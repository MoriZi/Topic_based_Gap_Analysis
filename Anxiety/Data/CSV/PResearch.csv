"""Comorbid anxiety disorders and baseline medication regimens predict clinical outcomes in individuals with co-occurring bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence: Results of a randomized controlled trial"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Comorbid anxiety disorders and baseline medication regimens predict clinical outcomes in individuals with co-occurring bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence: Results of a randomized controlled trial"" by James J. Prisciandaro, Delisa G. Brown, Kathleen T. Brady and Bryan K. Tolliver ( Psychiatry Research , 2011[Aug][15], Vol 188[3], 361-365). The authors regret that although the text (i.e., Section 3.2, “Associations between co-occurring diagnoses and outcomes”) correctly noted that antisocial personality disorder (aspd) was not uniquely significantly associated with any outcomes, Table 3 (“Results from path models with co-occurring diagnoses predicting outcomes”) incorrectly displays stars (**) below “OCDS” and “MADRS,” indicating statistically significant associations between aspd and these outcomes. Please note that the betas listed in the table are all correct, it is simply the stars for the associations of aspd with “OCDS” and “MADRS” that are misplaced. The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2011-16783-011). Despite the high prevalence and detrimental impact of alcoholism on bipolar patients, the diagnostic and treatment factors associated with better or worse clinical outcomes in alcohol-dependent patients with bipolar disorder are not well understood. The present study investigated the prospective impact of baseline psychiatric comorbidities and treatment regimens on clinical outcomes in bipolar alcoholics. Data were drawn from an 8-week randomized controlled clinical trial of acamprosate for individuals (n =30) with co-occurring bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence. Depressive and manic symptoms, and alcohol craving and consumption were monitored longitudinally using standardized instruments. Path analysis was used to estimate the prospective associations between patient characteristics and outcomes. More than 50% of patients were diagnosed with at least one anxiety (76.7%) or drug dependence disorder (60.0%). Comorbid anxiety disorders were prospectively associated with increased depressive symptoms and alcohol use. Participants were prescribed an average of 2.6 psychotropic medications at baseline. Antipsychotics and anticonvulsants were prospectively associated with increased alcohol use; anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines were associated with increased alcohol craving. Antidepressants were associated with increased depressive symptoms. Conversely, lithium was associated with decreased alcohol craving and depressive symptoms. The findings from the present study suggest areas for future research in this population.

Impact of outbreak covid-19 pandemic on psychiatry emergencies in spain,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused an unprecedented clinical situation. A retrospective cross-sectional study was designed with the aim to evaluate psychiatric emergencies from March 14 to May 1, 2020, coinciding with the start of the emergency state and the lockdown until the attenuation of the confinement. Data obtained during this period were compared with the emergencies attended in the same period of 2019. A total of 213 psychiatric emergencies were attended in 2020 compared with 367 in 2019. The mean number of emergencies per day was significantly lower during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 (M=4.35, SD= 2.04) vs. the same period in 2019 (M=7.50, SD= 3.18). A higher percentage of patients with schizo/psychotic disorders (34.3% in 2020, vs. 24.3% in 2019), as well as a lower percentage of patients with anxiety/adaptive disorders (25.4% in 2020 vs. 35.4% in 2019) was observed during the outbreak. A significant lower mean discharge/emergency ratio (M=42.17, SD= 26.94 in 2020 vs. M=63.43, SD= 17.64 in 2019) and a higher referral to Internal Medicine/emergency ratio (M=20.55, SD= 22.16 in 2020 vs. M=3.32, SD= 6.63 in 2019) was observed. The results suggest important changes in psychiatric emergencies during the most critical period of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain.

Deterioration of mental health despite successful control of the covid-19 pandemic in south korea,"South Korea was able to successfully control the spread of COVID-19 without nationwide lockdowns or drastic social distancing efforts, but pandemic-related psychological outcome of the general population remains unknown. Between March and June 2020, 400 South Korean residents participated in an online study of depression, anxiety, stress, psychosis-risk and loneliness, as well as indices of social network, physical health and demographics. Clinical levels of depression, anxiety or stress were reported by 45% of the respondents, and psychosis-risk was present in 12.8%; a drastic increase above the base rate reported by previous studies conducted in South Korea prior to the pandemic. Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not the size of the social network accounted for poor mental health. Women were especially at increased risk for mental health problems. Thus, despite effective mitigation of the pandemic, there was a striking deterioration of mental health. As the psychological burden of the continuing pandemic accrues, the probability of an impending mental health crisis is increasing, especially in countries with greater infection and death rates than South Korea. Comprehensive efforts to address the psychological aftermath of the pandemic are urgently needed.

Mental health of pregnant women during the covid-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study,"Several studies have reported the susceptibility of pregnant women to emotional instability and stress. Thus, pregnancy may be a risk factor that could deepen the already negative effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyze longitudinally the psychopathological consequences of the pandemic in pregnant women, and to explore differences with non-pregnant women. The participants in this study were 102 pregnant women, and a control group of 102 non-pregnant women (most of them reported having university studies and little financial impact from the pandemic). They completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, in three different times (2, 14, and 47 days after the start of the lockdown). In a time range of 50 days of quarantine, all women showed a gradual increase in psychopathological indicators and a decrease in positive affect. Pregnant women showed a more pronounced increase in depression, anxiety and negative affect than the non-pregnant women did. In addition, pregnant women showed a more pronounced decrease in positive affect. It is important for institutions dedicated to perinatal health care to count on empirical information to optimize the provision of their services.

Adding stress to the stressed: Senior high school students’ mental health amidst the covid-19 nationwide lockdown in greece,"The two-year preparation for the National university entrance exams in Greece is one of the most trying periods in a young person's life, physically and emotionally. The present study reports the results from 442 last year senior high school students who completed an online survey (16-30 April 2020) concerning the lockdown impact on their mental health. Overall, the rate of positive screen for depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 11) significantly increased from 48.5% to 63.8% and of those scoring within severe depression range (PHQ-9 ≥20) from 10% to 27%; for anxiety (GAD-7 score ≥ 11) increased from 23.8% to 49.5% and of those scoring within severe anxiety range (GAD-7≥17) from 3.8% to 20.5%. After taking sex and baseline (one month prior to the lockdown) levels of depression and anxiety into account, the level of lockdown experienced distress was predictive of depression and anxiety levels in time of home confinement, accounting for about 30% of variance in symptoms severity scores. Although our results may be subject to sampling and recall bias, the unexpectedly high rates of anxiety and depression warrant an urgent call to action aiming at mitigating and managing mental health risks of senior high school students in future waves of pandemic.

Psychological impact of the covid-19 outbreak on students in a french region severely affected by the disease: Results of the pims-cov 19 study,"The COVID-19 has sent billions of students worldwide into lockdown. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety and identify the factors associated with anxiety among French students during lockdown.A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect sociodemographic data, living and learning conditions, anxiety symptoms and social support. Among 3936 students, 15.2%, experienced moderate anxiety and 9.8%, severe anxiety.Female gender (OR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.8-2.7) and having relatives or acquaintances from their housing hospitalized for COVID-19 (OR=3.3, 95% CI: 1.4-7.9) were the main risk factors for anxiety. Tensions at home (OR=1.8, 95% CI: 1.5-2.1), difficulties isolating (OR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6), noises inside (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-1.9) or outside the housing (OR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.3-1.8), no direct outdoor access (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.0), delay in final examination (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.1), reduced time for learning (OR=1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6), increased tobacco consumption (OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.4-2.6), ineffectiveness of using media entertainment (OR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.1-4.4) and reading (OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.7) to calm down, were identified as risk factors. Family (OR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.8-0.91) and friend (OR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.82-0.94) support were protective factors. This suggests the need to focus on students during epidemics, especially those living with someone hospitalized with COVID-19.

"Risk factors for depression, anxiety, and ptsd symptoms in perinatal women during the covid-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: Pregnant women and women who recently gave birth are vulnerable to COVID-19-related psychosocial stresses. METHODS: We assessed COVID-19-related health worries and grief, and current mental health symptoms (depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD) in 1,123 U.S. women during the COVID-19 pandemic (May 21 to August 17, 2020) through a cross-sectional study design. RESULTS: Among our respondents, 36.4% reported clinically significant levels of depression, 22.7% for generalized anxiety, and 10.3% for PTSD. Women with pre-existing mental health diagnoses based on their self-reported history were 1.6-to-3.7 more likely to score at clinically significant levels of depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD. Approximately 18% reported high levels of COVID-19-related health worries and were 2.6-to-4.2 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for mental health symptoms. Approximately 9% reported high levels of grief and were 4.8-to-5.5 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal women with pre-existing mental health diagnoses show elevated symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although causation cannot be inferred, COVID-19-related health worries and grief experiences may increase the likelihood of mental health symptoms among those without pre-existing mental health concerns. Providers should develop strategies for addressing health-related worry and grief within their practice.

The solitary confinement of incarcerated American youth during COVID-19,"In spring 2020, various states of emergency, stay-at-home orders, and school closures were enacted due to COVID-19. Since then, American juvenile correctional facilities (JCFs) have faced a complex situation that requires consideration of staff and youth safety and physical health, the need for social distancing, and the high prevalence of youth with mental disorders. Even for people in the community during COVID-19, social isolation can be a traumatic experience that can result in loneliness, depression, anxiety, and make it more difficult to deal with stress. The psychological effects of solitary confinement for incarcerated youth are even more dramatic and may include depression, anger, obsessive thoughts, paranoia and psychosis, and suicide. JCF staffing concerns provide another hurdle in the provision of emotional support to incarcerated and isolated youth during COVID-19. Similar to front-line medical staff and staff that work in other residential settings, JCF workers are at significant risk for experiencing burnout, fear and anxiety of contracting and spreading the virus.To understand JCF policies and practices during COVID-19 and chart a path forward, survey research is needed concerning approaches to, (a) ensuring youth and staff physical health, (b) providing youth with social and emotional support, (c) delivering educational services, and (d) providing COVID-19 related information to youth, staff, and families. Interview research would also provide in-depth insight into youth and staff views and experiences during the crisis.

The psychological impact of quarantine on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"This article is a systematic review of psychological impact of quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on these studies, a great amount of psychologic symptoms or problems developed during the quarantine period, including anxiety (228/649, 35.1%), depression (110/649, 16.9%), loneliness (37/649, 5.7%) and despair (6/649, 0.9%). The review examined the factors influencing the development of psychologic symptoms. Two studies showed that the mental health status of COVID-19 patients and people under medical observation differed across gender, age, marital status, education, occupational status, monthly income per capita, and place of residence. However, according to another study, no significant associations between age, gender, marital status, and education level with psychological problems in patients quarantined in hospital and at home. The main source of the problems seems to be the small isolation space and the surrounding environment, but the stress may also be related to concerns about delayed work or infecting family members. Professional psychological care and the access to reliable information are essential for minimizing the mental health problems during quarantine.

Fear and agony of the pandemic leading to stress and mental illness: An emerging crisis in the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak,"The outbreak of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), later named as a pandemic affecting nearly 210 countries and territories has led to negative emotions of fear and agony in the general population and healthcare staff professionals. The healthcare regulators and the governments have imposed emergencies and lockdowns in their countries which has led to an adverse effect on the mental health of people ultimately leading to a rise in anxiety, depression, and associated mental illness. The fear and uncertainty increased by the COVID-19 crisis are putting extreme pressure on our finite resources. This report aims to synthesis the dilemma of mental illness as a result of pandemic and initiates suggestions to help the general public, healthcare professionals, and workers mitigate the negative emotions to improve the mental wellbeing in this detached period of isolation.

Distinguishing burnout from depression: An exploratory qualitative study,"Whether depression and burnout are synonymous or not has been a longstanding debate. Many studies have examined for similarities and differences, but findings have overall been inconclusive, with most studies being quantitative in design. We therefore undertook a qualitative study in which participants who self-identified as having experienced both burnout and depression were asked how they distinguished between the two conditions. Thematic qualitative analysis was undertaken and while a fifth of the sample stated that their burnout and depression experiences were indistinguishable or were very similar, we also identified 11 key themes of difference. The most prevalent themes captured differences in the perceived cause of each condition, in experiencing hopelessness as against helplessness, and impacts on levels of functioning, sadness, anger, anxiety and emotional lability. We also identified differences in suicidal ideation between the two conditions. While some differences identified could be dimensional and suggest that burnout is simply synonymous with or a developmental phase of depression, the several categorical symptom differences nominated by participants suggest that most sufferers who have experienced both conditions perceive them as distinct. Such ‘lived experience’ reports are therefore intrinsically informative and should shape further quantitative analyses.

Association between anxiolytic/hypnotic drugs and suicidal thoughts or behaviors in a population-based cohort of students,"Aims: To investigate the association between the use of anxiolytic/hypnotic drugs and suicidal thoughts and/or behavior (STB) in students. Methods: 12,112 participants who completed the baseline questionnaire in the i-Share cohort between April 2013 and March 2017 were included. STB were defined at inclusion as suicidal thoughts over the previous year and/or a lifetime suicide attempt. The use of prescribed anxiolytic/hypnotic drugs over the previous 3 months was measured at baseline and follow-up time points (in 2,919 students). Psychiatric disorders were assessed through validated scales. Multivariate logistic regression models were run using disease risk score. Results: At inclusion, 25.2% of students had STB and 10.3% used anxiolytics/hypnotics. STB at baseline were associated with a more frequent use of anxiolytics/hypnotics in the previous 3 months, after adjustment for covariates including anxiety, depression, sleep, impulsivity, and substance use. The use of anxiolytics/hypnotics at baseline was not associated with the occurrence, persistence or remission of STB one year later. STB at baseline were associated with a new anxiolytic/hypnotic treatment one year later. Conclusions: Anxiolytic/hypnotic drug use was associated with STB in students independently of many risk factors of suicide and most psychiatric disorders that require such treatment, which raises drug safety concerns.

Differential-diagnostic confusion and non-specificity of affective symptoms and anxiety: An empirical study of first-admission patients,"In everyday clinical work, psychiatrists encounter patients who present with symptoms spanning several diagnostic categories, e.g., showing signs of a psychosis, depression, and anxiety. This raises the critical question of which symptoms hold precedence over other and, by extension, which diagnosis is the right diagnosis. ICD-10 and DSM-5 do not provide unambiguous answers to this question and therefore psychiatry remains exposed to diagnostic disagreement with consequences for treatment and research. We explored symptom distribution in a sample of 98 first-admission psychiatric patients. We extracted and categorized singular symptoms into symptom domains: anxiety, mania, delusions, hallucinations, first-rank symptoms, and negative symptoms. Most symptoms were seen in most disorders. We found symptoms of depression and anxiety in almost all patients. Thus, just counting symptoms do not seem to be a valid way to make diagnoses. We elaborately discuss these issues in the context of the differential-diagnosis between schizophrenia and depression. Finally, we suggest that a combination of a criteria- and Gestalt-based approach to diagnosing mental disorders may contribute to counteract some of the current differential-diagnostic confusion.

A prospective study of intensive in-patient treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Multimodal in-patient treatment incorporating intensive cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) and medication management is a promising alternative for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients who do not respond to standard out-patient treatment. We prospectively examined the short-term outcome and predictors of outcome of intensive in-patient treatment in a largely pharmacotherapy-resistant OCD sample. Fifty eight consecutive patients, admitted for treatment of OCD were evaluated at admission, at discharge and 2 months post-discharge for psychiatric diagnosis, personality disorders, obsessive beliefs, insight into obsessions and severity of obsessive-compulsive, depressive and anxiety symptoms. All patients received comprehensive treatment consisting of a combination of pharmacotherapy and intensive CBT. The mean Y-BOCS score was 29.38( ± 5.72) at admission, which reduced to 16.62( ± 7.91) at discharge and 16.75(± 8.85) at follow-up. Thirty five participants (60.3%) met the prespecified criteria for response and 19 (32.8%) for remission. There was a significant reduction in Y-BOCS scores at discharge [43.67 (23.81)%] and post-discharge follow-up [2.18 (29.32)%] as compared to baseline (p &lt; 0.01). Baseline Browns Assessment of Beleifs Scale score (insight) was the only variable that statistically differentiated responders and non-responders. In-patient treatment is an effective treatment for medication resistant, severe and chronic OCD. Poor insight is a potential predictor of non-response to in-patient treatment.

High depression and anxiety in people with Alzheimer's disease living in retirement homes during the covid-19 crisis,"To cope with Covid-19 and limits its spread among residents, retirement homes have prohibited physical contact between residents and families and friend and, in some cases, even between residents or between residents and caregivers. We investigated the effects of measures against Covid-19 on the mental health of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who live in retirement homes in France. We instructed on-site caregivers to assess depression and anxiety in participants with mild AD who live in retirement homes. Fifty-eight participants consented to participate in the study. The participants rated their depression and anxiety during and before the Covid-19 crisis. Participants reported higher depression ( p = .005) and anxiety ( p = .004) during than before the Covid-19 crisis. These increases can be attributed to the isolation of the residents and/or to the drastic changes in their daily life and care they receive. While, in their effort to prevent infections, retirement homes are forced to physically separate residents from the outside world and to drastically reduce residents’ activities, these decisions are likely to come at a cost to residents with AD and their mental health.

"Cortisol, DHEA and DHEA-S during exposure therapy in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder—Secretion patterns and prediction of treatment response","The cortisol response in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) during exposure with response prevention (ERP), a stressful but very effective psychotherapeutic treatment, has shown contradictory findings in three prior studies with low sample sizes. In a larger cohort of 51 patients with OCD we repeatedly measured subjective units of distress (SUD) and the adrenocortical stress hormones cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) in saliva during the very first session of ERP and on the day before. Expectedly, SUD were increased on the ERP day before the session and further rose during ERP, but salivary cortisol and DHEA were statistically indistinguishable from the comparison condition. Interestingly, DHEA-S was significantly elevated throughout the ERP versus the comparison day, but did not further increase in acute response to ERP. According to an explorative analysis in a subsample, hormone levels on the comparison or the ERP day did not predict anti-OCD treatment response one month later. These results corroborate our prior findings of cortisol non-response despite considerable subjective stress in ERP. The role of DHEA-S in anticipatory anxiety and the effects of augmentative cortisol therapy in ERP need further study.

"Ptsd and obesity in U.S. military veterans: Prevalence, health burden, and suicidality","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obesity are prevalent among U.S. military veterans, though less is known about the mental and physical health burden and suicidality of co-occurring PTSD and obesity in this population. A nationally representative sample of the U.S. veterans was used to assess PTSD and obesity prevalence, co-occurrence and relationships with mental and physical health measures. A total of 16.4% of veterans screened positive for current PTSD, 32.7% for obesity, and 5.8% for co-occurring PTSD and obesity. Relative to obesity-only veterans, veterans with co-occurring PTSD and obesity had elevated likelihoods of mental and physical health concerns (most notably major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders), suicidality, and migraine headaches, and higher body mass indices. Relative to veterans with PTSD alone, individuals with comorbid PTSD and obesity had elevated likelihoods of suicidal ideation, nicotine dependence, mental health treatment, migraine headaches, diabetes, hypertension, and insomnia. A significant minority of U.S. veterans has co-occurring PTSD and obesity, which is associated with substantial mental and physical health burden, including elevated suicidality. Results underscore the importance of integrative assessment, monitoring, and treatment approaches for PTSD and obesity in this population.

We tested the new measure with 712 healthcare workers in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru and found the new measure formed three factors to predict healthcare workers’ anxiety and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. We call for further studies to test COVID-OS in other countries and settings.

Psychometric assessment of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in an obstetric population,"The prevalence and negative effects of perinatal depression are well known. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a common screening tool for perinatal depression and it is recommended for use by several professional organizations. The current study tested competing EPDS factor structures and assessed EPDS change from intake to 6-week follow-up, and identified demographic correlates in an outpatient obstetric sample. Using a retrospective observational study design, medical records were coded for demographic, mental health, and EPDS patient data (n = 524). Confirmatory factor analysis, t-tests, and ANOVA were utilized. Findings included: (1) a 3-factor model (i.e. anxiety, depression, anhedonia) of the EPDS displayed the best fit to the current data; (2) small declines in all 3 subscales of the EPDS from intake to 6-week follow-up appointments and; (3) demographic correlates of EPDS subscales included history of depression, history of anxiety, race, and pregnancy status (i.e. first child or not). The 3-factor structure can be used in clinical practice to assess perinatal depression in a nuanced fashion. Given that history of depression and anxiety are risk factors for perinatal depression, a thorough assessment of these items in clinical practice is needed.

"Validation of the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder","The purpose of the study was to examine the internal consistency and validity of the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and without intellectual disability (IQ &gt;= 70). Participants (NN = 123) were consecutively recruited from the Brain and Mind Centre in New South Wales, Australia. Internal consistency was determined using Cronbach's alpha. Item-total correlations were evaluated by Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient. The convergent validity of the DASS-21 was examined by measuring its associations with quality of life and other measures of depression and anxiety. Factorial validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. The DASS-21 demonstrated good internal consistency, adequate convergent validity, and all items exhibited satisfactory item-total correlations. Considering fit indices and factor loadings, the confirmatory factor analysis results provided support for the original 3-factor oblique model consisting of depression, anxiety, and stress factors. The model fit could be further improved with some modifications. Overall, the results indicate that the DASS-21 is a viable self-report screening measure for depression, anxiety, and stress in individuals with ASD and without intellectual disability.

Adolescent psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown,"The aim of this paper was to review the literature on adolescent psychiatric disorders related to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Stressful life events, extended home confinement, brutal grief, intrafamilial violence, overuse of the Internet and social media are factors that could influence the mental health of adolescents during this period. The COVID-19 pandemic could result in increased psychiatric disorders such as Post-Traumatic Stress, Depressive, and Anxiety Disorders, as well as grief-related symptoms. Adolescents with psychiatric disorders are at risk of a break or change in their care and management; they may experience increased symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown may have a negative impact on the mental health of adolescents, although there is still no data on the long term impact of this crisis. Adolescents’ individual, familial, and social vulnerability, as well as individual and familial coping abilities, are factors related to adolescent mental health in times of crisis. Adolescents are often vulnerable and require careful consideration by caregivers and healthcare system adaptations to allow for mental health support despite the lockdown. Research on adolescent psychiatric disorders in times of pandemics is necessary, as such a global situation could be prolonged or repeated.

Psychological distress in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic: Preliminary development of an assessment scale,"COVID-19 is now spreading worldwide, and poses some public mental health problems which requires close attention. This study aims to develop a scale of COVID-19 related psychological distress in healthy public (CORPD) to assess the severity of psychological distress in uninfected healthy populations. We compiled a 14-item scale which contains two dimensions— Anxiety &amp; fear and Suspicion —using the classical measurement theory. 652 Chinese citizens consented and completed a survey through an online questionnaire APP. The reliability test showed that the scale had good internal consistency reliability and Split-Half reliability, and the validity test showed that it had good structure validity, content validity and criterion correlation validity. This scale can be used to assess the psychological distress of people in China and in other COVID-19-hit regions and countries. It also provides a reference for future studies on COVID-19 or other respiratory infectious diseases related public mental health.

The psychological and mental impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on medical staff and general public—A systematic review and meta-analysis,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused enormous psychological impact worldwide. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 Nov 2019 to 25 May 2020. We conducted literature research using Embase, PubMed, Google scholar and WHO COVID-19 databases. Among the initial search of 9207 studies, 62 studies with 162,639 participants from 17 countries were included in the review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% confidence interval: 28%-38%) and 28% (23%-32%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%-62%]), and it was similar between healthcare workers and the general public. Studies from China, Italy, Turkey, Spain and Iran reported higher-than-pooled prevalence among healthcare workers and the general public. Common risk factors included being women, being nurses, having lower socioeconomic status, having high risks of contracting COVID-19, and social isolation. Protective factors included having sufficient medical resources, up-to-date and accurate information, and taking precautionary measures. In conclusion, psychological interventions targeting high-risk populations with heavy psychological distress are in urgent need.

"Impact of the group intervention ""Accept Voices©"" for the management of auditory hallucinations","Aim of the study: The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential impact of a third wave CBT group intervention for the management of auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia. Method: 38 patients with schizophrenia presenting with auditory hallucinations, followed in mental health services, participated in six sessions of a group based on acceptance and engagement therapy (ACT). The study followed a repeated single case experimental design (type A-B-A) based on the principle of a control phase followed by an intervention phase and a follow-up phase of similar duration. The various measurements were administered during the control phase, at pre-/post-group and six weeks after the last group session. Results: The results show a significant decrease in auditory hallucinations, as measured by the PSYRATS scale, during the treatment and follow-up phase, compared to the control phase. In addition, the participants saw significant reductions in depressive and anxious symptomatology (assessed with CDSS and SEAS), and increases in coping and acceptance in regards to voices (assessed using a study scale and VAAS). The level of Malevolence beliefs about voices (measured with BAVQ-R) also decreased significantly. Conclusions: A brief group intervention based acceptance show promise in the reduction of the intensity of auditory hallucinations, depression and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia, while improving their acceptance.

The psychometric properties of 30-day versions of the DSM-5 dimensional severity scales for social anxiety disorder and panic disorder,"Objectives: The current study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the DSM-5 dimensional severity scales for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PD) using a past 30 day timeframe. Methods: Data were from a sample of 1,052 Australian community dwelling adults (aged 18 years or older) recruited using online advertisements. Respondents completed the DSM-5 severity scales for SAD and PD as well as a range of additional widely used self-administered scales for SAD and PD in the past 30 days prior to the survey. Results: Both scales exhibited high internal consistency (alpha&gt; = 0.94) and a strong general factor that justified unidimensional item response analysis (OmegaH = 0.96). There was no evidence of significant local dependence amongst item pairs after accounting for the single factor. Similarly, there was no evidence for meaningful differential item functioning of the scales across sex, age, education level, and residential location. There was high convergent validity (0.71-0.85) amongst conceptually related scale and moderate to high correlations (0.54-0.80) between conceptually unrelated scales. Conclusions: These findings provide support for the use of past month versions of the DSM-5 severity scales for SAD and PD by researchers and clinicians to inform and supplement diagnostic decisions.

Assessing high risk of suicide amongst physicians and nurses in treatment,"Little is known about the suicidal behaviour of health professionals admitted to specialised programmes. This study aims to describe the factors associated with high risk of suicide (HRS) of physicians and nurses in treatment at the Galatea Care Programme. We conducted a retrospective naturalistic study with data from 1,214 electronic medical records of physicians and nurses working in Catalonia and in treatment at the Galatea Clinic during 2017 and 2018. HRS was registered in the medical record according to the screening criteria of the Catalonia Risk Suicide Code; 62.4% ( n = 757) were physicians and 37.6% ( n = 457) were nurses. HRS was identified in 5% physicians and 5.2% nurses. Patients who were in a relationship or were not on a sick leave were less likely to have HRS, whereas those with affective disorders were more likely to have HRS compared with those with anxiety disorders or substance use disorders. Patients with HRS were more likely to have concurrent mental disorders. Specialised treatment programmes for health professionals should regularly screen for suicide risk, especially amongst those having affective disorders, comorbid mental disorders or when their working and interpersonal life areas are impaired.

Abnormal night sleep duration and inappropriate sleep initiation time are associated with elevated anxiety symptoms in Chinese rural adults: The Henan Rural Cohort,"Sleep problems have been demonstrated to cause mental symptoms, such as anxiety. However, research on the association of the night sleep duration and sleep initiation time on anxiety symptoms in rural China is still lacking. The current study, therefore, explored the independent and combined association of the night sleep duration and sleep initiation time on anxiety symptoms. This study included 28, 054 participants from the Henan Rural Cohort. Sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Anxiety was assessed by the two-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2). Multivariable logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline with anxiety symptoms as a dependent variable were fitted. Among the participants in this study, 11, 209 (39.96%) were males, and 16,845 (60.04%) were females, 1574 (5.61%) had anxiety symptoms. Both shorter and longer night sleep duration were significantly related to elevated prevalence of anxiety symptoms. Extreme sleep initiation time was also significantly associated with elevated anxiety symptoms. Additionally, night sleep duration and sleep initiation time had a combined effect on the prevalent anxiety symptoms. In conclusion, there was a dose-response association of night sleep duration and sleep initiation time with anxiety among Chinese rural population. Moreover, they might jointly increase the odds of prevalent anxiety.

Development of the short version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory,"The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) has been widely used to measure the state and trait components of anxiety. We sought to develop a short, yet reliable and valid form of these scales for use in circumstances where the full‐form is not feasible. We abbreviated the scales using item response theory analyses to retain the items that could discriminate the best among participants. One sample ( N = 922) completed the state scale, a second sample ( N = 2227) completed the trait scale, while a third sample (N = 250) completed the short forms. Our participants completed the Hungarian version of STAI alongside other measures to observe external validity. We calculated cut-off scores for the state (&gt;9.5,) and trait (&gt;13.5) scales. A total of 19.5% and 20.1% of the respondents reached the cut-off scores. The five-item short forms of STAI had sound psychometric properties that are comparable to those obtained on the full-form. The external validity of the scales is also demonstrated. We report detailed descriptive statistics that could be used in further studies as standards. The short scales are reliable measures that could be used in clinical screening and behavioural research; especially where practical considerations preclude the use of a longer questionnaire.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for major depression: A naturalistic observational study in an Australian private hospital,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective and evidence-based treatment for major depression, which is now as a mainstream treatment in clinical practice. However, there is limited data concerning its use in Australian private psychiatric hospital settings. This retrospective study examined routinely collected data of 153 inpatients, who received 20 rTMS treatments over four weeks. Primary outcomes measures were the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). At post-treatment, response and remission rates were 54% and 28%, respectively, for the HAMD-17; and 53% response and 16% remission rates, for the DASS-21 Depression subscale, respectively. Although no gender differences were observed, younger patients demonstrated more improvements during acute rTMS but the effect was not significant after accounting for pre-treatment symptom severity. The findings of this naturalistic study suggest that an acute course of rTMS provided in private clinical settings resulted in similar response and remission rates to longer rTMS courses. Shorter rTMS courses appear to have satisfactory efficacy in treating major depression, in clinically diverse and real-world practice.

Eating disorders in the age of COVID-19,"Comments on an article by P.M.M. Carvalho et al. (see record 2020-22694-001). Carvalho et al. discussed the broad psychological effects of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) including loneliness, worsening anxiety, distress and insomnia. Psychosocial stressors stemming from COVID-19 pandemic and resultant stay-at-home orders, may exacerbate ED-related triggers and present a challenging environment for individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder. Appropriately managing EDs is crucial to mitigate the potential long-term impacts on individuals with these disorders. For example, individuals with EDs have greater suicidal risk under normal conditions, and additional COVID-19 pandemic-related stressors could further increase that risk. Thus, in order to minimize the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on EDs, we encourage HCPs to continue to provide mental health resources to ED patients up to 6 months postisolation, including virtual group therapy sessions and live meal support through the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA). Further, it is recommended that HCPs encourage ED patients to plan meals and purchase 'safe' food items with a long shelf-life in bulk, when available in store.

University students’ mental health amidst the COVID-19 quarantine in Greece,"The COVID-19 hit also Greece but due to early measures and their exceptional success, the death toll is one of the lowest in the world. Here we report the results from the analysis of the responses to an online survey, from the first 1000 university students, concerning the impact of the lockdown on their mental health. Overall, there was a ‘horizontal’ increase in scores; 42.5% for anxiety, 74.3% for depression, and 63.3% increase in total suicidal thoughts. Quantity of sleep increased in 66.3% but quality worsened in 43.0%. Quality of life worsened in 57.0% (same in 27.9%). There was a 25-3 fold increase in possible clinical cases of depression and an almost 8-fold increase in suicidal thoughts. Almost a third accept and one fifth are open to conspiracy theories concerning COVID-19. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting data concerning the impact of lockdown and quarantine on the mental health of university students. While the acute impact seems clear, the long-term consequences are unknown and although suicidal thoughts have risen substantially, it seems unlikely this will result in deaths. However, the results constitute a clear message that vulnerable populations are at a need for specific interventions concerning their mental health issues.

Associations between subclinical inflammatory markers and OCD: A retrospective study,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by unwanted, intrusive and disturbing thoughts or images that cause anxiety and repetitive behaviours or mental acts to relieve these thoughts or images. Considering controversial aetiology of OCD and growing evidence for the role of inflammation in OCD, the aim of this study was to examine the association between OCD and subclinical inflammatory markers, namely neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio(NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR) in adult patients and to investigate the association between antidepressant medications and NLR, PLR. Electronic medical records(EMR) of 24,635 patients aged 18-64 were reviewed and after exclusion of comorbid psychiatric and medical diagnosis 135 EMR of OCD patients were included into final analyses and compared with the healthy control group (n = 133). Blood cell counts were noted to calculate NLR and PLR. Medications of patients were gathered from all patients to calculate fluoxetine-equivalent-dose(FED) to examine the effects of antidepressants on NLR and PLR. NLR and PLR were significantly higher in OCD. Contrary to the correlation of FED with NLR, PLR was found to not correlate with FED. Hence, PLR would be considered as a robust biomarker to medication effect contrary to NLR. OCD was significantly predicted by both NLR and PLR in logistic regression analyzes.

"Relationships between stroke, depression, generalized anxiety disorder and physical disability: Some evidence from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health","The objective of this study is to evaluate associations between stroke, depression, anxiety and physical disability. The sample of 19,159 participants aged ≥30 was obtained from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey–Mental Health. Depression or anxiety was defined as major depressive disorder (MDD) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) within the past 12 months. The history of anxiety was defined as GAD at any time point during the respondent's lifetime. Physical disability was assessed by the past 14-day disability in daily-living activities. For statistical analysis, two logistic regression models (crude and adjusted models) were presented. The results showed that subjects with stroke had greater likelihoods of MDD-GAD comorbidity and GAD only compared those without stroke. People with GAD only had higher likelihood of physical disability than those with neither of the two conditions. Among participants with stroke, lifetime GAD was associated with a greater likelihood of MDD. In conclusion, individuals with stroke may be vulnerable to comorbid depression-anxiety as well as anxiety only. Additionally, subjects with anxiety were more likely to have physical disability. The history of anxiety increased the risk for developing post-stroke depression.

Clinically significant fear and anxiety of COVID-19: A psychometric examination of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale,"The present study examined the psychometric properties of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) using an online survey of 398 adult Amazon MTurk workers in the U.S. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the CAS measures a reliable (α = 0.92), unidimensional construct with a structure that was shown to be invariant across gender, race, and age. Construct validity was demonstrated with correlations between CAS scores and demographics, coronavirus diagnosis, history of anxiety, coronavirus fear, functional impairment, alcohol/drug coping, religious coping, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as social attitudes (e.g., satisfaction with President Trump). The CAS also demonstrated solid discrimination ability for functional impairment (AUC = 0.88), while the original cut score of ≥ 9 (76% sensitivity and 90% specificity) showed the strongest diagnostic effectiveness among scores. Overall, these findings are largely consistent with the results of the first CAS investigation and support the validity of this mental health screener for COVID-19 related research and practice.

A traumatic life experience in childhood increases the risk of a psychiatric disorder in the offspring,"A traumatic life experience in childhood is a fundamental risk factor of numerous psychiatric disorders. Recently, studies try to evaluate the mental health consequences on victims’ offspring, but few psychiatric disorders were examined, and whether these results apply to the general population remains unknown. In this study, we use the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a large representative sample of American population, in order to estimate the impact on the offspring of a traumatic experience in parents. Besides, we use a well-known risk factor for offspring's psychiatric disorder: a familial history of a psychiatric disorder, in order to compare and assess the importance of parental traumatism as a risk factor for the offspring. Our results show that the five psychiatric disorders studied, alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, mood disorder, antisocial personality disorder and anxiety disorder, are more prevalent in the offspring, when at least one parent report a traumatic life event in his own childhood. Moreover, the magnitude of this risk factor is close to the magnitude of having a parental history of psychiatric disorder.

The comparison of the four cohorts revealed a significant increase of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, as well as of the use of social platforms from 2016 to 2019. In contrast, positive mental health (PMH) significantly decreased over the years. No significant changes of the gaming behavior were found. A slight significant positive relationship occurred between the negative variables of well-being and online media use. The association between PMH and online media use was significantly negative. Thus, cohort trends found in the U.S. can at least rudimentarily be replicated in Germany. Young adults in 2019 seem to have lower levels of well-being and to engage in more use of social platforms than older cohorts.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for bipolar disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an increasingly popular treatment for major depression and anxiety disorder, but has shown inconsistent efficacy for bipolar disorder (BD). Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the general efficacy of MBCT for BD. Methods: Ten studies were identified that fulfilled the current inclusion criteria, including three controlled and seven uncontrolled studies. The effects of MBCT on depression, anxiety, mania, stress, mindfulness ability, and emotional regulation were assessed by comparing psychometric scale scores within groups (pre- vs. post-intervention) across trials as well as between groups (control vs. MBCT) across controlled trials. Results: Within-group comparison revealed a reduction in symptoms of depression ( g = 0.37, 95%CI = 0.09−0.64, P = 0.009) and anxiety ( g = 0.45, 95%CI = 0.16−0.75, P = 0.002) following treatment compared to baseline. Stress symptoms were also significantly reduced ( g = 0.39, 95%CI = 0.09−0.69, P = 0.01), mindfulness ability (g = 0.63, 95%CI = 0.39−0.87, P &lt; 0.00001) and emotion regulation ( g = 0.62, 95%CI = 0.14−1.10, P = 0.01) were significantly improved compared to baseline. However, symptoms of mania were not alleviated ( g = −0.26, 95%CI = −1.43−0.91, P = 0.66). Subgroup analysis indicated that symptoms of depression and anxiety were still significantly improved at 3 months post-intervention ( g = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.13−0.80, P = 0.006 and g = 0.57, 95%CI = 0.21−0.94, P = 0.002, respectively) but not at 12 months ( g = 0.04, 95%CI = −0.29−0.37, P = 0.82 and g = 0.17, 95%CI = −0.16−0.50, P = 0.31). In between-groups analysis of controlled studies, MBCT significantly reduced depressive symptoms ( g = 0.3, 95%CI = -0.05−0.65, P = 0.09) but not anxiety symptoms ( g = 0.51, 95%CI = −0.20−1.22, P = 0.16). Conclusion: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy appears effective for alleviation of depression and anxiety among BD patients, possibly by improving emotional regulation and mindfulness abilities. However, efficacy appears time-limited and inconsistent, necessitating additional larger-scale studies and the development of post-intervention programs for sustained efficacy.

Preliminary evaluation of the utility of parental ratings in a Child Network,"Introduction: : Children in the US have a high incidence of psychiatric disorders, but the symptoms of these illnesses are often poorly recognized and treated. We thus created a Child Network for parents of children aged 2-12 to rate their child on a weekly basis on a secure website so that longitudinal ratings could be easily visualized. Methods: : After giving informed consent, parents filled out: a one-time questionnaire and a 97 item Child Checklist; and then rated the severity of depression, anxiety, ADHD, oppositional behavior, and mania each week. The new Checklist ratings were correlated with the 23 previous validated in adults (the M-3), and symptom burden was compared with diagnoses received in the community. Results: : The 23 item M-3 ratings were highly correlated with the more extensive Child Checklist. Symptom severity also corresponded to diagnoses received in the community. An example of the longitudinal weekly ratings of a child with a dysphoric mania is also presented. Conclusions: : The convergence of scores on the adult and child portions of the Child Checklist and the ease of visualization of symptoms and response to treatment suggest the utility of the ratings in the Child Network.

Death anxiety and attitude to death in patients with schizophrenia and depression,"Attitude to death and death anxiety in patients with severe psychiatric disorders have been studied rarely so far, although this is an existential perspective for each human being and clinically seems to be changed in patients with depression and schizophrenia. Patients with depression (mean age 46.30 ± 13.39; 12 women, 8 men) and schizophrenia (mean age 38.95 ± 1285; 9 women, 11 men), as well as healthy controls, were included in the study. Death anxiety and attitude to death were assessed using the newly developed and currently validated BOFRETTA scale. Attitude to death was significantly worse in the group of patients with schizophrenia, especially in those with prominent negative symptoms. Concerning death anxiety, patients with schizophrenia and also those with depression exhibited higher mean values compared with healthy controls in the same age range. These results suggest that there are specific similarities and differences concerning attitude to death and death anxiety in patients with psychotic and affective disorders. It can be concluded that existential aspects such as death and meaningful life should also be considered within the treatment of patients with severe mental disorders.

"Depression, anxiety, stress levels of physicians and associated factors in Covid-19 pandemics","Aim: To investigate anxiety, stress, and depression levels of physicians during the Covid-19 outbreak and explored associated factors in both clinical and general site. Methods: An online survey is conducted to asses psychological responses of healthcare workers and related factors during Covid-19 outbreak. It is consisted of three subsections covering the following areas: 1) sociodemographic data 2) information on individuals` working condition 3) Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DAS-21). Results: Of all 442 participants, 286 (64.7%) had symptoms of depression, 224 (51.6%) anxiety, and 182 (41.2%) stress. Being female, young, and single, having less work experience, working in frontline were associated with higher scores, whereas having a child was associated with lower scores in each subscale. Factors found to be associated with higher DAS-21 total scores in frontline workers were as follows: increased weekly working hours, increased number of Covid-19 patients cared for, lower level of support from peers and supervisors, lower logistic support, and lower feelings of competence during Covid-19 related tasks. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the factors which need to be taken into consideration to protect the mental wellbeing of doctors while fighting with a disaster that has major impacts on society worldwide.

The psychiatric impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak,"Patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV (new coronavirus disease) may experience fear of the consequences of being infected with a potentially fatal new virus, and those in quarantine might experience boredom, loneliness, and anger. Furthermore, infection symptoms, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, could lead to anxiety worsening and mental distress. The psychosocial response to an infectious event of this magnitude is complex. Maunder et al. concluded that patients and staff's emotional and behavioral reactions have been understood as a normal and adaptive response to stress during an overwhelming event. Studies have also highlighted that the least amount of damage should be ensured when using psychotropic medicine, which will mainly decrease the harmful effects of any interaction with 2019-nCoV and its treatments.

All animal studies and studies with women already on medication were excluded. A total of 74 articles were reviewed and summarized into postpartum stress associations with infant growth, development, nutrition, sleep and maternal fetal attachment. Postpartum stress is negatively associated with poor developmental trajectories and linear growth deficits, causing stunting in growth; poor language and cognitive development; poor gross and fine motor movement, and infant sleep. An inverse relationship exists with breast feeding and postpartum depression. More importantly, breastfeeding efficacy is important for sustaining positive infant feeding outcome. Increased maternal age during postpartum depression has been linked, as a contributing factor, to decreased maternal fetal attachment/bonding. A ripple effect exists from the association between postpartum stress and poor infant sleep. There is strong evidence that correlates PPS to infant outcome, mediated through many external factors. More research needs to be conducted to delineate and potentially mitigate the impact of modifiable factors. Not all articles in the literature were reviewed.

The experimental effects of psilocybin on symptoms of anxiety and depression: A meta-analysis,"The current meta-analysis examined the effects of psilocybin in combination with behavioral interventions on anxiety and depression in samples with elevated symptoms. Across four studies (one uncontrolled; three randomized, placebo-controlled; N = 117), within-group pre-post and pre-follow-up effects on anxiety and depression were large (Hedges’ gs = 1.16 to 1.47) and statistically significant. Across three placebo-controlled studies, pre-post placebo-controlled effects were also large ( gs = 0.82 to 0.83) and statistically significant. No serious adverse events were reported. Limitations include the small number of studies and risk for bias within studies. Results tentatively support future research on psilocybin for the treatment of anxiety and depression.

The moderating effect of FKBP5 and 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on the day-level association between drinking to cope motivation and negative affect,"Daily levels of drinking to cope (DTC) have been found to be related to negative outcomes such as increased negative affect, and these effects vary across person. We examined whether daily-level effects of DTC motivation were related to two genetic polymorphisms (rs1360780 in the FKBP5 gene and 5-HTTLPR in SLC6A4 ) thought to be associated with maladaptive drinking and stress-reactivity. We also examined whether these associations changed during the transition from college to post-college life. Participants ( N = 839, 55% women) completed an Internet-based 30-day daily diary during college and again five years later in which they reported their previous night's drinking and drinking motivation, and their current day's negative affect. Saliva was collected at wave 1 to provide DNA for genotyping. The within-person association between nighttime DTC motivation and next-day anxiety and depression was stronger (more positive) for FKBP5 rs1360780 T-allele carriers, compared C/C-allele individuals. We also found that 5-HTTLPR L’/S’ subjects (but not S’/S’ homozygotes), compared to L’/L’ homozygotes, showed stronger positive associations between DTC and anxiety. Results for FKBP5 T-allele carriers are discussed in terms of past findings indicating that such individuals tend to demonstrate increased attention toward stressors, thus possibly intensifying the deleterious effects of DTC-motivated drinking.

A comparison of the dimensionality of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and the DSM-5 Anxious-Distress Specifier Interview,"The Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) is one of the most widely used measures for assessing anxiety in research settings. However, it has been criticized for its inclusion of items that assess depressive symptoms. The DSM-5 Anxious Distress Specifier Interview (DADSI), developed as one assessment tool for measuring anxiety among depressed patients, demonstrates similar validity when compared with the HAM-A. However, its underlying factor structure has never been explored. The goal of the current study, therefore, was to compare the underlying factor structures of the HAM-A and the DADSI among clinically depressed (n = 576) and non-depressed (n = 146) patient samples. While two- and three-factor structures of the HAM-A fit similarly well among patients with a current major depressive episode, the three-factor structure—with anxiety and depressive symptoms forming separate factors—fit best among patients without a current major depressive episode. The DADSI was best represented by a single-factor model in both groups. The DADSI showed stronger associations with anxiety and somatic symptoms than with depressive symptoms of the HAM-A. These findings add to the characterization of the DADSI, and further highlight an important consideration for the use of HAM-A as a measure of anxiety in outcome studies.

Trichotillomania: Case report of pharmacological treatment outcome with clomipramine,"Presents a case report of a patient diagnosed with anxiety associated with trichotillomania (TTM) and her response to clomipramine. A 50-year-old married woman with two children, undergraduate professor, Catholic, attended the Outpatient Psychiatry Department in Maringá, in the state of Paraná, Brazil. Trichotillomania became a daily routine in the patient's life during the past five years, especially in stressful situations and during the premenstrual phase, which made her feel ashamed. The patient used to tie back her hair to hide the lack of hair on the scalp. The patient was diagnosed with anxiety and received psychiatric care. In her clinical history, the patient had used sertraline, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, and olanzapine. However, the patient experienced inadequate symptom relief due to therapeutic failure of drugs.

Addressing the need for forensic psychological evaluations of asylum seekers: The potential role of the general practitioner,"Asylum seekers who have survived torture and other abuses may experience a wide range of psychological symptoms associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. During the asylum process, attorneys might refer their clients to clinicians who document these psychological sequelae of human rights violations. However, the need for forensic psychological evaluations exceeds the number of mental health clinicians available to provide these assessments. It has been suggested that primary care physicians, professionals who already play essential roles in the identification and treatment of mental health issues, may be able to conduct these evaluations. Yet, there is little empirical knowledge of what prior training and clinical experiences support mental health and non-mental health professionals who engage in this work, and what is needed to prepare general practitioners to provide forensic psychological evaluations to asylum seekers. This pilot study found non-mental health practitioners with experience in psychological forensic evaluations reached a level of confidence in conducting evaluations of asylum seekers comparable to general mental health practitioners. The study also identified clinicians’ perceptions of training that supports them in their forensic psychological evaluations, their professional development needs, and the potential for general practitioners to leverage their current skill sets in this work.

The many faces of heterogeneity in psychiatric diagnostics: A response to Allsopp et al,"Comments on an article by K. Allsopp et al. (see record 2019-51754-004). Allsopp et al. complements this increasingly vast critical literature surrounding the DSM-5. On the one hand, it broadens existing critiques by exposing various forms of heterogeneity both within and across diagnostic criteria for a number of commonly diagnosed mental disorders. In so doing, the authors reveal at least one major potential source of heterogeneity within what should be discrete and homogeneous psychiatric categories. In this regard, we would add that, variation in the criteria brought to bear on different clinical accounts should not be regarded as being worrisome as such, especially as the authors seem to admit that there might be a perfectly valid reason why, e.g., the perspective of observers is attributed more weight in the case of psychosis than in reports about anxiety. However, such variation becomes spurious if not sufficiently grounded in clinical experience and rigorous empirical research (as in criteria about the severity of experienced trauma in PTSD), or if not formulated and defended in a sufficiently explicit way.

Inflammatory and antioxidant pathway dysfunction in borderline personality disorder,"Introduction: This study investigates the alteration of the inflammatory/oxidative pathway in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and its relationship with clinical features of the disorder. Methods: 49 BPD patients and 33 healthy control subjects were studied. Plasma levels of TBARS, nitrites, and the antioxidant enzymes CAT, GPx and SOD were measured. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained to investigate levels of intracellular components of the inflammatory/oxidative pathway including the IκBα, NFκB, iNOS, COX2, Keap1, NQO1, and HO1. Western Blot and ELISA were used to measure protein expression. Patients were assessed for different clinical dimensions of BPD with scales for depression, anxiety, impulsivity and functioning. Results: A significant decrease of IκBα levels and a significant increase of inflammatory factors, including NFκB, COX2 and iNOS levels were found in patients. On the other hand, a significant decrease was observed for all antioxidant enzymes in patients with BPD, except for HO1. The inflammatory factor NFκB showed a significant positive correlation with impulsivity scores. Conclusions: Patients with BPD presented an increased activation of several components of the inflammatory pathways, as well as an inhibition of the antioxidant path. These alterations appear partially correlated with the impulsivity scores in these patients.

The &lt;i&gt;NR3C1&lt;/i&gt; gene expression is a potential surrogate biomarker for risk and diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder which occurs after a traumatic event. The NR3C1 gene codes for the Glucocorticoid Receptor, which participate in the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and is altered in PTSD patients. To evaluate whether the NR3C1 gene expression in peripheral blood could be useful as a diagnosis biomarker, a total of 32 PTSD patients and 59 healthy controls were analyzed with quantitative RT-PCR. Also, to assess if NR3C1 dysregulation is associated with hypocortisolism in PTSD patients, serum cortisol was quantified by ELISA in a subset of these samples. Significant NR3C1 over-expression was found in PTSD patients compared with controls, and this was higher in patients with acute PTSD. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of NR3C1 gene expression was 0.797. The sensibility and specificity of NRC1 gene expression to diagnose PTSD was 62.5% and 89.8%, respectively. We also found that an up-regulation of NR3C1 increased the risk for being diagnosed with PTSD (OR = 12.8, 95%, CI 4-41.4). Finally, the NR3C1 gene expression was inversely related with serum cortisol in PTSD patients. The present results suggest that NR3C1 gene expression could be a promising biomarker for PTSD diagnosis and estimate the risk for disease development.

Suicidality in relation to depressive symptoms and psychological distress in adults aged 30 to 101 years in a population-based study in Finland,"Background: Screening for suicidality has importance in terms of public health. We investigated which specific items of psychological distress best predicted suicidality in a population-based sample. Methods: A random sample of adults aged 30–101 years, being representative of the general population living in Finland, attended a health examination survey (Health 2011). We analyzed ( n = 4373) the total scores on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-13), as well as alcohol use, depressive and anxiety disorders as assessed with the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI) among the participants. We assigned the participants having suicidality on the basis of the self-harm item on the BDI-13, and analyzed which of the items of the GHQ-12 were significant predictors of suicidality. Results: After adjusting for background variables, five items of the GHQ-12 remained as significant predictors for suicidality: items 11, 9, 4, 6, and 5 in this descending order. Limitations: The definition of suicidality was based on only a single item of the BDI-13. Conclusions: Certain items of the GHQ-12 demonstrated strong associations with suicidality, and the GHQ-12 or a brief version of it might be used as a screening instrument for suicidality.

Online writing about positive life experiences reduces depression and perceived stress reactivity in socially inhibited individuals,"Therapeutic writing can enhance psychological and physical health. Recent studies have suggested that these kinds of interventions can be effective when delivered online. The present study investigated whether positive emotional writing online can influence psychological and physical health in individuals reporting high levels of negative affectivity, who are most likely to benefit from psychological intervention ( N = 72, M age = 28.5, SD age = 8.7), and further, to investigate the potential moderating role of social inhibition. Participants completed self-report measures of physical symptoms, perceived stress, perceived stress reactivity, depression and generalised anxiety, before completing either i) positive emotional writing, or ii) a non-emotive control writing task on an online portal, for 20 min per day over three consecutive days. State anxiety was measured immediately after each writing session, and self-report questionnaires were again administered four weeks post-writing. Socially inhibited individuals exhibited significant reductions in depression and perceived stress reactivity four weeks following positive emotional writing, relative to writing about a neutral topic. The present study supports the efficacy of online therapeutic writing in individuals who, due to their socially inhibited nature, are most likely to benefit from online interventions which avoid interaction with a therapist or other clients.

"Childhood maltreatment, anxiety disorders and outcome in borderline personality disorder","Introduction: Anxiety disorders are a frequent in borderline personality disorder (BPD) and are associated with more severe symptomatology and poorer functional outcomes. Their presence in BPD is also believed to be the consequence of early life adversities. The aim of our study was to examine the relationship between comorbid anxiety disorders, childhood maltreatment and severity of BPD. Methods: 388 BPD outpatients were assessed for lifetime anxiety disorders and history of childhood maltreatment. Severity of BPD was measured by the number of DSM-IV BPD criteria, history of suicide attempts, hospitalizations, psychotic symptoms, comorbid substance use disorder, other comorbid disorders, level of depression, hopelessness, impulsivity and trait anger. We used logistic regressions to test the association between childhood maltreatment and anxiety disorders and the effect of those factors on severity indicators Results: More than half of the participants suffered from two or more anxiety disorders. The most common comorbidity was social phobia. Childhood maltreatment was associated with an increased number of anxiety disorders. Both anxiety disorders and childhood maltreatment had, independently from one another, an effect on severity indicators. Anxiety disorders were significantly associated with the number of DSM-IV BPD criteria, suicide attempts and psychotic symptoms. Anxiety disorders had an impact on the level of depression and hopelessness, whereas childhood maltreatment impacted impulsivity and anger trait. Conclusion: Our results show the importance of comorbid anxiety disorders in BPD, as well as their impact on severity. Anxiety disorders and childhood maltreatment should be considered by healthcare professionals to ensure optimal care. Furthermore, interventions targeting those issues need to be developed.

Specific or transdiagnostic? The occurrence of emotions and their association with distress in the daily life of patients with borderline personality disorder compared to clinical and healthy controls,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by more frequent and more intense negative emotions and less frequent positive emotions in daily life than healthy controls (HC) experience, but there is limited empirical evidence regarding whether this is a transdiagnostic or disorder-specific finding and which specific emotions are especially distressing in BPD. We assessed participants’ current emotions and distress every 15 min over a 24-h period using e-diaries to investigate the frequency, intensity, and the associated distress of specific emotions. To test the disorder specificity, we used multilevel modeling to compare 43 female patients with BPD, 28 patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 20 patients with bulimia nervosa (BN), and 28 HC. Patients with BPD exhibited anger more frequently than any of the clinical or healthy control groups, demonstrating specificity. The quality of anger accounted for additional distress beyond the pure emotional intensity. In patients with BPD, joy was associated with reduced distress, which was not the case in HC or PTSD. However, the majority of the comparisons (anxiety, sadness, shame, disgust, jealousy, guilt, interest) revealed transdiagnostic patterns. The distress-enhancing or distress-reducing effects of anger and joy might represent an important part of affective dysregulation in BPD.

The effect of Clinical Practice Guidelines on prescribing practice in mental health: A systematic review,"Clinical Practice Guidelines are succinct evidence-based recommendations and in psychiatry, exist to advise on psychotropic prescribing to effectively treat mental health conditions whilst minimising medication adverse effects. Implementation of psychiatric guidelines have, in the past, demonstrated little and transient impact on clinical practice. How effective prescribing guidelines are in aligning practice with evidence currently is unknown and this systematic review aimed to investigate said efficacy. Literature searches were performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL up to September 2019 and articles were selected by two reviewers independently with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. The review identified 18 eligible articles pertaining to the following conditions: depressive disorders, psychotic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar affective disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, borderline personality disorder, and opiate addiction with depression guidelines being the most frequently evaluated. Seven studies revealed guidelines effected no change in psychotropic prescribing. The remaining studies illustrated that even when practice was changed, the effect was generally small, emphasising the need to change guideline development and implementation, taking into account obstacles or opportunities specific to psychotropic pharmacotherapy.

"Comparison of burnout, anxiety and depressive syndromes in hospital psychiatrists and other physicians: Results from the ESTEM study","Aims: To compare prevalence and risk factors for burnout, anxiety and depression among hospital psychiatrists and non-psychiatrists. Method: Regional online survey of psychiatric and non-psychiatric hospital physicians was performed including: a job-stress scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), a stressful work relationships list and a six items scale about work-related psychosocial risk factors (PRFs). The client-related burnout scale of the CBI has been changed to an interpersonal burnout scale. Cases were defined by a score of 8+ for the HADS-A/HADS-D and 50+ for the three CBI subscales. Results: 285 psychiatrists and 326 non-psychiatrists participated. The prevalence of depression, personal burnout and work-related burnout did not differ between physicians. Anxiety was lower in psychiatrists and interpersonal burnout was higher in senior psychiatrists. Multivariate analysis showed two main PRFs, common to both groups of physicians: “work intensity and time” was associated with four of the five syndromes and “emotional demands” with the three burnout syndromes. Interpersonal burnout was associated with stressful relationships with leaders, but not with patients. Conclusion: Reducing the workload, improving the management of emotions and increasing managerial skills are important approaches for prevention.

Social problem solving in adult patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) experience interpersonal difficulties potentially linked to impaired social cognition. We aimed to investigate social problem solving strategies in adults with ADHD. Nineteen patients with ADHD and 20 healthy controls were assessed with a scenario-based battery gauging the ability to understand other people's mental states, to recognize interpersonal conflicts and to generate and identify optimal (i.e. both socially sensitive and practically effective) solutions to these conflicts. Furthermore, measures of socioemotional and executive functioning were administered. Patients and controls performed on a similar level with respect to theory of mind, the generation of the “best” solution to problematic social situations and the selection of the optimal solution out of alternatives. However, in a fluency task, patients generated fewer optimal solutions, while the number of only socially sensitive, only practically effective or irrelevant solutions was comparable in both groups. The overall ability to freely generate problem solutions was not linked to executive functioning or trait empathy, but better generation abilities were related to lower social interaction anxiety in the patients only. This suggests impaired generation fluency of optimal interpersonal conflict solutions in patients with ADHD which might contribute to higher levels of anxiety in social interactions.

Modifiable risk and protective factors for anxiety disorders among adults: A systematic review,"Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in the general population and associated with high rates of impairment and disability. This burden highlights the need to identify risk factors that individuals can modify without professional intervention. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that examined modifiable risk and protective factors for anxiety disorders among adults in the general population. Searches were conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE using medical subject headings and text words related to risk factors, protective factors, and each anxiety disorder. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by three study authors. Modifiable risk and protective factors from 19 studies across seven countries were identified. Risk factors identified included cigarette smoking, alcohol use, cannabis use, negative appraisals of life events, avoidance, and occupational factors. Protective factors included social support, coping, and physical activity. Cigarette smoking was the most studied risk factor. Support was found for cigarette smoking as a risk factor for agoraphobia and panic disorder. Mixed results were found for generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobia. Across disorders, smoking frequency was associated with greater risk. Results indicate an important gap in the literature in that few studies have examined modifiable risk factors for anxiety disorders.

Associations between neighborhood-level violence and individual mental disorders: Results from the world mental health surveys in Five Latin American cities,"Rapidly urbanizing areas of Latin America experience elevated but unevenly distributed levels of violence. Extensive research suggests that individual exposure to violence is associated with higher odds of both internalizing (anxiety and mood) and externalizing (substance and intermittent explosive) mental disorders. Less research, however, has focused on how neighborhood-level violence, as an indicator of broader neighborhood contexts, might relate to the mental health of residents, independently of an individual's personal exposure. We used multilevel analyses to examine associations of neighborhood-level violence with individual-level past-year mental disorders, controlling for individual-level violence exposure. We used data from 7,251 adults nested in 83 neighborhoods within five large Latin American cities as part of the WHO World Mental Health Surveys. Accounting for individual-level violence exposure, living in neighborhoods with more violence was associated with significantly elevated odds of individual-level internalizing disorders, but not externalizing disorders. Caution should be exercised when making causal inferences regarding the effects of neighborhood-level violence in the absence of experimental interventions. Nevertheless, neighborhood context, including violence, should be considered in the study of mental disorders. These findings are particularly relevant for rapidly urbanizing areas with high levels of violence, such as Latin America.

The prediction of alexithymia as a state or trait characteristic in patients with substance use disorders and PTSD,"Alexithymia is common in patients with a substance use disorder (SUD) and is possibly a negative prognostic factor in their treatment. The aim of this study was twofold. First, we explored whether SUD patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more alexithymic than SUD patients without PTSD. Next, we explored whether trait and state-related parts of alexithymia could be differentiated in these patients. This phenomenon was studied in 197 SUD patients with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20); Clinician Administered PTSD Scale; Self-Report Inventory for PTSD; Traumatic Experiences Checklist; European Addiction Severity Index; and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale in a cross-sectional design. SUD patients with current PTSD showed more alexithymic characteristics than patients without PTSD or with previous lifetime/not current PTSD. The severity of PTSD complaints; alcohol addiction; and the combination of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, all of which are more related to alexithymia as a state, explained 38.1% of the TAS-20. In conclusion, we advise that SUD patients be assessed for alexithymia and that its degree is taken into account. We also tentatively assume that a considerable part of alexithymia is more state- than trait-related in these patients.

A cross-sectional face-to-face interview survey of a representative sample of the adults was carried out after the Lorca (Spain) earthquakes (May 11, 2011). Socio-demographic variables, DSM-IV diagnostic assessment and earthquake-related stressors were obtained from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The triallelic and biallelic classification of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were genotyped from buccal swabs. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to predict PTSD, including interaction terms to explore gene-environment (G x E) interactions. The vast majority (83%, n = 341) of the Lorca survey respondents ( n = 412, 71% response rate) were genotyped. Both classifications of the 5-HTTLPR genotype were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Prior lifetime PTSD was the only variable that remained a significant predictor after adjustments. There were no significant main effects of earthquake related stressors or 5-HTTLPR. However, G x E interactions of 5-HTTLPR with high emotional impact and prior lifetime anxiety disorders were statistically significant. These results provide new evidence of the modulation effect of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on PTSD risk. This information might characterize people at higher risk of developing PTSD after an earthquake exposure.

Subjective sleep and objective sleep of the participants were evaluated by using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index and polysomnography, respectively. We found that major depression with insomnia exhibited higher daytime dysfunction than primary insomnia; showed significantly higher values of rapid eye movement (REM) periods, time of REM sleep and percentage of REM stage; and presented lower percentage of non-rapid eye movement stage compared with primary insomnia and general anxiety disorder with insomnia ( p &lt; 0.05). General anxiety disorder with insomnia showed lower awakening number (AN) than primary insomnia, and other objective and subjective sleep values of general anxiety disorder with insomnia and primary insomnia showed no significant difference ( p &gt; 0.05). Our findings showed that major depression with insomnia increased active REM sleep and severe daytime function, which could alert clinicians to the risk of depression. Major depression with insomnia and primary insomnia may be categorically different.

Primary findings included: (1) factor-analytic support for a two factor (i.e., internal and external) Entrapment Scale structure; (2) variation in external entrapment subscale factor loadings by sample; (3) significant demographic correlates of elevated entrapment of younger age, female gender, and U.S. sample; (4) significant convergent positive associations for both entrapment types with cognitive (e.g., perceived burdensomeness), mental health (e.g., anxiety), and STB correlates; and (5) significant, robust associations of internal entrapment and perceived burdensomeness with STBs in the U.K. sample. Implications are reviewed for suicide prevention theory, research and practice.

"Self-reported empathy in adults with autism, early psychosis, and social anxiety disorder","The Empathy Quotient (EQ) self-report questionnaire is used to measure empathy in individuals with clinical conditions that have been associated with social impairments. In this study, older teens and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; N = 60), early psychosis (EP; N = 51) and social anxiety disorder (SAD; N = 71) and neurotypical controls (NT; N = 26) were compared on the cognitive empathy, emotional reactivity and social skills sub-scales of the Empathy Quotient (EQ) measure. All three clinical groups reported lower cognitive empathy than NT controls, and the ASD group reported lower cognitive empathy than EP and SAD groups. The ASD group reported lower emotional reactivity than the SAD group. All three clinical groups reported lower social skills that NT controls. The poor self-rated empathy for the ASD and EP groups generally reflects previous research that found individuals with these conditions perform relatively poorly on certain objective measures of empathy. However, the poor self-rated cognitive empathy and social skills for the SAD group conflicts with previous research that has found that SAD groups perform well on objective measures of empathy. This suggests that both EQ and objective measures should be used to fully assess empathy in clinical groups.

Subthreshold autism spectrum in bipolar disorder: Prevalence and clinical correlates,"Background: While few previous studies highlighted a higher prevalence of autistic traits among adults with Bipolar Disorder (BD), little is known about their clinical significance in this population. Method: 143 subjects with BD were enrolled at the adult psychiatric inpatient clinic of the University of Pisa. Assessments included the SCID-5, the MOODS-SR, the AQ and the AdAS Spectrum. Results: 42.7% of the sample scored positively for significant levels of autistic traits. Subjects with high autistic traits showed a greater likelihood of a very early onset of BD, greater length of current in-hospital stay, significantly higher rates of anxiety disorders and lower rates of substance use disorders compared to patients with low autistic traits. They also show significantly greater depressive symptoms and suicidality across the lifetime. Suicidality was associated with the altered responsiveness to sensory input and inversely related to adherence to routine and inflexibility. Conclusion: The study is a first exploration of the clinical significance of autistic traits among BD patients. Our results highlight the clinical significance of autistic traits in patients with BD, supporting the usefulness of a dimensional approach to the autism spectrum.

Clinical insight in anorexia nervosa: Associated and predictive factors,"Clinical and cognitive factors associated with clinical insight regarding both baseline level and its time-related changes, in outpatients treated for anorexia nervosa. The 193 participants were recruited at 13 French centers specializing in eating disorders (FFAB network) and assessed for insight (SAI-ED), body mass index (BMI), eating disorder severity, symptoms of depression and anxiety, emotional state, silhouette, and functionality; two cognitive tests were also administered. The 137 patients were then re-assessed 18 weeks later. Minimum and ideal subjective BMI and premorbid intelligence were associated with poor baseline insight. Contrary to nearly all other clinical factors, the level of insight revealed no improvement after four months of care. Only the higher value of the minimum lifetime BMI was significantly predictive of increased insight. More positive emotions (PANAS), less symptoms of depression and anxiety (HADS scores), and fewer syndromes (HADS above threshold) were the only factors that covaried with the changes in the level of insight. In conclusion, poor insight has little time variability, contrary to nearly all clinical and cognitive factors. As increased insight is mainly accompanied by improvements in the emotional domain, the latter could represent potential targets for patients with lack of awareness about their eating disorder.

A randomized controlled trial comparing Transdiagnostic Behavior Therapy (TBT) and behavioral activation in veterans with affective disorders,"This randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared the efficacy of Transdiagnostic Behavior Therapy (TBT) to Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD) in veterans diagnosed with affective disorders. TBT is a transdiagnostic psychotherapy designed to address depressive, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Preliminary findings have been promising; however, no RCT has been completed to date. 105 treatment-seeking veterans were recruited and completed diagnostic and self-report measures, and then randomized into TBT or BATD treatment conditions for 12 weekly psychotherapy sessions. Assessment measures were re-administered at immediate post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. Of the 93 participants initiating treatment, 50 participants completed the full treatment protocol (TBT n = 29; BATD n = 21). No differences were observed in treatment completion across groups. Participants demonstrated significant treatment improvements across all assessments, including measures of depression, anxiety (general, cognitive, and somatic), stress, PTSD symptoms, and transdiagnostic impairment. Group differences with small effect sizes were observed in most of the studied measures, favoring TBT compared to BATD. Together, the findings support the growing literature on the efficacy of transdiagnostic psychotherapies, compared to disorder-specific treatments (DSTs). Related to the outcome findings, the benefits for transdiagnostic protocols in terms of symptom coverage, dissemination, and access were discussed.

Bipolar subtypes and their clinical correlates in a sample of 391 bipolar individuals,"Differences between BD-I and BD-II patients with regard to specific illness characteristics are poorly understood. This study is mainly aimed to compare socio-demographic and clinical characteristics between BD-I and BD-II patients with the goal of clarifying possible predictors of clinical course. The sample of this cohort study is composed of 391 currently euthymic bipolar patients. Participants were all receiving only maintenance treatment; their psychopharmacological regimens and psychopathological conditions were stable at assessment. After univariate analyses, BD-II patients were more likely to be female, had more frequently a recent depressive episode and substance abuse/dependence relative to BD-I subjects. BD-II patients were also less likely to have a positive history of psychiatric conditions in family, psychotic symptoms at first episode, and first depressive illness episode. Moreover, BD-II were older at their illness onset and first treatment than BD-I patients. Furthermore, BD-I were more likely to have higher depressive, manic, anxiety, and symptoms severity than BD-II patients. After logistic regression analyses, being female (OR = 0.289), having psychiatric conditions in family (OR = 0.273), and higher severity of illness at CGI (OR = 0.604) were all significantly associated with BD-II. Additional studies are required to replicate these results, and facilitate the prediction of BD outcomes according to the specified profile.

Social anxiety is associated with poorer peer functioning for girls but not boys with ADHD,"There is mixed evidence for whether or not co-occurring anxiety is associated with poorer peer functioning in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which may be partly due to studies typically using a global measure of anxiety and failing to consider possible sex differences. The present study examined child-reported social anxiety in relation to peer functioning and whether this association differs by sex in 93 children (66% male; ages 8–12) with ADHD. Children, parents, and teachers completed a measure of social acceptance, and teachers also completed measures of asociality, peer exclusion, peer dislike, and peer ignoring. Regression analyses examined the interaction between social anxiety and sex in relation to the peer functioning variables, with age, race, ADHD subtype, and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms included as covariates. Social anxiety was associated with lower parent-reported social acceptance, with no sex differences in the association. However, significant interaction effects were found for child- and teacher-rated social acceptance, as well as peer exclusion and peer ignoring such that social anxiety was associated with less competence, more exclusion, and greater ignoring for girls but not boys. Findings indicate that social anxiety is associated with poorer peer functioning for girls more so than boys with ADHD.

"Psychometric assessment of mental health in tinnitus patients, depressive and healthy controls","Tinnitus describes the perception of a sound without external source and is characterized by high comorbidity, e.g. depression. In many studies, tinnitus patients were compared to healthy controls while a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis was an exclusion criterion. Consequently, patients with severe tinnitus and psychiatric comorbidity were often neglected. In the current study, we tried to fill this gap and compared four groups including two control groups: (1) chronic tinnitus patients with mild tinnitus distress ( N = 37), (2) chronic tinnitus patients with severe tinnitus distress ( N = 24), (3) patients suffering from depression, but no tinnitus (major depressive disorder, MDD; N = 23) and (4) healthy controls ( N = 42). We assessed their clinical profile with clinical questionnaires concerning anxiety, depression and somatoform symptoms. Data were analyzed with a canonical discriminant analysis resulting in two factors. Factor 1 was called general psychopathology, because most questionnaires loaded highly on it. Regarding this factor, patients with severe tinnitus distress and MDD controls were impaired equally strong. Patients with mild tinnitus distress were more strongly affected than healthy controls. Both tinnitus groups reached higher values than the two control groups with regard to factor 2, called somatization. These results stress the presence of significant general psychopathology even in mild tinnitus.

Evidence for enhanced androgen action in the prefrontal cortex of people with bipolar disorder but not schizophrenia or major depressive disorder,"Anxiety and depressive disorders are more prevalent in hypogonadal men. Low testosterone levels are associated with greater negative symptoms and impaired cognition in men with schizophrenia. Thus, androgens may contribute to brain pathophysiology in psychiatric disorders. We investigated androgen-related mRNAs in post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of psychiatric disorders. We also assessed androgen receptor (AR) CAG trinucleotide repeat length, a functional AR gene variant associated with AR gene expression, receptor activity, and circulating testosterone. AR CAG repeat length was determined from genomic DNA and AR and 5α-reductase mRNAs measured using quantitative PCR in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and control cases [ n = 35/group; Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI) Array collection]. Layer-specific AR gene expression was determined using in situ hybridisation in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and control cases ( n = 15/group; SMRI Neuropathology Consortium). AR mRNA was increased in bipolar disorder, but was unchanged in schizophrenia, relative to controls. AR and 5α-reductase mRNAs were significantly positively correlated in bipolar disorder. AR CAG repeat length was significantly shorter in bipolar disorder relative to schizophrenia. AR mRNA expression was highest in cortical layers IV and V, but no layer-specific diagnostic differences were detected. Together, our results suggest enhanced cortical androgen action in people with bipolar disorder.

"The relationship between risk of obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep problems, depression, and anxiety in adolescents from a community sample","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly related to mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. However, previous studies on OSA and depression and anxiety have mostly been conducted in the adult population. We aimed to (1) screen for risk of OSA in a sample of adolescents from the general population using self-report questionnaires and (2) examine whether there are differences between the high- and low-risk groups for OSA in depressive and anxiety symptoms, self-esteem, and sleep-related variables. The data of 793 students (age range: 12–17 years old) were analyzed. The participants were assigned to the high-risk ( n = 202, 25.5%) or the low-risk group ( n = 591, 74.5%) of OSA. The participants in the high-risk group had more severe anxiety symptoms, lower self-esteem, insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and higher BMI compared those in the low-risk group. This study shows that it is possible to efficiently screen for risks of various problems associated with OSA in adolescents using an easy and simple screening tool.

Associations of childhood trauma and childhood mental disorder with past-year mental disorder in military and civilian employed men,"Childhood factors are pivotal to understanding mental health over the lifespan. However, there is a dearth of research exploring childhood trauma and childhood disorder simultaneously in determining adult mental disorder. We aimed to analyze childhood trauma and childhood disorder in determining past-year disorder in military and civilian employed men aged 18–60 years. Data derived from the 2010 Australian Defence Force (ADF) Mental Health Prevalence and Wellbeing Study, and the 2007 Australian Bureau of Statistics National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing were analysed using logistic regression and Generalised Structural Equation Modelling (GSEM). All major findings were consistent across both populations. The association between childhood disorder and past-year disorder remained after controlling for demographics, childhood and adult trauma (and service factors in the ADF). Childhood non-interpersonal trauma was not associated with past-year disorder in either population. The pathway between childhood trauma and past-year disorder was fully mediated by the spectrum of common childhood disorders, but not by childhood anxiety, depression or alcohol use disorders alone. Identification, intervention and prevention of childhood disorders is imperative. Investment in interventions targeting the influence of childhood traumatic events on the whole spectrum of childhood disorder, not only PTSD or anxiety, is a priority.

Effects of brief daily mindfulness practice on affective outcomes and correlates in a high BPD trait sample,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological disorder characterized by dysregulation across multiple domains. While selected mindfulness-based interventions are effective in addressing symptoms of BPD, less is known regarding the effects of engaging in brief mindfulness practices on affective correlates of BPD. The present study investigated the effects of engaging in brief, daily mindfulness practice in a sample of young adults with elevated BPD symptoms. Ninety-two participants were recruited and randomly assigned to 2 weeks of daily mindfulness meditation or relaxation practice (active control), or to a no-practice control condition. Participants completed measures assessing depression, anxiety, stress, shame, difficulties with emotion regulation, trait mindfulness, and self-compassion before and after the practice period. Compared to the no-practice control condition, mindfulness practice resulted in significant improvements in trait mindfulness and self-compassion, whereas relaxation practice led to reductions in emotion regulation difficulties. No significant differences were found on any of the other outcomes between the mindfulness and relaxation conditions. The findings suggest that while both mindfulness and relaxation-based practices are effective in targeting selected transdiagnostic processes associated with BPD, more intensive interventions may be required for the practices to induce changes at the level of psychological symptoms.

History of parenting instability and lifetime suicidal behavior in people who inject drugs,"Despite high rates of suicide in people who inject drugs, little is known about the risk factors for suicide related to childhood and family history in this population. We aimed to explore the relationship between the history of out-of-home care (OHC) and lifetime suicide attempts among people who inject opioids. Participants ( N = 202) were current injection opioid users with at least one previous episode of opioid maintenance treatment. They were recruited into a double-blind randomized controlled trial for opioid substitution treatment. Secondary analysis of baseline data was conducted from the European Addiction Severity Index and basic demographics questionnaires. A total of 81 (40%) participants reported a history of living in OHC and 27% reported attempting suicide. Participants who reported living in OHC were more likely to report lifetime suicide attempts compared to those who did not live in OHC. History of OHC and suicidal ideation were significant risk factors for suicide attempts adjusting for depression and anxiety. Highest rates of lifetime attempts were among participants who lived in a group home, foster care, and/or psychiatric facility. Living in OHC during childhood was significantly associated with higher rates of suicide attempts in our sample. Greater efforts should be made to provide children from vulnerable families with environments where stable one-to-one relationships can be cultivated.

Characterization of the mental health of immigrant children separated from their mothers at the u.S.–mexico border,"Immigrant children who faced forced separation from their parents may be at heightened risk of developing mental health disorders, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety disorders. This cross-sectional study assessed the mental health of children being held in U.S. immigration detention who had been previously separated from their mothers. We interviewed 73 mothers about their eldest child age 5–17 using the Parent-Report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Among these children, many had elevated scores for emotional problems (49%), peer problems (21%), and total difficulties (15%). Male children demonstrated significantly higher rates of abnormal peer problems compared to females. Younger children (age 5–11 years) also demonstrated significantly higher rates of abnormal conduct problems, hyperactivity, and total difficulties. Scores did not differ significantly based on length of separation. Results reveal that children who had been separated from their parents experience high levels of mental health distress, which are especially high in younger children. Regardless of length of separation, these children would benefit from comprehensive mental health treatment with a culturally-responsive and trauma-informed lens.

"Self-harm as a predisposition for suicide attempts: A study of adolescents' deliberate self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts","The aim of this study was to analyze the predictive risk factors for self-harm in adolescents with and without suicidal ideation. 600 adolescents answered a questionnaire about self-harm and suicidal behaviors. A logistic regression analysis was conducted. Over half of the individuals with deliberate self-harm (DSH) presented significant suicide risk. There was a direct association between DSH and suicide attempts, with almost the totality of the adolescents with suicide attempts also reporting DSH. According to the prediction model, suicidal ideation and diversity of DSH behaviors are significant predictors of suicide attempts, with an augmentation in the diversity of DSH behaviors and suicidal ideation predicting suicide attempts. Depression and anxiety appeared also as significant predictors of suicide attempts in adolescent self-harmers. Considering that the majority of the sample was not from a clinical setting, an alarming finding was that one third of the total sample was at suicide risk. These results place DSH as a key variable for early intervention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal",2019
Intolerance of uncertainty and decision making in generalized anxiety disorder patients,"Presents a study which aims to examine intolerance of uncertainty and decision making in generalized anxiety disorder patients. Patients were recruited at a community mental health center at which they sought assessment and treatment. An adapted version of the decision making task was used to assess participants’ decisions involving simple choices between two small monetary rewards, varying both in probability of receiving the first reward, magnitude of the reward and time to wait before learning the consequences of the choice. This study yielded two main results. One primary finding was that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients, but not control participants, tended to avoid uncertainty when risks were low. However, there was less of a difference in probability of waiting per trial type in the trials where the patients knew the time they had to wait than in the trials where they did not know how long they had to wait. This suggests that when uncertainty is lower, GAD patients are inclined to react more like healthy controls. Furthermore, results showed that both patients with GAD and healthy controls were sensitive to loss, although results suggested that this finding was mainly driven by patients.

Overcoming treatment-resistant major depressive disorder outside of the doctor's office,"Presents a study which aims to assess if Skype consultations of patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TR-MDD) with or without other co-morbid psychiatric pathologies, were as effective as conventional office consultations. The first consultation was mandatory to be in the office. Patients were non-randomly divided in two groups: office consultation (n=95) and Skype consultation (n=103). All patients were followed for 12 months and evaluated in 3–5 regular consultations. Participants included in the Skype group differed significantly from participants in the office consultation group regarding three psychiatric comorbidities: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Panic Disorder (PD) with or without agoraphobia. The number of patients with GAD was significantly higher in the office consultation group, and on the other hand, the percentage of patients with agoraphobia was significantly higher in the Skype consultation group. For patients with GAD the change in the format of the consultations could be sufficient to provoke an anxiety crisis with the worry of getting worse from the depression. This may have been the reason why patients with GAD did not choose the Skype consultation. After 12 months of follow-up the two groups were similar in terms of depression symptoms, disease severity and function, suggesting that the consultations by Skype are as efficient as the office ones.

Heterogeneity in psychiatric diagnostic classification,"The theory and practice of psychiatric diagnosis are central yet contentious. This paper examines the heterogeneous nature of categories within the DSM-5, how this heterogeneity is expressed across diagnostic criteria, and its consequences for clinicians, clients, and the diagnostic model. Selected chapters of the DSM-5 were thematically analysed: schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; bipolar and related disorders; depressive disorders; anxiety disorders; and trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Themes identified heterogeneity in specific diagnostic criteria, including symptom comparators, duration of difficulties, indicators of severity, and perspective used to assess difficulties. Wider variations across diagnostic categories examined symptom overlap across categories, and the role of trauma. Pragmatic criteria and difficulties that recur across multiple diagnostic categories offer flexibility for the clinician, but undermine the model of discrete categories of disorder. This nevertheless has implications for the way cause is conceptualised, such as implying that trauma affects only a limited number of diagnoses despite increasing evidence to the contrary. Individual experiences and specific causal pathways within diagnostic categories may also be obscured. A pragmatic approach to psychiatric assessment, allowing for recognition of individual experience, may therefore be a more effective way of understanding distress than maintaining commitment to a disingenuous categorical system.

A systematic review of quantitative EEG as a possible biomarker in child psychiatric disorders,"Quantitative EEG (qEEG) has emerged as a potential intermediate biomarker for diagnostic clarification in mental illness. This systematic review examines published studies that used qEEG in youth with psychiatric illness between 1996 and 2017. We conducted a comprehensive database search of CINAHL, PubMed, and Cochrane using the following keywords: “quantitative EEG” and depression (MDD), anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), eating disorder, conduct, substance use, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder. Our search yielded 516 titles; 33 met final inclusion criteria, producing a total of 2268 youth aged 4–18. qEEG was most frequently studied as a potential diagnostic tool in pediatric mental illness; few studies assessed treatment response. Studies show higher theta/beta ratio in ADHD vs healthy controls (HC). The most consistent finding in ASD was decreased coherence in ASD vs HC. Studies show MDD has lower temporal coherence and interhemispheric coherence in sleep EEGs than HC. Further research is needed in the areas of mood, anxiety, ASD, and relationship to treatment. It remains unknown if abnormalities in qEEG are nonspecific markers of pediatric psychiatric illness or if they have the potential to differentiate types of psychopathology.

Prevalence and correlates of sleep disorder symptoms in psychiatric disorders,"Difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, poor sleep quality, nightmares, and excessive daytime sleepiness are some of the key clinical symptoms of sleep disturbances observed among individuals with psychiatric illnesses. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of symptoms of sleep disorders including parasomnia, narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, circadian rhythm disorder and restless leg syndrome/periodic limb movement (RLS/PLMS) and its correlates in patients with psychiatric diagnoses. Patients aged 21–65 years (n = 400) attending the outpatient clinics with a primary diagnosis of either schizophrenia, mood or anxiety disorder based on ICD-9 criteria were included in this cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic information was collected and screening questions pertaining to specific symptoms of sleep disorders were administered by a study team member. The overall prevalence of symptoms of sleep disorders in the psychiatric outpatient sample was 40.75% (163/400). The prevalence for symptoms of narcolepsy, sleep breathing disorder, PLMS/RLS, circadian rhythm disorder and parasomnia were 12.5%, 14.5%, 14.8%, 4.5%, and 13.8% respectively. These symptoms were associated with age, low physical activity, and anxiety disorder. Results highlight the high prevalence of symptoms of sleep disorders in psychiatric patients.

Comorbidity profile of mental disorders among adolescents: A latent class analysis,"The aim of this study was to identify the number of comorbidity profiles among adolescents. Sociodemographic factors associated with the comorbidity profiles were also examined. Latent class analysis was conducted using data from the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), a representative sample of adolescents ( N = 10,123) in the United States. Latent classes were derived from 26 lifetime mental disorders which were assessed using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Instrument (CIDI). A three-class solution provided the best fit for the data, with classes labelled as comorbid emotional disorders (Class I), comorbid behavioural disorders (Class II), and normative (Class III). Class I (15.62% of the participants) included adolescents with a high probability of having anxiety, depressive, and intermittent explosive disorder. Class II (6.97%) was characterised by adolescents with a high probability of having substance use, behavioural disorders, and major depression. Class III (77.41%) was characterised by adolescents with a low probability of having any mental disorders. Characterising comorbid profile of mental disorders using person-based approach yields a higher-order classification that could have important clinical implications.

Intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors in postpartum women: Psychometric properties of the Parental Thoughts and Behaviors Checklist,"Validated measures to assess intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors in postpartum women are few. In the present study, we investigated the psychometric properties of such a measure—a self-report version of the Parental Thoughts and Behaviors Checklist (PTBC). Via an online survey platform, 488 women who had given birth during the last year completed the PTBC along with measures of general obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, anxiety, parental stress and quality of life. Scores on the PTBC and its subscales showed good to excellent internal consistency, correlated in the expected direction with the other measures in the study, and discriminated between women with and without a history of OCD. Finally, exploratory factor analyses yielded nine thematic factors of intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors which largely corresponded to the themes identified by the developers of the interview-based version of the PTBC. This self-report version of the PTBC was found to possess good psychometric properties and to have a factor structure that largely overlapped with the structure of the interview-based version. Further evaluation of this version is needed, but the measure holds promise as a tool that may aid in the assessment of postpartum OCD in primary care and in psychiatric settings.

Scale development and psychometric properties of internalizing symptoms: The interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health internalizing subscale,"Internalizing difficulties in children and adolescents refer to inner-directed disordered mood and emotions. The purpose of this study was to develop and assess the reliability and validity of the internalizing subscale on the interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health (ChYMH) in assessing broadband internalizing mental health symptoms. Data were collected from clinically-referred children/youths 4 to 18 years of age between 2015 and 2016 ( N = 2536). After initial items relevant to internalizing disturbances underwent expert content validation, exploratory first-order and bifactor factor analyses and multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) parameterizations were conducted to test the validity of the measurement model. The internalizing subscale demonstrated strong measurement properties for a three-factor structure (i.e., depression, anxiety, anhedonia) and MIRT analyses showed individual items had acceptable discrimination parameters across the latent continuum. A series of four competing models using confirmatory factor analyses were conducted in a separate sample of 1397 children/youth assessed in 2017 and the bifactor model showed superior fit compared to other models. Finally, concurrent validity of this measure was confirmed based on relationships with other established subscales from criterion measures. The interRAI ChYMH internalizing subscale could be used to provide useful information for triaging and prioritizing referrals for children/youths.

Lifetime trauma exposure among those with combat-related PTSD: Psychiatric risk among U.S. Military personnel,"Research has described the association between lifetime trauma exposure and psychiatric symptoms among various cohorts, but little is known about the effect of lifetime trauma histories on the symptom expression of active-duty military personnel diagnosed with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Active-duty soldiers ( N = 162) were diagnosed with PTSD from deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale. Soldiers then completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Lifetime exposure to categories of trauma types and the intensity of exposure was reported on the Life Events Checklist. The number of categories of trauma that happened to them significantly predicted the severity of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms, as well as a positive screen for likely depression diagnosis based on self-reported symptoms. Direct exposure to trauma explained most of the association, as witnessing trauma and hearing about trauma did not explain symptoms beyond events that happened to participants. Interpersonal traumatic events were not associated with psychiatric functioning after controlling for non-interpersonal traumatic events. Assessment of trauma history among post-9/11 service members and veterans should include the frequency and variety of lifetime trauma exposure, given the association with psychiatric functioning.

Risk classification for conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease in primary care,"There is a pressing need to identify individuals at high risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on available repeated cognitive measures in primary care. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we applied a joint latent class mixed model (JLCM) to derive a 3-class solution: low risk (72.65%), medium risk (20.41%) and high risk (6.94%). In the low-risk group, individuals with lower daily activity and ApoEε4 carriers were at greater risk of conversion from MCI to AD. In the medium-risk group, being female, single, and an ApoEε4 carrier increased risk of conversion to AD. In the high-risk group, individuals with lower education level and single individuals were at greater risk of conversion to AD. Individual dynamic prediction for conversion from MCI to AD after 10 years was derived. Accurate identification of conversion from MCI to AD contributes to earlier close monitoring, appropriate management, and targeted interventions. Thereby, it can reduce avoidable hospitalizations for the high-risk MCI population. Moreover, it can avoid expensive follow-up tests that may provoke unnecessary anxiety for low-risk individuals and their families.

Suicide attempts in chronically depressed individuals: What are the risk factors?,"Chronically depressed individuals have a high suicide risk. However, it is an open question whether previously observed risk factors for suicide attempts also apply to chronic depression or whether there are specific risk factors related to chronic-recurrent illness. We drew from a large group of chronically depressed individuals seeking psychotherapy to investigate demographic and psychological factors related to previous suicide attempts. Participants took part in the SCID and filled out established questionnaires. Among 368 chronically depressed individuals (68.7% women; Mage = 40.95 years), 75 participants (19.4%) reported previous suicide attempts. Men were more likely to have used violent methods. We tested the links of having attempted suicide with different variables using logistic regression analyses. Our findings corroborate previously observed risk factors (e.g. sexual abuse, personality disorders) and suggest other risk factors which could be especially relevant in chronic depression (e.g. depression severity, interpersonal problems, self-injurious behavior, and overall years of depression). Other risk factors from previous studies were not related to suicidal behavior within our sample (e.g. anxiety disorders, PTSD). Thus, mental health professionals should be aware that risk factors for suicidal behavior might vary between diagnosis groups and that chronic illness might be a risk factor in itself.

Can the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS) differentiate treatment-resistant from non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia? A factor analytic investigation based on data from the Pattern cohort study,"Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (TRS) and Non-Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (NTRS) may represent different subtypes of schizophrenia. However, few studies have investigated their PANSS symptom dimensions by Exploratory (EFA) or Confirmatory (CFA). Data from the present study are derived from 1429 patients of the Pattern study. TRS was defined by the use of clozapine in the previous year whereas NTRS by the use of non-clozapine antipsychotics (""by proxy""). Factors were chosen based on the Kaiser criterion and considered valid when loadings were greater than or equal to 0.5. The fit to the data was evaluated by CFA in comparison with well-established PANSS models, using fit indexes. The EFA yielded similar five-factor model in both groups: Negative, Positive, Anxiety/Depression, Cognitive and Excited. CFA showed a satisfactory, but not perfect, fit to the data, as compared with the previous PANSS factor analytic models. Despite the limitations regarding the ‘by proxy’ definition of TRS, the results of the present study show that there are no differences in the factorial structure of PANSS in patients with TRS and NTRS.

A systematic review of studies probing longitudinal associations between anxiety and anorexia nervosa,"The current study aimed to establish whether anxiety predicts subsequent anorexia nervosa onset and maintenance. A systematic review of longitudinal studies assessing the association between stable anxiety exposures (e.g. trait anxiety/anxiety disorder pathology) and anorexia nervosa development or maintenance was undertaken. Eight studies met inclusion criteria. Seven probed the association between anxiety and anorexia nervosa onset, and one assessed the association between anxiety and anorexia nervosa maintenance. Individuals with anorexia nervosa were more likely to report childhood anxiety compared to healthy individuals, but whether childhood anxiety explains unique variance in anorexia nervosa development is unclear. Current evidence does not support longitudinal associations between specific anxiety disorders (independently of other anxiety disorders) and subsequent anorexia nervosa onset, however anxiety disorder diagnosis in general may predict increased anorexia nervosa risk. The single study probing the association between anxiety and anorexia nervosa maintenance did not find evidence supporting a relationship. The quality of individual studies was fair to high, however the body of evidence was of low quality. Further research that minimises bias, allowing for strong conclusions concerning longitudinal associations between anxiety and subsequent anorexia nervosa outcomes, is required to inform anorexia nervosa aetiology. This in turn may promote improved prevention and treatment.

Cardiopulmonary coupling analysis predicts early treatment response in depressed patients: A pilot study,"This pilot study evaluated the effect of anti-depression treatment on sleep quality and symptoms of depression in patients with major depressive disorder, and identified cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC) indices for predicting early response. Forty-one Han Chinese patients with major depressive disorder were assessed for objective sleep quality before treatment (baseline) and at 2 weeks using CPC. Subjective sleep quality and depression levels were measured at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks after treatment, using the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-24), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Objective and subjective sleep quality, and depression symptoms, improved after treatment. Significant correlations were found between CPC variables at baseline and depression symptom improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. Total sleep time at baseline significantly correlated with somnipathy score reduction at week 2. Total in-bed time at week 2 significantly correlated with reductions in anxiety/somatic symptoms and retardation score, and total HAMD-24 score at week 4. In binary logistic regression, the total in-bed time at baseline was significantly associated with treatment response. Our findings suggest that objective sleep quality measured by CPC analysis is useful for predicting treatment response to antidepressant treatment in patients with major depressive disorder.

Improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms following cognitive behavior therapy for pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder,"Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) co-occurs frequently with other mental health conditions, adding to the burden of disease and complexity of treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is efficacious for both OCD and two of its most common comorbid conditions, anxiety and depression. Therefore, treating OCD may yield secondary benefits for anxiety and depressive symptomatology. This study examined whether anxiety and/or depression symptoms declined over the course of OCD treatment and, if so, whether improvements were secondary to reductions in OCD severity, impairment, and/or global treatment response. The sample consisted of 137 youths who received 12 sessions of manualized CBT and were assessed by independent evaluators. Mixed models analysis indicated that youth-reported anxiety and depression symptoms decreased in a linear fashion over the course of CBT, however these changes were not linked to specific improvements in OCD severity or impairment but to global ratings of treatment response. Results indicate that for youth with OCD, CBT may offer benefit for secondary anxiety and depression symptoms distinct from changes in primary symptoms. Understanding the mechanisms underlying carryover in CBT techniques is important for furthering transdiagnostic and/or treatment-sequencing strategies to address co-occurring anxiety and depression symptoms in pediatric OCD.

Psychiatric factors affecting recovery after a long term treatment program for substance use disorder,"Psychiatric comorbidity can negatively impact the course of addictions. Psychiatric features of patients who continued treatment after the first stage of an addiction program have not been sufficiently analysed. Therefore, only these patients were included in order to compare psychiatric comorbidity and clinical factors between patients who were able or not to complete a long term substance-free program. Treatment-completion status of 245 patients was systematically recorded. Addiction severity, psychiatry comorbidity, and psychological symptoms were evaluated. No significant differences were found regarding comorbid psychiatric diagnoses and the completion of the treatment. Longer treatment duration (OR: 1.22; p &lt; 0.01), higher educational level (OR: 2.37; p = 0.02), and cocaine dependence as main substance (OR: 3.68; p &lt; 0.01) were found to be related to increased likelihood in completing the treatment. Patients with higher severity of alcohol consumption (OR: 0.06; p = 0.02) and more depressive symptoms (OR: 0.95; p = 0.01) completed the treatment less frequently. Moreover, differences regarding employment problems, treatment facilities, anxiety symptoms, dysfunctional impulsivity, and mental HRQoL were found. It is concluded that comorbid psychiatric diagnoses do not determine treatment outcomes. However, therapeutic and psychological factors have a major influence on the likelihood to complete a long-term treatment program.

"Validation of the Social Functioning Scale: Comparison and evaluation in early psychosis, autism spectrum disorder and social anxiety disorder","Social functioning is an important component of mental disorders for assessment and treatment. There is no recognised self-report instrument to measure social functioning across disorders where social impairment is significant. The Social Functioning Scale (SFS) has, however, been used to assess social functioning in psychotic disorders, including Schizophrenia and Early Psychosis. The current study investigated the reliability, validity and sensitivity of the SFS in Early Psychosis, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and neurotypical control populations. As expected, all clinical groups showed significant impairment on the total and sub-scale scores of the SFS. The SFS showed good internal consistency and concurrent validity for people diagnosed with SAD and Early Psychosis and a similar factors structure was found for these groups. Participants with ASD reported a relatively low internal consistency and poor concurrent validity, as well as a three-component solution. The SFS has also showed a good sensitivity to separate clinical populations and neurotypical controls. This study supports the use of the SFS for those with SAD and Early Psychosis. Lower internal consistency in ASD populations suggests further research in larger samples is required and that the relationship between its scales are likely different to other populations. Alternative scales or significant other reports may be required for adults with ASD.

The role of attachment anxiety in the relationship between childhood trauma and schizophrenia-spectrum psychosis,"Childhood trauma (CT) is a comprehensive concept encompassing experiences of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, and neglect during childhood and adolescence. Patients with schizophrenia-spectrum psychosis (SSP) display higher rates of CT than healthy controls. Among the potential mediators of this association, insecure attachment has gained attention and empirical validation. The present study aimed to extend existing knowledge on this field by exploring the role of the two attachment dimensions, attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance, in the CT-SSP association. A clinical sample of 63 SSP inpatients was compared to a healthy control group on CT and attachment style measures. Correlations between CT, attachment dimensions and psychopathology were sought. Mediation analyses were also performed to examine whether attachment anxiety and/or attachment avoidance mediated the CT-SSP association. Patients displayed higher rates of CT and insecure attachment than controls. Attachment anxiety and severity of Mother Antipathy were linked to severity of hallucinations. Attachment anxiety was recognized as the sole mediator of the CT-SSP association. Our findings suggest that individuals with severe CT and increased attachment anxiety represent a risk population warranting early clinical attention, regular monitoring and tailored therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing the psychological impact of trauma.

Fear reactivity to head-mounted display perceptual illusion challenges is associated with suicidality,"Suicide remains a public health concern with suicide rates showing a consistent increase over the last 20 years. Recent studies have found a relationship between anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the fear of anxiety related symptoms) and suicidality. Specifically, a relationship has been found between anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns (ASCC) and suicidality. The knowledge around this relationship, however, has relied mostly on self-report measures. This study seeks to expand on the current literature by exploring the association between ASCC and suicidality, through the use of head-mounted display perceptual illusion challenges (e.g., using tactile sensations and mannequins to create illusions that the participant has switched bodies). A head-mounted display was used to elicit symptoms (e.g., depersonalization, derealization) related to ASCC in a sample of undergraduate students ( N = 54). Suicidality and depression were measured by the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms-2 (IDAS-II), anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns by the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3), and distress by the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS). Findings indicated that suicidality was associated with self-reported ASCC as well as the fear generated from the challenges. Furthermore, our results found that challenge-induced fear predicted suicidality scores above and beyond the traditional self-report measures of ASCC. The small sample size and low suicide risk of the current sample limits generalizations to more severe populations.

Social anxiety as a precursor for depression: Influence of interpersonal rejection and attention to emotional stimuli,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are comorbid conditions, and SAD confers risk for MDD. Biased attention and interpersonal rejection are important for the development of SAD and MDD, but little research has examined how these processes may lead to MDD. We hypothesized that interpersonal rejection would result in SAD symptoms being associated with more “depression-like” attention biases. Participants ( n = 164) completed a measure of SAD symptoms and an eye tracking task before and after a task in which they were randomized to be socially included or rejected. SAD symptoms, inclusion or rejection condition, and the interaction term were entered into separate hierarchical linear regressions predicting change in attention for five emotional faces. Rejection condition significantly moderated the effects of SAD on change in attention to sad, happy, and neutral faces. SAD predicted increased attention to sad faces and decreased attention to happy faces in the rejection condition, but not in the inclusion condition. SAD predicted increased attention to neutral faces in the inclusion condition, but not in the rejection condition. There were no significant effects for angry or disgust. Results suggest that SAD symptoms are associated with more depression-like attention biases in the context of interpersonal rejection.

"Childhood temperament is associated with distress, anxiety and reduced quality of life in schizophrenia spectrum disorders","Schizophrenia is conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental disorder and pre-morbid differences in social function and cognition have been well-established. Less is known about pre-morbid temperament and personality. Inhibited temperament—the predisposition to respond to novelty with wariness, fear, or caution—is a premorbid risk factor for anxiety, depression, and substance use but is understudied in schizophrenia. Participants were patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders ( n = 166) and healthy controls ( n = 180). Patients completed measures of childhood inhibited temperament, clinical symptoms (anxiety, depression, PANSS factors), and quality of life. Patients had significantly higher levels of inhibited temperament relative to healthy controls. In patients with schizophrenia, higher inhibited temperament was significantly associated with co-morbid anxiety disorders, greater anxiety and depression symptoms, higher PANSS Distress scores, lower PANSS Excitement scores, and lower quality of life. The current findings replicate and extend previous research with a larger sample and are consistent with vulnerability in an affective path to psychosis. In schizophrenia, higher inhibited temperament was associated with a cluster of mood and anxiety symptoms. Inhibited temperament was not associated with psychosis symptoms. Patients with high inhibited temperament may especially benefit from treatments that specifically target anxiety and depression.

Types of problematic smartphone use based on psychiatric symptoms,"To provide appropriate solutions for problematic smartphone use, we need to first understand its types. This study aimed to identify types of problematic smartphone use based on psychiatric symptoms, using the decision tree method. We recruited 5,372 smartphone users from online surveys conducted between February 3 and February 22, 2016. Based on scores on the Korean Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale for Adults (S-Scale), 974 smartphone users were assigned to the smartphone-dependent group and 4398 users were assigned to the normal group. The data-mining technique of C5.0 decision tree was applied. We used 15 input variables, including demographic and psychological factors. Four psychiatric variables emerged as the most important predictors: self-control (Sc; 66%), anxiety (Anx; 25%), depression (Dep; 7%), and dysfunctional impulsivities (Imp; 3%). We identified the following five types of problematic smartphone use: (1) non-comorbid, (2) self-control, (3) Sc + Anx, (4) Sc + Anx + Dep, and (5) Sc + Anx + Dep + Imp. We found that 74% of smartphone-dependent users had psychiatric symptoms. The ratio of participants belonging to the non-comorbid and self-control types was 64%. We proposed that these types of problematic smartphone use may be used for the development of an appropriate service for controlling and preventing such behaviors in adults.

"Anxiety symptoms across twenty-years in schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder","Anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders are common in both mood and psychotic disorders. However, limited comparative information exists regarding the long-term course of anxiety in schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. Prospective evaluation of the 20-year trajectory of self-reported anxiety and somatic-related anxiety in three major diagnostic groups, 43 schizoaffective patients, 47 bipolar patients, and 109 major depression patients was conducted. The patients were recruited at an index phase of hospitalization, and then reassessed longitudinally at six subsequent follow-ups over 20-years. The sample was well characterized with symptom, recovery and functioning data being available. This study found that in the earlier years of illness, self-reported anxiety was greater in schizoaffective and major depression patients than bipolar patients. The three groups were similar for anxiety symptoms during the 20-year course of their illness. Last, we found in all patients, self-reported anxiety in the early years predicted having a period of recovery and lower global functioning in the future. Our data provides unique information regarding the comparative course of anxiety in related mood and psychotic disorders. Both clinicians and researchers should focus on assessing, diagnosing, and treating anxiety in mood and psychotic disorders, as a means to improve outcomes and quality of life in these individuals.

Childhood sexual abuse as a potential predictor of psychotic like experiences in Tunisian college students,"Background: Current research has shown that experiencing childhood trauma may predispose individuals for psychosis and expression of Psychotic like experiences (PLEs). We aimed to examine the prevalence and characteristics of PLEs and depressive and negative experiences in a sample of Tunisian college students, and to evaluate the impact of childhood traumas in the occurrence and severity of these experiences at the time of the survey. Method: A total of 482 college students (63.7% female; aged 18–32) participated in a cross-sectional survey. The Positive Subscale of Community Assessment of Psychotic Experiences (CAPE) was used to measure PLEs. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used to assess childhood trauma and neglect. Results: 53.5% ( n = 258) of the students reported at least one positive PLE ‘nearly always’, and 40.9% ( n = 197) reported at least one negative PLE with this frequency. After controlling for demographic variables (gender, age) and psychosocial factors (drug use, depression, anxiety and stress), sexual abuse significantly contributed to PLEs. Conclusion: There is a need for further cross-cultural research regarding the phenotypal expression of PLEs and its associated variables. Child sexual abuse victims should receive systematic and complete psychological screening during their adolescence/ early adulthood including, among others, PLEs and psychotic symptoms.

A pilot randomized trial of a dual n-back emotional working memory training program for veterans with elevated PTSD symptoms,"Anxiety is characterized by excessive attention to threatening information, leading to impaired working memory (WM) performance and elevated anxious thoughts. Preliminary research indicates that individuals with PTSD show particular difficulty with WM in emotional contexts (Schweizer et al., 2011). Although several studies show that computerized training can improve WM capacity for anxious individuals (Owens et al., 2013; Schweizer et al., 2011; 2013), there has been very little research on WM training for PTSD or with Veterans (Saunders et al., 2015). In a pilot randomized trial, we assigned Veterans with elevated PTSD symptoms to an online emotional WM training, either adaptive ( n -back; n = 11) or a less potent training (1-back; n = 10). Overall, both groups showed significant decreases in PTSD symptoms. The n-back group showed a trend of outperforming the 1-back group in improving reexperiencing symptoms (which are likely to be associated with impaired WM functioning). This population anecdotally found the intervention quite challenging, which may be why even the less potent 1-back was still helpful. These preliminary findings justify the effort for developing new WM-focused PTSD intervention for complex, vulnerable populations, particularly as online training can improve accessibility.

Mental health in spouses of U.S. Gulf War veterans,"Veterans’ spouses are at risk for mental distress and substance use. We examined long term psychological functioning in spouses from a national cohort of 1991 Gulf War era veterans. From clinical interviews, spouses of deployed veterans ( n = 488) did not have a greater prevalence of post-war mental disorders compared to spouses of non-deployed veterans ( n = 536); however, in couples that were living together since the war, there was an increased risk of anxiety disorders or any one disorder. On questionnaires, the impact varied but was most consistently observed in more severe depression and greater functional impairment in spouses of deployed compared to non-deployed veterans. If a veteran developed post-war anxious/depressive disorders or any one mental disorder, the matched spouse was more likely to develop post-war anxious/depressive disorders or any one mental disorder, respectively. Veteran combat exposure did not similarly increase the risk of spouse post-war mental disorders. Greater spouse self-reported symptomatology was observed in spouses of veterans with anxious/depressive disorders even when controlling for deployment. In summary, the war conferred greater risk for spouse mental disorders and distress for spouses of veterans with mental health disorders, with some increased risk for spouses of deployed veterans, especially in couples together since the war.

Impairment in planning tasks of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders,"Anxiety disorders are associated with poor neuropsychological performance in attention and memory. However, little is known about the impact of these difficulties on other cognitive functions, such as planning. The ability to plan, including attention, working memory and set-shifting components, can be assessed by the Tower of Hanoi task (ToH). This study evaluated seventy-one participants, aged from 7–17 years. Thirty-seven subjects met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for at least one anxiety disorder and 34 individuals comprised the controls. The neuropsychological tests used were: the ToH, a problem-solving task, involves planning ability and other executive functions (working memory, attentional control and cognitive flexibility); for the assessment of processing speed and problem-solving, the Vocabulary/Matrix Reasoning subtests of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence was used to measure for estimated-IQ in both groups. The groups were compared with a generalized linear model controlling for age, IQ and ADHD comorbidity. Compared with controls, anxiety disorders subjects made more errors and required more time to complete the ToH. Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders have poorer planning ability compared to subjects without anxiety disorders, and the difficulty in planning is affected by interference from other cognitive functions, such as attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility and problems-solutions.

The role of excessive reassurance seeking: An eye tracking study of the indirect effect of social anxiety symptoms on attention bias,"High social anxiety is associated with increased attentional bias, and difficulties disengaging from relevant threat information, though social anxiety may also be associated with avoidance of threat. Few mechanisms of this relationship have been empirically evaluated, whereas theories and treatment manuals implicate avoidance and/or safety behaviors as significant agents of negative reinforcement for anxiety symptoms and search for threat. The current study sought to investigate one safety behavior, excessive reassurance seeking, as a mediator of the relationship between social anxiety and attention bias to disgust facial stimuli. Support was found for our hypotheses, such that social anxiety symptoms had an indirect effect on attention bias to disgust faces through increased reassurance seeking. These results suggest that reassurance seeking may result in disengagement of attention to threat stimuli. Specifically, social anxiety may result in a decreased threshold for negative social cues and therefore seek out reassurance feedback and avoid threatening stimuli. Future studies should test these directly and utilize a prospective design. The current study suggests that reassurance seeking may be involved in the attention bias process, providing additional data for current cognitive theories of social anxiety and additional support for reinforcement patterns of anxiety symptoms.

The psychometrics of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale supports a shorter—12 item—version,"The diagnosis of patients suffering from both anxiety and depression is complex due to mixed effects of the two disorders. This complexity has hardened the task to find an adapted treatment for these patients. Consequently, several instruments, known as depression anxiety scales, have been developed and are now used internationally by physicians to determine the diagnosis of anxiety and depression and treat the patients accordingly. This study aims at testing the consistency and reliability of one of the main anxiety and depression scale which is composed of 14 items, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We have used explanatory factor analysis (EFA) and factor extraction by principal component analysis (PCA) with orthogonal varimax (Kaiser Normalization) rotation on a cohort of 9706 French depressed patients. The relevance of the 14 items included in the HADS was also scrutinized by measuring the internal consistency and reliability of the global HADS removing each item one by one. Our conclusion is that the HADS could potentially gain in consistency in the detection of anxiety, notably through the revision of two of the anxiety items.

Reducing burnout and anxiety among doctors: Randomized controlled trial,"Prevalence studies show high levels of burnout, anxiety, fatigue and other symptoms of distress among medical doctors. However, there are very few randomized controlled trials testing interventions against these problems. This randomized controlled trial (NCT02838290; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016) tested interventions teaching 227 doctors about the psychology of burnout, stress, coping with patient death, and managing distress, as well as giving them information about prevalence rates among doctors. Primary outcomes included burnout, anxiety, insomnia, grief, alcohol/drug use, binge eating, physical symptoms, and psychiatric morbidity. The outcomes were tested before and after the interventions with a 7-day time-lag. The intervention significantly decreased doctors’ levels of burnout (e.g. emotional exhaustion and depersonalization) and anxiety. Doctors in the control group had no significant changes in these signs of distress. The intervention did not significantly reduce other health and habit-related outcomes potentially because these need a longer time-lag than 7 days. Interventions teaching doctors about the psychology of work-related distress reduce burnout and anxiety by helping doctors realize that distress is a normal, human reaction to external stressors, common in medicine, and solvable by learning about psychological coping strategies.

"Mental health and quality of life of Brazilian medical students: Incidence, prevalence, and associated factors within two years of follow-up","Medical students’ mental health and quality of life (QoL) cause growing concern worldwide, but, to date, few longitudinal studies have followed these students. Our objective was to evaluate the incidence, prevalence, and factors associated with quality of life and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress of Brazilian medical students who were followed for a period of two years. Students’ mental health (DASS-21), QoL (WHOQOL-Bref), and religiousness (DUREL) were evaluated in four different waves(four semesters). A total of 312 (54.2%) medical students responded to all four waves. Medical students demonstrated a high prevalence and incidence of emotional disorders. Almost half of the students presented high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress during the two-year follow-up; approximately one out of five students without symptoms at the baseline were considered new cases and these problems have a cyclical nature. Baseline factors such as depression, anxiety, stress, having low income, being female, being in the early stages of medical training and non-white were associated with poorer mental health and quality of life in the follow-up. Our results show that medical students have a high prevalence and incidence of mental health disorders during their medical training. This data may help educators plan preventive strategies.

Evaluation of the Social Phobia Scale and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale as assessments of performance and interaction anxiety,"The DSM-5 classification of performance anxiety as distinct from social anxiety underlines the need for specific measurement instruments. The Social Phobia Scale (SPS) and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) are widely used assessments of performance and general interaction anxiety, yet few studies have examined their criterion validity using actual performance and interaction stressors. The current study is the first to assess the scales’ convergent and discriminant validity using multimodal anxiety indices including psychophysiological reactivity, which is a key characterizing feature of performance anxiety. Ninety-three individuals completed the SPS and SIAS and participated in performance and interaction challenges. Anxiety response was assessed with criterion measures of self-reported anxiety, observer-rated anxiety, heart rate and skin conductance. Both scales were moderately correlated with self-report and observer-rated anxiety ( r ’s = 0.21–0.62) and weakly correlated with physiological measures ( r ’s = 0.07–0.35), generally supporting convergent criterion validity. Discriminant criterion validity was not supported, however, with the SIAS and SPS showing similar correlations with each criterion measure for both social challenges. These findings suggest the SIAS and SPS are valid instruments for the assessment of social anxiety but may not be suitable for the specific measurement of performance and interaction anxiety.

"Pathways among sleep onset latency, relationship functioning, and negative affect differentiate patients with suicide attempt history from patients with suicidal ideation","Depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and poor relationship functioning often co-occur with the confluence of these factors contributing to greater suicide risk. This study investigated whether the pathways between depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and relationship functioning differentiated patients with suicide attempt history from those with suicidal ideation history. Patients seeking partial hospital treatment for severe psychiatric symptoms ( N = 180) completed interviews assessing psychiatric and suicidal symptom histories, and self-report measures of sleep behaviors, anxiety, depression, and relationship functioning. Multiple sleep behaviors were examined: duration, sleep onset latency, and bedtime. Bias-corrected bootstrap mediation and moderated mediation analyses with suicide attempt as the moderator were used to evaluate pathways between variables. Among patients with ideation and attempt history, (1) sleep onset latency significantly mediated the association between depression and relationship functioning and that between anxiety and relationship functioning; (2) relationship functioning significantly mediated the association between depression and sleep onset latency and that between anxiety and sleep onset latency. These pathways were not significant among patients with suicidal ideation only. No other sleep behaviors were related to study variables. The reciprocal relationship between disrupted sleep onset latency and poor relationship functioning was specifically linked to more severe psychiatric symptoms among acute patients with suicide attempt histories.

Psychiatric disorders’ paradoxical protective effect on cardiovascular procedures and mortality,"Comments on an article by E. C. Pino et al. (see record 2018-14130-001). The recent study by Pino et al. is a thought-provoking study examining psychiatric comorbidity among patients with acute coronary artery disease. The authors demonstrated an interesting paradox where patients with a depression and/or anxiety diagnosis at the time of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have lower odds of revascularization (the primary treatment for STEMI) and in-hospital mortality. As the authors have noted, this is in direct contrast to majority of the previous literature which have shown that these comorbidities are risk factors for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Few additional analyses may be helpful in disentangling this interesting finding.

"Body dysmorphic disorder and its relationship to sexuality, impulsivity, and addiction","This study sought to examine the prevalence of probable body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) in a university sample and its associated physical and mental health correlates. A 156-item anonymous online survey was distributed via email to a randomly chosen subset of 10,000 university students, at a large public university. The survey queried current use of alcohol and drugs, psychological and physical status, academic performance, sexual behaviors, and questionnaire-based measures of impulsivity and compulsivity. A total of 3,459 participants (59.1% female) completed the survey and were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of BDD was 1.7% ( n = 59). Compared to students without BDD, those with BDD were significantly more likely to endorse symptoms of compulsive sexual behavior, depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Questionnaire-based measures revealed higher levels of both compulsivity and impulsivity associated with BDD. BDD appears to be common in young adults, and is associated with specific mental health comorbidities, as well as both impulsive and compulsive traits. Clinicians should be aware of the presentation of BDD and screen for it in primary care and mental health settings.

Dysmorphic concern in anorexia nervosa: Implications for recovery,"Body image disturbance (‘dysmorphic concern’) is a key diagnostic criterion for anorexia nervosa (AN). While dysmorphic concern has been described as a relapse predictor, relatively little is understood about the prevalence in AN, and the consequences upon wellbeing. The present study examined the rates of dysmorphic concern in a sample of treatment-seeking adults with AN ( N = 39), and explored the associations with general mental health, disability and eating disorder symptoms. The majority of participants (61.5%) had clinically significant levels of dysmorphic concern. Furthermore, higher dysmorphic concern scores were associated with increased symptoms of anxiety, depression and eating disorder symptomatology. There was also a trend towards associations between dysmorphic concern and age of onset and stages of change (pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance), although replication is required. These findings suggest that strategies which specifically address body image distortions should be a key feature of treatment for anorexia nervosa to support long-term recovery and wellbeing.

Intolerance of uncertainty and responsibility for harm predict nocturnal panic attacks,"Nocturnal panic involves waking suddenly from sleep in a state of panic, with no apparent cause, and affects more than half of patients with panic disorder. The Fear of Loss of Vigilance theory is the only proposed model for nocturnal panic, suggesting nocturnal panickers fear states in which they are unable to react to danger or protect themselves from threats. Prior work using a self-report questionnaire designed to test the theory (i.e., Fear of Loss of Vigilance Questionnaire; FLOVQ) was unsuccessful at differentiating nocturnal from daytime panickers. This study tested the theory using alternative measures to the FLOVQ. We predicted nocturnal panickers would show elevated responses to measures assessing fears of being unable to respond to or protect themselves from threats. A diverse community sample ( N = 218) completed self-report measures related to panic attacks, intolerance of uncertainty, responsibility for harm, and anxiety sensitivity dimensions. Nocturnal panickers endorsed greater inhibitory intolerance of uncertainty and responsibility for harm, but not prospective intolerance of uncertainty, or anxiety sensitivity physical or cognitive concerns. This study provides support for the fear of loss of vigilance theory and suggests intolerance of uncertainty and responsibility for harm reduction be targeted in treatment for nocturnal panic attacks.

Sorrow shared is halved? War trauma experienced by others and mental health among Darfuri asylum seekers,"Research suggests that the ethnic community plays a major role in the mental health of traumatized refugees arriving from collective societies. This study explored the relationships between war-related trauma and mental health separately for direct trauma exposure (i.e., events directly endorsed by asylum-seekers) and indirect trauma exposure (i.e., events endorsed by family, friends and other community members). Data for 300 Darfuri asylum-seekers living in Israel were obtained in a cross-sectional design. Hierarchical regressions were used to examine how direct versus indirect trauma exposure were associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive and anxiety symptoms and psychological well-being. Results showed that direct trauma exposure was associated with worse mental health symptoms and reduced well-being. In contrast, indirect trauma exposure to similar events of others was linked with fewer PTSD, depressive and anxiety symptoms and improved well-being. These findings offer preliminary insights into the nature of trauma and mental health in asylum-seekers from collective cultures: While trauma directly experienced by the individual is associated with increased risk for poor mental health; exposure to others’ similar experiences may be associated with reduced emotional distress. Findings are discussed in terms of their potential implications for culturally sensitive assessment and group therapy in refugees.

Latent typologies of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms in U.S. military veterans,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a heterogeneous condition that can be characterized by unique typologies of symptoms. To date, no study has examined predominant PTSD typologies using DSM-5 criteria. We used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify typologies of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms in 158 U.S. veterans who screened positive for this condition. A three-class solution provided the best fit to the data, described as Dysphoric (36.2%), High Symptom (34.0%) and Threat (29.8%). The Threat class had higher probabilities of intrusions and avoidance compared to the Dysphoric class; the Dysphoric class had higher probabilities of negative affect, anhedonia and externalizing behavior relative to Threat; the High Symptom class had high probabilities of all symptoms. Compared to the Threat class, the Dysphoric class was more likely to have a lifetime history of major depressive, alcohol and drug use disorders; the High Symptom class was more likely to have a lifetime history of alcohol, drug, and nicotine use disorder, current generalized anxiety, or to have attempted or currently contemplated suicide. The High Symptom class reported greater mental, physical and cognitive impairment and lower quality of life. These findings underscore the importance of a personalized approach to the assessment and treatment of DSM-5 PTSD.

Low total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein associated with aggression and hostility in recent suicide attempters,"Low cholesterol levels have been correlated with both suicidal and aggressive behavior in psychiatric patients. Few studies have investigated associations between serum lipid profiles and both aggressive state and trait. Fifty-two psychiatric medication-free inpatients were included in this study after a suicide attempt. Composite scores of “State Aggression” and “Trait Aggression” were calculated using relevant items from the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale and the Karolinska Scales of Personality. State Aggression was significantly and negatively correlated with total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Trait Aggression was also significantly and negatively correlated with LDL, but not TC. There were small but significant mediation effects of severity of anxiety symptoms on the relationship between State Aggression and TC as well as LDL. In exploratory analyses we found that low cholesterol was also associated with personality traits of hostility. Moreover, low cholesterol was more robustly associated with personality trait items related to interpersonal aggression, as opposed to items related to irritability or more indirect, non-overt aggression. Our findings suggest that low cholesterol is associated with both state and trait aggression in suicide attempters. Future mechanistic studies are warranted to better understand the relationship between low cholesterol and high aggression in suicide attempters.

Correlates of sedentary behavior among community-dwelling adults with anxiety in six low- and middle-income countries,"We investigated correlates of sedentary behavior (SB) among community-dwelling adults with elevated anxiety symptoms in six low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Cross-sectional data from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (2007–2010) were analyzed. Associations between SB levels and the correlates were examined using multivariable linear and logistic regressions. Out of 42,469 individuals aged ≥ 18 years, there were 2630 participants with anxiety (47.6 ± 16.5 years; 66.6% female). Correlates significantly associated with being sedentary ≥ 8 h/day were being male, older age, a lower income, never married (vs. married/cohabiting), being unemployed, poor self-related health, alcohol consumption, and less social cohesion (highest quartile vs. lowest). Disability and bodily pain were associated with more time spent (min/day) sedentary. Future intervention research should target the risk groups based on identified sociodemographic correlates. Also, whether the promotion of social cohesion increases the efficacy of public health initiatives should be examined with prospective data.

"Addicted to Facebook? Relationship between Facebook Addiction Disorder, duration of Facebook use and narcissism in an inpatient sample","The present study explored the Facebook Addiction Disorder (FAD) in an inpatient sample in Germany. Of the 112 Facebook users (71.4% women; age(years): M ( SD ) = 49.43 (9.17)), who were patients of a psychosomatic rehabilitation clinic with affective disorders and anxiety disorders as most common diagnoses, 28.6% reached the critical polythetic cutoff score of FAD, 0.9% researched the critical monothetic cutoff score, and 86.6% had enhanced values of withdrawal symptoms due to Facebook use. The mean level of FAD was significantly higher in inpatients with week depression than in inpatients with moderate depression. In the whole sample, FAD was significantly positively linked to duration of Facebook use and the personality trait narcissism. Present results provide first evidence of FAD in a non-student inpatient sample. They contribute to the understanding of the development of FAD and demonstrate that addictive Facebook use may impact persons who suffer from mental disorders, especially when they have enhanced levels of the personality trait narcissism. Practical applications for research and clinical treatment, as well as limitations of present results are discussed.

Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-10 in mood disorders: A population-based study,"Objective: The aim of this study was to assess if cytokines levels (IL-6 and IL-10) are related to major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), in a population-based study. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study population-based, involving 1037 people aged 18–35. MDD, BD, anxiety and suicide risk were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Serum IL-6 and IL-10 were measured by ELISA using a commercial kit. Results: The total sample comprised 1034 young adults, being 14.4% with MDD and 13.7% with BD. MDD and BD groups showed significantly higher serum IL-6 levels ( p ≤ 0.001) and IL-10 levels ( p ≤ 0.001) when compared to healthy control group. No correlation was found between serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels in health control group ( p = 0.830; r = − 0.008), non-suicide risk ( p = 0.337; r = 0.032) and non-anxiety disorder ( p = 0.375; r = 0.031). Covariance analysis showed that mood disorders alone, increase both interleukin levels (IL-6, p = 0.019; and IL-10, p = 0.026), whilst the interaction of mood disorders and suicide risk or anxiety disorders did not. Conclusion: Our results suggest that inflammatory dysregulation may be involved in the physiopathology of mood disorders and serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels are putative biomarkers for these disorders.

Increased psychiatric symptoms in university students with autism spectrum disorder are associated with reduced adaptive behavior,"High variability in adaptive behavior in cognitively-able adults with autism spectrum disorder has been previously reported, and may be caused by the high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in this population. This study's goals were to examine self-reported psychiatric symptoms in students with ASD, and to identify their relative contribution to the variance in adaptive behaviors. The study population included 95 students: 55 diagnosed with ASD (4 females; age range 18–34) who participated in a university integration program (ASD group), and 40 regularly matriculated students (non-ASD group, 7 females; age range 20–36). The ASD group showed a lower adaptive skill level than the non-ASD group as measured by the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (GAC-ABAS). Significantly higher scores for the ASD group were found for social anxiety, trait anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression symptoms. The level of adaptive skills correlated negatively and significantly with the severity of social anxiety symptoms in both groups and with severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms only in the ASD group. Additionally, in a regression model, significant contributions of having an ASD diagnosis and severity of social anxiety explained 41.7% of the variance in adaptive skills. Adequate evaluation and treatment, if needed, are recommended in this population.

An examination of the association between anxiety and social functioning in youth with ADHD: A systematic review,"Although up to 50% of children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) meet criteria for an anxiety disorder, it is unclear how comorbid anxiety influences social functioning for this population. Understanding the factors associated with social functioning in ADHD is important given the limited efficacy of existing social skills interventions for this population. This systematic review aimed to determine the association between anxiety and social functioning (social problems, peer status, and social skills/ competence) in children and adolescents with ADHD. A standardised search protocol was used, identifying 4807 articles for screening with 31 included in the final review. Anxiety symptom severity was associated with lower levels of social skills and higher levels of social problems in young people with ADHD. However, few differences emerged when defining anxiety based on diagnostic measures. Although the results varied considerably amongst studies, a number of key variables emerged that influenced the associations between anxiety and social functioning including the type of reporter and sample characteristics such as age, sex, ADHD subtype and other mental health comorbidities. These findings have implications for social functioning interventions in ADHD given the role of anxiety symptoms in predicting poorer social functioning.

Interactive effect of sleep duration and physical activity on anxiety/depression in adolescents,"Although effects of sleep duration and physical activity (PA) have been demonstrated on mental health in adolescents, their interactive effect has not been studied. This cross-sectional study first examines this interactive effect on anxiety/depression in adolescents. A total of 983 Japanese students aged 12—17 were studied, using a self-report questionnaire. The interaction of sleep duration and amount of PA and their main effects on anxiety/depression, assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), were investigated employing multiple regression, adjusting for grade and sex. Sleep duration and amount of PA were classified as being adequate or not, according to the duration and amount recommended by the National Sleep Foundation and World Health Organization, respectively. As a result, the interaction between sleep duration and amount of PA and their main effects were statistically significant. GHQ-12 score was significantly better in adolescents with either adequate sleep or adequate PA, not both, than those with neither adequate sleep nor adequate PA. The score, however, seemed no further improved in those with both adequate sleep and PA. The present study suggests that effects of sleep and PA on mental health need to be studied with consideration to their interaction.

Coping resources and stress reactions among Bedouin Arab adolescents during three military operations,"This study aimed to examine coping resources (sense of coherence and hope) and stress reactions among Bedouin Arab adolescents in southern Israel during three periods of escalated political violence. Two main questions were examined: 1) Did adolescents report different coping resources and levels of stress reactions during these three different periods? 2) Were there any differences in the pattern of the associations between coping resources and stress reactions across those periods? Data were gathered from 81, 91, and 192 Bedouin Arab adolescents, who were 14–18 years old, during three periods. Participants completed self-report questionnaires including the sense of coherence (SOC) scale, a hope index, a measure or state anxiety and state anger, a measure of psychological distress, and a demographic questionnaire. Across the three periods, differences were observed in both coping resources and levels of stress reactions. Over time, SOC was found to be a significant predictor of those stress reactions; whereas the association between hope components and stress reactions weakened over time. These findings support the hypothesis that SOC is a significant component of coping with stressful political events and emphasize the importance of addressing differences in the roles of personal resources over time and transition processes.

Attachment avoidance and fearful prosodic emotion recognition predict depression maintenance,"Insecure attachment cognitions, emotion recognition biases, and their interaction are important contributors to depression susceptibility. The present study, with a prospective longitudinal design, investigated the role of negative emotion recognition in moderating the linkage from insecure attachment cognitions to elevated depressive symptoms. A sample of 96 depression-prone individuals completed measures for attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance, depression symptom severity, and a computerized facial and prosodic emotion recognition task twice with a four-week interval. Results revealed that the interaction between attachment avoidance and fearful prosodic emotion recognition significantly predicted subsequent depressive symptoms. More specifically, greater attachment avoidance with lower accuracy of fearful prosodic emotions at baseline predicted an increase of depressive symptoms over four-week interval. However, no moderating role of emotion recognition in the linkage from attachment anxiety to depression persistence was noted. The present study demonstrates that attachment avoidance and negative emotion recognition may together contribute to the maintenance of depression. The findings may be pertinent to attachment avoidance-related deactivating strategy that appears to be a specific cultural forbearance way for emotion regulation in collectivistic societies. Potential applications and future research are then suggested.

An epidemiological study on the prevalence of hallucinations in a general-population sample: Effects of age and sensory modality,"Epidemiological studies have repeatedly shown that a significant minority of the general population have experienced hallucinations, however, a potential effect of age on the prevalence of hallucinations in the general population has never been previously examined in a specific study. The aim of the present study was thus to examine the effects of age and sensory modality on hallucination prevalence in a general population sample. A large, randomly selected and representative sample of the Norwegian population completed measures assessing different hallucination modalities (auditory, visual, olfactory, and tactile) and types (sensed presence and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations). Three age groups were identified and compared: young (19–30 years), middle (31–60) and old (61–96). There was a significant main-effect of age for all hallucination modalities and types, whereby hallucination prevalence significantly decreased with age. We also found that anxiety partially mediated the effect of age on hallucinations whilst depression was a partial suppressor. Concerning the co-occurrence of hallucination modalities, there was very little co-occurrence of auditory and visual hallucinations in all three age groups. In summary, a main-effect of age for hallucination prevalence was observed. Furthermore, individuals reported a more diverse variety of hallucination modalities compared to what is commonly reported in clinical populations.

Psychometric properties of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) in a large representative sample of Finnish adolescents,"Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are common among adolescents and can lead to severe psychosocial impairment, yet there is a lack of a good quality scale to measure symptoms of generalized anxiety in young people. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) is a self-report scale used to measure GAD symptoms and has been validated in adult populations, but the measure's psychometric properties regarding adolescents are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability, factorial validity, and construct validity of the GAD-7 in adolescents in a nationally representative sample from a general population. Our study was based on Finnish survey data on 111,171 adolescents aged 14–18 years. Our results show that the GAD-7 demonstrates good psychometric properties in adolescents. The internal consistency of the GAD-7 was good (Cronbach's α = 0.91) and the instrument's unidimensional factor structure was supported. The associations of GAD-7 sum scores with self-report measures of depression and social anxiety supported construct validity. The psychometric properties of the GAD-7 in this sample of adolescents were similar to those reported among adults. However, studies in which diagnostic interviews are performed are needed to demonstrate the diagnostic efficacy of the measure in this age group.

Effectiveness of psychoanalysis and long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy on personality and social functioning 10 years after start of treatment,"The evidence on potentially greater benefits of psychoanalysis (PA) vs. long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (LPP) is scarce. This study compared the effectiveness of PA and LPP on personality and social functioning during a 10-year follow-up from the beginning of the treatments. The eligible patients, 41 self-selected for PA and 128 assigned to LPP, were 20–45 years of age and had anxiety or mood disorder. Outcomes were analyzed using ten standard measures of personality and social functioning, carried out 5–9 times during the follow-up. Different change patterns by time in PA and LPP emerged, suggesting less benefit of PA during the first years of follow-up and more benefit in most outcomes thereafter. Greater post-treatment improvement in PA than in LPP was seen up to 1–2 years after PA had ended in more mature defense style (DSQ), level of personality organization (LPO), more positive self-concept (SASB), more improved social adjustment (SAS-SR) and sense of coherence (SOC). However, at the 10-year follow-up the differences were non-significant. In conclusion, PA may give some additional benefits when long-term aims are linked to personality and social functioning. The relatively small differences and higher costs in comparison to LPP may restrict the feasibility of PA.

Exploration of NO₂ and PM &lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; air pollution and mental health problems using high-resolution data in London-based children from a UK longitudinal cohort study,"Air pollution is a worldwide environmental health issue. Increasingly, reports suggest that poor air quality may be associated with mental health problems, but these studies often use global measures and rarely focus on early development when psychopathology commonly emerges. To address this, we combined high-resolution air pollution exposure estimates and prospectively-collected phenotypic data to explore concurrent and longitudinal associations between air pollutants of major concern in urban areas and mental health problems in childhood and adolescence. Exploratory analyses were conducted on 284 London-based children from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study. Exposure to annualized PM 2.5 and NO₂ concentrations was estimated at address-level when children were aged 12. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, conduct disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder were assessed at ages 12 and 18. Psychiatric diagnoses were ascertained from interviews with the participants at age 18. We found no associations between age-12 pollution exposure and concurrent mental health problems. However, age-12 pollution estimates were significantly associated with increased odds of major depressive disorder at age 18, even after controlling for common risk factors. This study demonstrates the potential utility of incorporating high-resolution pollution estimates into large epidemiological cohorts to robustly investigate associations between air pollution and youth mental health.

Stress reactivity in healthy child offspring of parents with anxiety disorders,"Several studies suggest that anxiety disorders (AD) involve dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and hypothalamic-pituitary (HPA) axis. However, it is unknown if alterations in these biological systems are premorbid markers of AD risk or a state-dependent feature of anxiety. This study examined ANS and HPA-axis response to a laboratory stressor in healthy child offspring of parents with ( n = 55) and without ( n = 98) a history of AD. High frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) was assessed during sitting and standing baseline conditions and during a speech task where participants remained standing. Salivary cortisol was measured at baseline and at 15, 30, 45 and 60 min post-speech. Subjective anxiety was assessed with a visual analogue scale. Children of parents with AD displayed reduced HRV and a blunted cortisol response to the speech task compared to children of non-anxious parents. No risk group effect was found for anxiety ratings. These preliminary data suggest that healthy children of anxious parents exhibit altered stress reactivity to an acute laboratory stressor. Further research is needed to confirm findings and identify mechanisms that may account for altered self-regulation processes to a stressor in children at familial risk for AD.

"An exploration of the associations among positivity, general distress and internet addiction: The mediating effect of general distress","The aim of the present study was to examine the relationships between positivity and general distress (including depression, anxiety, stress) and internet addiction and the mediating effects of general distress. The theoretical model was examined with 392 volunteers who were university students. Participants filled out the Positivity Scale (POS), Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS) and Short Form of Young's Internet Addiction Test (YIAT-SF). The results revealed that there were significant associations among positivity, general distress and internet addiction. According to the results of mediation analysis using structural equation modelling and bootstrapping, depression fully mediated the positivity-internet addiction relationship, whilst anxiety and stress partially mediated it. Bootstrap analysis indicated that positivity exerted a significant indirect effect on internet addiction through depression. Overall, the results implied the potential therapeutic effect of positivity which leads to a direct decrease in general distress and an indirect decrease in internet addiction through general distress. In addition, internet addiction may be considered as a secondary problem rather than a primary disorder. The results provide opportunities to design psychological interventions focused on improving positivity which may lead to a decrease in general distress which involves a mechanism preventing individuals from applying a positive reinforcement process.

The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio in adolescent obsessive-compulsive disorder: Does comorbid anxiety disorder affect inflammatory response?,"Recent adult etiologic studies indicated evidence linking increased inflammatory parameters with psychiatric disorders. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio are easily obtainable clinical markers of inflammation and have been found to be increased in various medical and mental disorders. In this study, we aimed to investigate the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio in adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Secondarily, the effect of comorbid anxiety disorder with OCD on the inflammatory response was investigated. Sixty drug-naïve adolescents with OCD aged 12 to 18 years were enrolled in the patient group. Twenty-three of the OCD group had comorbid anxiety disorder (AD) and 37 had no comorbidities. One hundred twenty-eight adolescents in the same age range with no psychiatric disorders were recruited as the healthy control group. The severity of OCD symptoms was evaluated using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. There were statistically significant differences in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, white blood cell, neutrophil, and platelet counts among the three groups, even after adjusting for age and sex. The adolescents with OCD and AD had the highest neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and white blood cell counts. A comorbid anxiety disorder diagnosis in addition to obsessive-compulsive disorder may increase the inflammatory response.

Temporal trends of co-diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety among female maternal and non-maternal hospitalizations: Results from Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2004–2013,"Perinatal depression/anxiety is considered the most underdiagnosed pregnancy complication in the US and is associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes. However, despite its prevalence, most women who present with depressive symptoms are not screened and do not receive adequate treatment. We examined the clinical co-diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety among maternal and non-maternal hospitalizations among females aged 14–49 from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) between 2004 and 2013 ( n = 83,472,775). Meta-regression was used to determine annual change and presence of temporal trends. Survey logistic regression was used to examine the association with sociodemographic factors. Rates of diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety disorders demonstrated a temporal increase from 2004–2013, and this increase was mainly driven by non-maternal hospitalizations compared to maternal. Furthermore, non-maternal hospitalizations demonstrated a greater prevalence of depression and/or anxiety diagnoses compared to maternal hospitalizations over the same time period (21•7% versus 2•8%). Among all female hospitalizations, whites were roughly twice as likely as minorities to have a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. These results add to the evidence suggestive of the underdiagnosed depression/anxiety present among women of reproductive age, particularly pregnant women and minorities, and underscore the critical role of obstetricians in treating both physical and mental health.

Social support moderates association between posttraumatic growth and trauma-related psychopathologies among victims of the Sewol Ferry Disaster,"Disasters have numerous harmful effects on the mental health status of trauma-exposed people. We investigated the differences in the association between trauma-related psychopathologies and posttraumatic growth according to the perceived social support level among victims of the Sewol Ferry disaster on April 16, 2014, in South Korea. Data from 241 bereaved family members, survivors, and family members of survivors were used. The Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire, Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, PTSD Checklist-5, Posttraumatic Embitterment Disorder Self-Rating Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 were used to evaluate perceived social support, posttraumatic growth, and trauma-related psychopathologies. We found that the severity of depression and anxiety showed inverse correlations with posttraumatic growth only in the low-social support group, while they did not demonstrate significant correlations in the high-social support group. The social support level had correlations with posttraumatic growth and the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder and posttraumatic embitterment disorder only in female respondents. Furthermore, there was a mediation pathway from social support level to posttraumatic growth through depressive symptoms. This study explored the complex relationship between social support, posttraumatic growth, trauma-related psychopathologies, and gender among trauma-exposed individuals in the aftermath of the Sewol Ferry disaster.

"Internet gaming disorder in male and female young adults: The role of alexithymia, depression, anxiety and gaming type","The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between alexithymia and Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) (while controlling for depression and anxiety), explore the presence of gender differences, and the potential differences between MOBA and MMORPG gamers. A total of 429 young adults (mean age 20.7 years) recruited from different forums dedicated to video games took part in the study and filled a questionnaire including type of video game use, the Game Addiction Scale, the TAS-20 (evaluating alexithymia) and the HADS (evaluation anxiety and depression). In the whole sample, being alexithymic, depression scores, and anxiety scores were associated with IGD. Nevertheless, results differed depending on gender and type of games played. In male gamers, being alexithymic, being young, and having high anxiety and depression scores was associated with IGD. In female gamers, having less than a high school education and a high depression score was associated with IGD. In MOBA gamers, only the difficulty describing feelings factor was associated with IGD while in MMORPGs gamers, graduation from high school and anxiety scores were associated with IGD. Playing MOBA games could be a strategy to regulate emotions while playing MMORPG appears to be a maladaptive coping strategy to deal with negative affective disturbances. Gender and gaming type are important factors in the relationship between alexithymia, depression, anxiety and IGD. These results have some interesting clinical implications, which are discussed.

Correlation between premature ejaculation and psychological disorders in 270 chinese outpatients,"Clinical patients with premature ejaculation(PE) often present with poor psychological state. This study investigated whether there is a difference in the psychological state of PE and non-PE in outpatients, and whether there is a correlation between ejaculatory latency and psychological disorders. We studied demographics informations and psychological indicators for PE patients and control group, including the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale(SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale(SDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and recorded the ejaculatory latency. We analyzed the relationship between PE and psychological disorders by the Pearson correlation and multifactorial logistic regression. There were significant differences in SAS(p &lt; 0.01) and SDS(p &lt; 0.05) scores between the PE and non-PE groups. However, Pearson correlation analysis showed that there was no correlation between ejaculatory latency and SDS. Multifactorial logistic regression analysis showed that anxiety(p &lt; 0.05) and sleep quality(p &lt; 0.05) were closely related to the attack of PE. The incidence of anxiety and depression in PE patients is high, anxiety is a risk factor of PE. Clinicians should pay close attention to the psychological state and sleep quality of patients with PE.

Does prolonged grief or suicide bereavement cause public stigma? A vignette-based experiment,"Prolonged grief disorder (PGD), characterized by severe, persistent and disabling grief, is newly included in the International Classification of Diseases 11 (ICD-11). Receiving a PGD diagnosis could lead to stigmatizing public reactions (i.e. public stigma), yet research on this topic is limited. Additionally, while there is evidence that experiencing suicide bereavement causes public stigma, no studies to date have investigated the interaction between PGD and cause of death on public stigma. To fill these knowledge gaps, this experimental study tested if a PGD diagnosis (vs. no diagnosis) and experiencing suicide bereavement (vs. homicide and natural loss) cause public stigma. Three hundred and seventeen adults from the general population were randomly assigned to read one of 6 different vignettes of a person with and without PGD who had lost a spouse through a suicide, homicide or a stroke. After reading a vignette, negative attributions, emotional reactions, and desire for social distance were assessed. Notably, only persons with PGD were attributed relatively more negative characteristics, and elicited more anger, anxiety and pro-social emotions, and a larger preferred social distance in participants. This study supports the claim that PGD causes public stigma, but nuances claims that suicide bereavement induces public stigma.

"Affect and worry during a checking episode: A comparison of individuals with symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, body dysmorphic disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and panic disorder","Checking behavior (CB) occurs in a variety of disorders such as obsessive-compulsive (OCD), body dysmorphic (BDD), illness anxiety (IA), and panic disorder (PD), as well as anorexia (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). Etiological models of these disorders—with the exception of those for PD—postulate that CB mainly occurs in situations characterized by negative affect and serves to regulate it. We aimed to test these assumptions: N = 386 individuals with a self-reported diagnosis of one of the disorders rated their affect at baseline, directly before a remembered CB episode, during, immediately afterwards, and 15 and 60 minutes afterwards, and rated their endorsement of different functions of CB. The results show that transdiagnostically negative affect is significantly higher before CB compared to baseline, and is significantly reduced from before CB to all post-CB assessments. Reduction of negative affect and Attainment of certainty were the sole functions predicting the affective course during CB, and most prominently reported transdiagnostically. Assumptions of the etiological models were confirmed, suggesting that exposure and ritual prevention should be examined across disorders. As attainment of certainty seems to be predictive for the course of CB, this might be targeted in cognitive interventions.

"Internalizing symptoms and chronotype in youth: A longitudinal assessment of anxiety, depression and tripartite model","Biological rhythm theories highlight the reciprocal relations between dysregulated circadian patterns and internalizing psychopathology. Chronotype characterizes individuals’ diurnal preference, as some exhibit more morningness or eveningness. Previous research suggests that eveningness prospectively predicts depression in adolescence. Anxiety often co-occurs with depression, but little is known about longitudinal, reciprocal associations between chronotype and anxiety, and whether this relationship remains after controlling for depression. We assessed different forms of anxiety (social, panic, separation), positive/negative affect, anxious arousal (from tripartite theory), and depression, in relation to chronotype to better understand the specificity and directionality of associations between chronotype and internalizing problems in adolescence. Community youth participated in three assessment time points: T1, T2 (18-months post-T1), and T3 (30-months post-T1) as part of a larger longitudinal study. Youth completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, positive and negative affect, and chronotype. Regression analyses showed that eveningness: (1) concurrently associated with decreased separation anxiety, elevated symptoms of depression and low levels of positive affect, (2) was prospectively predicted by elevated depression, (3) did not predict later symptoms of anxiety. The reciprocal, prospective relationship between chronotype and internalizing psychopathology is specific to depression during adolescence.

What are the specificities of social cognition in schizophrenia? A cluster-analytic study comparing schizophrenia with the general population,"While social cognition (SC) is widely recognized as being impaired in schizophrenia, little is known about the potential heterogeneity in individuals’ functioning. Using a wide range of SC measures and a cluster-analytic approach, we compared SC profiles in the general population and in people with schizophrenia. A total of 131 healthy controls and 101 participants with schizophrenia were included. Groups were compared on sociodemographic, neurocognition, anxiety and depressive mood variables. Three profiles were identified in healthy controls: one with good SC abilities (Homogeneous SC group) and two with specific weaknesses in complex Facial Emotion Recognition (Low FER group) or Affective Theory of Mind (Low AToM group). However, these patterns were not found in participants with schizophrenia, who were characterized rather by levels of SC functioning (i.e., Low, Medium and High SC groups). Importantly, while the High SC group (47.9% of the sample) exhibited normal performances, the two others were underpinned by different pathological processes (i.e., alexithymia for Medium SC group or neurocognition dysfunctioning for Low SC group). These results have important implications for future research as well as for clinical practice regarding assessment methodology and therapeutic interventions.

Dysfunctional beliefs in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression as assessed with the Beliefs Questionnaire (BQ),"There is an ongoing debate about the specificity of dysfunctional beliefs in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as some of these beliefs seem to be relevant in depressed patients as well. The present study aimed to elucidate the specificity of dysfunctional beliefs using the newly developed Beliefs Questionnaire (BQ). A combination of an online assessment and clinical interviews was carried out. One hundred thirty OCD patients ( M = 38.7 years; 68% women) were compared to 85 patients with depression ( M = 36.6 years; 75% women) and 220 nonclinical controls ( M = 38.9 years; 71% women) on the BQ, which contains 13 items tapping cognitive beliefs. The BQ was validated against the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ). Patients with OCD and depression scored higher on the BQ compared to nonclinical controls. OCD patients displayed higher values on overestimation of threat and the fear of becoming insane. Correlation between BQ and OBQ total scores was high ( r = 0.751), supporting the validity of the new scale. Our results show that two beliefs are OCD-specific. However, the BQ covers mainly transdiagnostic features and should be replicated with the inclusion of an anxiety disorder sample.

Psychiatric and psychological follow-up of undergraduate and postgraduate medical students: Prevalence and associated factors. Results from the national BOURBON study,"Background: Physicians are at risk of burnout, anxiety and depression. Prevention is needed from the beginning of the medical studies to detect early poor mental health outcomes. Objective: To determine the prevalence and associated of psychiatric or psychological follow-up in a national sample of undergraduate and postgraduate medical students (UPMS). Methods: UPMS of the 35 French Medicine faculties were recruited through mailing lists and social networks between December 2016 and May 2017 and fulfilled Internet anonymised questionnaires. Results: Overall, 10,985 UPMS were included in the present study (2165 (19.7%) postgraduate, 31.6% males, mean aged 21.8 years). Overall, 1345 (12.2%) were followed-up by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist, 20.5% of them were regular anxiolytic consumers and 17.2% of them were regular antidepressant consumers. In multivariate analyses, being followed-up by a psychiatrist and/or psychologist was associated with older age (aOR = 1.2[1.2–1.2], p &lt; 0.0001), female gender (aOR = 0.5[0.5–0.7], p &lt; 0.0001), current alcohol use disorder (aOR = 1.3[1.3–1.5], p &lt; 0.0001), higher anxiolytic (aOR = 3.1[2.5–3.7], p &lt; 0.0001) and antidepressant (aOR = 11.7[7.6–18.0], p &lt; 0.0001) consumption, and with lower self-reported general health, social functioning and mental health quality of life (all aORs = 0.9, all p &lt; 0.05). The UPMS followed-up by psychiatrist and/or psychologist reported to have been more frequently exposed to sexual assault (5.1% vs. 0.9%, aOR = 2.5[1.3–4.7], p &lt; 0.0001), domestic violence (3.3% vs. 0.8% aOR = 2.1[1.2–4.0], p = 0.01) and parents divorce (11% vs. 6.4%, aOR = 1.5[1.2–1.9], p = 0.001). Students followed-up by a psychiatrist and/or psychologist reported more frequently to seek alleviating anxiety (aOR 1.9[1.6–2.3], p &lt; 0.0001), depression (aOR 1.7[1.3–2.1], p &lt; 0.0001), coping with studies difficulties (aOR 1.5[1.2–1.8], p &lt; 0.0001), experiencing more stress at hospital (aOR = 2.3[1.6–3.5], p &lt; 0.001) and more burnout syndrome (aOR = 1.4[1.1–1.8], p = 0.03). Conclusions: Around 12% of UPMS are followed-up by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist. These students reported higher antidepressant and anxiolytic consumption, psychic suffering and altered quality of life, associated with professional pressure and personal issues. Public health programs should be developed to help these students through their studies to prevent later mental /addictive issues and professional suffering. Improving UPMS mental health may also improve the later quality of care of their patients and global stress at hospital.

Difficulties in emotion regulation and suicide ideation and attempt in adolescent inpatients,"This study aimed to examine the concurrent relation between six dimensions of emotion dysregulation, proposed by Gratz and Roemer (2004), and suicide ideation and attempt in a large sample of psychiatric adolescent inpatients. A sample of 547 adolescent inpatients completed measures on dimensions of emotion dysregulation, psychiatric diagnoses, and suicidal ideation and attempt. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that limited access to emotion regulation strategies, difficulties in impulse control, and mood disorder diagnosis, were significantly associated with past year suicidal ideation, covarying for other emotion dysregulation subscales, anxiety and externalizing diagnoses, sex, and age. However, difficulties in impulse control was not significantly related to suicide ideation when analyses were conducted separately by sex. Binary logistic regressions also revealed that past year suicidal ideation uniquely and significantly associated with lifetime attempt, covarying for sociodemographics, psychiatric diagnoses, and all emotion dysregulation subscales; these results held when analyses were also conducted separately by sex. Results indicating an association between perceived limited emotion regulation strategies and suicide ideation are consistent with existing research and suicide-focused theory. This finding may have some tentative benefit to informing clinical assessment and treatment of suicidal thoughts. Other findings are discussed.

The mediating role of self-esteem on the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health in South American immigrants in Chile,"Psychological aspects in South-South migration have been little studied. The following study aimed to describe the effect of individual self-esteem as a mediator in the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health (understood as the presence of anxious and depressive symptomatology) in South American migrants in Chile. We surveyed 853 people, of Peruvian and Colombian nationality, residing in three cities (Arica, Antofagasta and Santiago). Three ad-hoc scales were applied to evaluate the study variables, analyzing the measurement models for each of them using the Confirmatory Factor Analysis method. Subsequently, the hypothesized mediation model is evaluated through Structural Equations (SEM). The results show that discrimination has a positive and direct relationship with both anxiety and depression, and that the effect of interaction between the variables of discrimination, self-esteem and symptoms associated with depression and anxiety, had a simple partial mediating effect. Discrimination would have a positive and minor effect on anxious and depressive symptoms, as it is mediated by self-esteem.

Intervention mechanism of repeated oral GABA administration on anxiety-like behaviors induced by emotional stress in rats,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanism of repeated oral administration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on anxiety-like behaviors induced by emotional stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups (8 rats each): control, emotional stress model, three emotional stress + GABA-treated groups (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg). The rats were given empty water bottles after the training of drinking water to induce emotional stress. Each group was treated with saline or different doses of GABA respectively for 21 consecutive days. Then open field and elevated plus maze were used to assess anxiety-like behaviors. Both frontal cortex and plasma NO metabolites nitrate and nitrite (NO x ) levels were determined spectrophotometrically. Results showed that oral administration of GABA significantly reversed the stress-induced anxiety-like negative responses dose-dependently. The frontal cortex NO x levels were lower in stressed rats than in control group ( P &lt; 0.05), but higher in 2 mg/kg GABA-treated group than stress model group ( P &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, NOx levels in plasma showed a gradual decline trend. Collectively, these results suggest that short repeated oral administration of GABA has an anxiolytic-like effect possibly via preventing NO reduction caused by stress and improving availability of NO in the frontal cortex.

This was a cross-sectional study involving 300 students of both sexes (20.5 ± 4.4 years) who were freshmen in a Brazilian public university. Eating behavior was evaluated using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, SC was identified by a yes/no question (“Have you had a very strong desire to eat sweet food over the last three months?”), and characterized by the Questionnaire for Assessment of Sweet Substance Dependence. Individuals with SC scored significantly higher for uncontrolled eating (UE), emotional eating (EE), and anxiety symptoms. Logistic regression analysis revealed that anxiety symptoms are independently associated with SC. In conclusion, negative emotions, like anxiety, and eating guided by these emotions can contribute to the SC phenomenon.

Self-reported asthma diagnosis and mental health: Findings from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys,"Historically, asthma has had a mixed association with mental health. More research is needed to examine the associations between asthma and specific psychiatric disorders, and whether these associations hold true across racial groups in the general population of the United States. Using the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys, we examined the associations between lifetime asthma and specific DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and smoking status. We found that when looking at the entire sample, self-reported diagnosis of asthma was associated with greater odds of reporting mood disorders (AOR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.05–1.74). Asthma was not significantly associated with total anxiety disorders (AOR 1.25; 95% CI: 0.98–1.60), though it was specifically associated with generalized anxiety disorder. Asthma was associated with greater odds of having alcohol use disorders (AOR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.24–2.37), but was not associated with total eating disorders (AOR:1.36; 95% CI: 1.17–2.51) (though it was significantly associated with higher odds for binge eating disorder, but lower odds of reporting bulimia). The strength and the significance of the associations between asthma and psychiatric disorders varied when stratified by race, underscoring the importance of examining race as a potential explanation for the mixed findings observed previously in the literature.

Validation of an interview-only version of the Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DY-BOCS) in treatment-seeking youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder,"There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be sub-typed along different symptom dimensions. These dimensions may help explain responsiveness to current treatments. The Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DY-BOCS) is a validated instrument involving a self-report screening tool followed by a structured interview in which the presence/absence and severity of OCD symptom dimensions are assessed and rated. The present study investigated the validity of a briefer, interview-only version of the DY-BOCS modified for use in routine care. Clinically-referred children and adolescents ( N = 119) with OCD were administered the DY-BOCS along with other measures of OCD, anxiety, depression, and overall functioning and a subset ( N = 100) were reassessed on average 14 months after initial assessment. This briefer, interview-only version of the DY-BOCS demonstrated high levels of internal consistency and correlated in the moderate to strong range with alternative measures of OCD severity and OCD symptom dimensions. Change scores on the DY-BOCS from baseline to follow-up were significantly correlated with change scores on the alternative measures of OCD and clinician-rated improvement, suggesting that this brief version of the DY-BOCS is valid and sensitive to the effects of treatment for OCD delivered in routine clinical care.

"The effect of discrimination on depression and anxiety symptoms and the buffering role of social capital among female domestic workers in Macao, China","Foreign migrant domestic workers experience an increased burden of mental disorders. Discrimination contributes to this burden. Social resources may buffer migrants from the effects of this discrimination. The present study explored the relationship between discrimination and common mental disorder (CMD) symptoms, anxiety and depression, and examined whether social capital (cognitive and structural) modified this association. A total of 131 female migrant Filipina domestic workers in Macao, China ( M age = 39.7) were sampled using snowball methods. Self-report data were obtained using tablet devices. Correlation analyses demonstrated that discrimination was significantly associated with depression ( r s = 0.43) and anxiety ( r s = 0.42). Mulitvariable regressions showed that cognitive, but not structural, social capital was significantly negatively associated with depression (β = −0.30) and anxiety (β = −0.32). Cognitive social capital modified the association between discrimination and depression (β = 0.39) and anxiety (β = 0.53). Contrary to predictions, as discrimination increased, compared to those with no cognitive social capital, those with moderate or high levels of cognitive social capital experienced worsening CMD symptoms. This finding provides greater nuance to our understanding of how and under what circumstances social resources are protective for mental health for migrant workers.

How does self-esteem affect mobile phone addiction? The mediating role of social anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity,"Low self-esteem is an important factor influencing mobile phone addiction, which has been well documented. However, little research focused on the mechanism underlying the association between self-esteem and mobile phone addiction. We hypothesized that social anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity may mediate the relationship between self-esteem and mobile phone addiction. Six hundred and fifty three (353 girls among them) college students with the mean age of 19.94 (SD = 1.34) were recruited for the study. Participants completed mobile phone addiction scale, Rosenberg self-esteem scale, the social anxiety questionnaire and interpersonal sensitivity subscale of SCL-90. The findings were as follows: 1) interpersonal sensitivity mediated the relation between self-esteem and mobile phone addiction. 2) social anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity sequentially mediated the relation between self-esteem and mobile phone addiction. The result reveals that self-esteem has indirect effect on mobile phone addiction, which is mediated by social anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity.

The clinical sample consisted of 825 patients who, as part of treatment, were offered 16 sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy. The cohort was allocated to two subsamples based on whether interpreters were used in psychotherapy or not and the treatment outcome for the two subsamples was compared. The primary outcome measure was severity of PTSD-symptoms (Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ)) and secondary outcome measures were depression and anxiety symptoms (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), Hamilton Depression and Anxiety rating scales (HAM-D, HAM-A)), somatisation (somatisation items of SCL-90 (SI-SCL-90)), quality of life (WHO-5-Well-being Index (WHO-5)) and functioning (Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF-F, GAF-S)). Compared to no use of interpreter, the use of interpreter in psychotherapy was associated with less improvement during treatment on the primary outcome measure HTQ and the secondary outcome measures HSCL-25, SI-SCL-90, SDS, WHO-5, HAM-A, but not on GAF-S, GAF-F and HAM-D. Based on the primary outcome measure HTQ and the majority of the secondary ratings the subsample in interpreter-mediated psychotherapy had less improvement in their mental health status compared to the subsample without interpreter.

Withdrawal from chronic treatment with methamphetamine induces anxiety and depression-like behavior in mice,"Methamphetamine (METH) is an illicit psychostimulant that is widely abused. After producing extreme pleasure, METH abuse leads to negative emotional states during withdrawal in clinical survey. However, the mood behavioral consequences of withdrawal from chronic METH exposure in animal experiments and related mechanisms have not been clarified yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the anxiety and depression-like phenotype in mice induced by withdrawal from chronic METH treatment and the potential molecular mechanism. We found that withdrawal from chronic METH treatment increased the immobility time during the forced swimming test and decreased central activities in open field test, indicating increased anxiety and depression-like behavior. Additional experiments showed that expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated tropomyosin receptor kinase B (p-TrkB), phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB) were decreased in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice in METH group and the level of mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) was increased. Combined, our data show that withdrawal from chronic METH exposure induces anxiety and depression-like behavior associated with aberrant changes of proteins in BDNF-ERK-CREB pathway, providing new evidence for the involvement of BDNF pathway in the negative emotional states induced by withdrawal from METH.

"The roles of cognitive avoidance, rumination and negative affect in the association between abusive supervision in the workplace and non-clinical paranoia in a sample of workers working in France","This study examined the relationship between abusive supervision and non-clinical paranoia and explored which cognitive mechanisms are mediating this association (i.e. rumination, cognitive avoidance and negative affect). A sample of two hundred and five French-speaking workers currently in employment in France was recruited to fill in a battery of online questionnaires comprising of the French adaptations of the Abusive Supervision Scale, the State Social Paranoia Scales, the Depression and Anxiety and Stress Scales, the Cognitive Avoidance Questionnaire and the Mini-Cambridge Exeter Repetitive Thought Scale. Mediation analyses showed that the experience of supervisory abuse directly influences state paranoia, however, there were significant mediation effects. Abusive supervision impacted on cognitive avoidance that led to more rumination, which in its turn increased negative affect and this increased state paranoia. Rumination impacted on state paranoia but through the effect of negative affect only. This study showed that abusive supervision works together with cognitive and affective factors to impact on non-clinical paranoia. It is recommended that Cognitive and Behavioural therapy (CBT) is tailored to help workers to cope with experiences of supervisory abuse and associated paranoid thoughts by focusing on replacing rumination and cognitive avoidance strategies for more adaptive cognitive strategies and on how to manage depression.

Randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioural therapy for depressive and anxiety symptoms in Chinese women with breast cancer,"Depressive and anxiety symptoms are frequently observed in breast cancer survivors. To date, few randomized controlled trials have been conducted on the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for depressive and anxiety symptoms in Chinese population. This study aims to verify the efficacy of CBT in Chinese breast cancer survivors. Women ( n = 392) with breast cancer were randomly assigned to 3 groups: CBT ( n = 98), self-care management (SCM, n = 98), and usual care (UC, n = 196) using the proportion 1:1:2. Women in the CBT and SCM groups received a series of nine sessions for 12 weeks, while women in the UC group received their usual medical care only. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score at baseline, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks. A significant intergroup difference was found in the HAMD and HAMA scores. Women in the CBT group showed significantly less depressive and anxiety symptoms compared with women in the SCM and UC groups over time. In conclusion, this study supports the efficacy of CBT for depressive and anxiety symptoms in Chinese breast cancer survivors.

The role of childhood emotional maltreatment and body image dissatisfaction in problematic smartphone use among adolescents,"Growing empirical evidence has identified specific psychological and contextual risk factors associated with problematic smartphone use (PSU). However, the potential direct and indirect impact of childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM) on PSU remains largely unexplored, despite the established role of CEM in the onset of other excessive, problematic, and addictive behaviors. Consequently, the purpose of the present study was to test the direct and indirect relationships of emotional abuse and neglect (two facets of CEM) with PSU via specific mediational pathways including body image dissatisfaction (BID), social anxiety, and depression. The sample comprised 443 adolescents who completed a questionnaire that included assessment tools of aforementioned variables. Multiple mediation model results indicated that CEM was directly and indirectly associated with PSU via BID, depression, BID-related depression, and BID-related social anxiety. Results suggested that emotionally traumatic experiences were associated with PSU in adolescents and that this relationship may partially be explained by BID and psychosocial risk factors. The present study draws caution to the amplifying roles of CEM and BID on increased PSU. The results of the study have important clinical and public health implications, but additional research is needed before interventions can be developed and implemented on the basis of present results.

"Time to think: Subjective sleep quality, trait anxiety and university start time","Poor quality sleep is related to mental health and there is increasing interest in student wellbeing and mental health. The aim of the current study was to evaluate sleep quality, daytime dozing, anxiety proneness, chronotype and preferred start time in a sample of university students. A total of 546 university students (age range, 18–55) from two university located in South East England were included and completed an online survey. Participants’ self-reported age, gender, year and field of study. Sleep quality, anxiety, daytime dozing, coffee/caffeine/tobacco use (coded as binary variables), preferred start time and chronotype were also recorded. Data were analysed using independent samples t -tests, chi-square, simple mediation-analyses and Analysis of Variance. Across the entire sample 46% percent of participants rated their sleep as fairly bad or very bad. Poor quality sleep was associated with significantly higher levels of anxiety which was not mediated by chronotype. Poor quality sleep is more prevalent in the first year of university and our sample endorsed a start time for university activities approximately 2 h later than currently timetabled. The current findings demonstrate that a large proportion of students are chronically sleep deprived, obtaining, on average, less than 7 h sleep per night on week days and this was more marked in first year students. In addition, we show that poor sleep is associated with increased anxiety. Based on the current evidence the authors suggest a review of current university timetabling and examination scheduling merits immediate consideration by policy makers and educators.

Meaning in life buffers the association between clinical anxiety and global maladjustment in participants with common mental disorders on sick leave,"An important goal of mental health specialists is to improve the quality of life and the adaptation of people with common mental disorders on sick leave. Meaning in life is a protective factor for people adjusting to distress and negative events. This study explores the buffering role of meaning in life in the relationship between clinical anxiety or negative affect and maladjustment in participants with common mental disorders on sick leave. The sample was 167 participants with Adjustment, Anxiety and, Depressive Disorders; n = 115 were women and n = 52 men. Participants’ mean age M = 42.16 ( SD = 9.91) years. We performed zero-order correlations and hierarchical regression analyses. Meaning in life moderated and buffered the association between clinical anxiety or negative affect and global maladjustment to daily life. These findings suggest that Meaning in life is a relevant variable in the adjustment of common mental disorders on sick leave.

"The impact of depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and severity of internet addiction symptoms on the relationship between probable ADHD and severity of insomnia among young adults","The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and severity of Internet addiction symptoms (IAS) on the relationship between probable attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and severity of insomnia among young adults. The study was conducted with online survey among 1010 volunteered university students in Ankara, people who are in the e-mail database of a company located in Istanbul that organizes e-sports tournaments and Turkish gamers from gaming forums. Scale scores were higher among the group with high probability of insomnia ( n = 200, 19.8%). Also risk of high probability of insomnia was 2.7 times higher among those with probable ADHD. In linear regression analysis, both inattentiveness and hyperactivity/impulsivity dimensions of ADHD were related with the severity of insomnia, together with severities of anxiety, depression, neuroticism and IAS. Similarly, presence of probable ADHD was related with the severity of insomnia in ANCOVA, together with severities of anxiety, depression, neuroticism and IAS. These findings suggest that the presence of probable ADHD and the severity of ADHD symptoms are related with the severity of insomnia, even after controlling the depression, anxiety, neuroticism and IAS, which are all related with the severity of insomnia, among young adults.

The roles of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in predicting treatment remission in a Chinese Han population with generalized anxiety disorder,"Neurotrophic factors, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), are involved in neuroplasticity in the nervous system. To explore the characteristics of BDNF and GDNF and their roles in predicting treatment remission in a Chinese Han population with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), 85 GAD patients were treated with escitalopram or venlafaxine randomly for 8 weeks. The serum BDNF/GDNF levels were detected, while Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) scores were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. The differences in serum BDNF/GDNF levels between GAD patients ( n = 85) and healthy controls ( n = 73) and between remission and nonremission were then compared. The serum BDNF levels were lower in GAD patients (1197.24 ± 367.41 µg/L) than in healthy controls (1378.09 ± 382.46 µg/L) ( P &lt; 0.05). The serum GDNF levels were also lower in GAD patients (10.19 ± 9.86 µg/L) than in healthy controls (13.73 ± 9.44 µg/L) ( P &lt; 0.05). The BDNF level was negatively correlated with baseline HAMA score ( P &lt; 0.05). The GDNF level was negatively correlated with baseline HAMA score ( P &lt; 0.05). The BDNF level was positively correlated with GDNF level ( P &lt; 0.05). Both baseline BDNF/GDNF levels in remission and nonremission showed no statistically significant differences. No significant correlation was found between baseline BDNF level and the HAMA reduction rate or between baseline GDNF levels and the HAMA reduction rate. Both serum BDNF and GDNF were demonstrated to be potential biomarkers of GAD, it seems that serum BDNF and GDNF levels can be used to assess the baseline anxiety severity of GAD but cannot serve as a factor to predict treatment remission.

Relationship between quality of life in young adults and impulsivity/compulsivity,"Impulsive and compulsive symptoms often become apparent during young adulthood, which is a critical time for brain development and establishment of life goals. The aim of this study was to identify important associations with quality of life in young adults, across a range of clinical, questionnaire, and cognitive measures, focusing on impulsivity and compulsivity. Significant relationships between exploratory variables and quality of life were identified using Partial Least Squares (PLS). In the 479 participants (mean age 22.3 [SD 3.6] years), quality of life was best explained by a one-factor model (p &lt; 0.001). Variables significantly associated with lower quality of life were: older age, greater alcohol consumption, and the presence of impulse control disorders (including gambling, compulsive buying, intermittent explosive disorder, compulsive sexual behavior, binge-eating, and skin picking), mood/anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorder. Worse quality of life was also significantly explained by higher impulsiveness on the Barratt scale, and by relative impairments in extra-dimensional set-shifting and quality of decision-making. These findings suggest that impulse disorders merit more public health attention, especially problematic gambling. Performance on decision-making and set-shifting tasks also appears particularly important in understanding quality of life in young adults.

"Sleep-wake, cognitive and clinical correlates of treatment outcome with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for young adults with depression","The utility of key phenotypes of depression in predicting response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), namely sleep-wake behaviour, cognition and illness chronicity, has been understudied and not been extended to young samples. This study aimed to determine whether sleep-wake disturbance, cognition or depression chronicity are associated with rTMS outcome in young depressed adults. Sixteen depressed young adults diagnosed with mood disorders (aged 18–29 years) completed this open-label study. Neuronavigationally targeted high-frequency rTMS was administered at 110% of motor threshold on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 20 sessions over 4 weeks. Clinical, sleep-wake and cognitive assessments were undertaken pre- and post-treatment. Repeated-measures and correlational analyses determined pre- and post-treatment changes and predictors of treatment outcome. rTMS significantly reduced depression and anxiety. Better cognitive flexibility, verbal learning, later age of onset and greater number of depressive episodes were associated with better treatment outcome. There were no other significant/trend-level associations. rTMS had no effect on sleep-wake or cognitive measures. We provide the first evidence for the utility of cognitive flexibility and verbal learning in predicting rTMS outcome in depressed young adults. This research provides preliminary support for rTMS as an early intervention for depression and supports the need for sham-controlled trials.

"Impact of physical or sexual childhood abuse on plasma DHEA, DHEA-S and cortisol in a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test and on cardiovascular risk parameters in adult patients with major depression or anxiety disorders","While the impact of childhood trauma on basal and dynamic cortisol regulation has widely been studied, the most abundant steroid hormones dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphated derivative DHEA-S have received little attention in this context. One-hundred in-door patients suffering from major depression or an anxiety disorder filled in the Childhood Trauma Questionaire. A low dose dexamethasone suppression test (DST) measuring DHEA, DHEA-S and cortisol was performed. Furthermore, various cardiovascular risk parameters were measured. Forty-six percent of the patients reported a history of substantial physical or sexual childhood abuse. However, no significant differences in plasma DHEA or DHEA-S emerged in the DST between the traumatised group and the remaining patients. Basal plasma cortisol was significantly lower in the childhood trauma group. No impact of childhood trauma history on cardiovascular risk factor profile was detected. Current limited data about DHEA or DHEA-S in patients with childhood trauma are equivocal. Further study using more sophisticated assessment of trauma history and simultaneously measuring a multitude of putative biomarkers of traumatization are needed.

Psychological and electrophysiological indices of inattention in hoarding,"Individuals with elevated hoarding symptoms report elevated symptoms of ADHD and these symptoms are related to impaired daily functioning. Neuropsychological studies have found specific deficits in attention, and a recent review of attentional data from numerous hoarding studies concluded that inattention likely represents an etiological factor in hoarding, rather than a comorbidity. Our study aimed to examine which symptoms of ADHD, inattention or hyperactivity, are related to hoarding symptom severity, and whether individuals with hoarding symptoms display a neurophysiological marker of poor attention (Theta/Beta Ratio; THBR) that might explain these associations. The THBR indexes theta power relative to beta power in the frontal cortex and is often atypical in individuals with ADHD. We hypothesised that individuals would report more severe problems with inattention and would exhibit an elevated theta/beta ratio relative to a healthy control group. We also predicted that any relationship between hoarding and inattention would be independent of anxiety and depression symptoms. 17 hoarding-symptomatic participants and 16 healthy control participants completed self-report measures relating to ADHD, hoarding and general psychopathology, and then underwent resting measures of electroencephalography (EEG). Individuals with hoarding symptoms reported greater difficulties with inattention and hyperactivity, however they did not exhibit an elevated theta/beta ratio. When taking into account recent anxiety and depression, only inattention predicted hoarding symptom severity. Further investigations may help clarify this association and help inform attention-based treatments for hoarding.

"Expressed emotion, emotional distress, and individual and familial history of affective disorder among parents of adolescents with bipolar disorder","Parental expressed emotion (EE) attitudes are important prognostic indicators in the course of bipolar disorder (BD) in adolescents and adults. This study examined the hypothesis that parents’ own susceptibility to affective disturbances contributes to their likelihood of high-EE attitudes. We examined past-week levels of emotional distress, lifetime affective diagnoses, and family histories of affective disorder among high- and low-EE parents of 86 adolescents with bipolar I or II disorder who were recovering from an episode of depression or (hypo) mania. High EE parents endorsed higher concurrent levels of depression, anxiety, and anger/hostility than low EE parents, and reported a greater familial history of depression and BD. No differences between high and low EE parents were found in concurrent levels of interpersonal sensitivity, lifetime rates of affective disorders, or familial loading of anxiety disorder. Parents’ distress at the time of the EE assessment was the strongest correlate of EE. The results suggest that susceptibility to affective psychopathology may be an important contributor to the development of EE attitudes among parents of adolescents with BD.

Mindful attention moderating the effect of experiential avoidance in terms of mental health among Latinos in a federally qualified health center,"The present study examined the moderating role of mindful attention in the relation between experiential avoidance and anxious arousal, social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and the number of mood and anxiety disorders among a sample of Latinos seeking health services at a primary care facility. Participants included 326 adult Latinos ( M age = 39.79 years, SD = 11.27; 88.9% female; 98.2% used Spanish as their first language). Results provided empirical evidence of an interaction between mindful attention and experiential avoidance for anxious arousal, social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and the number of mood and anxiety disorders in the studied sample. Specifically, among Latinos with lower (vs higher) levels of mindfulness, greater experiential avoidance was related to greater anxiety/depressive symptoms and number of mood and anxiety disorders. Together, these data provide novel empirical evidence of the clinically relevant interplay between mindful attention and experiential avoidance regarding a relatively wide array of negative emotional symptoms and disorders among Latino primary care patients. Limitations of the study include a largely female sample and cross-sectional data.

On continuum beliefs and psychiatric stigma: Similarity to a person with schizophrenia can feel too close for comfort,"Continuum belief interventions that blur boundaries between “normal” individuals and individuals with psychiatric problems have shown promise in reducing psychiatric stigma. Interventions to date have afforded participants considerable psychological distance from individuals with mental illness. An intervention that compels psychological closeness to individuals with mental illness may lead to increased anxiety/threat and an attenuated intervention effect on stigma. In a randomized experiment, one hundred thirty-five participants listened to a bogus interview involving an ostensible person with schizophrenia who shared numerous characteristics in common with participants. In the interview, the target person (1) did not verbally broach issues of similarity to “normal” people, (2) endorsed a continuum view, or (3) endorsed a categorical view. Participants then read a bogus research article on schizophrenia that (1) was agnostic with respect to the continuum/categorical distinction, (2) attested to a continuum view, or (3) attested to a categorical view. Correlational analyses demonstrated that greater endorsement of continuum beliefs predicted less stigma. Experimental analyses demonstrated that the continuum intervention had no effect on stigma. The continuum intervention increased participants’ feelings of anxiety/threat, measured via self-report and a lexical decision task. These findings might usefully inform the design of stigma reduction programming centered on continuum beliefs.

Does mindfulness help people adapt to the experience of hearing voices?,"Mindfulness-based interventions show promise in the treatment of psychotic symptoms. From a theoretical perspective, there may be several benefits of mindfulness for individuals who experience hearing voices. Related cross-sectional findings suggest mindfulness may protect against distress, disruption, negative beliefs, dysfunctional relational style and responding, and mood symptoms for individuals who hear voices. To extend on previous findings, this study aimed to identify whether mindful relating to voices predicted voice-related negative impacts (distress, disruption and resistance), when the influence of voice-topography and mood symptoms were controlled for. Overall, 62 participants with a psychotic disorder who had experienced hearing voices in the previous week were given the Southampton Mindfulness of Voices Questionnaire, Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales, Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory. As predicted, greater mindfulness of voices predicted less voice-related distress and lower resistance to voices. Regression analyses revealed that when associated voice topography and mood symptoms were controlled for, mindful relating to voices explained a significant proportion of variance in voice-related distress and resistance. Conversely, mindfulness of voices did not significantly predict voice-related disruption. In the context of existing literature, these findings suggest further mindfulness-based protocols for persistent voices should be developed and trialled.

Increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels predict severity of depression after six months of follow-up in outpatients with major depressive disorder,"Previous studies have reported dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Outpatients diagnosed with MDD ( n = 199) underwent psychological evaluation, and were followed up with a phone interview after 6 months, using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). At 6-month follow-up, 59 out of 199 patients with MDD were still depressed (29.5%), as shown by scores ≥ 10 on the PHQ-9. The depressed group at follow-up showed significantly higher anxiety and suicidality levels at baseline than the non-depressed group at follow-up. Among the complete blood counts, lipid profiles, and hormone levels, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was the only parameter that was significantly increased in the still depressed group. Levels higher than 40 pg/mL of ACTH at baseline were associated with higher depression scores at follow-up. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that ACTH and cortisol predicted depression scores at follow-up, after controlling for baseline depression scores. Increased ACTH level at baseline may predict ongoing symptoms and severity of depression at follow-up, suggesting the role of dysfunctional HPA axis in MDD prognosis.

"Associations between negative life events and anxiety, depressive, and stress symptoms: A cross-sectional study among Chinese male senior college students","The aims of this study were to explore the associations between negative life events and anxiety, depressive, and stress symptoms among male senior college students who experience negative life events in daily life. Data were obtained from 582 male senior college students recruited from universities in Chongqing China. Participants completed the Adolescent Self-rating Life Events Checklist (ASLEC), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Socio-demographic information, lifestyle information, and a blood sample were acquired. 39 (6.7%), 74 (12.7%), and 39 (6.7%) subjects were depressed, anxious, and stressed, respectively. The results confirmed that negative life events were positively related to mental health problems. Different types of negative life events had their specific associations with being depressed, anxious, or stressed. With respect to different types of negative life events, subjects with more “interpersonal relationship” related problems had a higher probability of being anxious and stressed; whereas, subjects with more “change for adaptation” related problems had a higher probability of being depressed and anxious. These results indicate that more concerns over the events with both high occurrence rate and severity might be helpful to mental health prevention and promotion for senior college students.

Correlations between TSIA and TAS-20 and their relation to self-reported negative affect: A study using a multi-method approach in the assessment of alexithymia in a nonclinical sample from Italy,"The 20 item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) has been set as the golden standard in assessing alexithymia despite its limitation due to its self-report structure. Overcoming this bound is the main reason that in 2006 brought Bagby, Taylor and Parker to develop the Toronto Structured Interview for Alexithymia (TSIA): a structured interview composed of 24 questions with the purpose of assessing four dimensions of alexithymia: Identifying emotional feelings (DIF), Describing emotional feelings (DDF), Imaginal processes (IMP), and Externally oriented thinking (EOT). The present study aimed to confirm the validity of the TSIA in the assessment of alexithymia, using internal consistency (alpha) and convergent validity (comparing TSIA and TAS-20). Since it has been demonstrated an association between alexithymia, measured with the TAS-20, and negative affect, an additional goal was to evaluate the correlation of TSIA with two measures of depression and anxiety (BDI-II and STAI-Y2). Our results showed a significant capability of the TSIA in assessing alexithymia while clearing the limitation of the TAS-20 in keeping aside partially overlapping construct such as depression and anxiety. The final suggestion is that a reliable assessment of alexithymia might come from the application of both a self-report and an observer-rated instrument.

Trait anxiety is associated with a decreased visual working memory capacity for faces,"Recent work has suggested that anxiety restricts working memory capacity, which may underlie a wide range of cognitive symptoms in anxiety. However, previous literature on the anxiety-visual working memory association yielded mixed results, with some studies demonstrating an anxiety-related increase in visual working memory capacity. In an attempt to gain a more thorough understanding of the relationship between anxiety and visual working memory maintenance function, the current study examined the influence of trait anxiety on visual working memory capacity and resolution for negative, positive, and neutral faces in a large unselected sample, by conducting two different experiments. Experiment 1 used a change-detection task to estimate visual working memory capacity, while Experiment 2 used a modified time-delay estimation task to measure memory precision. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze the relationship between trait anxiety, emotional valence, and visual working memory. Results showed that trait anxiety was associated with decreased visual working memory capacity for faces in a valence-independent manner, whereas anxiety-related change in visual working memory resolution was not significant.

Behavioral inhibition system and self-esteem as mediators between shyness and social anxiety,"Shyness has been demonstrated to be an important factor associating with social anxiety. However, it is less clear on the mechanisms responsible for such association. The aim of the present study was to examine whether behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and self-esteem mediated the relationship between shyness and social anxiety. A sample of 521 healthy volunteers in the age range of 18–25 years completed self-report measures of BIS, self-esteem, shyness and social anxiety. Our correlational analyses showed that shyness was positively associated with social anxiety, supporting the overlapping and continuum hypotheses. Furthermore, BIS was positively correlated with shyness and social anxiety while self-esteem was negatively related to them, indicating that BIS and self-esteem were different in the relation between shyness and social anxiety. Importantly, results from structural equation modeling revealed that the relation between shyness and social anxiety was partially mediated by BIS and self-esteem, which suggested that they might play important roles in the relation between shyness and social anxiety.

Validity and clinical utility of DSM and prototype diagnosis for depressive and anxiety spectrum disorders in predicting adaptive functioning,"Prototype matching, which involves comparing a patient clinical presentation with a prototype description of the disorder, addresses some of the clinical limitations of categorical approaches. Most research to-date on prototype matching has been conducted with personality disorders. Here, we examined the validity and clinical utility of prototype diagnosis for mood and anxiety disorders. We compared clinicians prototype diagnosis (based on DSM IV and empirically derived) to categorical diagnosis (based on independent SCID interview) in predicting patient global adaptive functioning rated across the clinician, patient and independent interviewer among N = 80 clinicians and N = 170 patients. Our findings show that prototype diagnosis (both one that is based on DSM criteria and empirically derived) demonstrates some incremental validity over and above the categorical DSM IV, in predicting patient's global adaptive functioning. This is particularly pronounced for mood disorders (MDD and dysthymia) as well as several anxiety disorders (OCD, social phobia) across a range of experience level of diagnosticians. Furthermore, clinicians rated the prototype matching approach as more useful in clinical practice compared with the binary categorical system. Using a dimensional approach, which is based on prototype matching that also preserves the advantages of categorical system offers a valid and efficient approach to psychiatric assessment.

We recorded age, years of education, BMI, the Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). BIS action scores, total scores and BDI scores were significantly different between the groups. Partial correlation analyses with age and education years as covariates found that CSF glutamate levels negatively correlated with BDI scores, but did not correlate with SAS scores in heavy smokers. No correlation was found between CSF glutamate levels and BDI or SAS scores in non-smokers. In conclusion, heavy smokers had more impulsivity had lower levels of CSF glutamate and higher BDI scores. CSF glutamate levels negatively correlated with BDI scores in heavy smokers.

The association between schizotypal traits and social functioning in adolescents from the general population,"Difficulties in social functioning have been linked to schizotypy, which may reflect vulnerability to psychotic disorders. We investigated these links in early adolescence, a developmental stage when many mental illnesses first emerge. Using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and The Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences, we examined the association of peer-relationship problems and prosocial behavior with positive and negative schizotypy in a sample of 149 school children (70 girls, 79 boys) between 12 and 15 years old. The results showed that while increased positive schizotypy was significantly associated with increased peer-relationship problems, increased negative schizotypy was significantly associated with decreased prosocial behavior. These effects were observed after the potential effects of age, sex, general cognitive abilities, the ability to infer affective mental states, anxiety, and depression had been taken into account. These results suggest that different dimensions of schizotypy are associated with different aspects of social dysfunction in adolescents. Interventions aimed at improving social functioning in adolescence would benefit from considering these unique associations.

Psychomotor agitation in subjects hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of Schizophrenia,"The aims of this study were to establish the prevalence of moderate and severe psychomotor agitation in patients hospitalized for an active phase of schizophrenia, the associations between psychomotor agitation and patients’ demographic and clinical variables, the intra-individual stability of the agitated/non-agitated dichotomy in independent psychotic breakdowns. The study was performed on a database relative to 630 inpatients hospitalized with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Psychomotor agitation was measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale—Excited Component (PANSS-EC). Prevalence of moderate and severe psychomotor agitation was 40.5% and 23.7%, respectively. Non-agitated patients were older, with longer illness history and duration of untreated psychosis, were more frequently on antipsychotic medication, had lower incidence of recent use of substances, and functioned better before the index hospitalization than moderately and/or severely agitated patients. Non-agitated patients had lower scores for total PANSS and Emsley's positive and anxiety dimensions. Compared with the severely agitated group, non-agitated and moderately agitated patients scored more in Emsley's depression dimension. Poor functioning before index hospital admission, higher scores for negative subscale and Emsley's positive dimension and use of substances exerted an effect on risk of psychomotor agitation.

Comorbidity of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder in children and adolescents,"The aim of the study is to explore the impact of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) comorbidity in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Six hundred children with ADHD (mean age = 9.12 years), recruited from 2013 to 2017, participated in the study. A total of 96 (16%) children with ADHD displayed a comorbidity with GAD. ADHD + GAD were compared to 504 ADHD children without GAD in terms of cognitive and psychiatric profile, ADHD subtype and family psychiatric history. The ADHD + GAD, predominantly represented from ADHD combined (72.6%), displayed higher psychiatry comorbidity, in particular with depressive disorders, and were associated with higher rates of maternal depression, of ADHD in fathers, and bipolar disorders in second degree relatives. Moreover, younger preschool-primary school age children with ADHD + GAD showed significant higher frequency of depressive disorders versus younger preschool-primary children with ADHD without GAD. ADHD + GAD comorbidity represents a more complex clinical condition compared to ADHD without GAD, characterized by the higher frequency of multiple comorbidities and by a psychiatric family with higher rates of mood and disruptive disorders.

Theory of mind disturbances in borderline personality disorder: A metaanalysis,"Impairments of theory of mind (ToM) are widely accepted underlying factors of disturbed relatedness in borderline personality disorder (BPD). The aim of this meta-analysis a was to assess the weighted mean effect sizes of ToM performances in BPD compared to healthy controls (HC), and to investigate the effect of demographic variables and comorbidities on the variability of effect sizes across the studies. Seventeen studies involving 585 BPD patients and 501 HC were selected after literature search. Effect sizes for overall ToM, mental state decoding and reasoning, cognitive and affective ToM, and for task types were calculated. BPD patients significantly underperformed HC in overall ToM, mental state reasoning, and cognitive ToM, but had no deficits in mental state decoding. Affective ToM performance was largely task dependent in BPD. Comorbid anxiety disorders had a positive moderating effect on overall and affective ToM in BPD. Our results support the notion that BPD patients’ have specific ToM impairments. Further research is necessary to evaluate the role of confounding factors, especially those of clinical comorbidities, neurocognitive functions, and adverse childhood life events. Complex ToM tasks with high contextual demands seem to be the most appropriate tests to assess ToM in patients with BPD.

Nonsuicidal self-injury among adolescents and young adults with prolonged exposure to violence: The effect of post-traumatic stress symptoms,"Less is known about nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents and young adults living in areas under prolonged political violence. This study aims to explore the frequencies of NSSI as well as the severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, and sleep problems among 889 Palestinian adolescents and young adults. The participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing NSSI, PTSS, depression, anxiety symptoms, and sleep difficulties. The results found that 13.8% of the total sample are frequently engaging in some form of NSSI behavior. Moreover, 43.1% exhibited severe symptoms of PTSD, and almost one-third of the sample reported severe symptoms of depression (30.1%); more than two-thirds of the sample (68.4%) experience sleep difficulties. Those who engage in NSSI were found to be at higher risk for sleep problems, depression, and PTSS. Avoidance/numbing, as well as hyperarousal symptoms clusters of PTSS, were significantly associated with NSSI above and beyond depressive symptoms. These results suggest that NSSI is frequently a sequelae of prolonged exposure to trauma and violence, and highlight the importance of routine assessment of this behavior. It is crucial to be familiar with the association between PTSS, sleep difficulties, and NSSI in a clinical setting to implement programs focusing on preventing these domains.

An evaluation of a low intensity mHealth enhanced mindfulness intervention for Chinese university students: A randomized controlled trial,"Mental disorders and sleep dysfunction are common among Chinese university students. This study aimed to evaluate a low cost scalable mindfulness intervention program to improve psychological health and sleep quality among Chinese university students. A randomized controlled trial with 101 university students (mean age 22.30 ± 2.63, 69.31% female) was conducted. Participants were randomized into 4 groups: Group 1: control group ( n = 25), Group 2: mindfulness only group ( n = 27), Group 3: mindfulness + plain-text reminder group ( n = 24), and Group 4: mindfulness + enhanced text reminder with animal meme group ( n = 25).The mindfulness intervention consisted of two in-person guided sessions along with weekly self-guided practice for 7 weeks. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to measure depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep dysfunction. After the intervention at week 4, compared to controls, completers in group 2, 3 and 4 ( n = 42) showed significantly reduced depression (Cohen's d = 0.83), anxiety (Cohen's d = 0.84), and stress (Cohen's d = 0.75), and improved subjective sleep quality (Cohen's d = 2.00), sleep latency (Cohen's d = 0.55), and habitual sleep efficiency (Cohen's d = 0.86). The effect was maintained at week 7. Low-intensity mindfulness interventions might be a useful intervention program in university settings.

"Anxiety attacks with or without life-threatening situations, major depressive disorder, and suicide attempt: A nationwide community sample of Korean adults","Regardless of categorical diagnosis, many psychiatric patients suffer from sudden attack of fear or intense anxiety. In this study, we defined anxiety attacks to refer to these phenomena and investigated their association with depression and suicide attempts. A total of 12,532 adults randomly selected population through the oneperson-per-household method completed a face-to-face interview using the Korean version of Composite International Diagnostic Interview (K-CIDI). A total of 5.88% reported to have experienced anxiety attacks. Among them, 46.5% reported to have experienced anxiety attacks without life-threatening situations. ‘Anxiety attacks’ group reported more suicidal ideation, plan, and attempts, which were even higher frequencies in ‘anxiety attacks without life-threatening situations’ group than ‘anxiety attacks only with life-threatening situations’ group and showed stronger association with lifetime suicide attempts when it had comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) (AOR = 9.69, 95%CI 5.90–15.90), compared with ‘never’ group. There was no association between each symptom of patients with anxiety attacks and their lifetime suicide attempt. In conclusion, the finding suggests that there are as many individuals who experience anxiety attacks without lifethreatening situations as those with life-threatening situations. And anxiety attacks appear to be relevant to an increased risk of suicide attempt, especially without life-threatening situations and with comorbid MDD.

Effects of post-exposure naps on exposure therapy for social anxiety,"Exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder (SAD) utilizes fear extinction, a memory process enhanced by sleep. We investigated whether naps following exposure sessions might improve symptoms and biomarkers in response to social stress in adults undergoing 5-week exposure-based group SAD therapy. Thirty-two participants aged 18–39 (18 females) with SAD were randomized. Before and after treatment, participants completed the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and underwent a Trier Social Stress Test with psychophysiological monitoring (mpTSST) that included skin conductance (SCL), electromyographic (EMG) and electrocardiographic recording, and an auditory startle procedure while anticipating the social stressor. At sessions 3 and 4, exposure was followed by either a 120-min polysomnographically monitored sleep opportunity (Nap, N = 17) or wakefulness (Wake, N = 15). Primary hypotheses about SAD symptom change (LSAS) and EMG blink-startle response failed to differ with naps, despite significant symptom improvement (LSAS) with therapy. Some secondary biomarkers, however, provided preliminary support for enhanced extinction learning with naps, with trend-level Time (pre-, post-treatment) × Arm interactions and significant reduction from pre- to post treatment in the Nap arm alone for mpTSST SCL and salivary cortisol rise. Because of the small sample size and limited sleep duration, additional well-powered studies with more robust sleep interventions are indicated.

Hypovitaminosis D is associated with depression and anxiety in schizophrenia: Results from the national FACE-SZ cohort,"Objective: Hypovitaminosis D has been associated with respectively major depressive disorder, schizophrenia (SZ) and cognitive disorders in the general population, and with positive and negative symptoms and metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia. The objectives were (i) to determine the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and associated factors (with a focus on depression and cognition) in a national non-selected multicentric sample of community-dwelling SZ subjects (ii) to determine the rate of SZ patients being administered vitamin D supplementation and associated factors. Methods: A comprehensive 2 daylong clinical and neuropsychological battery was administered in 140 SZ subjects included between 2015 and 2017 in the national FondaMental Expert Center (FACE-SZ) Cohort. Hypovitaminosis D was defined by blood vitamin D level &lt; 25 nM. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale depressive subscore and current anxiety disorder by the Structured Clinical Interview for Mental Disorders. Results: Hypovitaminosis D has been found in 21.4% of the subjects and none of them had received vitamin D supplementation in the previous 12 months. In multivariate analysis, hypovitaminosis D has been significantly associated with respectively higher depressive symptoms (aOR = 1.18 [1.03–1.35], p = 0.02) and current anxiety disorder (aOR = 6.18 [2.15–17.75], p = 0.001), independently of age and gender. No association of hypovitaminosis D with respectively positive and negative symptoms, cognitive scores or other biological variables has been found (all p &gt; 0.05), however, a trend toward significance has been found for metabolic syndrome ( p = 0.06). Vitamin D supplementation has been administered during the previous 12 months in only 8.5% of the subjects but was associated with lower depressive symptoms (aOR = 0.67 [0.46–0.98], p = 0.04) and lower rate of current anxiety disorder (aOR = 0.06 [0.01–0.66], p = 0.02) compared to patients with hypovitaminosis D. Conclusion: Hypovitaminosis D is frequent and associated with depressive symptoms and anxiety disorders in schizophrenia. Vitamin D supplementation is associated with lower depressive and anxiety symptoms, however patients with hypovitaminosis D remain insufficiently treated.

Posttraumatic stress disorder clusters and suicidal ideation,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. However, less is known about how the PTSD symptom clusters, namely alterations in arousal and reactivity (AAR), negative alterations in cognitions and mood (NACM), avoidance, and intrusion, uniquely relate to suicidal ideation. This study aimed to characterize the associations among suicidal ideation and these symptom clusters. Methods: Study 1 ( n = 346) and Study 2 ( n = 194) included community members and treatment-seeking adults at an anxiety specialty clinic, respectively. Participants completed measures of trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Results: In both studies, suicidal ideation significantly and positively correlated with all PTSD factors. In Study 1, Wald tests of parameter constraints indicated that NACM and AAR had the strongest associations with suicidal ideation, followed by intrusion and avoidance. Results were replicated when restricting the sample to individuals with probable PTSD. In Study 2, suicidal ideation significantly and positively correlated with all PTSD factors; there were no differences in the strength of the suicidal ideation-PTSD factors relations. Limitations: The studies were cross-sectional and relied on a single-item measure of suicidal ideation. Discussion: All PTSD factors significantly and positively correlated with suicidal ideation, and the NACM and AAR PTSD clusters were most strongly associated with suicidal ideation in Study 1. Therefore, clinicians should be cautious to thoroughly screen patients with elevations on these PTSD cluster scores for suicide risk.

The spark that might have ignited the fire: The association of cognitive and psychological factors with state anxiety in light of the Syrian-Israeli incident,"The current study aimed to explore Israelis' state anxiety due to a Syrian-Israeli incident that occurred on February 10, 2018, when an Israeli F-16 fighter jet was shot down by Syrian air defense forces. In line with the ""looming vulnerability"" model which emphasizes the importance of the dynamic nature of psychologically threatening situations, the following psychological factors were suggested: associative memory of prior events, worries of future war, sense of safety, and death anxiety. We employed two cross-sectional points of time in our assessment: 36 hours and three months after the incident. Using an online survey, 162 adult participants were recruited in Study 1 and 172 in Study 2. The participants completed set of questionnaires measuring state anxiety along with other psychological measures. The results of the two studies suggested that higher levels of worry of future war and lower levels of sense of safety associated with higher state anxiety. The looming vulnerability model and variables associated with state anxiety were found to have a salient role in explaining state anxiety as a response to a negative unexpected event.

"Association of positive, negative, and disorganized schizotypy dimensions with affective symptoms and experiences","Schizotypy offers a useful construct for investigating the etiology, development, and expression of schizophrenia-spectrum psychopathology, as well as the comorbid expression of mood and anxiety disorders across the schizophrenia spectrum. The present study examined the associations of positive, negative, and disorganized schizotypy with affective symptoms and experiences in a sample of MTurk workers and college students ( n = 575). Participants completed the Multidimensional Schizotypy Scale (MSS) and measures of depression, anxiety, social phobia, hypomanic traits, and state affect. As expected, positive schizotypy was significantly associated with hypomanic traits, whereas negative schizotypy was associated with reduced positive affect and reduced hypomanic traits. Although prior research has emphasized the association of positive schizotypy with depression and anxiety, the current results demonstrate that disorganized schizotypy is more strongly associated with elevated negative affect (over-and-above positive schizotypy). As such, these findings highlight the importance of examining disorganization of affect, in addition to the cognitive-behavioral deficits traditionally associated with disorganized schizotypy. Finally, the MSS and MSS-Brief demonstrated closely comparable findings. The present results provide further support for the construct validity of the MSS and the three-factor model of schizotypy.

This study aims to assess the differences between old SUD women and men regarding socio-demographics, clinical factors and outcomes. A 6-months follow-up longitudinal study was conducted in an outpatient center, on a convenience sample of 115 SUD old adults (≥ 65 years old, average age of 71.57). Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed. Data showed statistical significant differences between men and women related to sociodemographic variables (marital status, coexistence, criminal records and stress factors), medical and psychiatric conditions (women suffer higher rates of depression and anxiety, with worse health-related quality of life), family records (women had more presence of family psychiatric records) and SUD related parameters (men tend to use more alcohol, had an early onset, consume higher doses, report more craving and more tobacco life use while women had higher rates of prescription drugs use). At 6-month follow-up, the whole sample showed excellent rates of adherence and abstinence, without sex differences. The study points out sex differences on several sociodemographic and clinical variables, indicating their specific needs.

Neurocognitive deficits in a transdiagnostic clinical staging model,"There is a growing literature which suggests that neurocognitive deficits may be markers of susceptibility for serious mental illness development. This study assessed neurocognitive functioning in a sample of youth at risk of serious mental illness across different clinical stages as described by McGorry and colleagues and compared them to healthy controls. The sample was 243 male and female youths aged 12–26 and included: asymptomatic participants with psychiatric risk factors (Stage 0; n = 41); youth with early mood or anxiety symptoms (Stage 1a; n = 52); youth with attenuated psychiatric syndromes (Stages 1b; n = 108); and healthy controls ( n = 42). The neurocognitive battery included IQ measures and the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Consensus Cognitive Battery. Participants in Stage 1b had lower scores than healthy controls on the composite score of neurocognitive performance, across all IQ measures, and in the domains of processing speed, working memory, attention and problem solving. They also had lower scores than subjects in Stage 0 across most IQ measures and in the domains of processing speed and working memory.

Exploring the role of the DSM-5 performance-only specifier in adolescents with social anxiety disorder,"The DSM-5 social anxiety disorder section has recently added the performance-only specifier for individuals whose anxiety is limited to speaking or performing in public. The impact of the DSM-5 performance-only specifier remains a neglected area. The sample comprised 44 healthy controls and 50 adolescents with a clinical diagnosis of SAD (20% met criteria for the performance-only specifier). Findings revealed that adolescents with the specifier had a later age of onset; lower levels of depression, social anxiety symptomatology and clinical severity; and a lesser degree of comorbidity relative to adolescents with SAD but excluding the performance-only specifier. Specifiers only evidenced higher (cognitive) social anxiety symptomatology compared to healthy controls. Results of this study also suggested that the performance-only specifier may correspond to a mild form of social anxiety disorder. Data also revealed that SAD exists on a continuum of severity among healthy controls, specifier participants, and those with both interactional and performance fears, which is consistent with a dimensional structure for SAD. Finally, findings suggested a unique comorbid pattern for specifiers and those adolescents with SAD but excluding the performance-only specifier. The implications of these findings for the etiology, assessment, classification, and treatment of social anxiety in youth are discussed.

This study aims to determine the socio-demographic and clinical features and possible clinical subtypes that predict the 12-month outcomes of cases with hikikomori syndrome, a severe form of social withdrawal. Socio-demographic and clinical data at baseline were analysed as well as data obtained for 12 months after at-home treatment in 190 cases. The inclusion criteria were: spending all time at home, avoiding social situations and relationships, significant deterioration due to social isolation, with a minimum duration of 6 months. Six major diagnostic groups were identified: affective, anxiety, psychotic, drug use, personality and other Axis I disorders. The anxiety-affective subgroup demonstrated lower clinical severity, but worse evolution. Less than half of the cases were available for medical follow-up at 12-months. Subjects undergoing intensive treatment had a higher medical follow-up rate and better social networks at 12-months. Therefore, our findings provide data to reach consensus on the specific characteristics of social isolation hikikomori syndrome. The analysis demonstrated the fragility and tendency to relapse and have disengagement, particularly relevant in the anxiety-affective subgroup, suggesting that intensive treatments are more effective.

Depression with or without comorbid social anxiety: Is attachment the culprit?,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) frequently co-occurs with social anxiety disorder (SAD), and their comorbidity (MDD-SAD) increases clinical severity and functional impairment. Still, the specific psychological vulnerabilities of individuals with MDD-SAD are poorly understood. Individual attachment characteristics develop early in life through interactions with primary caregivers, and tend to persist throughout life. Early trauma can worsen attachment insecurity, increasing the risk for future anxiety and depression. The purpose of this study is to examine differences in individual attachment and history of trauma in depressed individuals with or without comorbid SAD and controls. One hundred sixty-two participants were categorized into three groups based on SCID-I interview: healthy controls (HC), individuals with current MDD without SAD (MDD), and individuals with current MDD comorbid with SAD (MDD-SAD). MDD-SAD group had significantly greater attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance compared to the MDD and HC groups. MDD-SAD group had greater clinician-rated depression severity and dysfunction compared to MDD group. In summary, the study further supports the clinical risks associated with MDD-SAD and suggests that insecure attachment might represent an associated vulnerability and a possible pathway which warrants further research and clinical attention.

"Worry, anxiety sensitivity, and electronic cigarettes among adults","Although electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is now a common substance use behavior, there is little understanding of the individual difference factors related to e-cigarette use beliefs and dependence. The present investigation sought to test a theoretically-driven model of anxiety sensitivity as an explanatory element in a worry-e-cigarette beliefs and dependence model. Participants included 558 adult e-cigarette users (51.4% female; 35.2 years, SD = 10.1) who were nationally recruited via an online survey system. Participants completed a single survey that assessed their mood and e-cigarette behavior and beliefs. Results supported a statistically significant indirect pathway for worry in relation to perceived benefits of e-cigarettes, e-cigarette positive outcome expectancies, and e-cigarette dependence via anxiety sensitivity; effect sizes were small. The indirect effects were evident when accounting for several theoretically relevant covariates (sex, income, education, concurrent cigarette use, and neuroticism). This study provides the first empirical evidence of the role of anxiety sensitivity in the relation between worry and e-cigarette use beliefs and behavior, which may represent a novel intervention target.

Association between physical activity and depressive symptoms in general adult populations: An analysis of the dose-response relationship,"This study explored the magnitude and clinical correlates of anxiety in three groups of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD): those with comorbid anxiety disorders (the COM group), those with subthreshold core anxiety disorder symptoms that are the screening items for anxiety disorders on the MINI (the SUB group), and those with neither anxiety disorders nor subthreshold core anxiety disorder symptoms (the NON group). Anxiety symptomatology of 1052 patients from 8 psychiatric settings in mainland China, who met DSM-IV TR criteria for MDD, was assessed using the MINI. The presence of core anxiety symptoms was determined by patient endorsement of any screening item of panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder. The prevalences of comorbid subthreshold core anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders were 13% and 28.7%, respectively. The SUB and COM cases showed similar patterns of clinical presentation. Both were more likely than the NON cases to be characterized by younger age, concurrent dysthymia and OCD, suicidal ideation and attempted suicides. These findings highlight the importance of assessing both anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders in the presence of MDD, and suggest the need for novel assessments capable of addressing different levels of anxiety in depressed patients.

Testing the exacerbation and attenuation hypotheses of the role of anxiety in the relation between ADHD and reactive/proactive aggression: A 10-year longitudinal study,"Both anxiety and aggression commonly co-occur with ADHD symptoms. Two competing hypotheses describing the role of anxiety in aggression associated with ADHD symptoms have previously been advanced. The exacerbation hypothesis proposes that the presence of anxiety increases the risk of aggression in the context of ADHD symptoms. The attenuation hypothesis proposes that the presence of anxiety protects against aggression in the context of ADHD symptoms. We tested these hypotheses using moderated cross-lagged panel models in the Zurich project on social development from childhood to adulthood (z-proso) sample using both self-report (3 waves) and informant-report (8 waves) data spanning ages 7–17. We found evidence that anxiety protects against both reactive and proactive aggression; however, the effect was direct: there was no evidence for anxiety moderating the strength of ADHD symptom-aggression links. Results suggest that anxiety likely plays an important role in inhibiting aggression but does not interact with ADHD symptoms in the manner predicted by either the exacerbation or attenuation hypothesis.

Refinement of anxiety sensitivity measurement: The Short Scale Anxiety Sensitivity Index (SSASI),"Anxiety sensitivity, defined as the fear of anxiety and arousal-related sensations, has been among the most influential cognitive-based transdiagnostic risk and maintenance factors in the study and treatment of emotional and related disorders. The currently available anxiety sensitivity measures are limited by their length. Specifically, the length of these instruments discourages the adoption of routine anxiety sensitivity assessment in clinical or medical settings (e.g., primary care). The goals of this study were to develop and assess the validity and reliability of a short version of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3; Taylor et al., 2007), entitled the Short Scale Anxiety Sensitivity Index (SSASI), using three independent clinical samples. Results indicated that the abbreviated five-item version of the SSASI had good internal consistency and a robust association with the ASI-3. Further, across the samples, there was evidence of unidimensionality and excellent convergent and discriminant validity. There also was evidence of partial measurement invariance across sex and full measurement invariance across time. Overall, the five-item scale offers a single score that can be employed to measure anxiety sensitivity. Use of the SSASI may facilitate screening efforts and symptom tracking for anxiety sensitivity, particularly within clinical settings where practical demands necessitate the use of brief assessment instruments.

Normal cholesterol levels in the immediate postpartum period: A risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms?,"We aimed to ascertain if cholesterol levels within the reference standards for healthy non-pregnant women are a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms in the immediate postpartum period. During the first week after delivery, total cholesterol levels of 120 new mothers were measured and their mood state was assessed with the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Two weeks before delivery, mothers’ personal and family history of mood disturbances was assessed with the Maternal History of Mood Disturbances (MHMD) scale. Only 26 (22%) of the new mothers had normal cholesterol levels (≤ 200 mg/dL). Mothers with normal levels did not differ on psychometric measures from those with high levels. However, in the subgroup of mothers with normal cholesterol, those with lower levels experienced more symptoms of anxiety, depression and fatigue and scored higher on the MHMD scale. In the larger group of mothers with high cholesterol levels, history of mood disturbances and postpartum depressive and anxiety symptoms were not correlated with total cholesterol.

The clinical correlates of comorbid anxiety symptoms and syndromal anxiety in patients with major depressive disorder,"This study explored the magnitude and clinical correlates of anxiety in three groups of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD): those with comorbid anxiety disorders (the COM group), those with subthreshold core anxiety disorder symptoms that are the screening items for anxiety disorders on the MINI (the SUB group), and those with neither anxiety disorders nor subthreshold core anxiety disorder symptoms (the NON group). Anxiety symptomatology of 1052 patients from 8 psychiatric settings in mainland China, who met DSM-IV TR criteria for MDD, was assessed using the MINI. The presence of core anxiety symptoms was determined by patient endorsement of any screening item of panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder. The prevalences of comorbid subthreshold core anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders were 13% and 28.7%, respectively. The SUB and COM cases showed similar patterns of clinical presentation. Both were more likely than the NON cases to be characterized by younger age, concurrent dysthymia and OCD, suicidal ideation and attempted suicides. These findings highlight the importance of assessing both anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders in the presence of MDD, and suggest the need for novel assessments capable of addressing different levels of anxiety in depressed patients.

"Domain-specific associations between disability and depression, anxiety, and somatization in primary care patients","This study explores the associations between different disability domains and the most prevalent symptoms of mental disorders in primary care patients (i.e. depression, anxiety, and somatization). A total of 1241 participants from 28 primary care centres completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and somatization. This same sample also completed the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) to assess functional impairment in work, social life, and family life domains. Associations between the symptoms and each disability domain were examined using hierarchical regression analyses. Depression emerged as the strongest predictor of all three disability domains. Somatization was associated only with the work domain, and anxiety was associated only with the family life domain. Clinical symptoms explained a greater proportion of the variance than sociodemographic variables. In primary care patients, depression, anxiety and somatizations were associated with distinct domains of disability. Early provision of effective treatments in the primary care setting may be crucial to reduce the societal burden of common mental disorders.

Sleep quality components and mental health: Study with a non-clinical population,"The deconstruction of sleep quality into its particular components may help to specify how each one of them influences mental health. Thus, to detail the understanding of the relationship between sleep quality and mental health, our study aims to assess the relationship between each component of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and depression, anxiety and stress. Also, we intend to analyse the moderating effects of gender, age and country on these relationships. The instruments PSQI and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) were applied to a non-clinical population of 1552 participants from three different countries (Portugal, Spain and Brazil), aged over 18 years old. We estimated a multivariate regression model with AMOS Graphic 21.0 to test the seven proposed research hypotheses. The adjusted model explains 14.0%, 21.0% and 19.3% of the variances of depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. The conclusion of this study demonstrates that, with the exception of subjective sleep quality, all the other six components of the PSQI individually relate to mental health in nonclinical populations and that country is a significant moderator of these relationships.

The relationship between paternal prenatal depressive symptoms with postnatal depression: The PATH model,"The purpose of the study was to determine the relationship between men's prenatal and postnatal depressive symptom (PDS). In a descriptive study, 403 fathers meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled using Poisson random sampling method from public health clinics in Zanjan, Iran. All participants were selected in the third trimester of pregnancy and were followed up eight weeks after childbirth. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to screen the participants for depressive symptoms. Data was analyzed using descriptive test, Path analysis at a confidence level of 95%. Results showed that the effect of the prenatal depressive symptoms on PDS had perfect good fitness indices. A high level of prenatal depressive symptoms predicted a high level of PDS. We found significant total mediating effects of state, trait, and total anxiety on PDS. The total moderating effect of income on PDS was not statistically significant. These results suggest that a high level of prenatal depressive symptoms is a risk factor for a high level of PDS. Therefore, health providers should pay more attention to the psychological health of fathers during the pre and postpartum period. The predictor factors should be considered in both intervention and clinical assessment of paternal PDS.

An initial investigation of the unique relationship between disgust propensity and body dysmorphic disorder,"Disgust is a universal emotion that has received recent empirical attention for its potential role in various forms of psychopathology. We conducted two studies using varying methods to explore the relationship between disgust propensity, a construct related to obsessive-compulsive symptomatology, and symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Study 1 found a significant and unique (i.e., above and beyond co-occurring depression and anxiety) relationship between higher disgust propensity and more severe BDD symptoms, as measured by a standardized self-report and via an in-vivo task aimed at eliciting BDD-related concerns ( N = 200). In Study 2, a clinical sample of individuals with BDD ( N = 50) reported higher disgust propensity compared to mentally healthy controls ( N = 36). This finding remained significant when controlling for depression and anxiety. Findings are the first to our knowledge to demonstrate a relationship between disgust propensity and BDD symptoms and provide directions for future research exploring the role of disgust in BDD.

Anxious and alert? Hypervigilance in social anxiety disorder,"The vast majority of research on attentional biases to threat focusses on selective attention, even though several cognitive-behavioral models furthermore assume hypervigilance to be important in this regard. Thus, the current study examined hypervigilance in trait and state social anxiety. We analyzed visual scanpath lengths and fixation counts of participants with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) ( n = 61) and healthy controls ( n = 60) in a combined visual search and eye tracking paradigm, including photographs of facial expressions. Half of all participants were randomly assigned to a state anxiety induction. Interaction effects revealed opposed attentional patterns of participants with SAD as compared to healthy controls considering overall visual scanpath lengths ( F (1,117) = 5.32, p = 0.023, η² partial = 0.043) and fixation counts ( F (1,117) = 5.10, p = 0.026, η² partial = 0.042). Accordingly, participants with SAD showed signs of hypervigilance in the anxiety induction condition. In contrast, there was no main effect of diagnostic group, indicating that individuals with SAD shift their attentional focus to broad scanning behavior only under conditions of threat. Our results add to the small number of existing studies on hypervigilance in SAD and suggest the topic to be promising for future research.

"Emotional intelligence, emotion regulation and affectivity in adults seeking treatment for obesity","Obesity has become an increasingly widespread endemic with social implications; however, the relationship between higher body mass index (BMI) and psychological functioning is still not fully understood. This study examined the differences in affect-related psychological variables among BMI classes. A total of 134 adults seeking treatment for obesity and 124 controls completed a set of questionnaires to assess: trait emotional intelligence, emotion regulation strategies, anxiety, depression, binge eating behaviors and happiness. Correlations and multivariate analysis of variance were run per each study variable controlling for BMI class (normal weight, overweight, or obesity class I, II, III). Individuals with obesity class III were characterized by reduced trait emotional intelligence and happiness, and a higher tendency to use emotion suppression compared to normal weight individuals. All individuals with obesity also showed higher levels of depression and binge eating behaviors compared to both normal weight and overweight adults. Depression and emotion suppression were the most relevant discriminant factors across BMI classes, while trait emotional intelligence resulted as an important psychological factor clustering individual differences between obese and non-obese individuals. These results suggest that more attention to the affective domain of psychological functioning is needed for proper and comprehensive treatment of obesity.

Relationship of internet addiction severity with probable ADHD and difficulties in emotion regulation among young adults,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate relationship of Internet addiction (IA) symptom severity with probable attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and difficulties in emotion regulation, while controlling the effects of depression, anxiety and neuroticism. The study was conducted with online survey among 1010 volunteered participants of university students and/or amateur or professional gamers. Scale scores were higher among the group with high probability of ADHD ( n = 190, 18.8%). In linear regression analysis, both Inattentiveness and hyperactivity/impulsivity dimensions of ADHD were related with the severity of IA symptoms, together with depression and non-accept dimension of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Similarly, presence of probable ADHD was related with the severity of IA symptoms in ANCOVA, together with depression, neuroticism and non-accept dimension of DERS. Participants were two different groups of nonclinical samples and all scales were self-rated. Also common comorbidities were not screened. Finally, since this study is cross-sectional the findings of this study cannot address the causal relationships among the primary constructs of interest. These findings suggest that the presence of probable ADHD is related with the severity of IA symptoms, together with the difficulties in emotion regulation, particularly non-accept dimension, depression and neuroticism among young adults.

"Functional profiles of school refusal behavior and their relationship with depression, anxiety, and stress","Negative emotional states are common among youth with problematic school absenteeism, but little is known about their presence across different school refusal behavior profiles. The aim of this study was twofold: to identify different cluster solutions across functional profiles of school refusal behavior (I. Avoidance of Negative Affectivity, II. Escape from Social and/or Evaluative Situations, III. Pursuit of Attention, and IV. Pursuit of Tangible Reinforcement) and to determine whether these profiles differ from each other based on dimensions of depression, anxiety, and stress. The sample consisted of 1582 Ecuadorian adolescents aged 12–18 years ( M = 14.83; SD = 1.86) who completed the School Refusal Assessment Scale-Revised (SRAS-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Latent class analysis revealed three school refusal profiles: non-school refusal behavior, school refusal behavior by tangible reinforcements, and school refusal behavior by multiple reinforcements. The last group displayed the most maladaptive profile and revealed highest mean scores on the three dimensions of the DASS-21 compared to other groups. To promote mental health in this group it is a necessary goal due to their link with these negative emotional states. Prevention measures to strengthen emotional self-regulation should be considered in these cases.

Reduced heart rate variability in a treatment-seeking early psychosis sample,"Reduced cardiac autonomic function is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), with heart rate variability (HRV) providing an accessible index of cardiac autonomic function. HRV may provide a candidate physiological mechanism linking reduced cardiac autonomic function to increased risk for CVD in schizophrenia illness. This study examines whether HRV is also reduced in a community sample of treatment-seeking participants experiencing early psychosis ( n = 48) compared to healthy volunteers ( n = 48) and social anxiety control groups ( n = 48) matched by gender and age. HRV was assessed during a five-minute interbeat interval recording at rest. Participants also completed self-report psychiatric symptom measures. Early psychosis participants showed significant reductions in HRV compared to social anxiety and healthy control groups. Reductions in HRV were also observed in early psychosis participants taking anticholinergic medications compared to both control groups taking cardio-benign medications or who were non-medicated. Lastly, whether or not early psychosis participants were taking anticholinergic medications was not associated with reductions in HRV. Findings provide preliminary evidence that early psychosis is associated with reduced HRV. This study supports further research with larger sample sizes to precisely determine the influence of anticholinergic drugs on HRV in early psychosis populations.

Identifying Chinese adolescents with a high suicide attempt risk,"Adolescent suicide has become a serious public health problem in China. Since suicide attempts are considered the strongest predictor of suicide completion, it is valuable to identify adolescents with a high suicide attempt risk. This study aimed to develop a decision tree model for the interactive prediction of high suicide attempt risk in Chinese adolescents. A classification tree analysis was conducted in a sample of senior high school students ( N = 6,686) based on the CRUISE program. The results indicated that depression, anxiety, social support, gender, self-esteem, family cohesion and adaptability were significant predictors of high suicide attempt risk, and interactions among these predictors constructed a hierarchical decision tree model. The tree model offered a series of reliable rules to identify Chinese adolescents with high suicide attempt risk, for example, adolescents with high depression scores had the highest probability (69.22%) of having a suicide attempt, female adolescents with low social support and low depression scores had the second highest probability (57.58%), and adolescents with low anxiety, low family adaptability, and medium depression scores had the third highest probability (55.77%). These exploratory findings suggested that different screening criteria are needed to detect at-risk Chinese adolescents with different severities of depression.

The anxiolytic-like effects of estazolam on a PTSD animal model,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious psychiatric disorder. Estazolam has been shown to produce anxiolytic-, hypnotic-, amnestic-, and sedative-like effects. However, few studies are concerned about its anti- PTSD-like effects. The anti-PTSD-like effects of estazolam were evaluated by single prolonged stress animal model. After exposure to single prolonged stress, rats (Sprague-Dawley, male, 8 weeks) were administered by estazolam (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) from day 2 to 13 once daily. The behavioral assessments were performed during treatment with drugs. After the behavioral evaluation, the role of allopregnanolone in the anti-PTSD-like effects of estazolam was also evaluated via astrocyte cells and brain tissues (e.g. prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala). The PTSD-like behavioral deficits were significantly blocked by estazolam (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) without affecting locomotor activity. Consistently, the levels on allopregnanolone were increased by estazolam (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. The levels of allopregnanolone were increased by sertraline (1 μmoL/L) and estazolam (4 μmoL/L), while the effects were antagonized by trilostane (1 μmoL/L) and finasteride (1 μmoL/L) in astrocyte cells, respectively. Collectively, the anxiety-like behavior deficits were ameliorated by estazolam in the single prolonged stress animal model that was associated with biosynthesis of allopregnanolone.

The prevalence of diagnosed obsessive compulsive disorder and associated comorbidities: A population-based Canadian study,"The objective of this study was to provide epidemiological data regarding obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in Canada, and examine related conditions, childhood experiences and healthcare utilization. A Statistics Canada population-based health survey was utilized (N = 25,097). The prevalence of diagnosed OCD in Canada was 0.93% (95% CI 0.75–1.11). People with OCD were younger and more likely to have lower incomes. They were more likely to have mood disorders including depression and bipolar disorder (both diagnosed conditions and by screening), and generalized anxiety disorder. The diagnosis of OCD was also associated with alcohol dependence and substance abuse and dependence. Negative childhood experiences were more common in people with OCD, with 72.33%(95% CI 62.25%–82.41%) of people with OCD having experienced some form of childhood maltreatment. Healthcare utilization was more frequent in people with OCD, but they were also more likely to desire help but feel as if they did not receive it. The higher proportion of people with OCD reporting not receiving the care they needed may reveal a crucial gap in treatment and available resources.

"Interrelations among negative core beliefs, attachment anxiety and low self-directedness, putative central constructs of depression vulnerabilities in cognitive, attachment and psychobiological personality theories","The present study examined the interrelations among negative core beliefs, attachment anxiety and low self-directedness, to test if the central constructs of depression vulnerabilities in cognitive, attachment and psychobiological personality theories are integrated into negative self-image. The subjects were 410 healthy Japanese medical students and staff. Negative core beliefs, attachment anxiety and self-directedness were evaluated by the Brief Core Schema Scales, Experiences in Close Relationships and Temperament and Character Inventory, respectively. There were strong interrelations among the three factors. The present study suggests that the central constructs of depression vulnerabilities in the three theories are integrated into negative self-image.

Exploring anxiety in schizophrenia: New light on a hidden figure,"Anxiety is among the least studied features of schizophrenia, despite evidence of its significant impact on disease outcome. This work aims to investigate the anxiety construct in a sample of outpatients with schizophrenia, exploring the interplay of clinical, neurocognitive and social cognitive domains, as well as adverse childhood experiences and their relative contribute in determining anxiety. A forward stepwise regression model was performed on a sample of 68 outpatients with schizophrenia, to examine the predictive effect of different variables on anxiety. Predictors have been selected based on previous literature and include psychopathological, neurocognitive and social cognitive measures, as well as premorbid environmental factors. The analysis showed a significant contribution of childhood adverse experiences, followed by personal distress, while no significant effect was found for symptom's severity, nor global cognitive efficiency. The results show that anxiety is mainly determined by early environmental factors, as well as by socio-cognitive dimensions, such as personal distress. Data also suggest that anxiety can be considered as an independent construct, rather than as a mere epiphenomenon of the illness. The study has clinical implications as it highlights the importance of implementing both standardized assessments and group interventions specifically targeting anxiety in schizophrenia.

Towards a greater understanding of anxiety sensitivity across groups: The construct validity of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3,"The present study examined the factor structure, invariance properties, reliability, and validity of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3, Taylor et al., 2007). Participants were recruited from a large, ethnically diverse southwestern university ( n = 3651; 77.8% female; M age = 22.06 years; 28% non-Hispanic White). Findings supported a bifactor structure for the ASI-3, which demonstrated measurement invariance across sex, race/ethnicity, age, and sexual minority status. Furthermore, the ASI-3 demonstrated strong reliability and validity, with the anxiety sensitivity general and specific factors (physical, cognitive, and social concerns) evidencing unique patterns of relations with symptoms of depression, suicidality, anxious arousal, and social anxiety. Clinically, these findings generally support the validity of the ASI-3 in measuring anxiety sensitivity across sex, age, race/ethnicity, and sexual minority status. Future work is needed to better understand the role anxiety sensitivity plays within specific demographic subgroups, particularly African–Americans, Asian Americans, and sexual minorities.

Anger rumination and unjust world beliefs moderate the association between cyberbullying victimization and psychiatric symptoms,"Several studies have found a positive relationship between cyberbullying victimization and psychiatric symptoms such as depression or anxiety. However, relatively little research has investigated factors that might moderate this association. The present study aimed to examine the moderating role of anger rumination, unjust world beliefs and perceived social support in the relationship between cyberbullying victimization and psychiatric symptoms across different victim groups. A total of 1,500 participants (57.9% male, M age = 28.9 years, SD = 8.7) were recruited using an online questionnaire. According to the results, 29.8% of participants reported being bullied online during the past year. Results also indicated that cyberbullying victims but not bully-victims with a tendency to ruminate on past anger episodes and strong unjust world beliefs are more likely to experience psychiatric symptoms. These findings point to the differences between victims and bully-victims in the mechanisms underlying the victimization–psychiatric symptoms association, and highlight the importance of emotion regulation and just world beliefs in preserving and enhancing psychological well-being in those individuals who had been bullied online.

Attachment and medically unexplained somatic symptoms: The role of mentalization,"Previous research has found an association between insecure attachment and increased somatization in adults. However, the mechanisms underlying this association are unknown. In the present study, we examined whether the association between attachment insecurity and somatization in psychiatric patients diagnosed with medically unexplained somatic symptoms (MUSS) is mediated by mentalization deficits. Attachment security of 58 outpatients diagnosed with MUSS was measured with the Experiences in Social Relationships Questionnaire (ECR). Difficulty with understanding own emotions was measured with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20. In addition, others’ mental state comprehension was measured with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). Somatic symptom severity experienced by MUSS patients was related to attachment anxiety and alexithymia. These associations remained significant after controlling for sex, age, medication use, and depressive symptoms. Moreover, alexithymia mediated the association between anxious attachment and severity of somatic symptoms. Somatic symptom severity was also related to better RMET performance, although this association was not significant after controlling for sex, age, medication use, and depressive symptoms. Our findings may indicate that individuals with an anxious attachment style have difficulties in clarifying own emotions. This may in turn result in somatic experience of emotional distress and risk for development of MUSS.

"Relationship between economic stress factors and stress, anxiety, and depression: Moderating role of social support","The economic crisis had a detrimental impact on the economies of several European countries, namely in Portugal. The literature emphasizes that periods of economic turmoil potentiate the appearance of mental health issues, such as stress, anxiety, and depression, and decrease populations’ well-being. The present study, conducted in Portugal, was performed with a sample of 729 individuals, 33.9% males and 66.1% females, with an average age of 36.99 years old. Its’ aim was to assess the relationship between economic stress factors (economic hardship, financial threat, and financial well-being) and stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as to test the moderating effect of social support on this relationship. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the relationships defined. When comparing the results obtained in the models without and with social support as a moderator, statistically significant differences were observed on the relationships between financial threat and depression and between economic hardship and stress, anxiety, and depression. Regarding the association between financial threat and stress and anxiety, the effect of the economic stressor decreased in the presence of social support, but the differences were not statistically significant. The implications of these results are discussed and strategies to foster social support are proposed.

Motor function in an animal model with ouabain-induced bipolar disorder and comorbid anxiety behavior,"In a clinical setting, anxiety disorder is highly correlated with bipolar I disorder in humans. However, the comorbidity of anxiety behavior and bipolar disorder still remains unclear in an animal model. This study utilized an ouabain-induced animal model to examine anxiety and mania in an open field test. In the present study, 5 µl of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) or ouabain (10 −5 , 10 −4 , and 10 −3 M) were administered into the left ventricle. The animals’ motor functions and anxiety behaviors were measured for 15 min. The results showed that 10 −3 M ouabain significantly increased the animal's total distance traveled, average speed, and maximum speed compared to the control group. The time spent inside (i.e., how much time rats spent in the center of the square) and the inside-outside times of the central square (i.e., how many times rats ran across the center square) of the higher-concentration groups (10 −4 M and 10 −3 M) were significantly decreased. Therefore, a high concentration of ouabain may induce hyperactivity. The 10 −4 M and 10 −3 M ouabain groups exhibited more anxiety behaviors. The study is the first model to examine comorbid anxiety behaviors and bipolar disorder in an animal model. The study provides some insights for comorbid anxiety and bipolar disorder in clinics.

Few studies have investigated PMDD in a community sample of young adults, especially in Brazil. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and the factors associated with PMDD in a community sample of 727 young adult women between the 18 and 24 years of age in southern Brazil. This was a cross-sectional population-based study. The data were collected from 2012 to 2014. PMDD was assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview (M.I.N.I. – Plus). The prevalence of PMDD was 17.6%. PMDD was significantly higher among older women, and in women from lower socio-economic status. A trend towards significance was found for women without a current occupation (study or work). The comorbidities significantly associated with PMDD were current major depression disorder, agoraphobia, bipolar disorder, current suicide risk, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and specific phobia. The high prevalence found in the present study should be interpreted considering a retrospective report. However, our data showed that clinicians should be alert for PMDD symptoms, especially among young adult women.

Prolonged grief and attachment security: A latent class analysis,"The death of a loved one has been associated with a wide range of mental health outcomes. Attachment theory is one of the primary paradigms for understanding bereavement outcome, yet there is comparatively little examination of the relationship between attachment style and bereavement responses. In this study we use Latent Class Analysis to identify subgroups of bereaved individuals based on patterns of prolonged grief (PG) and major depression symptom co-occurrence in 285 bereaved individuals. We then explored the relationship between these subgroups and attachment anxiety and avoidance. Three new subgroups of individuals were identified: one showing high levels of PGD and depression (PGD/depression), one showing high depression (Depression), and one showing few symptoms (Low). Attachment anxiety significantly differentiated between the three groups; the highest levels of attachment anxiety predicted membership of the PGD/depression group, the lowest levels, membership of the Low group. Attachment avoidance was predictive of greater depressive symptoms, with higher levels of attachment avoidance differentiating the two symptom groups (PGD/depression and depression) from the Low symptom group. These findings underscore the relevance of insecure attachment style to the current understanding of PGD.

We assessed comorbidity, severity and sociodemographic related factors. With a double-phase design, a sample of 1514 students participated in the 1st phase and 562 students (175 at risk of depression) were assessed in the 2nd phase with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Kids. The estimated current prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) was 1.6%, similar to the 1.5% found 20 years ago. A total of 3.4% were diagnosed with some form of DD (MDD or Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD)). No significant differences between genders were found in either of the two periods studied. The rate of depressive symptoms (11.6%) was not significantly different from that of previous data (9.4%). 80% and 71.9% of the children diagnosed with MDD and PDD respectively also had an anxiety disorder. In conclusion, we have not found an increase in depression among Spanish early adolescents. However, the data on the prevalence of DD, the comorbidity, and the impairment all highlight the need to design and implement appropriate preventive interventions in schools.

More intensive probing increases the detection of social anxiety disorders in schizophrenia,"This study examined the influence of the assessment methods in detecting social anxiety disorders (SAD). We used a two-stage procedure to elicit social anxiety symptoms (SAS) to diagnose SAD in 80 people with a schizophrenia spectrum psychotic disorder (SZSPD) from an early intervention program. We observed a 28.8% lifetime prevalence of SAD when considering only the SAS elicited using the SCID probes (first stage), and a significant increase to 48.8% after adding the probes from the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (second stage). In conclusion, the LSAS can increase the sensitivity in detecting SAS and hence SAD comorbid to SZSPD.

However, little is known about the associations between anger and the development and progression of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGID). The study aim was to determine the associations between FGID and anger, anxiety, and depression. Participants in this cross-sectional observational study were 109 consecutive patients aged 18–64 years with FGID at Gastroenterology Clinic of Başkent University Hospital. A control group comprised of 96 individuals with no chronic gastrointestinal disorders recruited via snowball sampling. Sociodemographic and clinical information were obtained and participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2. FGID participants scored higher than controls on depression, anxiety, state anger, and anger expression-in. When the FGID group was divided into upper and lower gastrointestinal symptom groups, the lower symptom group showed higher anger expression-out scores than the upper symptom group. Anger may contribute to the etiology and development of FGID. This is the first study to demonstrate a significant psychological difference between individuals with lower and upper FGID.

Using an online survey, 397 adult participants were recruited, Seventy-two hours after an ISIS terror attack, and filled out Psychological distress Patient Health Questionnaire 4 and severe stress symptoms questionnaire as well as physical proximity to the site of the terror attack, associative memory of prior events, danger perception and ISIS anxiety scales. Physical proximity to the site of the terror attack and ISIS anxiety were found to be significantly associated of both psychological distress and severe stress symptoms. Regarding danger perception, only danger perception of terror attacks was associated with both psychological distress and with severe stress symptoms. Lastly, whereas being reminded of the 2014 Jerusalem tractor attack (tapping to association via location) was neither associated with psychological distress nor with severe stress symptom, the reminder of the truck attack in Berlin (tapping into association by recency and similarity) was associated with psychological distress but not with severe stress symptoms. The importance of the findings is discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2018
The relationship of discrimination related to sexual orientation and HIV-relevant risk behaviors among men who have sex with men,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for contraction and transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Increased risk of infection has been linked to high risk behaviors, such as alcohol and drug use, as well as engaging in unsafe sexual behaviors. Experiences of discrimination related to sexual orientation often experienced in this population predict risky behavior outcomes, but little research has examined the mechanisms implicated in this model. The current study examined the effect of anxiety and depressive symptoms in the relationship between discrimination related to sexual orientation and high-risk behaviors of alcohol use, drug use, using sex to cope with negative emotions, frequency of sex without a condom, and frequency of sex with an HIV + or unknown status partner. Three hundred and eighty-nine MSM were recruited to participate in a survey based study. Results indicated anxiety was maintained a significant indirect effect between discrimination related to sexual orientation and coping behaviors (using sex to cope, alcohol, substance use), but showed no significant indirect associations with risky sexual behavior. Overall, the current study provides novel empirical evidence that discrimination related to sexual orientation is associated with increased anxiety, which in turn, is associated with certain HIV risk behaviors. Importantly, it is possible that alcohol use, drug use, and using sex to cope with negative emotions may be precursors to more risky sexual behavior, such as engaging in anal sex without a condom or having sex with an HIV + or unknown status partner. Clinically, reducing symptoms of anxiety in the context of discrimination related to sexual orientation may help reduce HIV risk behavior among MSM.

"The relationship between internet addiction, social anxiety, impulsivity, self-esteem, and depression in a sample of Turkish undergraduate medical students","Internet addiction (IA) is currently becoming a serious mental health problem. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of IA among undergraduate medical students and evaluate the relationship of IA with social anxiety, impulsivity, self-esteem, and depression. The study included 392 undergraduate medical students. Evaluations were made with the sociodemographic data form, the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11 (BIS-11), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The IA group had significantly higher scores on LSAS, BDI, BAI and lower scores on RSES than the control group but the BIS-11 scores were similar among groups. IAT severity was positively correlated with LSAS, BDI, and BAI and negatively with RSES. No correlation was observed between IAT severity and BIS-11. In the hierarchical linear regression analysis, the avoidance domain of social anxiety was the strongest predictor of the severity of IA. The present study suggests that undergraduate medical students with IA exhibit higher social anxiety, lower self-esteem and are more depressed than those without IA, thus, indicating that social anxiety, rather than impulsivity, seemed to play a prominent role in IA psychopathology.

"The role of distress tolerance, anxiety sensitivity, and intolerance of uncertainty in predicting hoarding symptoms in a clinical sample","Hoarding disorder (HD) is characterized primarily by difficulty discarding possessions, leading to severe clutter and significant distress and impairment. Although promising psychological treatments have emerged, treating HD remains a clinical challenge. A greater understanding of the role of psychological vulnerability factors in predicting hoarding symptoms in a clinical HD sample could further enhance treatments. To investigate the role of proposed individual difference factors (i.e., distress tolerance, anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty), we administered a diagnostic and self-report battery to 73 individuals diagnosed with HD who were seeking treatment for hoarding at a community clinic. Results indicated that when controlling for depression and anxiety symptoms, only distress tolerance predicted the severity of hoarding symptoms. Furthermore, meditation analyses revealed that the impact of distress tolerance on hoarding severity was partially mediated by hoarding beliefs. These results have important theoretical and clinical implications for HD.

"Food addiction, in obese patients seeking bariatric surgery, is associated with higher prevalence of current mood and anxiety disorders and past mood disorders","The current cross-sectional study investigates the prevalence of the food addiction (FA) phenotype and its association with psychiatric disorders in bariatric surgery candidates. It also investigates the eating behavior characteristics associated with FA and the association between FA and loss of control over specific foods high in sugar, salt and/or fat. We included 128 bariatric surgery candidates and we assessed FA (YFAS 2.0), mood and anxiety disorders, suicidality, eating disorders (current bulimia nervosa and current anorexia nervosa), alcohol and tobacco use disorders (MINI 5.0.0, beck depression inventory, AUDIT, Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence) and eating behavior (DEBQ). Prevalence of FA in our sample was 25%. FA was significantly associated with higher prevalence of current mood and anxiety disorders and past mood disorders, higher current suicidality but not with eating disorders and alcohol use disorder. FA was significantly associated with higher emotional eating, and with loss of control over consumption of foods high in fat, sugar and/or salt, but not of fruits, vegetables or grain products. Our results provide arguments for considering psychiatric disorders and suicidality in FA and for considering FA as an addictive disorder in obese patients, with many risk factors in common with other addictions.

"Schizotypal traits and their relation to rejection sensitivity in the general population: Their mediation by quality of life, agreeableness and neuroticism","Schizotypal traits are a cluster of personality styles suggesting a potential liability for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Interpersonal schizotypal traits include cognitive disorganisation which consists of social anxiety, and introvertive anhedonia which consists of a lack of pleasure in social activities. Rejection sensitivity is evident all along this continuum. This study aimed to determine whether psychosocial quality of life (QOL), neuroticism and agreeableness mediates the relation between schizotypy and rejection sensitivity. Three hundred and eighteen participants from a predominantly University student population completed an online survey measuring schizotypy, rejection sensitivity, quality of life, and the five-factor personality traits. A regression analysis determined the prediction of rejection sensitivity by schizotypy, quality of life, and the five personality traits. Analyses examined the mediation of the relation between interpersonal schizotypy and rejection sensitivity by psychological QOL, social QOL, neuroticism, and agreeableness. Cognitive disorganisation and introvertive anhedonia predicted greater rejection sensitivity, which in turn were mediated by psychological QOL, social QOL, neuroticism, and agreeableness. The findings show that interpersonal schizotypy relates to greater rejection sensitivity. Psychosocial factors that lower one's ability to have positive feelings, trusting relationships, and prosocial behaviour, and personality traits that increase worrying mediate this association.

Exploration of illness perception among patients with mental illness in a multi-ethnic Asian sample,"Illness perceptions are beliefs that patients have about their illness. These beliefs play an important role in influencing their behaviour and outcomes. This study examined the factor structure and correlates of the Illness Perception Questionnaire Mental Health (IPQ-MH) among patients with mental illness in a multi-ethnic Asian sample. 400 participants with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, mood or anxiety disorder were recruited from a tertiary psychiatric institution and administered the IPQ-MH. Data on sociodemographic variables were also collected. A multi-factor structure was identified for the Identity, Structure and Cause subscale of the IPQ-MH. Age was consistently associated with a positive perception of illness across all three disorders; women had a more positive perception of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders as compared to men while those of Indian ethnicity had a more negative perception of their mood disorder as compared to those of Chinese ethnicity. Those with lower education had a poorer understanding of their illness among those with mood disorder, and a poorer understanding of their illness and the effectiveness of treatment among those with anxiety disorder. The study identified specific groups which can be targeted through tailored and culturally relevant psychoeducational interventions to enhance their understanding and perception of mental illness.

Assessment of the frequency criterion for the diagnosis of non-suicidal self-injury disorder in female adolescents with conduct disorder,"Recent studies suggest a higher threshold number of self-injuries during the past year than the one proposed in the DSM-5 criteria for non-suicidal self-injury disorder (NSSID). Therefore, we aimed to test a validity of the frequency criterion in girls with conduct disorder (CD) based on psychopathology and the level of functioning. Mixture modelling analysis revealed that the frequency of at least 8 self-harm behaviours in the previous year differentiated adolescents with CD. Thus, we divided adolescents into three subgroups: group 1: at least 8 self-harm acts; group 2: 1–7 self-harm behaviours and group 3: those who did not injure themselves during the last 12 months. Individuals from group 1 were significantly younger and had earlier age of self-harm onset. There were significant differences between groups 1 and 3 in terms of anxiety and depressive symptoms, self-esteem, aggression and the global functioning level. The group 1 scored significantly higher on depressive symptoms compared to the group 2. The group 2 scored significantly higher than the group 3 on the level of hostility. Our results provide further evidence supporting the need for modification of the NSSID frequency criterion.

Prevalence of childhood mental disorders in overweight and obese Spanish children: Identifying loss of control eating,"The aim was to examine the prevalence of childhood mental disorders in overweight/obese pediatric sample and also to explore the relationship between these pathologies and loss of control eating (LOC). Another aim was to assess the association between psychopathology and severity of obesity. A total of 170 children from different Health Centers were evaluated (84 girls and 86 boys; aged 8 to 12 years). Childhood psychological problems were assessed through a standardized diagnostic interview schedule (K-SADS-R) and by questionnaires (STAIC for anxiety, CDI for depression and ChEAT for disordered eating). Loss of control eating episodes were evaluated through the diagnostic interview. Of the sample, 57.06% of overweight/obese children met a DSM-5 diagnosis, typically an anxiety disorder; and 33.53% of the overweight/obese children presented loss of control eating episodes. We found more pathologic eating attitudes (ChEAT) in children who presented LOC versus children who did not. Finally, the scores obtained in the STAIC correlated positively with z-BMI and a positive association was found between z-BMI and the presence of episodes of LOC. These results highlight the importance of including psychological component in the initial assessment and contribute to the understanding of LOC episodes, which are still underestimated in childhood obesity.

Distress tolerance as a mechanism of PTSD symptom change: Evidence for mediation in a treatment-seeking sample,"Low distress tolerance, the perceived or actual inability to tolerate negative emotional states, is a transdiagnostic risk marker associated with greater PTSD symptoms and poorer treatment outcomes. However, the role of distress tolerance in PTSD symptom trajectories has not yet been explored. This study examined the mediating role of distress tolerance in PTSD symptom change among outpatients participating in a trial of computerized interventions for anxiety-related and mood-related risk factors. It was hypothesized that pre- to post-intervention change in distress tolerance would predict PTSD symptoms at three- and six-month follow-up, and mediate the effect of condition on PTSD symptoms above and beyond the effects of a competing mediator, anxiety sensitivity. Although condition differences in distress tolerance change were non-significant, distress tolerance change predicted month-three PTSD symptoms and mediated the direct effect of condition on month-three PTSD symptoms. After accounting for the direct effect of condition on month-six PTSD symptoms, distress tolerance change did not predict month-six PTSD symptoms. Findings suggest distress tolerance does play a longitudinal role in PTSD symptom change, and distress tolerance interventions may benefit certain samples who may otherwise not be able to immediately access, or remain in PTSD treatments.

Examination of the latent structure of DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in Slovakia,"The latent structure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been widely discussed, with the majority of studies in this area being conducted in the US. The current study aimed to extend this area of research by comparing seven existing PTSD factor models in a sample of 754 trauma-exposed university students from Slovakia, where similar research has not been conducted yet. The sample was predominantly female (83.69%), with a mean age of 22.68 years. The comparison of competing models revealed that the Anhedonia model, consisting of six inter-correlated factors of reexperiencing, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, dysphoric arousal and anxious arousal, provided the best fit. Several factors of the Anhedonia model also showed differential relationships with the external variables of anxiety and depression. The study contributes to the limited literature on the latent structure of PTSD in Eastern Europe.

Childhood maltreatment and problematic social media use: The role of attachment and depression,"Childhood maltreatment is associated with many maladaptive outcomes. This study sought to examine the association between childhood maltreatment and problematic social media use using a cross-sectional sample of young adults aged 17–25 years ( n = 1029). Specifically, we studied whether the relationship is mediated through (i) attachment anxiety, (ii) attachment avoidance, or (iii) both attachment dimensions operating in series with depressive symptoms. Results revealed that a history of childhood maltreatment was significantly associated with more problematic social media use. Both anxious and avoidant attachment dimensions independently mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and problematic use of social media, but in opposing directions. Avoidant attachment was associated with less problematic social media use, whilst anxious attachment was associated with more problematic social media use. Avoidant attachment and depressive symptoms in series accounted for part of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and problematic social media use. Anxious attachment and depressive symptoms in series fully mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and problematic social media use. The results suggest that childhood maltreatment may influence social media use directly, but also indirectly. People experiencing depressive symptoms may overuse social media in an attempt to alleviate their distress. However, causality cannot be established with the current design.

The profile of cognitive impairments in chronic ketamine users,"The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive function in chronic ketamine users. Factors correlated to cognition impairments were analyzed. Sixty-three chronic ketamine users and 65 healthy subjects were recruited. Cognitive function was assessed by using immediate/delayed visual reproduction (IVR/DVR) tasks, immediate/delayed logical memory (ILM/DLM) tasks, Stroop test, Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST), and continuous performance test (CPT). Psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Ketamine users performed worse than controls on the IVR, ILM, DLM, Stroop and auditory CPT tests. IVR and DVR, color-naming and color-interference-reading scores were positively correlated with education level. In ketamine users ILM scores were negatively correlated with the negative subscale of PANSS. DLM score was positively correlated with average dose of ketamine use. Word-reading score was positively correlated with education level, and negatively correlated with duration of ketamine use. False hits in auditory CPT was positively correlated with duration of ketamine use. Number of trials to complete the first category and perseverative errors on WCST were positively correlated with the duration between the test and last ketamine use. Chronic ketamine users had cognitive impairments across multiple domains.

Comparison of performance-based assessment and real world skill in people with serious mental illness: Ecological validity of the Test of Grocery Shopping Skills,"Valid functional measures are essential for clinical and research efforts that address recovery and community functioning in people with serious mental illness. Although there is a great deal of interest in functional assessment, there is limited research supporting how well current evaluation methods provide a true assessment of real world functioning or naturalistic behavior. To address this gap in the literature, the present study examined the performance of individuals with serious mental illness (i.e., diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum, bipolar disorder, or other depression/anxiety diagnoses and accompanying functional disability) on the Test of Grocery Shopping Skills (TOGSS), a performance-based naturalistic task. We compared TOGSS performance to two dimensions of real world functioning: directly observed real world grocery shopping and ratings of community functioning. Results indicated that the TOGSS was significantly associated with real life grocery shopping, in terms of both shopping accuracy ( r = 0.424) and time ( r = 0.491). Further, self-report and observer-rated methods of assessing real world shopping behaviors were significantly correlated ( r = 0.455). To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to directly compare a performance-based naturalistic skill assessment with carefully observed real world performance of that skill in people with serious mental illness. These findings support the feasibility and ecological validity of performance-based naturalistic assessment with the TOGSS.

The treatment consisted of 16 sessions of psychotherapy with manualised SM or CR in addition to 10 sessions with a medical doctor (psychoeducation and pharmacological treatment). The primary outcome was PTSD symptom severity (Harvard Trauma Questionnaire). Secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Ratings), quality of life (WHO-5), functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning, Sheehan Disability Scale), pain (Visual Analogue Scale) and somatisation (Symptom Checklist). There was no difference in the primary outcome between groups.

State paranoia and urban cycling,"Consistent with a continuum approach to mental health, a growing body of research has established that paranoia occurs in the general population. The stress-vulnerability model would predict an association between environments high in threat and the presence of state paranoia, even in those with low dispositional trait paranoia. The present research examines whether urban cycling, a naturalistic environment high in interpersonal threat, is associated with state paranoia—operationalised as an explicit perception that other road users intend the agent harm. 323 members of the general population who regularly cycled in London completed measures of state and trait paranoia, anxiety, depression and stress. The majority of the general population sample (70%) reported experiencing state paranoia during urban cycling, and there was no association between state paranoia and trait paranoia. Reported state paranoia was higher during urban cycling than when using the London underground (a lower threat environment) and reported state paranoia on the underground was associated with trait paranoia. The findings are consistent with the stress-vulnerability model of everyday paranoia.

Clinical depression and anxiety among ST-elevation myocardial infarction hospitalizations: Results from Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2004–2013,"Depression and anxiety are common among patients who have a major cardiovascular event. However, despite their frequency, there is a lack of evidence regarding the relationship between depression and/or anxiety and receiving revascularization in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) hospitalizations. Using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from the years 2004 to 2013, we assessed whether a clinical co-diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety decreases the likelihood of revascularization among STEMI hospitalizations. Our central finding is that, paradoxically, the odds of in-hospital mortality were lower among STEMI hospitalizations with a clinical co-diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety as compared to those without. We further discovered that clinical diagnoses of depression and/or anxiety were less prevalent among revascularized as compared to non-revascularized STEMI hospitalizations. However, the percentage of clinical diagnoses of depression and/or anxiety among STEMI hospitalizations increased at a similar rate over a 10-year period irrespective of revascularization status. In conclusion, these results are suggestive of the potentially underdiagnosed mental health issues surrounding major cardiovascular events, and indeed, chronic disease as a whole. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document and examine the “depression paradox” among a population of cardiac patients.

Oppositional behavior and longitudinal predictions of early adulthood mental health problems in chronic tic disorders,"Chronic tic disorders (TD) are associated with a number of psychological problems such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive behavior (OCB), oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) as well as anxious and depressive symptoms. ODD is often considered a risk factor for many psychological symptoms and recent work suggests that different ODD dimensions show independent predictions of later psychological problems. This study examined the longitudinal predictions between ODD dimensions of Irritability and Defiance and the most frequent comorbidities in TD from childhood to early adulthood. From an initial sample of 135, parent reports were obtained on 58 participants with TD using standard clinical questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Defiance symptoms decreased from baseline to follow-up whereas Irritability symptoms were more stable over time. In multiple regressions, Irritability in childhood predicted anxiety and OCB in early adulthood while Defiance in childhood predicted ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms in early adulthood. No developmental link was found for depressive symptoms. Results indicate that ODD dimensions are developmentally linked to both internalizing and externalizing adult mental health symptoms in TD.

Developing image sets for inducing obsessive-compulsive checking symptoms,"Visual stimuli are often used for obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom provocation in research studies. We tested the induction of anxiety and OC checking symptoms across different types of checking provocation stimuli in three populations: individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), individuals with checking symptoms but without a diagnosis of OCD, and control individuals with neither checking symptoms nor a clinical diagnosis. One set of provocative images depicted objects that are commonly associated with checking anxiety. Another set (‘enhanced provocative images’) depicted similar objects but also included contextual cues suggesting a specific harmful scenario that could occur. As expected, the enhanced provocative images were more effective at inducing anxiety and OC symptoms than the standard provocative images. Future studies requiring checking symptom provocation should therefore consider incorporating similarly suggestive images. Individuals with clinical OCD reported the greatest provocation in response to these images, followed by those with nonclinical checking, followed by control individuals. Thus, these stimuli are able to provoke OC checking symptoms and anxiety differentially across groups, with the intensity of provocation reflecting diagnostic status. All groups demonstrated a similar qualitative pattern of provocation across images. Finally, in all groups, reported anxiety closely tracked intrusive thoughts and checking urges.

Sex differences in traumatic events and psychiatric morbidity associated to probable posttraumatic stress disorder among Latino prisoners,"Latinos comprised 17.1% of the U.S. population and 33.1% of US prisoners, yet they are underrepresented in the psychopathology literature. Despite higher rates of trauma among incarcerated individuals than in the general population, most of the previous research in this area focused primarily on women samples, and very few studies examined sex differences in PTSD and traumatic experiences. In addition, there is a need for research assessing traumatic experiences and probable PTSD in men and women Latino inmates to inform culturally competent care and sex sensitive care for this vulnerable and underserved population. Our study examined whether men and women Latino inmates with probable Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), based on the cut off 40 or more symptoms on the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), differed significantly by the number of event types experienced, the type of potentially traumatizing event, and in co-occurring psychiatric conditions. A multi-stage sample design was used to select a probabilistic sample of 1,331 inmates from 26 penal institutions in PR of which 1179 participated in the study. Bivariate associations were calculated for each type of traumatic event and probable PTSD. Mean number of types of potentially traumatizing event experienced was comparable for both sexes (F = 3.83, M = 3.74) yet sex differences were found in the nature of the event. Women with probable PTSD had higher rates of experiencing rape and sexual abuse. Men had higher rates of experiencing combat in war, a life-threatening accident, of witnessing violence, and being threatened with a weapon. Men with significant ADHD symptoms in childhood and with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) during adulthood were almost 5 and 7 times as likely to score above threshold on the DTS whereas women were &gt; 3 times as likely in the presence of ADHD symptoms in childhood or depression during adulthood.

"Posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and suicidal ideation in veterans: Results from the Mind Your Heart study","Veterans with PTSD or depression are at increased risk for suicidal ideation. However, few studies have examined that risk in those with comorbid PTSD and depression, instead focusing on these disorders individually. This study investigates the association of suicidal ideation with comorbid PTSD and depression and examines the role of military and psychosocial covariates. We evaluated 746 veterans using the CAPS to assess PTSD and the PHQ-9 to measure depression and suicidal ideation. Covariates were assessed via validated self-report measures. 49% of veterans with comorbid PTSD and depression endorsed suicidal ideation, making them more likely to do so than those with depression alone (34%), PTSD alone (11%), or neither (2%). In multivariate logistic regression models, this association remained significant after controlling for demographics and symptom severity. Anger, hostility, anxiety, alcohol use, optimism and social support did not explain the elevated risk of suicidal ideation in the comorbid group in fully adjusted models. As suicidal ideation is a known risk factor for suicide attempts and completions, veterans with comorbid PTSD and depression represent a vulnerable group who may need more intensive monitoring and treatment to reduce risk of suicide.

"Self-reported nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and sex as self-injury (SASI): Relationship to abuse, risk behaviors, trauma symptoms, self-esteem and attachment","This study focuses on a conceptually unexplored behavior among adolescents who report deliberately using sex as a means of self-injury. In a large high school-based sample ( n = 5743), adolescents who engaged in sex as self-injury (SASI, n = 43) were compared to adolescents who reported direct nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI, n = 933) and those who reported both NSSI and SASI ( n = 82). Results showed that significantly more adolescents with SASI had experience of penetrating sexual abuse, as well as more sexual partners compared to those with NSSI. The SASI group also had higher levels of self-reported trauma symptoms, such as dissociation, posttraumatic stress and sexual concerns compared to those with NSSI, suggesting a distinct relationship between sexual abuse, trauma symptoms and engaging in sex as self-injury. There was no difference between the SASI and NSSI groups regarding experiences of emotional and physical abuse, self-esteem, parental care or overprotection or symptoms of depression, anxiety and anger. Adolescents who engaged in both NSSI + SASI stood out as a more severe and burdened group, with more experience of abuse, risk behaviors and impaired psychosocial health. Adolescents with traumatic experiences such as sexual abuse need to be assessed for SASI and vice versa.

"Validation, reliability, and specificity of CliniCom™ Psychiatric Assessment Software","The purpose of this study was to determine the specificity and reproducibility of CliniCom™ Psychiatric Assessment Software to appropriately diagnose five prevalent mental health disorders. This online assessment tool incorporates proprietary algorithms for its propensity assessment. Unlike other questionnaires, which require a survey per specific mental disorder, CliniCom can simultaneously assess multiple mental disorders for an individual. CliniCom was concordant with other commonly used assessment tools in diagnosing five prevalent disorders including: Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Social Phobia. The online tool was overall 78% concordant in diagnosing the same disorder during a test-retest analysis. When subjects exhibited two, three, or four disorders, the tool was less consistent in diagnosing the same set of disorders during the test-retest analysis (53% concordant). However, if evaluated as individual disorders within subjects, the more persistent disorders had a higher rate of concordance: MDD (83.3%), ADHD (81.0%), and OCD (68.4%). This study proposes CliniCom as an online assessment tool that demonstrates specificity in identifying specific psychiatric conditions and shows reproducibility over multiple administrations.

Minnesota Impulse Disorders Interview (MIDI): Validation of a structured diagnostic clinical interview for impulse control disorders in an enriched community sample,"Background: Disorders of impulsivity are common, functionally impairing, and highly relevant across different clinical and research settings. Few structured clinical interviews for the identification and diagnosis of impulse control disorders exist, and none have been validated in a community sample in terms of psychometric properties. Methods: The Minnesota Impulse control disorders Interview (MIDI v2.0) was administered to an enriched sample of 293 non-treatment seeking adults aged 18–35 years, recruited using media advertisements in two large US cities. In addition to the MIDI, participants undertook extended clinical interview for other mental disorders, the Barratt impulsiveness questionnaire, and the Padua obsessive-compulsive inventory. The psychometric properties of the MIDI were characterized. Results: In logistic regression, the MIDI showed good concurrent validity against the reference measures (versus gambling disorder interview, p &lt; 0.001; Barratt impulsiveness attentional and non-planning scores p &lt; 0.05), and good discriminant validity versus primarily non-impulsive symptoms, including against anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (all p &gt; 0.05). Test re-test reliability was excellent (0.95). Conclusions: The MIDI has good psychometric properties and thus may be a valuable interview tool for clinical and research studies involving impulse control disorders.

Information was collected on ADHD symptoms using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) Screener, while happiness was assessed with a single (3-point) measure. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis and a mediation analysis were performed to examine associations. Greater ADHD symptom severity was associated with higher odds for feeling less happy. Mood instability (percentage mediated 37.1%), anxiety disorder (35.6%) and depression (29.9%) were all important mediators of the association between ADHD and happiness. Given that happiness has been linked to a number of beneficial outcomes, the results of this study highlight the importance of diagnosing ADHD in adults and also of screening for and treating any comorbid psychiatric disorders in these individuals.

The moderating role of cognitive biases on the relationship between negative affective states and psychotic-like experiences in non-clinical adults,"Negative emotions and cognitive biases are important factors underlying psychotic symptoms and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs); however, it is not clear whether these factors interact when they influence psychotic phenomena. The aim of our study was to investigate whether psychosis-related cognitive biases moderate the relationship between negative affective states, i.e. anxiety and depression, and psychotic-like experiences. The study sample contains 251 participants who have never been diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. Anxiety, depression, cognitive biases, and psychotic-like experiences were assessed with self-report questionnaires. A moderation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between the study variables. The analyses revealed that the link between anxiety and positive PLEs is moderated by External Attribution bias, whereas the relationship between depression and positive PLEs is moderated by Attention to Threat bias. Attributional bias was also found to moderate the association between depression and negative subclinical symptoms; Jumping to Conclusions bias served as a moderator in the link between anxiety and depression and negative PLEs. Further studies in clinical samples are required to verify the moderating role of individual cognitive biases on the relationship between negative emotional states and full-blown psychotic symptoms.

Subjective cognitive function in hoarding disorder,"The aim of the present study was to examine subjective cognitive impairment among adult patients with hoarding disorder (HD). Eighty-three patients with HD and 46 age- and gender-matched healthy control (HC) participants received a diagnostic interview and completed measures of subjective cognitive functioning and motivations for saving behavior, as well as measures of hoarding severity, depression, anxiety, stress, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms. The HD group reported more impairment than did the HC group in domains of memory, distractibility, blunders, memory for names, and inattention. These differences generally remained significant when controlling for comorbid symptoms. In the HD group, the degree of cognitive impairment was significantly correlated with severity of saving and acquiring behaviors, although results were attenuated when controlling for comorbid symptoms (overall HD severity, but not saving behavior specifically, remained significantly correlated with cognitive impairment). Subjective cognitive impairment was further associated with a desire to save possessions in order to avoid forgetting, and these results remained significant when controlling for comorbid symptoms. These results comport with current behavioral models of HD that emphasize decision-making deficits, as well as clinician observations suggestive of impaired cognitive function, and complement a growing body of neuropsychological testing studies.

Examining predictors of help-seeking behaviours in patients with mood and anxiety symptoms,"Relatively little is known about individual characteristics that factor into the decision to seek help for mood and anxiety symptoms. The current study was undertaken in order to examine factors that predict the likelihood of seeking help for mood and anxiety symptoms amongst a clinical population. Patients ( N = 278) referred to a tertiary care clinic in Toronto, Canada were asked about their help-seeking behaviours (HSB) through initial intake assessments and self-administered questionnaires, including the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. Correlates of anxiety and depression were examined to determine whether they could predict HSB amongst individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder with or without comorbid Major Depressive Disorder, as well as Panic Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder. Psychiatric diagnoses were then examined to determine whether comorbidity and demographic factors impacted HSB. Results indicated that there were significant differences in anxiety and depression correlating mainly with anxiety sensitivity, as a predictor of HSB, and that there is a complex relationship between disorder type and demographic variables. The implications of these findings and suggested targeted interventions are discussed.

Are online poker problem gamblers sensation seekers?,"The purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between sensation seeking and online poker gambling in a community sample of adult online poker players, when controlling for age, gender, anxiety and depression. In total, 288 online poker gamblers were recruited. Sociodemographic data, gambling behavior (CPGI), sensation seeking (SSS), depression and anxiety (HADS) were evaluated. Problem online poker gamblers have higher sensation seeking scores (total, thrill and adventure, disinhibition and boredom susceptibility subscores) and depression scores than non-problem online poker gamblers. Being male, with total sensation seeking, disinhibition and depression scores are factors associated with online poker problem gambling. These findings are interesting in terms of harm reduction. For example, because disinhibition could lead to increased time and money spent, protective behavioral strategies like setting time and monetary limits should be encouraged in poker online gamblers.

Long-term treatment effect of trauma-affected refugees with flexible cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressants,"Few studies exist on the long-term effect of treatment of trauma-affected refugees. The purpose of this study was to estimate the long-term treatment effects of cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressants (sertraline and mianserin) in trauma-affected refugees. Follow-ups were conducted 6 and 18 months after a randomised controlled clinical trial. The included patients were refugees with war-related traumatic experiences, PTSD and without psychotic disorders. We found a small improvement over time in PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms and level of functioning, but the improvement was not associated with any specific treatment. Personality change after catastrophic experiences and life events influenced the symptom level at all follow-ups while depression at completion of treatment was associated with a steeper decline in symptom load at the follow-ups. In spite of the limited decline in symptom scores and treatment effects immediately after treatment, the condition of the treated trauma-affected refugees was significantly improved 6 and 18 months after treatment although the improvement was small.

The role of lifetime anxiety history in the course of bipolar spectrum disorders,"Individuals with bipolar spectrum disorder (BSD) frequently meet criteria for comorbid anxiety disorders, and anxiety may be an important factor in the etiology and course of BSDs. The current study examined the association of lifetime anxiety disorders with prospective manic/hypomanic versus major depressive episodes. Participants were 244 young adults (aged 17–26) with milder forms of BSDs (i.e., bipolar-II, cyclothymia, BD-NOS). First, bivariate analyses assessed differences in baseline clinical characteristics between participants with and without DSM-IV anxiety diagnoses. Second, negative binomial regression analyses tested whether lifetime anxiety predicted number of manic/hypomanic or major depressive episodes developed during the study. Third, survival analyses evaluated whether lifetime anxiety predicted time to onset of manic/hypomanic and major depressive episodes. Results indicated that anxiety history was associated with greater illness severity at baseline. Over follow-up, anxiety history predicted fewer manic/hypomanic episodes, but did not predict number of major depressive episodes. Anxiety history also was associated with longer time to onset of manic/hypomanic episodes, but shorter time to onset of depressive episodes. Findings corroborate past studies implicating anxiety disorders as salient influences on the course of BSDs. Moreover, results extend prior research by indicating that anxiety disorders may be linked with reduced manic/hypomanic phases of illness.

"Genetic correlations between wellbeing, depression and anxiety symptoms and behavioral responses to the emotional faces task in healthy twins","Currently there is a very limited understanding of how mental wellbeing versus anxiety and depression symptoms are associated with emotion processing behaviour. For the first time, we examined these associations using a behavioural emotion task of positive and negative facial expressions in 1668 healthy adult twins. Linear mixed model results suggested faster reaction times to happy facial expressions was associated with higher wellbeing scores, and slower reaction times with higher depression and anxiety scores. Multivariate twin modelling identified a significant genetic correlation between depression and anxiety symptoms and reaction time to happy facial expressions, in the absence of any significant correlations with wellbeing. We also found a significant negative phenotypic relationship between depression and anxiety symptoms and accuracy for identifying neutral emotions, although the genetic or environment correlations were not significant in the multivariate model. Overall, the phenotypic relationships between speed of identifying happy facial expressions and wellbeing on the one hand, versus depression and anxiety symptoms on the other, were in opposing directions. Twin modelling revealed a small common genetic correlation between response to happy faces and depression and anxiety symptoms alone, suggesting that wellbeing and depression and anxiety symptoms show largely independent relationships with emotion processing at the behavioral level.

Relevance of treated cocaine users’ retrospective memory of first cocaine use,"Little is known regarding between-subject variability in the subjective effects of first cocaine use. This study retrospectively assesses the subjective effects of first cocaine use in 160 current treatment-seeking cocaine use disorder patients. Subjective effects of first cocaine use were evaluated with an ad-hoc questionnaire used for cannabis effects. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, with resulting factors correlated with clinical variables (α = 0.05). Four factors emerged in the PCA, namely Anxiety (accounting for 21.5% of questionnaire variance), Disinhibition (17.3%), Tachypsychia (16%) and Calmness (13%). Male gender was associated with Disinhibition and Tachypsychia. Cocaine severity factors were associated with Disinhibition, Tachypsychia and Calmness. Opiate, sedative and poppers uses were associated with Anxiety, Tachypsychia and Calmness. The retrospective assessment of the subjective effects of first cocaine use shows significant variability. The different dimensions of subjective first effects are influenced by age, gender and previous substance use history, as well as characteristics of first cocaine use and cocaine-related outcomes.

"Associations of early childhood adversities with mental disorders, psychological functioning, and suitability for psychotherapy in adulthood","Childhood adversities frequently precede adulthood depression and anxiety. Yet, how they impact needed treatment duration, type or focus in these common disorders, is unclear. For developing more individualized and precise interventions, we investigated whether specific early adversities associate with patients’ distinct psychiatric problems, psychological vulnerabilities, and suitability for psychotherapy. A total of 221 depressed and anxious adult outpatients (excluding psychotic, severe personality, bipolar, and substance abuse disorders) referred from community, student, occupational, and private healthcare services filled the Childhood Family Atmosphere Questionnaire (CFAQ). They also filled self-reports on interpersonal behavior and problems, perceived competence, dispositional optimism, sense of coherence, defenses, and psychiatric history. Clinicians assessed the patients’ symptomatology, personality, object relations, cognitive performance, and psychotherapy suitability. Regression analyses were conducted. Childhood adversities predicted both worse current psychological functioning (e.g., interpersonal problems), and better clinician-rated capacities for benefiting from psychotherapy (e.g. self-reflection, capacity for interaction). Parental problems had the most numerous negative associations to psychological functioning. Best capacities for psychotherapy were predicted by recollected family unhappiness. Associations with psychiatric criteria were, however, largely non-significant. In conclusion, for psychosocial treatment planning, patients’ early adversities may indicate both vulnerability and resources. As childhood adversities are frequent among treatment-seekers, further studies examining how early adversities predict psychotherapy outcome are needed.

Are there clinical and neurophysiologic predictive factors for a positive response to HF-rTMS in patients with treatment-resistant depression?,"Better selection of patients with treatment-resistant depression for high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) would make the procedure more efficient. The objective of this study was to search for clinical and neurophysiologic predictors of therapeutic response with a special focus on the bipolar population. Forty patients (30 bipolar) underwent 20 daily sessions of HF-rTMS. Clinical outcome measures included the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Clinical Global Impression, and the Patient Global Impression. Neurophysiologic measurements included repeated estimation of the motor threshold and cortical silent period. Improvement was obtained in all psychometric scales, with no difference between unipolar and bipolar patients. Longer duration of the illness, higher number of prior hospitalizations, and more disturbed activity were associated with a worse response to rTMS, and somatic anxiety, sleep disorders, and health worries were positive predictors. In bipolar patients, longer disease duration and therapy with mirtazapine, mianserin, trazodone, hydroxyzine, and promethazine were associated with a worse response. Sleep disturbances, higher baseline motor threshold, and longer cortical silent period predicted a better response. In this study, we found several clinical and neurophysiologic predictors of better/worse responses to the standard HF-rTMS protocol. Our preliminary data need to be reproduced.

Cerebrospinal fluid FGF23 levels correlate with a measure of impulsivity,"Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived protein produced mainly by osteocytes and osteoblasts and at low levels in specific parts of the brain. It has been shown to associate with mood regulation. Lithium treatment gives rise to significant elevations of serum FGF23 levels in depressive patients. High peripheral blood FGF23 levels correlated with poor cognitive performance in hemodialysis patients. However, no direct evidence demonstrates a relationship between FGF23 and mood regulation. In this study, we aimed to measure the concentration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FGF23 and to explore its relationship with a cluster of emotional characteristics. We measured CSF FGF23 levels in 96 male Chinese subjects. All subjects completed the Chinese version of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS 11), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). CSF FGF23 levels ranged from 12.8 to 99.3 pg/mL. Negative correlations were found between CSF FGF23 concentrations and BIS non-planning, BIS cognition and BIS total score (all p &lt; 0.05). Nevertheless, except for the BIS cognition scores, these correlations became insignificant after Bonferroni correction. No correlations were found between CSF FGF23 concentrations and BDI or SAS scores. These findings suggest that CSF FGF23 levels correlate with a measure of impulsivity.

Higher concentration of interleukin 6—A possible link between major depressive disorder and childhood abuse,"Little is known about the correlation between IL-6 and childhood abuse and neglect which may be risk factors for the development of affective disorders in adulthood. The aim of this study was to analyze differences in serum concentrations of IL-6 between patients with major depressive disorder and healthy controls, and to investigate possible correlations with adverse childhood experiences. Peripheral venous blood samples were obtained from 64 patients who fulfilled DSM-IV-R criteria for a current major depressive episode without psychotic symptoms (MDD) and 53 healthy controls, matched for age and gender. Participants were assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). The concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in patients with major depressive disorder compared to healthy controls. The total score of childhood trauma questionnaire highly statistically significantly correlated with IL-6 levels in patient group. Persons who were physically abused, physically neglected and emotionally abused had higher levels of IL-6. Interleukin 6 as a pro-inflammatory immune marker could be an important developmental mediator linking physical and emotional abuse in early life with the development of depressive disorder in adulthood.

"Objective measures of sleep in fibromyalgia syndrome: Relationship to clinical, psychiatric, and immunological variables","We aimed to investigate the changes in the objective and subjective sleep variables during painful episodes of fibromyalgia and post-episode period, and to evaluate the impact of the sleep variables on the current clinical, psychological, and immunologic parameters. Thirty-one consecutive patients who were referred to the Erenköy Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Polyclinic with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia were evaluated before and in the sixth week of the acute pain treatment. The sleep variables were measured by polysomnography, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The clinical and psychiatric assessment of patients was performed by using Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire; Patient Health Questionnaire-Somatic, Anxiety, and Depressive Symptoms; and Visual Analog Scale. Serum pro-inflammatory molecules were measured to evaluate the immunological status. The pain treatment significantly affected subjective sleep variables, psychiatric variables, clinical variables, and IL-6 levels. The subjective sleep parameters, clinical and psychiatric variables, and IL-6 levels were improved with pain treatment in fibromyalgia. The objective sleep variables, IL-1 and TNF-alpha levels were not significantly improved with the pain treatment, and they were not related to clinical presentation of patients with fibromyalgia. Subjective variability of sleep contributes to the clinical presentation, suggesting that the objective structure is trait-specific with IL-1 and TNF-alpha.

Social anxiety and risk factors in patients with schizophrenia: Relationship with duration of untreated psychosis,"Social anxiety is commonly reported as a comorbid condition among people with schizophrenia. The aims of this study were to elucidate the associations between demographic/clinical features and social anxiety. A total of 207 outpatients with schizophrenia underwent assessments for social anxiety, psychiatric symptoms, social cognition, cognitive function, social functioning, and quality of life (QOL). To confirm the prediction model for social anxiety, we conducted multiple linear regressions using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) score as an outcome variable and demographic/clinical variables as predictors. Of the 207 patients, 30 (14.5%) met the criteria for social anxiety disorder and 109 (52.7%) had a mean LSAS score higher than 30, suggesting that their social anxiety symptoms had reached a clinical level. Social anxiety was significantly correlated with psychiatric symptoms, social functioning, and QOL, whereas significant correlations with social cognition and cognitive function were not observed. A multiple regression analysis identified social functioning, gender, age of onset, and duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) as predictors that were most closely associated with the LSAS score. We confirmed that social anxiety symptoms were highly prevalent among outpatients with schizophrenia and were closely associated with social functioning and DUP, rather than social cognitive impairments.

This article has been removed: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/ article-withdrawal). This article has been retracted at the request of the authors and Editor-in-Chief of the journal. It was brought to the authors' attention that there were several significant data analytic errors linked to the data entry and the software program that was used in the published meta-analysis comparing the effect of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo administration on psychiatric symptoms. Correcting these errors changed the main result of this study. The authors greatly apologize to the journal, the reviewers, and readers for the errors in the original article, and would like to thank the readers who brought the errors to their attention. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-27889-001). Clinical trials of intranasal administration of oxytocin for treating psychiatric problems have yielded mixed results. To conduct a quantitative review of placebo-controlled clinical trials of intranasally-administered oxytocin (OT) for psychiatric symptoms, manual and electronic searches using PubMed and PsycINFO were conducted. Of 1828 entries, 16 placebo-controlled studies totaling 330 participants were included in the analysis. The overall placebo-controlled effect size was moderately strong (Hedges' g = 0.67) and robust as suggested by the fail-safe N and funnel plot analysis. OT reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety, autism/repetitive behaviors, psychotic symptoms, and general psychopathology. In the combined sample, symptom reduction was moderated by frequency of administration. Publication year and diagnostic category did not moderate the effect of OT on the clinical outcome measures. We conclude that intranasal administration of OT is a potentially useful intervention for reducing psychiatric symptoms. However, more studies are needed to determine the best treatment target and to identify the mechanism of treatment change.

"Anxiety sensitivity and cannabis use problems, perceived barriers for quitting, and fear of quitting","Cannabis is among the most widely used psychoactive substances in the United States, and rates of cannabis use and cannabis-related problems are increasing. Anxiety sensitivity, or the fear of aversive interoceptive sensations, may be relevant to better understanding cannabis use problems and other significant cannabis use processes (e.g., beliefs about quitting). Previous research has primarily focused on the global anxiety sensitivity construct; however, anxiety sensitivity lower-order facets (Cognitive Concerns, Physical Concerns, and Social Concerns) tend to be differentially related to substance use processes in non-cannabis specific studies. The current study therefore explored anxiety sensitivity lower-order facets in relation to cannabis use problems, perceived barriers for cannabis cessation, and abstinence phobia (fear of not using cannabis) among a community sample of 203 cannabis-using adults. Results indicated that anxiety sensitivity Cognitive Concerns were significantly associated with each of the dependent measures and these effects were not explained by shared variance with the other lower-order factors or a range of other covariates (e.g., tobacco use). The present findings suggest future work may benefit from focusing on the role of anxiety sensitivity Cognitive Concerns in the maintenance of cannabis use.

In this sample of 200 participants, the majority had a chief complaint of chest pain and 46.5% met SCID criteria for panic-related anxiety. The PDSQ-PD demonstrated only fair operating characteristics for panic attacks (AUC = 0.57) and good operating characteristics for panic disorder (AUC = 0.79). The PHQ-PD achieved adequate operating characteristics (AUC = 0.66) for panic attacks and good operating characteristics for panic disorder (AUC = 0.76) using a modified scoring algorithm or a single screening question (AUC = 0.72).

"Close relation of interpersonal sensitivity with negative core beliefs about the self, the central construct of cognitive vulnerability to depression","Interpersonal sensitivity is a personality trait linked with anxious attachment conceptualized in attachment theory. This personality trait is comprised of four components, i.e., interpersonal awareness, separation anxiety, timidity and fragile inner-self, which are measured by the corresponding subscales of the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (IPSM). Meanwhile, one study showed that six items of the IPSM tentatively used as negative self-schemas predicted the onset of depression. To clarify if interpersonal sensitivity reflects cognitive vulnerability, we examined the relation of this personality trait with negative core beliefs about the self. The study population consisted of 335 Japanese volunteers. Interpersonal sensitivity was measured by the IPSM, and negative core beliefs about the self were assessed by the negative-self subscale of the Brief Core Schema Scales (BCSS). Multiple regression analysis showed that scores of the four subscales of the IPSM were strongly correlated with those of the negative-self subscale of the BCSS (P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, sequential equation modeling demonstrated that the four components of interpersonal sensitivity were strongly predicted by core beliefs of negative-self (P &lt; 0.001). The present study shows that interpersonal sensitivity is closely related to negative core beliefs about the self, suggesting that this personality trait can be regarded as a cognitive vulnerability to depression.

An investigation of emotion recognition training to reduce symptoms of social anxiety in adolescence,"This study aimed to examine the effect of emotion recognition training on social anxiety symptoms among adolescents, aged 15–18 years. The study included a screening session, which identified participants who scored above a cut-off on a self-report measure of social anxiety for enrolment into a randomized controlled trial (Clinical Trials ID: NCT02550379). Participants were randomized to an intervention condition designed to increase the perception of happiness over disgust in ambiguous facial expressions or a sham intervention control condition, and completed self-report measures of social anxiety, fear of negative evaluation, anxiety-related disorders, and depressive symptoms. The intervention group demonstrated a strong shift in the balance point at which they perceived happiness over disgust in ambiguous facial expressions. This increase in positive perception was not associated with any changes in the primary outcome of social anxiety; however, some evidence of improvement in symptomatology was observed on one of a number of secondary outcomes. Those in the intervention group had lower depression symptoms at 2-week follow-up, compared to those in the control group who received the sham intervention training. Potential reasons for why the shift in balance point measurement was not associated with a concurrent shift in symptoms of social anxiety are discussed.

Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 secretions in eating disorders: Correlations with psychopathological aspects of the disorders,"Hormonal alterations in Eating Disorders (ED) may result from the biochemical stress of malnutrition/starvation. The correlations between some hormonal impairments, particularly of the somatotropic axis, and the psychopathological aspects of ED are still undefined. We measured the plasma concentrations of the somatotropic hormone (GH) and the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in 136 patients with various forms of ED, 65 with restricted Anorexia Nervosa (ANR), 19 with bingeing-purging Anorexia Nervosa (ANBP), 12 with purging-non binging Anorexia Nervosa (ANP), 26 with Bulimia Nervosa (BN), 8 with ED not otherwise specified-anorexic type (EDNOS-AN), 7 with ED not otherwise specified-bulimic type (EDNOS-BN) and in 30 healthy controls. Psychological assessment of patients and controls was performed using two outpatient rating scales, the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2) and the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90). Significant negative or positive correlations were observed between GH-IGF-1 concentrations and impairments on several EDI-2 subscales (drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, interoceptive awareness, sense of ineffectiveness, interpersonal distrust, maturity fear) and on SCL-90 subitems (depression, hostility, obsessivity compulsivity, anxiety), suggesting a possible hormonal modulatory effect on specific aspects of ED psychopathology.

"Childhood adversities, bonding, and personality in social anxiety disorder with alcohol use disorder","Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is frequently associated with alcohol use disorders (abuse/dependence). However, there has been little research on the characteristics of this subgroup so far. In the current study we investigated individuals with SAD and comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) with regard to socialization experiences and personality. The sample comprised 410 individuals diagnosed with SAD by the Structured Clinical Interview of DSM-IV. 108 participants with comorbid AUD were compared to 302 participants without comorbid AUD concerning traumatic experiences during childhood and adolescence (Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire; ACE), parental bonding (Parental Bonding Instrument; PBI), and personality (Temperament and Character Inventory; TCI). MANCOVA with covariates sex and depression displayed that individuals with SAD plus AUD reported significantly more traumatic events during childhood and adolescence, lower levels of maternal care, as well as lower cooperativeness. Our results highlight that adverse childhood experiences and unfavourable maternal bonding characterize individuals suffering from SAD plus AUD. These experiences might be reflected in a personality-based tendency to distance themselves from others, which corresponds to low scores on the character dimension cooperativeness. A deeper understanding of personality and specific socialization experiences is necessary to develop new treatment options in this clinically challenging subgroup.

Almost 56% of the entire sample was using BZDs at the moment of the assessment, and 74.5% described having used them at some point during their lifetimes. The duration of psychiatric treatment and a lifetime history of PD, but not any other “transdiagnostic” measure of severity (such as the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale, the Social Phobia Inventory, the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-36, and the Beck Inventories) were independent risk factors for current prescription of BZDs. Patients who continued to use BZDs differed from patients who stopped them by being older (both currently and when firstly seen in the clinic), by having a later age at onset of their most significant anxiety disorder, by being more agoraphobic/avoidant, and by believing to be less capable of stopping their BZDs for the fear of not being able to sleep.

Gender differences in stress hormone response regulates effects of mindfulness in stress related disorder,"Comments on an article by E.A. Hoge et al. (see record 2017-03827-001). Hoge et al. examined the effect of mindfulness intervention on generalized anxiety disorder by demonstrating change in measured stress biomarkers before and after the intervention. The findings indicated Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program may enhance resilience to stress in generalized anxiety disorder. In this study, Hoge et al. examined stress biomarker linked to stress and inflammation in blood sample for indication of acute and chronic stress. Hoge et al. used ACTH and pro-inflammatory cytokines as a biomarker of stress to determine the effect of mindfulness on stress reduction. Taking previous findings into account, gender wise comparison of the level of biomarkers before and after MBSR intervention would be more expedient rather than overall longitudinal comparison among subjects in the study by Hoge et al. Presenting the results in terms of gender difference would have been more informative given the role of female sex hormone in inhibition of ACTH. Immunological studies as such by Hoge et al. are more edifying on application of mindfulness intervention in wide range of disorders currently.

Adult insecure attachment plays a role in hyperarousal and emotion dysregulation in Insomnia Disorder,"Studies show that unhelpful cognitive processes play a role in insomnia, whereas interpersonal factors have been less studied in insomnia. Attachment theory can be used as a cognitive-interpersonal framework for understanding insomnia. Because attachment insecurity (vs security) is related to psychiatric disorders the objective was to study the attachment style in insomnia. To this aim sixty-four subjects with Insomnia Disorder (DSM-5) and 38 good sleepers were evaluate in a cross-sectional study with: Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ), Arousal Predisposition Scale (APS), Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS) and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Differences in means between groups were assessed using t-test or Mann-Whitney U/Wilcoxon test. Linear/multiple regression analyses were performed. Subjects with insomnia (mean age 47.1 + 13 yrs) presented an insecure attachment style and higher scores in all the scales (ASQ, APS, PSAS, DERS p &lt; 0.0001) than good sleepers (mean age 48.2 + 14 yrs). After taking into account anxiety/depressive symptoms, insecure attachment was related to hyperarousal trait (p = 0.02), pre-sleep hyperarousal (p = 0.04) and emotion dysregulation (p = 0.002). In conclusion subjects with insomnia showed an insecure attachment which was related to hyperarousal trait, pre-sleep hyperarousal and emotion dysregulation. It may intervene in the trajectory of insomnia starting from predisposition to perpetuation. Clinical implications are discussed.

Serotonin transporter and behavioral traits,"Comments on an article by A. Talati et al. (see record 2017-24741-033). Talati et al. concluded that “5-HTTLPR predicts higher impulsivity, hostility, and neuroticism, and that impulsivity could serve as a useful independent outcome or intermediary phenotype in genetic studies of anxiety.” In fact, the observation on the relationship between the short polymorphism of 5-HTTLPR and impulsivity is similar to that seen for the monoamine oxidase A polymorphism. These observations suggest an important influence of basic genetic background on behavior. The short polymorphisms of 5-HTTLPR has a lower molecular weight than the long polymorphism, indicating lower molecular function per molecule of 5-HTTLPR. Hence, a higher serotonin level can be expected in individuals with the short polymorphism, and the increased level might be related to agitated behavior. This speculation is concordant with previous publications on the effect of molecular weight and its clinical impact in other polymorphism-related medical disorders.

Social anxiety and detection of facial untrustworthiness: Spatio-temporal oculomotor profiles,"Cognitive models posit that social anxiety is associated with biased attention to and interpretation of ambiguous social cues as threatening. We investigated attentional bias (selective early fixation on the eye region) to account for the tendency to distrust ambiguous smiling faces with non-happy eyes (interpretative bias). Eye movements and fixations were recorded while observers viewed video-clips displaying dynamic facial expressions. Low (LSA) and high (HSA) socially anxious undergraduates with clinical levels of anxiety judged expressers’ trustworthiness. Social anxiety was unrelated to trustworthiness ratings for faces with congruent happy eyes and a smile, and for neutral expressions. However, social anxiety was associated with reduced trustworthiness rating for faces with an ambiguous smile, when the eyes slightly changed to neutrality, surprise, fear, or anger. Importantly, HSA observers looked earlier and longer at the eye region, whereas LSA observers preferentially looked at the smiling mouth region. This attentional bias in social anxiety generalizes to all the facial expressions, while the interpretative bias is specific for ambiguous faces. Such biases are adaptive, as they facilitate an early detection of expressive incongruences and the recognition of untrustworthy expressers (e.g., with fake smiles), with no false alarms when judging truly happy or neutral faces.

"Alcohol withdrawal hallucinations in the general population, an epidemiological study","Hallucinations are sometimes encountered in the course of alcohol withdrawal; however, both the factors predisposing to alcohol withdrawal hallucinations (AWH) and the implications of AWH with respect to the mechanisms of hallucinations remain unclear. To clarify these issues, we used data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) to investigate the demographic correlates, alcohol-use clinical patterns, and psychiatric comorbidities in two groups: drinkers with and without a history of AWH. We estimated the odds ratios for studied factors and used logistic regression analyses to compare the two groups. We found that over 2% of drinkers reported AWH (758 of a sample of 34,533 subjects). Alcohol tolerance and withdrawal seizures were highly associated with AWH, and exposure to alcohol during brain development was associated with a 10-fold increase in AWH compared to exposure during adulthood. African Americans, Native Americans, and unmarried subjects, as well as subjects with lower levels of education and lower levels of income were more likely to experience AWH. Furthermore, those with a history of AWH had higher odds ratios for most psychiatric illnesses than those without such history—yet of anxiety disorders, only panic was associated with AWH. These associations suggest that higher levels of education and of standard of living could protect against AWH; while social isolation, hypervigilance, exposure to alcohol during brain development, and long and severe exposure to alcohol could predispose to AWH.

Profile of psychiatric symptoms in methamphetamine users in China: Greater risk of psychiatric symptoms with a longer duration of use,"Chronic methamphetamine (MA) use is associated with psychiatric symptoms. This study explored pattern of co-occurring psychiatric symptoms in MA users and their relationship to duration of MA use. A cross-sectional study was conducted among MA users at the Shenzhen Compulsory Drug Detoxification Center from April 2012 to October 2015. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory were used to assess psychiatric symptoms. Among 1277 MA users, 57.6% participants had any type of psychiatric symptoms including depressive, anxiety and psychotic symptoms. A dose-response relationship was found between duration of MA use and risk of psychiatric symptoms. The odds ratios (OR) of depressive symptoms increased with the duration of MA use (1–5 years vs. &lt; 1 year: 1.74 [95% CI, 1.24–2.42]; ≥ 5 years vs. &lt; 1 year: 2.07 [1.19–3.61]), so did the ORs of co-occurring anxiety and depressive symptoms (1–5 years: 1.74 [1.20–2.51]; ≥ 5 years: 3.09 [1.76–5.40]). Methamphetamine-dependent individuals were four-times more likely to experience any type of psychiatric symptoms than non-dependent users. The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms was high in chronic MA users and increased with MA use duration. Early prevention and treatment strategies targeting both MA use and associated psychiatric symptoms are needed.

A network analysis of eating disorder symptoms and characteristics in an inpatient sample,"Eating disorders (EDs) are characterized by symptoms that reflect disturbed eating habits. Available data on EDs largely reflects a traditional latent variable model, whereby symptoms reflect an underlying entity. The network model is an alternative approach where ED symptoms do not reflect an inferred, unobservable category or dimension, but rather are themselves constitutive of the disorder. In the present study, data from ED patients ( n = 5193) that completed the Eating Disorders Inventory—2 ( EDI-2 ; Garner, 1991) before and after inpatient treatment were used to identify symptoms (i.e., body dissatisfaction) and characteristics (i.e., perfectionism) central to EDs. Results revealed that interoceptive awareness and ineffectiveness, but not body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness, were central to the ED network at admission and discharge. Although effect sizes were small, multiple regression analyses revealed that ineffectiveness at admission predicted discharge BMI (over and above interoceptive awareness and BMI at admission) and discharge depression (over and above interoceptive awareness and depression at admission), but not discharge anxiety. These findings suggest that interoceptive awareness and ineffectiveness are central symptoms of EDs that may have implications for treatment outcome. The implications of these findings for conceptualizing the nature and treatment of EDs are discussed.

Factors associated with lifetime suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in outpatients with substance use disorders,"Risks factors for suicide are multiple and highly prevalent in addicted patients (previous suicide attempts, substance abuse, impulsivity, history of sexual abuse and other factors). The aim of this study is to identify and to compare the clinical and socio-demographic profile of SUD outpatients with lifetime suicidal behavior (previous suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts) and to analyze the factors related to it. A retrospective cohort study of 696 addicted patients, according to DSM-IV-TR criteria (APA, 2000) were collected from the Addiction Unit of Vall d’Hebron University Hospital. Lifetime suicidal ideation in addicted patients is associated with presence of: borderline personality disorder (BPD), depressive disorders, sexual abuse, polydrug abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and motor impulsivity. The factors associated with suicide attempts were: borderline personality disorder, lifetime abuse (whether emotional, physical or sexual), co-occurrent psychotic disorders, polydrug abuse, anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms. We conclude that previous suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempts should be considered in the clinical care of addicted patients. Factors related to both suicidal behaviors share similarities and differences according to our findings and need to be deeply explored in the future.

Metacognitive beliefs as psychological predictors of social functioning: An investigation with young people at risk of psychosis,"Poor social functioning has been found to be present in those at risk for psychosis. This study aimed to examine metacognitive beliefs as potential predictors of structured activity (measure of social functioning) in those with an At Risk Mental State (ARMS). Regression and correlation analyses were conducted. The sample included 109 young people. Age was found to be positively correlated to structured activity. Metacognitive beliefs concerning uncontrollability and danger of worry were found to negatively predict structured activity. This was after controlling for age, gender, treatment allocation, cognitive schemas, positive symptom severity, social anxiety, and depression. Metacognitive danger items were most important. Age was the only control variable found to be an independent predictor of structured activity in the regression model, despite negative bi-variate relationships with structured activity found across three cognitive schema subscales and social anxiety. This is the first study to find that higher negative metacognitive beliefs about uncontrollability and danger predict lower social functioning in an ARMS sample, and that the perception of thoughts being dangerous was of particular importance. Psychological interventions should consider targeting this metacognitive dimension to increase social functioning. Future longitudinal research is required to strengthen findings in this area.

Both anxiety and joint laxity determine the olfactory features in panic disorder,"Previous research showed a high sensitivity in sensorial modalities in panic disorder (PD). This disorder has been consistently associated to the joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS). In non-clinical samples, this collagen alteration has been also related to an enhanced sensitivity in some sensorial modalities. The main aim of this study is to explore the olfactory functioning in PD in relation to JHS. Sixty patients with PD and sixty healthy controls performed the Sniffin’ Sticks Test (SST) (threshold subtest), and completed the Affective Impact of Odors scale (AIO), the Relational Scale of Olfaction (EROL), and the Odor Awareness Scale (OAS). Clinical symptom rating scales and JHS assessment were also obtained. PD patients showed enhanced odor acuity, greater reactivity to smells and also increased odor awareness compared to the healthy controls. Within the patients group, those suffering from JHS displayed higher functioning in all olfactory domains compared to the non-JHS ones. The JHS and anxiety measures emerged as predictor variables of the olfactory function. The present findings highlight the importance of the olfactory function in PD and underline that both, JHS and anxiety, determine the olfactory characteristics in this disorder.

The effect of mindfulness meditation training on biological acute stress responses in generalized anxiety disorder,"Mindfulness-Based interventions have increased in popularity in psychiatry, but the impact of these treatments on disorder-relevant biomarkers would greatly enhance efficacy and mechanistic evidence. If Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is successfully treated, relevant biomarkers should change, supporting the impact of treatment and suggesting improved resilience to stress. Seventy adults with GAD were randomized to receive either Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or an attention control class; before and after, they underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) concentrations were calculated for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. MBSR participants had a significantly greater reduction in ACTH AUC compared to control participants. Similarly, the MBSR group had a greater reduction in inflammatory cytokines’ AUC concentrations. We found larger reductions in stress markers for patients with GAD in the MBSR class compared to control; this provides the first combined hormonal and immunological evidence that MBSR may enhance resilience to stress.

"Serum levels of cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and oxytocin in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder combined presentation with and without comorbid conduct disorder","The present study aimed to investigate serum cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and oxytocin levels of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) combined presentation and those diagnosed with ADHD combined presentation and coexisting conduct disorder. A total of 74 drug-naive children with ADHD combined presentation alone, 32 children with ADHD combined presentation + conduct disorder, and 42 healthy controls were included. The severities of ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms were assessed via parent- and teacher-rated questionnaires. The severity of aggression, anxiety, and depression symptoms of the children were assessed by the self-report inventories. Independent of potential confounders, including age, sex, pubertal stage, and severity of depression and anxiety, serum oxytocin levels of the ADHD combined presentation + conduct disorder group were significantly lower than those of both the ADHD combined presentation alone and control groups. There was also a trend for the ADHD combined presentation + conduct disorder group to show lower serum DHEA levels than that of the ADHD combined presentation alone group. However, serum cortisol levels did not show significant alterations among the groups. These findings suggest that oxytocin and DHEA may play a role in the pathophysiology of conduct disorder, at least in the presence of ADHD combined presentation.

Clinical predictors of gaming abstinence in help-seeking adult problematic gamers,"Research into the effectiveness of interventions for problematic gaming has been limited by a lack of data concerning the clinical characteristics of voluntary treatment-seekers; the nature and history of their gaming problems; and, their reasons for seeking help. The study aimed to identify variables predictive of short-term commitment to gaming abstinence following initial voluntary contact with an online help service. A total of 186 adult gamers with gaming-related problems were recruited online. Participants completed the DSM-5 Internet gaming disorder (IGD) checklist, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21, Internet Gaming Cognition Scale, Gaming Craving Scale, and Gaming Quality of Life Scale. A one-week follow up survey assessed adherence with intended gaming abstinence. Abstainers were less likely to have withdrawal symptoms and less likely to play action shooting games. Participants with mood symptoms (40% of the total) reported significantly more IGD symptoms, stronger maladaptive gaming cognitions (e.g., overvaluing game rewards), more previous occurrences of gaming problems, and poorer quality of life. However, mood symptoms did not predict abstinence from or continuation of gaming. Adults with gaming disorder seeking help to reduce their gaming may benefit initially from strategies that manage withdrawal and psychoeducation about riskier gaming activities.

Clinically significant personality traits in individuals at high risk of developing psychosis,"It is still unclear to what extent personality may influence the development of psychosis. We aimed to explore significant personality traits in individuals at high-risk (HR) for psychosis. Personalities of forty HR individuals and a matched sample of 40 healthy volunteers (HVs) were evaluated with the Millon Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI-III). They were also assessed with the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (BDI-II and BAI), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 6.0.0). Fisher's exact test was employed to compare frequency of traits. Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression were used to establish relationships between traits and symptoms, and the effect of age, sex and symptoms on such traits. Most HR individuals (97.5%) had at least one significant trait; 75% had personality disorders, mainly depressive, borderline or schizotypal. Only histrionic and narcissistic traits were more prevalent in HVs. Negative symptoms were related to schizoid and paranoid traits. Depression was more severe with borderline traits. Most HR individuals (67.6%) had more than one DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis, mainly depressive/anxiety disorders. Transition rate was low (5%). Certain personality profiles may not be markers for conversions to psychosis but contribute to high morbidity in HR individuals.

Correlates of bullying and its relationship with psychiatric disorders in Lebanese adolescents,"Understanding the contextual determinants of bullying behavior is pivotal for effective interventions. This paper describes the prevalence of bullying, its socio-demographic correlates and factors influencing its relationship with psychiatric disorders among a population-based sample of adolescents from Beirut recruited through a two-stage cluster sampling design. Recruited participants (n = 510) and their parents completed a battery of questionnaires and interviews including the Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA) and the Peer-Relations Questionnaire (PRQ). We found that around 30% of the adolescent participants were involved in bullying. Younger age, lower family income, lower parental education, receiving private tutoring, having an anxiety disorder and having a disruptive behavior disorder were correlated with being bullied by peers while lower family income, repeating a school-grade, and having a disruptive behavior disorder were associated with bullying others. Several factors including gender, age group, family income, and attending private versus public schools moderated the relationship between bullying behavior and having psychiatric disorders.

"Cyberchondria: Overlap with health anxiety and unique relations with impairment, quality of life, and service utilization","Cyberchondria refers to a clinical phenomenon in which repeated Internet searches regarding medical information result in excessive concerns about physical health. Cyberchondria is positively associated with symptoms of health anxiety, though it remains unclear as to whether cyberchondria poses a unique public burden. The current study replicated previous findings regarding the relationship between cyberchondria and health anxiety, and extended those findings to examine the extent to which health anxiety and cyberchondria may be differentially associated with public health outcomes, including impairment, quality of life, and service utilization. Community participants ( N = 462) recruited via online crowdsourcing completed a battery of self-report questionnaires assessing cyberchondria, health anxiety, and measures of public health outcomes, including the WHOQOL and SDS. Bifactor latent variable modeling indicated that cyberchondria was closely related to, yet importantly distinct from, health anxiety. Moreover, when accounting for overlap with health anxiety, cyberchondria was associated with increased functional impairment and healthcare utilization. Results provide further support for the identification of cyberchondria as a distinct set of clinical symptoms that may pose a significant public health burden. Future research should determine ways in which to treat and/or prevent symptoms.

PTSD and depression in adult survivors of flood fury in Kashmir: The payoffs of social support,"Exposure to disasters such as floods predisposes individuals for psychological distress such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Researchers exploring the association between flood-exposure and psychopathology attempt to understand the conditions and mechanisms through which potential benefits may occur. One such potential factor that may contribute to resilience in the face of disaster is social support system. However, there is scarcity of researches concerning the protective effects of social support following floods, in adult samples. Thus, the present study examined the moderating and indirect effects of perceived social support from family and friends in the association between flood-exposure and symptoms of PTSD and depression. The study was a cross sectional in nature. Survey data were collected from 87 adult survivors of flood fury in Kashmir valley, aged 30–40. High level of family and friends’ support reduced the association between flood-exposure and symptoms of PTSD and depression whereas a low level of such support enhanced this association. Results also suggested that family support carried a significant proportion of variance in predicting depression. Given the potential for negative mental health outcomes following natural disasters, efforts to enhance adults’ social support may be especially important.

We subsequently randomly assigned subjects to either 1) a smart phone loss group or 2) social media accounts loss group. We asked them to imagine losing two days’ access to the technology in their respective group, and rate associated symptoms using the DASS-21. Compared to subjects in the smartphone loss group, social media loss subjects evidenced stronger relations between suppressive emotion regulation with depression, anxiety and stress from imagined loss. Controlling for age and gender, social media loss subjects’ increased use of suppression, and decreased use of cognitive reappraisal in emotion regulation, were related to depression, stress and (for suppression only) anxiety due to imagined lost social media. Emotion regulation was not related to psychopathology for subjects in the smartphone loss scenario.

The traumatized body: Long-term PTSD and its implications for the orientation towards bodily signals,"Orientation to bodily signals is defined as the way somatic sensations are attended, perceived and interpreted. Research suggests that trauma exposure, particularly the pathological reaction to trauma (i.e., PTSD), is associated with catastrophic and frightful orientation to bodily signals. However, little is known regarding the long-term ramifications of trauma exposure and PTSD for orientation to bodily signals. Less is known regarding which PTSD symptom cluster manifests in the ‘somatic route’ through which orientation to bodily signals is altered. The current study examined the long-term implications of trauma and PTSD trajectories on orientation to bodily signals. Fifty-nine ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) and 44 controls were assessed for PTSD along three time-points (18, 30 and 35 years post-war). Orientation to bodily signals (pain catastrophizing and anxiety sensitivity–physical concerns) was assessed at T3. Participants with a chronic PTSD trajectory had higher pain catastrophizing compared to participants with no PTSD. PTSD symptom severity at T2 and T3 mediated the association between captivity and orientation. Among PTSD symptom clusters, hyperarousal at two time-points and intrusion at three time-point mediated the association between captivity and orientation. These findings allude to the cardinal role of long-term PTSD in the subjective experience of the body following trauma.

Aggression ( p = 0.003), sexual ( p = 0.007) and religious ( p = 0.023) obsessions and rituelistic ( p = 0.000) compulsions were significantly higher in the group with CTQ ≥ 35. Mild correlation was detected between the SPS score and the scores of CTQ. Correlation remained even when the effect of BAS and BDS scores were excluded. At the end of our study, childhood traumas were found to be associated with obsessive symptoms.

Public stigma of prolonged grief disorder: An experimental study,"Prolonged grief disorder (PGD), characterized by severe, persistent and disabling grief, is being considered for inclusion in the International Classification of Diseases’ 11 (ICD-11) and a related disorder, Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder (PCBD), is included for further investigation in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5). Establishing diagnoses for pathological grief may lead to stigmatization. Additionally, it has been argued that people experiencing severe grief responses after loss of non-family members (i.e., disenfranchised grief) may experience more stigmatizing reactions. Yet, no research to date has investigated this. To fill this gap in knowledge, 379 adults from the general population were randomly allocated to read one of 4 different vignettes of a person with and without a grief disorder diagnosis who had lost a friend or a spouse. After reading the vignettes, we assessed: 1) characteristics ascribed to the person, 2) emotional reactions to the person, and 3) desire for social distance. Notably, people with a diagnosis were attributed relatively more negative characteristics, and elicited more anger, anxiety and pro-social emotions and a stronger desire for social distance. Stigmatization and its negative consequences appear a valid concern to the establishment of pathological grief disorders in diagnostic manuals.

27 ways to meet PTSD: Using the PTSD-checklist for DSM-5 to examine PTSD core criteria,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been criticized for including symptoms that substantially overlap with other depression and anxiety disorders. To address this concern, Brewin et al. (2009) reformulated the diagnosis around a core symptom set. Although several studies have examined the utility of the core criteria in predicting diagnostic status, none have done so using a self-report screening instrument. The sample included 617 veterans presenting for outpatient psychological services. As a part of the intake process, veterans completed the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and were assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). Veterans meeting core criteria on the PCL-5 were over 22 times more likely to meet PCL-5 diagnosed PTSD than veterans who met the core criteria on the PCL-5 but did not meet PCL-5 diagnosed PTSD (OR = 22.94; CI [12.76, 41.25]). Further, veterans who met core criteria on the PCL-5 were over 2 times more likely (OR = 2.34; 95.0% CI [1.53, 3.59]) to meet CAPS-5 diagnosed PTSD than veterans who met the core criteria on the PCL-5 but did not meet CAPS-5 diagnosed PTSD.

Assessing advanced theory of mind and alexithymia in patients suffering from enduring borderline personality disorder,"Findings on the theory of mind (ToM) abilities in borderline personality disorder (BPD) have been inconsistent. Surprisingly, no studies have focused on the complex aspects of ToM while simultaneously measuring alexithymia as well as comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms, therefore, our study aimed to fill this gap. 30 female patients with BPD and 38 healthy controls (HCs) completed the Faux Pas Test (FPT) and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20). The clinical and intellectual assessment comprised of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis II Disorders (SCID-II), the Borderline Personality Inventory (BPI), the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale–Revised (CESD-R), and the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). Women with BPD scored significantly worse than HCs on overall ToM abilities. After controlling for the intelligence level, depressive symptoms, and state and trait anxiety, both groups presented a similar overall level of alexithymia. No correlation between the FPT and TAS-20 scores was found, suggesting that both constructs might be unrelated in BPD. Because ToM dysfunctions seem not to result from comorbid clinical symptoms, trait anxiety, or intellectual abilities, our study results suggest that ToM deficits might be considered a core feature of BPD.

Acculturative stress and mental health among economically disadvantaged spanish-speaking latinos in primary care: The role of anxiety sensitivity,"The present study examined the role of anxiety sensitivity in the relation between acculturative stress and mood and anxiety symptoms and disorders among Latinos seeking health services at a primary healthcare facility. Participants included 142 adult Latinos (86.6% female, M age = 39.05 years, SD = 12.46%, and 96.3% reported Spanish as their first language). Results indicated that acculturative stress was indirectly related to the number of mood and anxiety disorders, anxious arousal, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms through anxiety sensitivity. The observed effects were evident above and beyond the variance accounted for by gender, age, marital status, educational status, employment status, years living in the United States, and negative affectivity. Overall, the present findings suggest that there is merit in focusing further scientific attention on the interplay between acculturative stress and anxiety sensitivity to better understand and inform interventions to reduce anxiety/depressive vulnerability among Latinos in primary care.

"Self-reported volitional control in adolescents and young adults from a community cohort: Associations with current, past and future mental disorders","Alterations in volitional control have been found for various mental disorders. However, it remains unclear to which degree such alterations vary by type of psychopathology and constitute preceding vulnerabilities or correlates of mental disorders. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed among adolescents and young adults from the community at baseline (age 14–24) and in up to 3 follow-up assessments over 10 years ( n = 2515) using a standardized diagnostic interview (DIA-X/M-CIDI). Self-reported volitional control was assessed at second follow-up (T2) when subjects were aged 17–28 using the German version of the Short Form of the Volitional Components Inventory. Linear regressions adjusted for sex, age and lifetime disorders revealed that anxiety and affective disorders were associated with widespread alterations in self-reported volitional control (lower self regulation, higher self inhibition and volitional inhibition), while substance use disorders were specifically associated with higher volitional inhibition. Logistic regressions adjusted for sex, age and prior lifetime psychopathology revealed that lower self-reported volitional control at T2 predicted incident panic, social phobia and substance use at T3 (follow-up interval M = 4.8 years). Findings point toward at least partly disorder-specific alterations in volitional control in mental disorders, which might be antecedent vulnerability factors and thus useful to guide early recognition and prevention.

"Childhood maltreatment is associated with attachment insecurities, dissociation and alexithymia in bipolar disorder","Child maltreatment is a public health issue that is a well-established risk factor for many psychological conditions, including bipolar disorder. The current study is one of the first to investigate associations among child maltreatment, dissociative symptomatology, alexithymia, anxiety, depression, and attachment insecurities. 40 patients with bipolar disorder-I and 40 healthy subjects matched for age, gender, and education participated in the study. The Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-28), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), and Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R) were completed by participants. In comparison to control participants, patients with bipolar disorder-I reported significantly more frequent abusive experiences in childhood, higher levels of attachment insecurities, more severe pathological and somatoform dissociation, as well as higher scores on measures of alexithymia, anxiety, depression and psychological stress. Reports of psychopathology among first-degree relatives (OR = 102.169, 95%IC = 4.596–2271.255; P &lt; 0.01) and childhood emotional trauma (OR = 1.032; 95%CI = 0.782–1.363, P = 0.05) significantly contributed to bipolar disorder-I diagnosis. In contrast, absorption was negatively associated with bipolar illness (OR = 0.852; 95% CI = 0.747–0.973, P &lt; 0.05). Our results showed significant associations between childhood trauma exposure and risk of bipolar disorder. Moreover, the results demonstrate that emotional abuse exposure predicts bipolar illness.

Social contact as a strategy for self-stigma reduction in young adults and adolescents with mental health problems,"This study assessed the effectiveness of a social contact program between young adults and adolescents with and without mental health problems. It was evaluated if the development of a social contact program in a non-segregated space and respecting criteria of contact hypothesis reduced Self-Stigma and Public Stigma and, increased Self-Esteem. A pre-post intervention design was used with a sample of 47 subjects, 25 with different mental health diagnoses (Psychotic Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Depression, Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) and 22 without mental health problems, aged between 15 and 35 years. Five workshops of social contact and creativity were carried out during five months with a 2-h weekly meeting. The results analysis revealed a significant reduction in Self-Stigma for participants with mental health problems and may suggest a slight reduction in Public Stigma as well as a slight increase in the level of Self-Esteem of all participants. These findings suggest that programs of this nature reduce Self-Stigma and facilitate social inclusion in young adults and adolescents with and without mental health problems.

Associations between severity of anxiety and clinical and biological features of major affective disorders,"Patients with major affective disorders (MAFD) with comorbid anxiety show a greater functional impairment than those without anxiety. The aim of this study is to delineate the associations between severity of anxiety in MAFD, namely bipolar disorder (BD) and major depression (MDD), and MAFD characteristics and serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. Recruited were 82 participants with anxiety disoders and 83 without anxiety disoders, including 101 MAFD patients and 51 healthy controls. We used the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) to measure severity of anxiety and made the diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and phobias. The HAM-A score is significantly predicted by higher number of depressive episodes, GAD and phobias, childhood trauma, tobacco use disorder, metabolic syndrome and lowered HDL-cholesterol. Increased HAM-A scores are, independently from severity of depression, associated with lowered quality of life, increased disabilities and suicidal ideation. Lithium treatment significantly lowers HAM-A scores. It is concluded that severity of anxiety significantly worsens the phenomenology of MAFD. Therefore, treatments of MAFD should target increased severity of anxiety and its risk factors including low HDL-cholesterol, metabolic syndrome, childhood trauma and tobacco use disorder.

Patients with OCD report lower quality of life after controlling for expert-rated symptoms of depression and anxiety,"Background: One to three percent of the adult population suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD). Previous studies have also shown that, compared to controls, patients with OCD report a lower QoL. The latter is associated with self-rated symptoms of depression and anxiety. The aim of the present study was to compare the quality of life of OCD patients with that of healthy controls, while introducing expert-rated symptoms of depression and anxiety as covariates. Gender was also taken into account as an additional associated factor. Method: A total of 100 patients diagnosed with OCD (mean age: 32 years; 64% females) and healthy 100 controls (mean age: 31 years; 59% females; no discernible psychiatric disorder) took part in the present cross-sectional study. All participants completed questionnaires covering socio-demographic characteristics and dimensions of QoL. Experts rated participants’ symptoms of OCD (Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale), anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) and depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale). Results: Compared to healthy controls, patients with OCD reported a lower QoL, and had higher symptoms of depression and anxiety. This pattern was particularly pronounced among female patients with OCD. QoL was lower in patients with OCD, even when controlling for depression and anxiety. Results from binary logistic regressions showed that female gender, low QoL and higher symptoms of OCD, depression and anxiety together predicted status as patient with OCD. Conclusions: Compared to healthy controls, patients with OCD have a poorer quality of life and this is independent of depression or anxiety, and is particularly pronounced among female patients. Thus, treatment of OCD might take into account patients’ comorbidities and gender.

"Stress reactivity links childhood trauma exposure to an admixture of depressive, anxiety, and psychosis symptoms","Childhood trauma exposure has been associated with a clinically relevant mixed phenotype of psychopathology composed of depressive, anxiety, and psychosis symptoms, across healthy and clinical samples. Altered stress-reactivity after exposure to childhood trauma may be a plausible underlying mechanism explaining this association. In a general population sample of female twins (T0 = 564; T1 = 483), associations between childhood trauma exposure and symptom profile (no symptoms, isolated symptoms, or a mixed phenotype) on the one hand, and daily life stress reactivity on the other were investigated. Daily life stress reactivity was measured using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), and was defined as negative affect reactivity to minor daily life stressors. Individuals exposed to childhood trauma who reported a mixed phenotype of psychopathology showed a significant increase in emotional reactivity to daily life stress (activity and social stress), compared with trauma-exposed individuals without a mixed phenotype. In the trauma-exposed mixed phenotype group, increased emotional reactivity to event-stress predicted more severe symptoms at ± 14 month follow-up. This study found evidence that may link heightened emotional reactivity to stress in individuals with a trauma history to the risk for later comorbid psychopathology.

"Major and minor life events, personality and psychopathology in children with tourette syndrome","Environmental, psychological, and biological interactions underlie many psychopathologies. Tourette's Syndrome (TS) has an obvious biological substrate but environmental factors and personality play substantial roles in its expression. We aimed to study the interrelationships between stressful life events, personality traits, tics, and comorbid disorders in children with TS. To this end, 132 children with TS and 49 healthy controls were recruited for the study. Major life events in the 12-months prior to testing and minor life events in the month prior to testing were retrospectively assessed using the Life Experiences Survey (LES) and the Brief Adolescent Life Events Scale (BALES), respectively. Personality was assessed with the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory (JTCI). Tics, obsessive compulsive symptoms, attention deficit and hyperactivity symptoms, anxiety, depression and aggression were assessed by self-report questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. We found that major life events correlated with the severity of tics expression and complexity, and comorbid psychopathology. Minor life events correlated with more severe symptomatology. High levels of harm avoidance were related to more obsessions, anxiety, and depression whereas high levels of self-directedness were protective. To conclude, TS expression in childhood should be understood as the result of an interaction between biological, personality and environmental factors.

Attachment and motivational systems: Relevance of sensitivity to punishment for eating disorder psychopathology,"An altered balance of reward and inhibition systems may explain Eating Disorder (ED) behaviors and could be related to difficulties in socio-emotional processing. According to attachment theory, early interaction with caregivers affects the ability to regulate emotion in adult interpersonal situation. The aim of our study was to investigate if insecure attachment may be related to ED symptomatology through changes in reward and inhibition systems. Seventy-eight people affected by EDs and 45 healthy controls (HC) filled in the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ), the Behavioral Inhibition System-Behavioral Activation System Scale (BIS-BAS) and the Eating Disorders Inventory-2 (EDI-2) questionnaire. ED people reported significantly higher scores than HC in EDI-2 scores, all dimensions of insecure attachment style and sensitivity to punishment (BIS score). In ED patients, ASQ anxiety scores correlated with almost all EDI-2 subscores and sensitivity to punishment. The association between anxious attachment style and ED symptomatology (drive to thinness and body dissatisfaction) was totally mediated by an indirect effect of sensitivity to punishment. These findings suggest, for the first time, increased sensitivity to punishment as a pathway that may explain the relationship between anxious attachment and ED symptomatology highlighting the relevance to target social experiences as an important psychotherapeutic focus.

Early maladaptive schemas as mediators between childhood maltreatment and later psychological distress among Chinese college students,"The aim of the current study was to examine whether early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) mediate the association between different kinds of childhood maltreatment and later psychopathology and the effect of different kinds of childhood maltreatment on psychological distress in later life. A total of 1102 college students from two local universities participated in the study; their average age was 20.46 ± 1.13 years. The participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Early Maladaptive Schemas Scale (EMSs), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Later psychological distress had a significant positive correlation with childhood EMSs, and almost all of the variables measuring childhood maltreatment had a significant positive correlation with EMSs. Structural equation modeling and mediation analyses were conducted based on Bootstrap estimations; the mediation analyses demonstrated the utility of EMSs as the mechanism through which childhood maltreatment has an indirect effect on later psychological distress. Moreover, the study found that emotional abuse had the strongest overall effect of all five types of child maltreatment on later psychological distress, followed in order of magnitude by emotional neglect, physical neglect, sexual abuse, and physical abuse.

Cognitive insight and objective quality of life in people with schizophrenia and auditory hallucinations,"Poor cognitive insight in schizophrenia has been linked to delusions, hallucinations, and negative symptoms as well as to depressive/anxiety symptoms. Its impact on quality of life has been less studied, especially in schizophrenia subjects with ongoing auditory hallucinations. The Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) and the Quality of Life Scale (QLS) were administered to subjects who met DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia after due translation and validation. All subjects reported ongoing auditory hallucinations at recruitment. Mean composite cognitive insight scores from participants (N = 60) (2.97 ± 2.649) were in the lower range as compared to published literature. Cognitive insight scores as well as self-reflectiveness subscale scores, but not self-certainty scores, correlated significantly with the QLS scores p &lt; 0.001. Results suggest that better cognitive insight, especially self-reflectiveness, may be linked to better quality of life. Self-reflectiveness could be a useful construct to address in psychotherapy to improve rehabilitation.

"The interplay between trait anxiety, cognitive biases and attentional control in healthy individuals with psychotic-like experiences","Although both anxiety and cognitive biases contribute to psychosis, it is still unclear whether these factors interact in their influence on psychotic symptoms. The aim of the study was to examine the interactions between trait anxiety, cognitive biases and delusion-like experiences (PLEs) in a non-clinical sample; the moderational role of attentional control on this relationship was also considered in the study. Two subgroups of participants, 92 individuals (M = 24.76; SD = 6.33) with heightened (HA) trait anxiety and 78 individuals (M = 23.09; SD = 5.66) with lowered (LA) trait anxiety took part in the study. Anxiety, cognitive biases and attentional control were measured using self-report questionnaires. Regression analyses and moderation analyses were performed. External attribution bias predicted psychotic-like experiences in both groups, whereas attention to threat bias and belief inflexibility predicted PLEs within LA group. Further moderation analyses revealed that in LA group attention to threat bias increases PLEs only among individuals with a high and moderate ability to focus attention. The results indicated that trait anxiety is an important factor influencing the relationship between cognitive biases and PLEs, and that the ability to voluntarily focus attention is a significant moderator of the linkage between attention to threat bias and delusion-like experiences among low-anxious healthy individuals.

Is the first cut really the deepest? Frequency and recency of nonsuicidal self-injury in relation to psychopathology and dysregulation,"Research on nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) has moved beyond examination of factors that associate with the mere presence or absence of the behavior, and into more nuanced examination of which discrete features of NSSI behavior relate to pathology. This study examined two features of NSSI, frequency of occurrence and recency, as cross-sectional predictors of psychopathology in a large community sample of adults with a history of NSSI ( N = 315). Results of 2 × 2 factorial ANOVAs testing the interactive effects of NSSI frequency (clinical, subclinical) and recency (current, past) revealed that current NSSI was consistently associated with poorer emotional and behavioral health (e.g., greater symptoms of depression, panic, and anxiety, worse emotion regulation, greater alcohol misuse). Results for NSSI frequency were more variable, though preliminary evidence suggested significant interactions of current NSSI and clinical frequency on emotion dysregulation, general anxiety, and panic. Possible clinical and empirical implications of the NSSI disorder frequency criteria proposed in DSM-5 are discussed.

Adverse life events and the onset of anxiety disorders,"This study tested the hypothesis that adverse events are associated with increased risk of onset of anxiety disorders. Data from Waves 1 (N = 43,093; 2001–2002) and 2 (N = 34,653; 2004–2005) of the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) were used to assess whether adverse events at baseline are associated with increased risk of anxiety disorder onset over three years of follow up. Sixty-six percent (SE: 1.0) of respondents with an anxiety disorder in the intervening period between Waves 1 and 2 had experienced an adverse life event in the year prior to the Wave 1 interview. In logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and psychiatric characteristics, adverse life events at baseline were associated with anxiety disorder onset within the three-year follow up period. The pattern of association between adverse events and anxiety disorder onset was similar across sub-types, and injury, illness or death of family or close friends consistently had the strongest association with anxiety disorder onset. These findings suggest that adverse life events play a role in the onset of anxiety disorders.

Responsibility beliefs and persecutory delusions,"Recent research implicates cognitive processes traditionally linked to anxiety disorders in the maintenance of paranoia. Responsibility beliefs have traditionally been associated with OCD, and recent research suggests they may be transdiagnostic. The present study reports the first data on responsibility beliefs in individuals with persecutory delusions. 30 people with persecutory delusions completed measures of psychotic symptoms and responsibility beliefs. Participants were also asked to identify who they held responsible for their persecution. Quantitative data on responsibility beliefs were compared with 29 matched non-clinical control participants, and with published data from patients with OCD and anxiety disorders. People with persecutory delusions identified a number of different entities responsible for harm. The persecutory delusions group had higher responsibility beliefs than those with OCD, anxiety disorders and nonclinical controls. The results suggest that responsibility beliefs are a facet of the phenomenology of persecutory beliefs. Cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis might usefully draw from OCD interventions and focus on responsibility beliefs, perhaps especially in Bad Me paranoia.

Psychological burden and caregiver-reported non-adherence to psychotropic medications among patients with schizophrenia,"The study examined the association between psychological distress, caregiving burden and caregiver-reported medication adherence in 444 informal family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia. Participants were assessed on the Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale, Zarit Burden Interview and the Medication Adherence Report Scale. Caregivers reported a non-adherence rate of 54.5% among patients with schizophrenia. Poor adherence to antipsychotics was significantly associated with caregiver burden (p &lt; 0.01) and experience of anxiety (p &lt; 0.0001). The burden of caregiving should be considered during the assessment of adherence. The findings suggest a need for culturally appropriate interventions that improve antipsychotic adherence of outpatients with schizophrenia with specific attention to the burden of the caregiver.

Heart rate variability associated with posttraumatic stress disorder in victims’ families of sewol ferry disaster,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is caused by a major traumatic event, has been associated with autonomic nervous function. However, there have been few explorations of measuring biological stress in the victims’ family members who have been indirectly exposed to the disaster. Therefore, this longitudinal study examined the heart rate variability (HRV) of the family members of victims of the Sewol ferry disaster. We recruited 112 family members of victims 18 months after the disaster. Sixty-seven participants were revisited at the 30 months postdisaster time point. HRV and psychiatric symptoms including PTSD, depression and anxiety were evaluated at each time point. Participants with PTSD had a higher low frequency to high frequency ratio (LF:HF ratio) than those without PTSD. Logistic regression analysis showed that the LF:HF ratio at 18 months postdisaster was associated with a PTSD diagnosis at 30 months postdisaster. These results suggest that disrupted autonomic nervous system functioning for longer than a year after trauma exposure contributes to predicting PTSD vulnerability. Our finding may contribute to understand neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying secondary traumatic stress. Future studies will be needed to clarify the interaction between autonomic regulation and trauma exposure.

Impaired central coherence in patients with anorexia nervosa,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of central coherence in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). 22 female patients with AN (median age = 31.50 (QD = 8.13) years) and 33 female healthy controls (HC) (median age = 28.00 (QD = 8.50) years) participated in the study. Their central coherence was assessed with the Rey Complex Figure Task (RCFT). Clinical symptoms were evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form JYZ. The results showed that AN patients’ Central Coherence Index and accuracy scores in copy, 3-min delayed recall and 30-min delayed recall tasks of the RCFT were significantly lower than those of HC. Moreover, the significant differences in Central Coherence Index score in copy task and accuracy scores in 3-min delayed recall and 30-min delayed recall tasks remained when the effects of depression, anxiety and starvation were eliminated statistically. These findings may explain some characteristics of AN patients such as focusing on local rather than global picture in their perception of body or life.

Group metacognitive therapy vs. Mindfulness meditation therapy in a transdiagnostic patient sample: A randomised feasibility trial,"Two transdiagnostic therapies for treating psychological disorder are Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). These two approaches have yet to be compared and therefore the current study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a study of group MCT and MBSR in treating anxiety and depression. A feasibility trial with 40 participants (aged 19–56) was conducted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either eight weeks of group MCT or MBSR. The primary outcome was feasibility which included recruitment rates, retention and treatment acceptability. The primary symptom outcome was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) total score, which provided an overall measure of distress. Both treatments were found to be acceptable with low attrition and similar ratings of acceptability. Changes in outcomes were analyzed based on the intention-to-treat principle using mixed effect models. Preliminary analyses revealed that MCT was more effective in treating anxiety and depression in comparison to MBSR, and in reducing both positive and negative metacognitive beliefs. Reliable improvement rates favoured MCT at post-treatment and 6-month follow up. Both treatments appeared to be feasible and acceptable in treating transdiagnostic samples; however, a larger, definitive trial is required. The limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

Markers of DNA/RNA damage from oxidation as predictors of a registry-based diagnosis of psychiatric illness in type 2 diabetic patients,"Oxidative stress is a potential biological mediator of the higher rates of psychiatric illness (PI) observed after the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We investigated validated urinary markers of systemic DNA/RNA damage from oxidation (8-oxodG/8-oxoGuo respectively) as predictors of incident PI in a cohort of 1381 newly diagnosed T2DM patients, who were followed prospectively for a total of 19 years after diagnosis. Psychiatric diagnoses were from Danish national registries. Patients were examined at the time of diagnosis and at a 6-year follow-up. At baseline, 8-oxodG was slightly lower in PI vs. non-PI patients, while at 6-year follow-up, 8-oxoGuo was significantly higher in PI patients. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we found that higher levels of 8-oxodG at 6-year follow-up significantly predicted lower incidence of PI after the adjustment for confounders. In a subgroup analysis, this association was most predominant in minor PIs (unipolar depression and anxiety) compared to major PIs such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These observations indicate that higher levels of systemic oxidative stress are not associated with a higher risk of PI after T2DM onset. Only PI patients treated in hospital care were included in the registries, and the conclusion thus only applies to these individuals.

Seasonal mood changes in patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder,"Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is frequently associated with mood disorders. However, to date, the co-occurrence of OCD with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) has not been investigated. We have aimed to estimate the prevalence of seasonal mood changes in patients with OCD and explore the contribution of seasonality in mood to the severity of OCD. The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ), the Yale-Brown Obsession and Compulsion Scale (Y-BOCS), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 Items (HDRS-17), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were administered to patients with OCD ( n = 104) and controls ( n = 125). The degree of seasonality was measured by the Global Seasonality Score (GSS) calculated from the SPAQ. SAD and subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder (S-SAD) were significantly more prevalent in patients with OCD (53%, n = 55) than controls (25%, n = 31). When patients were assessed in the season in which SAD occurs, depression and compulsions (but not obsessions, OCD or anxiety) were more severe than those assessed in a season during which SAD does not occur. SAD frequently co-occurs with OCD and, given this co-occurrence, depression symptoms in some patients with OCD might be expected to vary on a seasonal basis.

Differential symptomatology and functioning in borderline personality disorder across age groups,"There is increasing research aimed at addressing whether patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) may exhibit variations in symptomatology and functioning according to their chronological age. The current study consisted of 169 outpatients diagnosed with BPD, who were divided into four age groups as follows: 16–25 years ( n = 41), 26–35 years ( n = 43), 36–45 years ( n = 45), and 46 and more years ( n = 40). Age groups were compared for symptomatology, normal personality traits, psychiatric comorbidities, functioning, and treatment-related features. The younger group had significantly higher levels of physical/verbal aggression and suicide attempts relative to the older group. Conversely, the older group had significantly greater severity of somatization, depression, and anxiety symptoms. In addition, the older group showed significantly greater functional impairment overall and across physical/psychological domains, specifically when compared to the younger group. Overall, these findings may suggest that age-related symptoms should be considered when diagnosing BPD. Also, functional impairments should be the target interventions for older BPD patients.

Psychiatric comorbidity pattern in treatment-seeking veterans,"This study investigated comorbidity patterns in treatment-seeking veterans and currently-serving Canadian Forces members of an outpatient mental health clinic from September 2006-September 2014. Using a retrospective cohort design, latent class analysis was conducted to determine latent classes of comorbidity (including posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], major depressive disorder [MDD], generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and alcohol use disorder [AUD]). Multiple logistic regression was used to determine which covariates (age, gender, number of deployments, and service duration) were predictors of latent class membership. Among the 486 participants, 79.2% had more than one probable mental health condition. The most common comorbidity was PTSD and MDD (61.5%), followed by PTSD and GAD (52.3%). Among those with PTSD, almost all (95%) had a subsequent condition, predominantly MDD (82.6% of those with PTSD had MDD). A two-class model was the best fitting model with a high comorbidity and a low comorbidity class. Older age and shorter service duration significantly increased the probability of being in the high comorbidity class when not controlling for member status. Results showed that treatment-seeking veterans and military personnel have high rates of comorbidity, particularly alongside PTSD. Therefore, it is critical for clinicians to be able to assess and treat comorbidity.

These women were followed in 262 gynecological practices. Women with a spontaneous abortion were matched (1:1) with pregnant women without spontaneous abortion by age, index year, diagnosis of female infertility prior to the index date, procreative management prior to the index date, and physician. This retrospective cohort study included 12,158 women with a spontaneous abortion and 12,158 pregnant women without a spontaneous abortion. The mean age was 31.6 (SD: 5.5).years. One year after the index date, 8.9% of women with spontaneous abortion and 5.7% of controls were diagnosed with depression, anxiety, or adjustment disorder. Individuals who had previously undergone a spontaneous abortion were more likely to have one of these three psychiatric disorders compared to controls (OR = 1.53). Similar results were found in the age groups 21–30 and 31–40. Spontaneous abortion is associated with an increased prevalence of developing psychiatric diseases within the first year.

The current study intended to examine the level and impact of internalized stigma in patients with bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). 60 patients with BPAD, 33 patients with schizophrenia and 30 patients with anxiety disorders were compared on Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale and The Stigma Scale. The patients with BPAD were assessed using Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Participation scale (PS) and World Health Organization Quality Of Life - Brief Version—Hindi (WHOQOL-Bref). Significant differences were found in all domains of self-stigma measures among the three groups. Using appropriate covariates, it was found that the differences were significant and independent of the effect of the covariates. In patients of BPAD, stigma and its domains were significantly correlated with the measures on monthly income, education, socio-occupational functioning, RSES, PS and WHOQOL-bref. Patients with BPAD experience substantial stigma, which was intermediate between that experienced by patients with schizophrenia (higher) and that experienced by patients with anxiety disorder (lower). Internalized stigma has significant impact on self-esteem, socio-occupational participation and functioning, and quality of life in patients with BPAD. Small sample size, sample of convenience, and cross-sectional design, limit the generalizability of the results.

The relation between GAD1 and PTSD symptoms: Shared risk for depressive symptoms,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) have substantial public impact and are common outcomes following trauma exposure. Thus, great interest exists in determining individual difference factors associated with greater risk for these outcomes. Both PTSD and MDD are at least moderately heritable and twin studies have demonstrated a high degree of overlap. However, a clear understanding of which specific variants confer risk for both disorders has been elusive. Recent research suggests that genetic variation of the glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system genes may be useful for understanding the genetic underpinnings of both disorders. Glu and GABA mediate the high majority of excitatory and inhibitory transmissions, and their interaction is thought to influence cognition and emotion. An enzyme of interest within this system is glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD1), which converts glutamate to GABA. The GAD system influences mood stability and the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders. To date, GAD genetic variants have been associated with mood disturbance and panic disorder. Thus, GAD1 SNPs may impact both mood and anxiety-like traits, and may also be relevant following stress or trauma exposure in influencing risk for PTSD as well as depression. Given this preliminary work, we explored whether a genetic risk sum score (GRSS) capturing risk for GAD is significantly associated with PTSD symptoms. We also tested whether this GRSS is associated with depressive symptoms. These effects were examined over and above the covariates age, sex, and race.

"Measuring pathology using the PANSS across diagnoses: Inconsistency of the positive symptom domain across schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and bipolar disorder","Although the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was developed for use in schizophrenia (SZ), antipsychotic drug trials use the PANSS to measure symptom change also for bipolar (BP) and schizoaffective (SA) disorder, extending beyond its original indications. If the dimensions measured by the PANSS are different across diagnoses, then the same score change for the same drug condition may have different meanings depending on which group is being studied. Here, we evaluated whether the factor structure in the PANSS was consistent across schizophrenia ( n = 3647), bipolar disorder ( n = 858), and schizoaffective disorder ( n = 592). Along with congruency coefficients, Hancock's H, and Jaccard indices, we used target rotations and statistical tests of invariance based on confirmatory factor models. We found the five symptom dimensions measured by the 30-item PANSS did not generalize well to schizoaffective and bipolar disorders. A model based on an 18-item version of the PANSS generalized better across SZ and BP groups, but significant problems remained in generalizing some of the factors to the SA sample. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder showed greater similarity in factor structure than did schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The Anxiety/Depression factor was the most consistent across disorders, while the Positive factor was the least consistent.

Drop-out and efficacy of group versus individual cognitive behavioural therapy: What works best for obsessive-compulsive disorder? A systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparisons,"Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the first-line psychological treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). However, a relevant proportion of individuals with OCD remain untreated or inadequately treated. Group cognitive behavioural therapy (GCBT) may be an alternative treatment modality. Little knowledge is available about the efficacy between GCBT versus individual CBT, particularly on long-term secondary outcomes including anxiety and depression. In addition, drop-out rates have not been investigated by previous meta-analyses. The current systematic review and meta-analysis summarized evidence comparing drop-out rates between GCBT and individual CBT and efficacy at post-treatment and follow-up on OCD symptoms, depression and anxiety. A systematic review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines was conducted. Online databases were searched. Studies were included if using randomized designs comparing GCBT versus individual CBT. Six studies were included (n = 327). No difference was found between GCBT and individual CBT on drop-out rates with a medium non-significant effect. No difference resulted at post-treatment on OCD symptoms, depression, and anxiety. Analyses on a smaller number of studies indicated no difference at follow-up. Findings provided preliminary evidence that GCBT can be as effective as individual CBT. Further trials are required with higher quality and long-term assessments of quality of life.

DSM-5-based latent PTSD models: Assessing structural relations with GAD in Filipino post-relocatees,"An increasing number of studies investigated the latent factor structure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology following the new fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). To date, there is no consensus on the best representation of PTSD. This study examined six latent PTSD models in a sample of Filipino post-disaster relocatees (N = 523). Further investigation on the relationship of the best-fitting model to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in the latent level was conducted. The seven-factor hybrid model consisting of intrusion, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, externalizing behaviors, anxious arousal, and dysphoric arousal, was the best fitting model. Latent associations between the factors in the hybrid model and GAD suggest there are core and transdiagnostic features of PTSD. These findings have implications for understanding the underlying mechanism of PTSD and can inform the development of trauma-related interventions, particularly among post-disaster relocatees.

Do previous experience and geographic proximity matter? Possible predictors for diagnosing Adjustment disorder vs. PTSD,"The minority of people who have experienced a traumatic event and were diagnosed as either suffering from PTSD or from Adjustment disorder, may suggest that victims of a traumatic event vary in risk factors for the disorders. The current research aimed at examining the association between reports of Adjustment disorder and PTSD symptoms (In accordance with the proposed revisions of the ICD-11) and several vulnerability variables: previous traumatic event, previous stressful event and physical proximity to the terror attack. Using an online survey, 379 adult participants were recruited, and filled out Adjustment disorder, PTSD symptomatology scales, as well as a previous exposure, magnitude of exposure and death anxiety scales. Findings revealed that previous experience of traumatic events was a significant predictor associated with both PTSD and Adjustment disorder symptoms. Previous experience of stressful events was a significant predictor associated with Adjustment disorder alone. Physical proximity to the site of the attack was a significant predictor associated with PTSD symptoms but not Adjustment disorder symptoms. The importance of previous traumatic events, previous stressful events and physical proximity to the terror attack as factors which are associated with Adjustment disorder and PTSD symptomatology is discussed.

Actor-partner interdependence analysis in depressed patient-caregiver dyads: Influence of emotional intelligence and coping strategies on anxiety and depression,"Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of suffering for both patients and their natural caregivers. A preliminary study highlights the association of emotional intelligence (EI) and coping strategies with quality of life. However, there is a lack of studies concerning dyadic (i.e., patient and natural caregiver) characteristics’ impact on anxious and depressive symptoms. In a sample of MDD patients-caregivers dyads, we explored the influence of EI and coping strategies on anxious and depressive symptoms using the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM). Methods: The cross-sectional study included 79 MDD patient-caregiver dyads. Self-reported data, completed by patients and their primary caregivers, were collected including socio-demographic, EI using TEIQue-SF, coping strategies using BriefCope, depressive symptoms using Beck Depression Inventory, anxious symptoms using STAI. The APIM was used to test the dyadic effects of EI and coping strategies on anxious and depressive symptoms, using structural equation modelling. Results: Patients and caregivers reported both anxious and depressive symptoms. Coping strategies, such as problem solving, positive thinking and avoidance, exhibited evidence of actor (degree to which the individual's coping strategies are associated with their own anxiety or depression level) and partner effect (degree to which the individual's coping strategies are associated with the anxiety or depression level of the other member of the dyad). The caregivers’ EI was associated with a decrease of their own depression level contrary to patients for which the results were not significant. The patients’ and caregivers’ EI was associated with a decrease of their own level of anxiety. Conclusion: EI and coping strategies were moderately associated with anxious and depressive symptomatology among MDD patient-caregiver dyads. These results suggest that targeted interventions could be proposed to both patients and caregivers.

"Perceptual abnormalities in clinical high risk youth and the role of trauma, cannabis use and anxiety","Recent research suggests that perceptual abnormalities are a group of diverse experiences, which have been associated with trauma, cannabis use, and anxiety. Of the attenuated psychotic symptoms that are present in youth at clinical high risk (CHR) of psychosis, perceptual abnormalities tend to be one of the most frequently endorsed symptoms. However, very few studies have explored perceptual abnormalities and their relationships with the above environmental and affective factors in a CHR sample. Four hundred and forty–one CHR individuals who met criteria for attenuated psychotic symptom syndrome (APSS) determined by the Structured Interview for Psychosis-risk Syndromes (SIPS) were assessed on the content of their perceptual abnormalities, early traumatic experience, cannabis use and self-reported anxiety. Logistic regression analyses suggested that both simple auditory and simple visual perceptual abnormalities were more likely to be reported by CHR who had early traumatic experiences, who are current cannabis users, and who have higher levels of anxiety. Multiple regression analysis revealed that only trauma and anxiety were independent predictors of both simple auditory and simple visual perceptual abnormalities. It is possible that examining subtypes of perceptual abnormalities in CHR leads to an improved understanding of the prevalence of such symptoms.

To see in a mirror dimly. The looking glass self is self-shaming in borderline personality disorder,"Symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) can be conceptualized as the expression of and defenses against or response to the painful emotion of chronic shame, which may relate to early maladaptive schemas (EMS). The goal of this research is to examine levels of early maladaptive schemas, self-reported shame, and anxious or angry reactions to social put-downs as well as their associations. We also looked to assess the association of shame with BPD symptoms. Fifty-six patients with BPD completed self-report measures of EMSs, chronic shame, and reactions to put-downs. Comparison groups consisted of 24 patients without personality disorder (non-PD) and 80 healthy controls (HC). Those with BPD reported higher levels of EMSs, characterological, behavioral and bodily shame, and were more prone to react with anxiety and anger than non-PD patients and HC subjects. EMSs domains had specific associations with chronic shame and reaction types to social put-downs. Identity disturbances were associated with characterological, behavioral and bodily shame. Stormy relationships were associated with bodily shame. Chronic shame and anxious and angry reactions to social put-downs are prominent in patients with borderline personality disorder and are associated with specific EMS domains and with the symptoms of identity disturbance and stormy relationships.

Self-reported sleep problems among the elderly: A latent class analysis,"The present study utilized a person-centered approach to examine the different profiles of problem sleepers in a community sample of elderly. In addition, this study also explores how demographic and psychiatric variables may be related to these different profiles of sleep problems. A total of 515 participants (Mean age = 67 years, SD = 5) were administered self-report measures of sleep problems, depression and anxiety. Among them, 230 who reported significant problems in any of five selected sleep components were entered into a latent class analysis. The remaining 285 participants were assigned to a comparison control group. The profiles of ‘inadequate sleep', ‘disturbed sleep’, ‘trouble falling asleep’ and ‘multiple problems’ were identified. The ‘multiple problems’ group had significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety relative to the control group. Regression analyses indicated that these different profiles had contributed to a significant increase in variance explained in anxiety but not depression levels, on top of the severity of sleep problems and demographic variables. Although sleep problems occur among the elderly with considerable heterogeneity, they can generally be classified into four different profiles. Furthermore, the inclusion of sleep problem profiles can significantly enhance the prediction of anxiety symptoms.

Childhood adversities and clinical symptomatology in first-episode psychosis,"In addition to severe traumatic experiences, milder, more common childhood adversities reflecting psychosocial burden may also be common in people with psychotic disorders and have an effect on symptomatology and functioning. We explored eleven negative childhood experiences and their influence on clinical symptoms among young adults with first-episode psychosis (FEP, n = 75) and matched population controls ( n = 51). Individuals with FEP reported more adversities than controls. Specifically serious conflicts within the family, bullying at school, maternal mental health problems, and one's own and parents’ serious illness during childhood were experienced by the patients more often than by controls. In the FEP group, the severity of adversity was associated with increased anxiety, manic, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but not with the severity of positive psychotic symptoms. Adversity produced a more pronounced effect on symptoms in male patients than in female patients. To conclude, in line with earlier studies of more chronic psychosis, a majority of the participants with FEP reported exposure to childhood adversities, with the FEP group reporting more adversities than controls. High levels of mood and anxiety symptoms in patients with FEP may be related to cumulative exposure to childhood adversities. This should be taken into account in the treatment for FEP.

The relationship between atypical depression and insülin resistance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and major depression,"In this study, we aimed to examine the relationship between atypical depression and insulin resistance (IR) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and major depression. A total of 176 subjects (69 patients with PCOS, 58 patients with depression, and 49 healthy controls) were included in the study. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) were administered. Data concerning their height, weight, fasting a.m. serum levels of insulin, glucose level, and total testosterone level were collected from all participants. The body mass index (BMI) and the Homeostasis Model Assessment Insulin Resistance index (HOMA-IR) were both calculated. 34 (49.3%) of the PCOS patients met the criteria for depression. 26 (76.5%) of them had atypical depression, 8 (23.5%) had non-atypical depression. 27 (46.6%) of the 58 depressed patients had atypical depression. Insulin resistance was higher in the PCOS patients than in the control subjects and the depression patients. There was no association between atypical depression and IR in patients with PCOS and depression. We concluded that there is no relationship between IR and atypical depression.

"Subtypes of suicide attempters based on longitudinal childhood profiles of co-occurring depressive, anxious and aggressive behavior symptoms","Because suicide attempts are multi-determined events, multiple pathways to suicidal behaviors exist. However, as a low-frequency behavior, within group differences in trajectories to attempts may not emerge when examined in samples including non-attempters. We used longitudinal latent profile analysis to identify subtypes specific for suicide attempters based on longitudinal trajectories of childhood clinical symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, and aggression measured in 2nd, 4th–7th grades) for 161 young adults (35.6% male; 58.6% African American) who attempted suicide between ages 13–30 from a large, urban community-based, longitudinal prevention trial ( n = 2311). Differences in psychiatric diagnoses, suicide attempt characteristics, criminal history and traumatic stress history were studied. Three subtypes emerged: those with all low ( n = 32%), all high (n = 16%), and high depressive/anxious, but low aggressive ( n = 52%) symptoms. Those with the highest levels of all symptoms were significantly more likely to report a younger age of suicide attempt, and demonstrate more substance abuse disorders and violent criminal histories. Prior studies have found that childhood symptoms of depression, anxiety and aggression are malleable targets; interventions directed at each reduce future risk for suicidal behaviors. Our findings highlight the link of childhood aggression with future suicidal behaviors extending this research by examining childhood symptoms of aggression in the context of depression and anxiety.

Modifiable cardiometabolic risk factors in youth with at-risk mental states: A cross-sectional pilot study,"Young people experiencing psychotic illness engage in low amounts of physical activity have poor fitness levels and poor sleep quality. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of these modifiable cardiometabolic risk factors among individuals with at-risk mental states (ARMS), who are at increased risk of developing psychosis. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a community-based youth mental health service. Thirty participants (23%♀, 21.3 ± 1.7 years old) were recruited, 10 with ARMS, 10 with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and 10 healthy volunteers. Physical activity levels were assessed using self-report and objective measures. Aerobic capacity, upper body strength, hamstring flexibility, forearm grip strength and core endurance were assessed. Sleep quality, depression and anxiety were measured by self-report questionnaire. The ARMS group did not differ significantly on anthropometric measures from FEP or healthy volunteers. They engaged in significantly less physical activity (p &lt; 0.05) and had poorer sleep quality (p &lt; 0.05) than healthy volunteers. Our results are consistent with other studies that found that youth with ARMS are at greater cardiometabolic risk. Interventions aimed at improving these modifiable risk factors may assist with preventing the decline in physical health associated with the development of psychiatric illness.

Relationship between psychological inflexibility and experiential avoidance and internet addiction: Mediating effects of mental health problems,"Internet addiction became a major mental health problem in college student. Our objective was to examine the relationship between psychological inflexibility and experiential avoidance (PIEA) and Internet addiction (IA) and the mediating effects of mental health problem indicators. 500 college students (238 men and 262 women) participated in this study. The level of PIEA was examined using the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II. The severity of IA was assessed using the Chen Internet Addiction Scale. The levels of depression, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility were evaluated using the Symptom Checklist-90 item-Revised Scale. The relationship among PIEA, mental health problems, and IA was examined using structural equation modeling. The severity of PIEA was positively associated with the severity of IA as well as positively associated with the severity of mental health problems. In addition, the severity of mental health problem indicators was positively associated with the severity of IA. These results provide the severity of PIEA is directly related to the severity of IA and indirectly related to the severity of IA through increasing the severity of mental health problems. The PIEA should be one of the target objectives when administer cognitive-behavioral therapy to college students with IA and mental health problems.

"Cognitive, affective, and social factors maintaining paranoia in adolescents with mental health problems: A longitudinal study","Paranoia may be a significant concern during adolescence, but there has been little research on excessive mistrust in young people. In this longitudinal study we set out to test the predictive ability of a number of cognitive, affective, and social factors in the early development of paranoia in a clinical adolescent population. Thirty four help-seeking adolescents, aged 11–16 years, reporting paranoid thoughts and attending mental health services were recruited. Self-report and interview assessments of paranoia were conducted at baseline. Measures relating to a cognitive model of persecutory delusions were completed. Paranoia was reassessed after three months with thirty three participants. Significant predictors of paranoia persistence were anxiety, depression, worry, negative self-beliefs, perceptual anomalies, insomnia, affective reactivity, bullying, and cyber victimization. No effect was found for reasoning bias or negative perceptions of academic ability, social competence, and physical appearance. In conclusion, many of the maintenance factors implicated in adult paranoia are likely to prove important in the early development of paranoia in young people. Further experimental and treatment studies are now needed to examine the causal role of these factors in the occurrence of paranoia in adolescents.

One hundred and thirty seven participants reported their daily Olympic-game viewing hours, somatization and will-to-live levels. Results show that while among those with low somatization symptoms level, the relationships between Olympic game viewing hours and will-to-live was positive, the opposite was found among those with high somatization symptoms level. Viewing the Olympic Games may be beneficial for individuals with low somatization level but less so to individuals with higher somatization.

Detached mindfulness reduced both depression and anxiety in elderly women with major depressive disorders,"We investigated the influence of detached mindfulness (DM) in treating symptoms of depression and anxiety among elderly women. Thirty-four elderly females (mean age: 69.23 years) suffering from moderate major depressive disorders (MDD) and treated with a standard medication (citalopram) at therapeutic doses were randomly assigned either to an intervention condition (DM; group treatment, twice weekly) or to a control condition (with leisure activities, twice weekly). At baseline (BL), four weeks later at study completion (SC), and four weeks after that at follow-up (FU), participants completed ratings for symptoms of depression and anxiety; experts blind to patients’ group assignments rated patients’ symptoms of depression. Symptoms of depression (self and experts’ ratings) and anxiety declined significantly over time in the DM, but not in the control condition. Effects remained stable at FU. The pattern of results suggests that, compared to a control condition, a specific psychotherapeutic intervention such as DM can have a beneficial effect in elderly female patients with MDD.

Schizophrenia dissection by five anxiety and depressive subtype comorbidities: Clinical implications and evolutionary perspective,"Twenty patients with DSM5 schizophrenia were comprehensively and formally assessed by an experienced psychiatrist. All subjects were assessed for: positive and negative psychotic symptoms; social anxiety; panic anxiety; obsessive compulsive disorder, atypical depression; major depression; suicide risk; and global assessment of functioning. Different profiles of clinical presentation and symptom evolution emerged for patients with schizophrenia who had co-morbid depression (15%), OCD (15%), panic or limited symptom attacks (55%) and social anxiety (5%). At least eighty percent of the sample had one or more of these co-morbidities. Summing up, the data support our previous finding that panic is highly prevalent in Schizophrenia with Auditory Hallucinations (&gt; 73% here, versus 100% before), and panic was paroxysmally concurrent with voice onset. Moreover, characteristic clinical findings may help point clinicians to five specific co-morbidity psychosis subtypes. Moreover, co-morbidity dissection of psychotic diagnoses recalls and parallels the historical psychopharmacologic dissection of non-psychotic anxiety and depressive subtypes diagnoses.

"Quality of life in individuals with attenuated psychotic symptoms: Possible role of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and socio-cognitive impairments","Individuals with Clinical High-Risk state for Psychosis (CHR-P) are reported to exhibit impaired quality of life (QOL) similar to that observed in schizophrenia, but its determinants remain unclear. We investigated the QOL of 33 subjects with CHR-P, 45 patients with schizophrenia, and 63 healthy subjects using the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). The CHR-P and schizophrenia groups were administered the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS), and the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) for socio-cognitive functions; and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for clinical symptoms. The CHR-P group was also assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory. The CHR-P and schizophrenia groups had a significantly lower QLS score to the same degree compared with controls, which was predominantly associated with the SOFAS, SCoRS, and PANSS negative/general scores. For the CHR-P, the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms was also correlated with a lower QLS score. Regression analyses demonstrated that the QLS score was predicted by SOFAS (for both groups) and SCoRS (for CHR-P) scores. Our findings suggest the importance of addressing socio-cognitive dysfunctions as well as anxiety and depressive symptoms for better QOL in CHR-P.

Trauma and traumatic stress in a sample of pregnant women,"Objective: To examine the construct validity of the 9 item Traumatic Events Questionnaire (TEQ) and to evaluate the extent to which experiences of trauma assessed using the TEQ are associated with symptoms of psychiatric disorders among 3342 pregnant women in Lima, Peru. Methods: Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) while the PTSD Checklist-civilian (PCL-C) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess symptoms of PTSD and generalized anxiety. Hierarchical logistic regression procedures were used to evaluate relations between TEQ and symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Results: The majority of participants (87.8%) experienced at least one traumatic event (mean = 2.5 events). The trauma occurrence score was moderately correlated with symptoms of PTSD (PCL-C: rho = 0.38, P -value &lt; 0.0001), depression (EPDS: rho = 0.31, P -value &lt; 0.0001; PHQ-9: rho = 0.20, P -value &lt; 0.0001), and GAD (GAD-7: rho = 0.29, P -value &lt; 0.0001). Stronger correlations were observed between the trauma intensity score with symptoms of psychiatric disorders (PCL-C: rho = 0.49, P - value &lt; 0.0001; EPDS: rho = 0.36, P-value &lt; 0.0001; PHQ-9: rho = 0.31, P-value &lt; 0.0001; GAD-7: rho = 0.39, P-value &lt; 0.0001).

Attentional avoidance increases voice hearing in an analogue task in people with psychosis: An experimental study,"Cognitive models of psychosis suggest that unhelpful ways of responding to experiences can maintain such experiences and the associated distress. The response styles of attentional avoidance and attentional focusing were manipulated in an analogue voice-hearing task. Predictions were that both would increase detection of words in response to an ambiguous audio-recording but that attentional avoidance would lead to a greater increase than focusing. We also predicted that there would be a greater increase in anxiety and distress in the avoidance group. Predictions were tested in a sample of 44 participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Participants were randomly assigned to either attentional avoidance or focusing while listening to an ambiguous auditory task. Number of words identified and anxiety and distress were recorded. As predicted, there was an increase in the number of words identified in both groups; however, this increase was greater in the avoidance group. The prediction that there would also be an increase in distress that would be greater in the avoidance group was not supported. It is possible that emotional reactions relate more closely to appraisals of the voice. The results suggest that avoidance of experiences is particularly counterproductive and can result in greater detection of experiences.

Stigma resistance and its association with internalised stigma and psychosocial outcomes among psychiatric outpatients,"Studies have suggested that stigma resistance plays an important role in the recovery from mental illness. However, there has been limited research in Asian countries that has examined the benefits of stigma resistance among the mentally ill in Asian populations. Hence, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of stigma resistance and establish the socio-demographic correlates of stigma resistance, as well as its association with internalised stigma and psychosocial outcomes among a multi-ethnic population of 280 outpatients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, depressive disorders and anxiety disorders in Singapore. Prevalence of stigma resistance measured using the Stigma Resistance subscale of the Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness Scale was 82.9%. ANOVA and logistic regressions were conducted and results revealed that: (i) Stigma resistance was positively associated with being separated/divorced/widowed but negatively associated with depression diagnosis; (ii) Psychosocial outcomes such as self-esteem and psychological health were positively associated with stigma resistance; and (iii) Internalised stigma was negatively associated with stigma resistance. Moving forward, treatments could emphasize on improving the self-esteem and psychological health of patients to increase their stigma resistance for counteracting effects of public and internalised stigma.

Current psychiatric disorders were observed in over half of patients during preoperative period, being anxiety disorders the most frequent diagnosis. For lifetime disorders, mood disorders were the most frequent diagnosis. Most of the sample presented 2 or more concurrent lifetime psychiatric disorders. While mood and eating disorders were frequent conditions, anxiety disorders were the most persistent conditions (the highest one month-to-lifetime prevalence ratio) and were significantly correlated with bipolar, depressive and eating disorders. Psychiatric disorders are frequent and enduring conditions among patients looking for bariatric surgery. Comorbid anxiety, mood, and eating disorders are remarkable features in treatment-seeking patients with obesity. Prognostic implications of preoperative psychiatric disorders on surgery outcome should be demonstrated prospectively in intervention studies.

Is therapist evaluation of Social Anxiety/Avoidance traits associated with patient-reported attachment style?,"The Social Anxiety/Avoidance Scale was recently added to the Shedler Westen Assessment Procedure (SWAP), and requires independent validation. This study used data drawn from a larger ongoing project in order to retrospectively examine its convergent validity with two self-report attachment measures: Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) and Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire-Revised (ECR-R). Fifty-two patients completed the RQ and the ECR-R before beginning psychotherapy treatment. Clinicians rated the patients on the SWAP after six sessions. The SWAP Social Anxiety/Avoidance Scale (SWAP-SAAS) was negatively related to the RQ secure attachment prototype scale and positively related to the ECR-R attachment anxiety scale. Our findings provide initial support for the use of the SWAP-SAAS as a therapist-rated measure associated with lower patient-reported levels of fit with a secure attachment prototype and with higher patient-reported levels of attachment anxiety. Implications and suggestions for future research on the SWAP-SAAS, as well as for clinical work with socially anxious and avoidant patients, are discussed.

Binge-pattern cocaine administration causes long-lasting behavioral hyperarousal but does not enhance vulnerability to single prolonged stress in rats,"Cocaine use disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occur. This could be due to vulnerability to post-traumatic symptoms conferred by previous exposure to cocaine. Therefore, we combined chronic binge-pattern cocaine with a model of psychological trauma (single prolonged stress) to determine whether the behavioral effects of psychological trauma are enhanced in cocaine-sensitized individuals. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats received 14 days of cocaine (15 mg/kg/injection) or saline in a binge pattern (3 injections per day, 1 h apart). Seven days after the last injection animals were exposed to traumatic stress or a control procedure. Seven days after stress, activity and anxiety-like behaviors were measured. Binge-pattern cocaine increased locomotor activity in the open field and elevated plus maze, and both cocaine and SPS exposure increased the rapidity with which rats moved through grooming sequences. Neither binge-pattern cocaine nor SPS increased anxiety-like behaviors, and no interactions were found between binge-pattern cocaine exposure and SPS exposure. A behavioral phenotype categorization approach demonstrated that cocaine-exposed groups expressed a high incidence of hyperactivity-like symptoms. These results suggest that binge-pattern cocaine exposure causes a long-lasting hyper-exploratory phenotype but does not make individuals more vulnerable to a later traumatic stress exposure.

Personality disorders and somatization in functional and organic movement disorders,"Psychiatric disturbances and somatizations are both criteria which support the diagnosis of functional movement disorders. It is unclear, however, whether these factors are helpful in differentiating functional and organic movement disorders. To address this issue, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I and II psychiatric disorders, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory and the “somatization section” of the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule were administered to 31 functional movement disorder patients diagnosed, according to Fahn and Williams criteria and 31 sex- and age-matched control outpatients, with adult-onset dystonia. Axis I psychiatric diagnoses were similarly frequent in patients with functional and organic movement disorders. There was a trend to a greater frequency of personality disorders overall; when looking at individual personality disorders, there was no significant between-group difference. Depression and anxiety scores and mean number of somatizations per patient were also greater in the functional group. The number of somatic complaints significantly correlated with depression and anxiety scores. However, the presence of these disturbances in a proportion of patients with organic dystonia indicates that personality disorders and somatizations do not aid in distinguishing functional and organic movement disorders.

"An integrative study of motivation and goal regulation processes in subclinical anxiety, depression and hypomania","Research has implicated motivation and goal regulation in susceptibility to mood disorders. We studied for the first time key facets of motivation and goal regulation concurrently in relation to affective symptoms. The cross-national sample comprised 510 university students from the United States ( n = 279) and United Kingdom (n = 231). Participants completed self-report measures of motivation, conditional goal setting, urgency, depression, anxiety, and mania risk. Structural Equation Modeling results found that behavioral activation system scores correlated negatively with depression and positively with mania risk, but were unrelated to anxiety. High conditional goal setting correlated uniquely with higher depression but not to anxiety or mania risk. Urgency correlated with higher anxiety, depression, and mania risk. Behavioral inhibition system scores correlated negatively with mania risk but unexpectedly did not correlate with anxiety in the multivariate model. The behavioral activation, behavioral inhibition, conditional goal setting, and urgency results showed shared and distinct patterns of relationships with depression, anxiety and mania risk. Our findings indicate unique and common risk vulnerabilities in depressive, anxious, and manic syndromes and extend an integrative knowledge of these syndromes in relation to goal regulation.

Factors associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms among adolescents exposed to the Sewol ferry disaster in Korea,"This study evaluated the factors associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms in Korean adolescents who lived in a disaster-affected community. A total of 1101 students attending secondary and high schools in Jindo, the location of the Sewol ferry disaster, were enrolled in a cross-sectional survey. The Child Report of Post-traumatic Symptoms (CROPS), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the State Anxiety Inventory for Children (SAIC) were administered. Female gender, older children, poor academic achievement, and directly witnessing the rescue scene were associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms. The CES-D and SAIC scores of subjects with witness of the rescue were significantly higher than those of respondents without such experiences. The regression analysis revealed that directly witnessing the rescue scene was significantly associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms after adjusting for other variables. The results of this study suggest that witnessing the rescue scene following a disaster might be a risk factor for post-traumatic stress symptoms in adolescents in disaster-affected communities.

Threatening events theme of cognitive biases mediates the relationship between fear of social situations and delusion–like experiences among healthy adults,"Social anxiety (SA) is frequently observed among patients diagnosed with psychosis as well as among individuals with delusion-like experiences (DLEs). A heightened level of SA has been recognized to precede the development of psychotic symptoms; however, the detailed mechanisms that link SA to delusional ideation remain unrecognized. Since social anxiety is associated with the presence of cognitive biases and biased cognitive processes have been found to play a role in the development and maintenance of delusions, we hypothesized that cognitive biases may mediate in the relationship between social anxiety and DLEs. A total sample of 202 healthy individuals with mean age 35.59 (SD = 17.15) was assessed for the presence of delusion-like experiences, social anxiety, as well as the threatening events theme and anomalous perception theme of cognitive biases. The threatening events theme was found to fully mediate the linkage between fear of social situations and DLEs (β = 0.12, p &lt; 0.05). The threatening events theme was also found to be a partial mediator in the association between social avoidance and DLEs (β = 0.20, p &lt; 0.05), and between the overall level of social anxiety and DLEs (β = 0.18, p &lt; 0.05). Our findings suggest that social anxiety may influence DLEs by providing the threatening events theme of cognitive biases.

Temporal focus clusters differ meaningfully in terms of anxiety and depressive symptomatology,"The present study examined the relationship between temporal focus profiles and scores on psychiatric symptomatology. Participants were recruited by undergraduate students in a university in the United Kingdom ( N = 372; 46% male). Five clusters emerged from hierarchical cluster analysis and were labelled, No Focus, Multi Focus, Past Focus, Future Focus, and Current Focus. The worst outcomes in terms of psychiatric symptomatology were observed for those belonging to the Past Focus cluster. These results build on the only previous study using cluster analysis of Temporal Focus Scale scores, where being past focussed was associated with lower self-esteem in adolescents.

Approach and avoidance tendencies in depression and anxiety disorders,"Anxiety is linked to increased avoidance and inhibition, whereas depression is linked to decreased approach and diminished behavioral activation. Although these notions are widely recognized, systematic investigation of approach-avoidance tendencies is lacking across these diagnostic groups. Participants (mean age = 45.6; 65.8% female) were subdivided in healthy controls (405), remitted patients (877) and currently anxious (217), depressed (154) or comorbid (154) patients. Automatic approach-avoidance tendencies in reaction to facial expression were assessed using the Approach-Avoidance-Task (AAT). Self-reported trait approach and avoidance tendencies were assessed using the BIS/BAS scale. Severity of psychopathology was assessed to examine dose-response relationships. We did not find any consistent associations of automatic approach-avoidance tendencies with psychiatric variables. In contrast, medium to large differences in BIS scores showed increased trait avoidance tendencies in all patient groups relative to healthy controls. Overall, it seems that increased trait avoidance, rather than decreased approach, is a characteristic of affective disorders. This holds for both depressed and anxious patients and more strongly so in severe and chronic patients. It underlines the importance to address trait avoidance tendencies in the treatment of affective disorders.

Predictors of illness anxiety symptoms in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder,"Illness anxiety and OCD symptoms appear to overlap in their presentation as well as in other conceptually important ways (e.g., dysfunctional cognitions). Little research, however, has directly examined these putative relationships. The present study examined the extent to which illness anxiety symptoms were associated with OCD symptom dimensions and relevant cognitive factors in a large treatment-seeking sample of patients with OCD. Patients completed a battery of self-report measures of OCD and health anxiety symptoms and related cognitive biases. Results from regression analyses indicated that illness anxiety symptoms were associated with harm obsessions and checking rituals, as well as with the tendency to overestimate threat and responsibility for harm. Illness anxiety was not associated with perfectionism. Conceptual and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

Relationships between patients’ attachment characteristics and views and use of psychiatric treatment,"This study explored the influence of attachment on psychiatric treatment by considering attitudes towards and the use of psychotropic medication and psychotherapy in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders. Adults referred to a psychiatrist completed self-report measures and participated in a diagnostic interview based on DSM-IV criteria. Those with depressive, anxiety or adjustment disorders were included (n = 124). Patients reported the types and dosage of current psychotropic medication as well as number of different psychiatrists and psychologists/counselors they had seen in the past 10 years. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine relationships between attachment anxiety and avoidance and the variables capturing treatment use and attitudes towards treatments. Attachment anxiety was positively associated with the number of current psychiatric medications and with both the number of psychiatrists and the number of psychologists/counselors seen. Attachment avoidance was negatively associated with the number of current psychotropic medications and beliefs about the efficacy of psychotherapy. The findings suggest that patients’ attachment characteristics play a role in their views and choices regarding treatments. Developing treatments sensitive to the needs of insecurely attached individuals may lead to improved treatment outcomes.

Screening for generalized anxiety disorder in Spanish primary care centers with the GAD-7,"The aim of the study was to determine the criterion validity of a computerized version of the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire to detect general anxiety disorder in Spanish primary care centers. A total of 178 patients completed the GAD-7 and were administered the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, which was used as a reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated. A cut-off of 10 yielded a sensitivity of .87, a specificity of .78, a positive predictive value of .93, a negative predictive value of .64, a positive likelihood ratio of 3.96 a negative likelihood ratio of .17 and Younden's Index of .65. The GAD-7 performed very well with a cut-off value of 10, the most frequently used cut-off point. Thus, a computerized version of the GAD-7 is an excellent screening tool for detecting general anxiety disorder in Spanish primary care settings.

Proactive and reactive inhibitory control in eating disorders,"Altered inhibitory control has been implicated in the development and maintenance of eating disorders (ED), however it is unclear how different types of inhibitory control are affected across the EDs. We explored whether individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED) and anorexia nervosa (AN) differed from healthy individuals (HC) on two types of motor inhibitory control: proactive inhibition (related to the preparation/initiation of a response) and reactive inhibition (withholding a response in reaction to a signal). Ninety-four women (28 AN, 27 BN, 11 BED, 28 HC) completed two neuropsychological tasks (a cued reaction time task and a stop signal task), and questionnaires assessing clinical variables, mood, anxiety, and inhibitory control. Self-reported inhibitory control was poorer in women with BN compared to the HC and AN groups, but greater in women with AN compared to all other groups. However, no group differences in reactive inhibition were observed. Proactive inhibition was augmented in women with AN compared to HC, and this was related to self-reported intolerance of uncertainty. The findings suggest that proactive inhibition may be a relevant target for behavioural interventions for AN, and call for further research into the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and proactive inhibition.

Genistein alleviates anxiety-like behaviors in post-traumatic stress disorder model through enhancing serotonergic transmission in the amygdala,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder, characterized by intense fear, and increased arousal and avoidance of traumatic events. The current available treatments for PTSD have limited therapeutic value. Genistein, a natural isoflavone, modulates a variety of cell functions. In this study, we tested anti-anxiety activity and underlying mechanisms of genistein in a PTSD rat model. The rats were trained to associate a tone with foot shock delivery on day 0, then fear conditioning was performed on day 7, 14 and 21. Genistein (2–8 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally daily for 7 days. The anti-anxiety effects of genistein were measured by contextual freezing behavior and elevated plus maze. By the end of the experiments, the amygdala was extracted and subject to neurochemistry analysis. Genistein alleviated contextual freezing behavior and improved performance in elevated plus maze dose-dependently in PTSD rats. Furthermore, in these rats, genistein enhanced serotonergic transmission in the amygdala, including upregulation of tryptophan hydroxylase, serotonin, and phosphorylated (p)-CaMKII and p-CREB, as well. Genistein exerts anti-anxiety effects on a PTSD model probably through enhancing serotonergic system and CaMKII/CREB signaling pathway in the amygdala.

Evidence of the paradoxical effect of social network support: A study among Filipino domestic workers in China,"Labor migrants are at an increased risk for poor mental health. Post-migration stressors contribute significantly to this risk. Social network supports are vitally important to protect health but little is known about the role of social network supports among labor migrants. The current study evaluated the role of migration stressors on poor mental health among Filipino female domestic workers (FDW) and whether family and friend social network support (SNS) modified this relationship. Data were collected from 261 FDWs in Macau, China from May to September 2013. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to test for direct and moderating effects of social networks on psychological distress. Post-migration stress was associated with increased anxiety, depression, somatization, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. SNS from family was not associated with the four psychological symptoms nor did it modify the association between stress and these symptoms. SNS from friends was positively associated with these symptoms, and significantly moderated the relationship between stress and these symptoms. Counterintuitive to the known buffering effects of SNS, greater SNS was associated with greater psychological symptoms among FDWs exposed to post-migration stressors. The present findings suggest that reliance on SNS to cope with post-migration stressors may worsen psychological distress.

Challenging mental health related stigma in China: Systematic review and meta-analysis. II. interventions among people with mental illness,"People with mental illness often face different types of mental illness stigma that may affect their lives, including perceived stigma, self-stigma, harmful coping strategies and poor quality of life. Although anti-stigma interventions for people with mental illness from Western countries have been identified by recent systematic reviews, their efficacy in China is unknown. This review evaluates the efficacy of anti-stigma interventions among people with mental illness in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. A systematic search of 8 electronic databases in English and Chinese yielded 17 randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated wherever possible. Psychoeducation was the most commonly used intervention. SMDs were large and significant for perceived/experienced/anticipated stigma, self-prejudice and coping with stigma, as well as for depression and anxiety symptoms and quality of life. Both Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and psychoeducation had positive effects on perceived/experienced/anticipated stigma. The quality of studies was modest and heterogeneity across studies was high. Anti-stigma interventions demonstrated promise to reduce stigma's negative impact on people with mental illness in China, but more high-quality intervention research is needed.

Psychological strain and suicidal ideation: A comparison between Chinese and US college students,"Objective: This study was to explore the relation between psychological strains and suicidal ideation among Chinese and American college students. Another secondary purpose of the study was to examine the reliability of the psychological strains scales (PPS: Ref) one more time in China and the United States in college populations. Method: Samples of college students were randomly recruited from China and United States. All of 529 college students (aged 17–27, 68.9% female) completed self-report assessments of psychological strains (Psychological Strain Scale), suicidal ideation (Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation), and indicators of psychological well-being (e.g., depression, anxiety, and stress). Results: Empirical results show that Psychological Strain Scales (PSS) has a good reliability. Chinese college students reported higher suicide ideation scores than American students whereas there was no statistical difference in psychological strains. Psychological strains and, depression, anxiety, and stress, were positively related to suicidal ideation in both countries. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that psychological strain can significantly predict suicidal ideation. Conclusions: These findings provide support for the Strain Theory of Suicide for both Chinese and American college students and some measures can be taken to reduce psychological strains in students. However, future work could extend these findings by utilizing a longitudinal design to determine whether psychological strains are in fact antecedents, and not simply correlates, of suicide ideation.

The importance of strengthening competence and control beliefs in patients with psychosis to reduce treatment hindering self-stigmatization,"Different aspects of self-stigmatization represent barriers for recovery in patients with psychosis disorders. It is unclear whether addressing patient's competence and control beliefs could attenuate the extent of self-stigmatization. The major aim of this study was to identify predictors of self-stigmatization derived from competence and control beliefs in patients ( N = 80). Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical variables, competence and control beliefs and self-stigmatization were assessed among 80 patients with psychosis disorders. The cross-sectional data was analyzed by correlation and regression analyses. Results indicate deficits in self-concept of own competences, i.e. the capability of acting in new, difficult or ambiguous situations, resulting in also impaired self-efficacy and relatively increased externality in patients compared to a general population sample. Subjective well-being under neuroleptics, trait-anxiety and defining oneself as religious were the most influential predictors of competence and control beliefs. A weaker self-concept of own competences was also revealed as the strongest predictor of overall high self-stigmatization. Our results stress the importance of orienting treatment strategies towards strengthening the self-concept of own competences in patients in order to reduce self-stigmatization and enhance resilience.

Heart rate variability of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder in the Korean veterans,"Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have lower heart rate variability (HRV) than the general population, but findings in this area have been inconsistent. This study was conducted to investigate the characteristics of HRV in patients with PTSD and to evaluate associations between PTSD symptoms and HRV indices. Sixty-eight patients with PTSD and 73 controls without PTSD were evaluated. HRV was measured in all subjects after they completed self-reported questionnaires. Patients with PTSD had significantly more depressed moods, anxiety, and poorer sleep quality than individuals in the non-PTSD group. Standard deviations of NN intervals (SDNN), the square root of the mean squared differences of successive NN intervals (RMSSD), and log high-frequency (LNHF) were significantly lower in the PTSD group than in the non-PTSD group. Comparisons of HRV indices among four sub-groups according to presence/absence of PTSD and experiences of combat-related or other trauma indicated that individuals in the PTSD group who had experienced combat-related trauma had the lowest HRV indices. These indices included SDNN, RMSSD, and LNHF. Further, SDNN, RMSSD, and HF power were significantly associated with symptoms of hyperarousal. HRV measures might be useful physiological parameters in assessing and monitoring sympathovagal function in patients with PTSD.

The prevalence and outcomes of exposure to potentially traumatic stressful life events compared across patients with bipolar disorder and unipolar depression,"This study examined the profile of stressful life experiences in patients with unipolar depression (UP) compared to bipolar disorder (BP), including their subsequent psychological impact and affirmation of post-traumatic stress symptoms. We studied 747 tertiary patients diagnosed with either a UP (n = 413) or BP condition (n = 334) according to a structured research interview and psychiatrist assessment. An online assessment collected additional study variables. Results showed that despite being younger in age, the BP group were more likely to have experienced 8 of the stressful life events, including childhood and adulthood abuse. However, both groups judged the consequential ‘impact’ of those events similarly. The BP group was significantly more likely than the UP group (45% vs. 36%) to affirm exposure to an extremely stressful event across their lifetime, resulting in 26.3% of the BP and 14.5% of the UP group affirming DSM-IV criteria for lifetime PTSD. The onset of DSM-IV-defined post-traumatic symptoms tended to occur in adulthood for both groups, with trauma often following the onset of the mood disorder. Thus, BP patients displayed greater vulnerability toward traumatic experiences and anxiety disorders, but reported a similar psychological impact in response to each stressor, compared with the UP group.

"SCL-90-R emotional distress ratings in substance use and impulse control disorders: One-factor, oblique first-order, higher-order, and bi-factor models compared","To fully understand the dimensionality of an instrument in a certain population, rival bi-factor models should be routinely examined and tested against oblique first-order and higher-order structures. The present study is among the very few studies that have carried out such a comparison in relation to the Symptom Checklist-90-R. In doing so, it utilized a sample comprising 2593 patients with substance use and impulse control disorders. The study also included a test of a one-dimensional model of general psychological distress. Oblique first-order factors were based on the original a priori 9-dimensional model advanced by Derogatis (1977); and on an 8-dimensional model proposed by Arrindell and Ettema (2003)—Agoraphobia, Anxiety, Depression, Somatization, Cognitive-performance deficits, Interpersonal sensitivity and mistrust, Acting-out hostility, and Sleep difficulties. Taking individual symptoms as input, three higher-order models were tested with at the second-order levels either (1) General psychological distress; (2) ‘Panic with agoraphobia’, ‘Depression’ and ‘Extra-punitive behavior’; or (3) ‘Irritable-hostile depression’ and ‘Panic with agoraphobia’. In line with previous studies, no support was found for the one-factor model. Bi-factor models were found to fit the dataset best relative to the oblique first-order and higher-order models. However, oblique first-order and higher-order factor models also fit the data fairly well in absolute terms. Higher-order solution (2) provided support for R. F. Krueger's empirical model of psychopathology which distinguishes between fear, distress, and externalizing factors (Krueger, 1999). The higher-order model (3), which combines externalizing and distress factors (Irritable-hostile depression), fit the data numerically equally well. Overall, findings were interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that the prevalent forms of symptomatology addressed have both important common and unique features. Proposals were made to improve the Depression subscale as its scores represent more of a very common construct as is measured with the severity (total) scale than of a specific measure that purports to measure what it should assess―symptoms of depression.

Psychophysiological and self-reported reactivity associated with social anxiety and public speaking fear symptoms: Effects of fear versus distress,"This study examines psychophysiological and subjective reactivity to anxiety-provoking situations in relation to social anxiety and public speaking fear. We hypothesized that social anxiety symptoms would be associated with similar reactivity across types of imaginary anxiety scenes and not specifically to social anxiety-related scenes. This would be attributed to co-existing depression symptoms. Public speaking fear was expected to be associated with more circumscribed reactivity to survival-threat scenes, due to its association with fearfulness. Community participants imagined standardized anxiety situations, including social anxiety and animal fear scenes, while their physiological reactivity and self-reported emotions were assessed. Findings supported that social anxiety was associated with undifferentiated physiological reactivity across anxiety-provoking situations, except with regards to skin conductance level, which was higher during social anxiety imagery. Public speaking fear was associated with increased reactivity to animal phobia and panic scenes. Covariance analyses indicated that the lack of response specificity associated with social anxiety could be attributed to depression levels, while the specificity associated with public speaking fear could be explained by fearfulness. Findings highlight the need to assess not only primary anxiety symptoms but also depression and fearfulness, which likely predict discrepant reactions of individuals to anxiogenic situations.

This cross-sectional study included 700 students. A self-administered, questionnaire for the socio-demographic characteristics, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire were used for assessment. High frequencies of depression (65%), anxiety (73%) and stress (59.9%) were reported. Stress scores were significantly higher than depression and anxiety (P = 0.001). 55.7% were poor sleepers. In univarate analysis, females, those living in the University campus/students' residence facility, in the preclinical years and with lower academic achievement had higher scores of DASS and PSQI compared to their comparative partners. Significant correlations were reported between stress with depression, anxiety and PQSI scores (P = 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, stress scores were significantly associated with female sex, depression and anxiety scores. We conclude that depression, anxiety and stress symptoms are common in medical students of Assiut University relative to other schools and female gender was significantly correlated with these findings.

Disassociation of cognitive and affective aspects of theory of mind in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Impairment in social functioning has been widely described in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, several aspects of social cognition, such as theory of mind (ToM), have not been substantially investigated in this context. This study examined cognitive and affective ToM in 40 OCD patients and 38 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) with the computerized Yoni task and a battery of neurocognitive tests. OCD symptom severity was assessed with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Depressive and anxiety symptoms were also assessed. Compared to HCs, OCD patients performed worse on second-order affective condition trials, but not cognitive or physical condition trials, of the Yoni task; there were not group differences in any of the first-order condition domains. Second-order ToM performance of OCD patients was associated with estimated intelligence and working memory performance. After controlling for neurocognitive variables, the group difference in second-order affective condition performance remained significant. These findings indicate that the affective component of ToM may be selectively impaired in OCD patients and that the observed deficit is largely independent of other neurocognitive impairments and clinical characteristics.

Mood and anxiety disorders in Australia and New Zealand's indigenous populations: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"The Indigenous populations of Australia and New Zealand are considered at higher risk of mood and anxiety disorders but many studies do not include direct comparisons with similar non-Indigenous controls. We conducted a systematic search of relevant electronic databases, as well as snowballing and targeted searches of the grey literature. Studies were included for meta-analysis if they compared rates of mood and anxiety disorders between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians or Maori. Seven Australian and 10 NZ studies were included. Overall, Indigenous people in both countries did not have significantly higher rates of disorder. However, in terms of specific disorders, there were differences in risk by gender, country (Australia or NZ), disorder type, and prevalence (current, 12-month or lifetime). For instance, Indigenous Australians and Maori both had significantly lower rates of simple phobias (current prevalence) and Maori participants had significantly lower rates of both lifetime simple phobia and generalised anxiety disorders. By contrast, Indigenous Australians had significantly higher rates of bipolar affective disorder and social phobia (current prevalence). Generalisations regarding the risk of psychiatric disorders in Indigenous people cannot therefore be made as this varies by several factors. These include disorder type, sociodemographic factors, Indigenous origin and study method.

Associations of plasma leptin to clinical manifestations in reproductive aged female patients with panic disorder,"Preclinical studies suggest the implication of the adipocyte hormone leptin in anxiety and fear processes. We explored for potential differences regarding plasma leptin, cortisol and the ratio leptin/Body Mass Index (BMI) between 27 medication-free female patients with Panic Disorder (PD) and 42 age-matched female controls, and for potential associations between plasma leptin and psychometric evaluations including number of panic attacks during last week, Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Symptoms Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Cortisol levels showed no differences between patients and controls, or correlations to leptin or to any clinical features. Both groups demonstrated a strong positive correlation between leptin and BMI and similar leptin and leptin/BMI, despite patients’ lower BMI. However, patients –but not controls- demonstrated significant negative correlations of leptin to the ‘somatization’, ‘anxiety’, and ‘phobic anxiety’ SCL-90-R subscales. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation of leptin and of leptin/BMI ratio to the number of panic attacks during last week, while higher CGI-S was associated with lower leptin/BMI ratio. Our results, limited to PD female patients, suggest that lower leptin serum levels are significantly associated with greater severity of psychopathological manifestations, including number of panic attacks, symptoms of somatization, anxiety and phobic anxiety and overall clinical presentation.

Early maladaptive schemas and suicidal risk in an Iranian sample of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder,"There are few studies on suicidal risk and its related factors in patients diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This study investigated the associations of early maladaptive schemas, OC symptom dimensions, OCD severity, depression and anxiety with suicidality (i.e., suicidal ideation and suicide attempts) in OCD patients. Sixty OCD outpatients completed the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI), the Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form (YSQ-SF), the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). 51.7% of patients had lifetime suicide attempts and 75% had suicidal ideation. OCD patients with lifetime suicide attempts exhibited significantly higher scores on early maladaptive schemas than those without such attempts. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the mistrust/abuse schema and the OC symptom dimension of unacceptable thoughts explained lifetime suicide attempts. The mistrust/abuse schema, unacceptable thoughts and depression significantly predicted suicidal ideation. These findings indicated that the mistrust/abuse schema may contribute to high suicidality in OCD patients. Also, patients suffering from unacceptable thoughts need to be assessed more carefully for warning signs of suicide.

Maternal distress in late pregnancy alters obstetric outcomes and the expression of genes important for placental glucocorticoid signalling,"The experience of maternal distress in pregnancy is often linked with poorer obstetric outcomes for women as well as adverse outcomes for offspring. Alterations in placental glucocorticoid signalling and subsequent increased fetal exposure to cortisol have been suggested to underlie this relationship. In the current study, 121 pregnant women completed the Perceived Stress Scale, State Trait Anxiety Inventory and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in the third trimester of pregnancy. Placental samples were collected after delivery. Maternal history of psychiatric illness and miscarriage were significant predictors of poorer mental health in pregnancy. Higher anxiety was associated with an increase in women delivering via elective Caesarean Section, and an increase in bottle-feeding. Birth temperature was mildly reduced among infants of women with high levels of depressive symptomology. Babies of mothers who scored high in all stress (cumulative distress) measures had reduced 5-min Apgar scores. High cumulative distress reduced the expression of placental HSD11B2 mRNA and increased the expression of placental NR3C1 mRNA. These data support a role for prenatal distress as a risk factor for altered obstetric outcomes. The alterations in placental gene expression support a role for altered placental glucocorticoid signalling in the relationship between maternal prenatal distress and adverse outcomes.

Quality of life in Chinese patients with schizophrenia treated in primary care,"In China, maintenance treatment for clinically stable patients with schizophrenia is usually provided by primary care physicians. This study examined the quality of life (QOL) in patients with schizophrenia treated in primary care and explored the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with QOL. Altogether, 612 patients with schizophrenia treated in 22 randomly selected primary care services in China formed the study sample. QOL, psychotic and depressive symptoms, extra-pyramidal symptoms and insight were assessed using standardized instruments. Data analyses were conducted with the one sample t-test and multiple linear regression analyses. Compared with the normative data for the Chinese general population, significantly lower scores in physical and mental QOL domains were found in the patient group. Older age, being unemployed, major medical conditions, no smoking, more severe depressive and negative symptoms, more frequent insomnia, and suicidality were independently associated with poor physical QOL. Male gender, more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, more frequent insomnia, and suicidality were independently associated with poor mental QOL. Patients with schizophrenia treated in primary care had lower level of QOL in comparison with general population. Effective measures need to be implemented to improve their QOL.

Social factors affect motor and anxiety behaviors in the animal model of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders: A housing-style factor,"The present study examines whether housing style (e.g., single housing, same-strain-grouped housing, and different-strain-grouped housing) and rat strain (e.g., spontaneous hypertension rats [SHR] and Wistar-Kyoto rats [WKY]) mediate motor function and anxiety behavior in the open field task. From week 4 through week 10 following birth, the rats were measured 30min for locomotor activity and anxiety once per week in the open field task. The SHR rats exhibited hyperactivity in total distance traveled and movement time to form the animal model of ADHD. The SHR rats spent more time inside the square and crossed the inside-outside line more often than the WKY rats, indicating the SHR rats exhibited less anxiety behavior. The different-strain-grouped housing style (but neither the same-strain-grouped housing style nor the single housing style) decreased total distance traveled and facilitated anxiety behavior. The motor function was negatively correlated with anxiety behavior for SHR rats but not for WKY rats. Housing styles had a negative correlation between motor function and anxiety behavior. The present findings provide some insights regarding how social factors (such as housing style) affect motor function and anxiety behavior related to ADHD in a clinical setting.

Somatoform symptoms profiles in relation to psychological disorders—A population classification analysis in a large sample of general adults,"In order to identifying somatoform symptoms profiles, classifying study population and evaluating of psychological disorders in extracted classes, we carried out a cross-sectional study on 4762 Iranian adults. Somatoform symptoms were assessed using a comprehensive 30-items questionnaire and psychological disorders were evaluated by 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaires. Factor analysis and factor mixture modeling (FMM) were used for data analysis. Four somatoform symptoms profiles were extracted, including ‘psycho-fatigue’, ‘gastrointestinal’, ‘neuro- skeletal’ and ‘pharyngeal-respiratory’. According to FMM results, a two-class four-factor structure, based somatoform symptoms, was identified in our study population. Two identified classes were labeled as “low psycho-fatigue complaints” and “high psycho-fatigue complaints”. The scores of psychological disorders profile was significantly associated with four somatoform symptoms profiles in both classes; however the stronger relationship was observed in high psycho-fatigue complaints class. The prevalence of all the somatoform symptoms among participants assigned to the ""high psycho-fatigue complaints"" class was significantly higher than other class. We concluded that somatoform symptoms have a dimensional-categorical structure within our study population. Our study also provided informative pathways on the association of psychological disorders with somatoform symptoms. These findings could be useful for dealing with treatment's approaches.

Positive effects of individual cognitive behavior therapy for patients with unipolar mood disorders with suicidal ideation in Malaysia: A randomised controlled trial,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of Individual Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) in treating patients with mood disorders with suicidal ideation. A total of 69 patients (48 females, 21 males) with the diagnoses above were randomly allocated to either the group of Treatment As Usual (TAU) + ICBT (n = 33) or the TAU group (n = 36). All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS), Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation Inventory (PANSI), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). These questionnaires were administered at pre-treatment, midway through treatment (week 4), post-treatment (week 8), and at follow-ups after three months (week 20) and six months (week 32). Factorial ANOVA results showed that the TAU + ICBT patients improved significantly and at faster rate as compared to the TAU group, which showed improvement only from pre to mid treatment on DASS-D and BHS-T measures. The effect size (Cohen's d), for the TAU + ICBT group showed large effect (1.47) for depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (1.00). These findings suggest that ICBT used in addition to the TAU, was effective in enhancing treatment outcome of patients with unipolar mood disorders as well as, reducing risk for suicide behavior.

The relationship of social anxiety disorder symptoms with probable attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Turkish university students; impact of negative affect and personality traits of neuroticism and extraversion,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate relationship of social anxiety disorder symptoms with probable attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) while controlling the personality traits of neuroticism and extraversion, anxiety and depression symptoms in a sample of Turkish university students (n = 455). Participants were evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Revised-Abbreviated Form (EPQR-A), the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale ( ASRS -v1.1) and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) . Severity of social anxiety, depression, anxiety and neuroticism were higher among those with probable ADHD, whereas extraversion score did not differ between the groups. The severity of ADHD score, particularly hyperactivity/impulsivity score, was related with the “fear or anxiety” together with low extraversion (introversion) and high neuroticism dimensions of personality, whereas the severity of ADHD score, both inatentiveness and hyperactivity/impulsivity scores, was related with “avoidence” together with low extraversion (introversion) dimension of personality. These findings suggest that probable ADHD and severity of ADHD symptoms are related with both “fear or anxiety” and “avoidance” of social anxiety, while personality dimensions of low extraversion (introversion) and high neuroticism may have an effect on this relationships among young adults.

"Role of IL-8, CRP and epidermal growth factor in depression and anxiety patients treated with mindfulness-based therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy in primary health care","Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and inflammatory markers have been associated with various neuro-psychiatric disorders. However, their role in mild to moderate depression and anxiety patients treated with mindfulness-based group therapy (mindfulness) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is not known. In this study we analyzed plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and EGF before (baseline) and after treatment (8 weeks) and investigated their role in response to both arms of the treatment. To cover variety of mental symptoms, treatment response was analyzed by four scales, the Montgomery–Åsberg depression rating scale (MADRS), Hospital anxiety and depression scale- Depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A) and patients health questionnaire-9. EGF levels were significantly decreased after both mindfulness and CBT and were associated with treatment response on all scales independent of the use of tranquilizers and antidepressant treatment. Moreover, baseline EGF levels were significantly associated only with baseline scores of anxiety scale. Levels of inflammatory markers analyzed in this study, were not significantly associated with treatment response on any scale. Our findings suggest that improvement in symptoms of depression and anxiety after both mindfulness and CBT is associated with changes in EGF levels but not with the inflammatory markers.

"Vitamin B12, folic acid, homocysteine and vitamin D levels in children and adolescents with obsessive compulsive disorder","Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a complex disorder with a poorly understood aetiopathogenesis. One carbon metabolism that includes vitamin B12, folic acid and homocysteine has been investigated in many psychiatric disorders like OCD. In recent years, vitamin D has also been considered to contribute to many of these psychiatric disorders. In this study we investigated whether vitamin B12, homocysteine and vitamin D play a role in the aetiology of paediatric OCD. With this aim we compared 52 children and adolescent OCD patients with 30 healthy controls. The participants were tested for vitamin B12, folic acid, homocysteine and vitamin D levels and were evaluated with a sociodemographic form, state-trait anxiety inventory 1 and 2, Kovacs Depression Inventory and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). As a result we found significantly lower levels of vitamin B12 and vitamin D and higher levels of homocysteine in the patient group compared to control group (p values for all three scores were &lt; 0.001), whereas there was no significant difference between groups in terms of folate levels (p = 0.083). This demonstrates that one carbon metabolism and vitamin D deficiency can play a role in the aetiology of OCD.

Assessing the latent structure of DSM-5 PTSD among Chinese adolescents after the Ya’an earthquake,"To examine the underlying substructure of DSM-5 PTSD in an adolescent sample, this study used a confirmatory factor analysis alternative model approach to assess 813 adolescents two and a half years after the Ya’an earthquake. Participants completed the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children, and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders. The results found that the seven-factor hybrid PTSD model entailing intrusion, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, externalizing behaviors, anxious arousal, and dysphoric arousal had significantly better fit indices than other alternative models. Depression and anxiety displayed high correlations with the seven-factor model. The findings suggested that the seven-factor model was more applicable to adolescents following the earthquake, and may carry important implications for further clinical practice and research on posttraumatic stress symptomatology.

Prevalence and treatment of psychiatric disorders other than psychosis in children and adolescents with 22q11DS: Examining associations with social and role functioning,"Individuals with chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) have high rates of psychotic disorders. Less is known about their psychopathology and how it is treated prior to the peak period of risk for psychotic disorder. There is also a lack of evidence on how functioning is impacted by psychopathology in this population. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and treatment of non-psychotic psychiatric disorders, and how these factors are associated with psychosocial functioning in children and adolescents with 22q11DS. 126 individuals with 22q11DS aged 8–17 participated in the study. Participants were assessed for psychiatric diagnoses, social and role functioning, anxiety and depressive symptoms and IQ. Information on current treatments was collected. 52.4% of the sample presented with at least one psychiatric disorder. Mood and anxiety disorders were the most frequent, followed by behavioural disorder. Individuals with a psychiatric disorder had significantly lower general, role and social functioning. Only 27% of participants with a psychiatric diagnosis were receiving any mental health treatment at the time of assessment. Findings suggest the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders in youth with 22q11DS, which significantly impacts psychosocial functioning.

Attentional control of emotional interference in children with ADHD and typically developing children: An emotional N-back study,"Emotional interference control refers to the ability to remain focused on goal-oriented processes when confronted with disrupting but irrelevant emotional stimuli, a process that may be impaired in children and adults with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, emotional interference levels are known to be associated with trait anxiety, and patients with ADHD often display elevated levels of trait anxiety, such as these may have confounded previous findings of decreased emotional interference control in this population. In the present study, male and female 8–13 years old (mean = 11.0 years) children with ADHD (n = 33) and typically developing (TD) children ( n = 24) performed a visual emotional working memory (n-back) task with 2 memory loads and three different background pictures (neutral/positive/negative), and trait anxiety measures were obtained. Children with ADHD performed less well, and displayed increased emotional interference in the presence of aversive distractors when compared with TD children. Contrary to our expectations, trait anxiety did not mediate the association between diagnostic group membership and the degree of emotional interference control; however, co-morbid ODD was associated with decreased levels of emotional interference in ADHD. Future research should aim at characterizing the mechanisms subtending decreased emotional interference control in the ADHD population.

Which biopsychosocial variables contribute to more weight gain in depressed persons?,"Depression appears to be associated with weight gain. Little is known about whether this association is independent of, or partly due to, several biopsychosocial variables. This study aims to investigate which biopsychosocial variables contribute to weight gain over a 4-year period in persons with major depressive disorder (MDD) or high depressive symptoms. Data from 1658 adults who participated in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used. Baseline depression was measured with a DSM-IV based psychiatric interview and with a depressive symptom measure. Four year weight gain was classified as stable weight (within 5% gain or loss) versus weight gain (&gt; 5% gain). Twenty-one baseline psychological, lifestyle and biological variables and antidepressant use were considered as potential contributing variables. In sociodemographic adjusted models, MDD and depressive symptoms were associated with subsequent weight gain. None of the biopsychosocial variables or antidepressants was associated with weight gain, thus did not contribute to the observed increased weight gain risk in depression, except for alcohol intake and TCA use. Future research should explore other potential factors that may be responsible for the increased risk for subsequent weight gain in depression, e.g. unhealthy dietary patterns or eating styles, or underlying intrinsic factors such as genetics.

Emotion regulation as a moderator between anxiety symptoms and insomnia symptom severity,"Insomnia is a common concern with many associated negative consequences. Previous research has established bivariate relationships between anxiety symptoms, emotion regulation, and insomnia symptom severity; however, limited research has examined how the interaction between emotion regulation and anxiety symptoms may be associated with insomnia symptom severity. A sample of 468 undergraduate participants and a subsample of 136 participants meeting a self-reported cutoff score for insomnia, completed questionnaires assessing anxiety, insomnia symptom severity, and emotion regulation difficulties. Among the general sample of all participants, the interaction between anxiety symptoms and both overall emotion regulation difficulties and limited access to emotion regulation strategies were associated with insomnia symptom severity. However, among the insomnia subsample, emotion regulation moderated this relationship, such that insomnia symptom severity increased as anxiety symptoms increased among those with high emotion regulation difficulties, but were unaffected by changes in anxiety symptoms among those with low emotion regulation difficulties. These findings suggest that maladaptive emotion regulation may be necessary for anxiety symptoms to have a negative influence on sleep difficulties, meaning that during treatment, it may be important to address both an individual's anxiety symptoms and emotion regulation difficulties, particularly among those with clinical levels of insomnia.

Our sample consisted of 1187 adult, treatment-seeking OCD outpatients from the U.S. ( n = 236) and Brazil ( n = 951). With regards to the demographics, U.S. participants with OCD were older, more likely to identify as Caucasian, had achieved a higher educational level, and were less likely to be partnered when compared to Brazilians. Concerning the clinical variables, after controlling for demographics the two samples presented largely similar profiles. Brazilian participants with OCD, however, endorsed significantly greater rates of generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, whereas U.S. subjects were significantly more likely to endorse a lifetime history of addiction (alcohol-use and substance-use disorders). This is the largest direct cross-cultural comparison to date in the OCD field. Our results provide much needed insight regarding the development of culture-sensitive treatments.

Shadows of the past and threats of the future: ISIS anxiety among grandchildren of Holocaust survivors,"The current study examined intergenerational transmission of trauma in grandchildren of Holocaust survivors. While many typically do not find evidence for such effects, careful reading of the relevant literature suggests conditions under which such effects may be obtained. Following, we made use of three factors. First, we took the number of grandparents exposed to the Holocaust into account. Second, we examined participants who were exposed to present terror and displayed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Third, we measured anxiety of a future ISIS threat, which in its genocidal nature is reminiscent of the Holocaust. Results reveal that grandchildren having all four grandparents who survived the Holocaust in conjunction with them directly experiencing PTSD symptoms demonstrated greater ISIS anxiety than other groups.

Taxometric analyses and predictive accuracy of callous-unemotional traits regarding quality of life and behavior problems in non-conduct disorder diagnoses,"Callous-unemotional (CU) traits have mainly been studied in relation to conduct disorder (CD), but can also occur in other disorder groups. However, it is unclear whether there is a clinically relevant cut-off value of levels of CU traits in predicting reduced quality of life (QoL) and clinical symptoms, and whether CU traits better fit a categorical (taxonic) or dimensional model. Parents of 979 youths referred to a child and adolescent psychiatric clinic rated their child's CU traits on the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional traits (ICU), QoL on the Kidscreen-27, and clinical symptoms on the Child Behavior Checklist. Experienced clinicians conferred DSM-IV-TR diagnoses of ADHD, ASD, anxiety/mood disorders and DBD-NOS/ODD. The ICU was also used to score the DSM-5 specifier ‘with limited prosocial emotions’ (LPE) of Conduct Disorder. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses revealed that the predictive accuracy of the ICU and LPE regarding QoL and clinical symptoms was poor to fair, and similar across diagnoses. A clinical cut-off point could not be defined. Taxometric analyses suggested that callous-unemotional traits on the ICU best reflect a dimension rather than taxon. More research is needed on the impact of CU traits on the functional adaptation, course, and response to treatment of non-CD conditions.

Participants (N = 336) ages 18–27 years old were evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID). The SCAARED was completed at or within two-weeks before the SCID. The psychometrics of the SCAARED were analyzed using standard statistical analyses including principal components, and Receiver Operant Curve analyses. A replication was performed in an age/sex matched independent sample (N = 158). Results: The SCAARED showed four factors: somatic/panic/agoraphobia, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, and social anxiety. The total and each factor scores demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.86−0.97) and good discriminant validity between anxiety and other disorders and within anxiety disorders for generalized and social anxiety. Area Under the Curve for the total and each of the factor scores ranged between 0.72 and 0.84 (p &lt; 0.0001). These results were replicated in the independent sample. Conclusions: The SCAARED showed excellent psychometric properties supporting its use to screen adults for anxiety disorders, longitudinal studies following youth into adulthood and studies comparing child and adult populations.

Perceived parental child rearing and attachment as predictors of anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms in children: The mediational role of attachment,"The present study aimed to examine (a) the relative contribution of perceived parental child-rearing behaviors and attachment on anxiety and depressive symptoms, and (b) the role of attachment as a possible mediator of the association between parental rearing and anxiety and depression. A sample of 1002 children (aged 9–12 years) completed a booklet of self-report questionnaires measuring parental rearing behaviors, attachment towards peers, and DSM anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms. We found that parental aversiveness, parental neglect, and fearful/preoccupied attachment, each accounted for a significant amount of the variance in both anxiety and depressive symptoms. In addition, parental overcontrol was found to account for unique variance in anxiety whereas communication/warmth accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in depression. A relevant finding was that fearful/preoccupied attachment was found to mediate the association between parental rearing behaviors and both anxiety and depression. Parental rearing behaviors and attachment to peers may act as risk factors to the development and/or maintenance of anxiety and depressive symptomatology in children. Findings may contribute to outline preventive and/or treatment programs to prevent or reduce both clinical anxiety and depression during childhood.

We test associations between 5-HTTLPR and (1) behavioral traits and (2) clinical diagnoses of anxiety and depression. Second and third generation participants (N=203, 34.2±13.8 years, 54% female) at high- or low- familial risk for depression (where risk was defined by the presence of major depression in the 1st generation) were assessed longitudinally using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-lifetime interview, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11, Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, and the NEO-Five Factor Inventory. High (but not low)-risk offspring with two risk (short, s) alleles had higher impulsivity (+13%), hostility (+31%) and neuroticism (+23%). SS was associated higher rates of panic (OR=7.05 [2.44, 20.38], p=0.0003) and phobic (OR=2.68[1.04, 6.93], p=0.04), but not other disorders. Impulsivity accounted for 16% of associations between 5-HTTLPR and panic, and 52% of association between 5-HTTLPR and phobias. We show that 5-HTTLPR predicts higher impulsivity, hostility, and neuroticism, and that impulsivity could serve as a useful independent outcome or intermediary phenotype in genetic studies of anxiety.

Substance abuse in patients with bipolar disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"By considering the debilitating outcome of co-occurring of bipolar disorder (BD) and substance abuse, determination of risk factors of substance use disorders (SUD: abuse or dependence of drugs and/or alcohol) is essential to identify the susceptible patients. The purpose of this study was to clarify the major determinant factors of SUD among adults with BD by reviewing the relevant literature. We systematically searched electronic databases including PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, OVID, Cochrane and Scopus for human studies addressing the co-existence of bipolar disorder and SUD. All potential published papers up to September 2016 have been reviewed. The statistical analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis version 2. Male gender (Odds ratio: 2.191 (95% CI: 1.121–4.281), P 0.022), number of manic episodes (P: 0.001) and previous history of suicidality (Odds ratio: 1.758 (95% CI: 1.156–2.674), P: 0.008) were associated to SUD in patients with BD. SUD was not related to age, subtype of BD, hospitalization and co-existence of anxiety disorders or psychotic symptoms. SUD affects many aspects of BD regarding clinical course, psychopathology and prognosis. Our study demonstrates that male gender, history of higher number of manic episodes and suicidality are associated to higher susceptibility to SUD. Thus, assignment of more intensive therapeutic interventions should be considered in patients with increased risk of drug abuse to prevent development of SUD.

Investigating insomnia as a cross-sectional and longitudinal predictor of loneliness: Findings from six samples,"Loneliness has been repeatedly associated with sleep problems; however, there is a dearth of research examining the prospective relationship between insomnia and loneliness, as well as this association controlling for other psychiatric symptoms. This study evaluated the cross-sectional and prospective relationship between insomnia and loneliness using six samples: 666 undergraduates; 2785 Army recruiters; 208 adults with a history of suicidality and/or depression; 343 adult psychiatric outpatients; 326 young adults at elevated suicide risk; and 183 undergraduates. A meta-analysis also was conducted to examine the magnitude of the relationship between insomnia and loneliness across the six studies. More severe insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with greater feelings of loneliness while accounting for some (e.g., anxiety, nightmares) but not all (i.e., depression) psychiatric covariates. Findings underscore the strength of the association between insomnia and loneliness and suggest that depression may account for this relationship. Additional studies are needed to further establish the temporal relationship between these variables, delineate the role of depression in the association between insomnia and loneliness, and test whether insomnia may confer unique risk for subsequent loneliness.

Negative correlation between cerebrospinal fluid FGF21 levels and BDI scores in male Chinese subjects,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an important metabolic regulator of glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Recently, FGF21 has been shown to play a robust neuroprotective role and act as a mediator of the effects of mood stabilizers. In the present study, we measured the concentration of FGF21 in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and investigated the relationship of FGF21 levels with depression and anxiety emotions. Sixty-seven Chinese volunteers were recruited from Beijing Jishuitan Hospital. A significant negative association was found between CSF FGF21 levels and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores in male subjects. Our findings provide evidence of the role of FGF21 in mood regulation.

Effect of self-esteem on social interactions during the Ultimatum Game,"Self-esteem is an attitude formed by self-evaluation based on positive and negative aspects of oneself. Low self-esteem is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders and is especially associated with social difficulties. Recently, behavioral economics has allowed the quantitative study of social interactions. We investigated the association between self-esteem and interpersonal problems and whether self-esteem modulates behavior and emotions during an economic task, the Ultimatum Game (UG). In this task participants accept or reject fair/unfair monetary offers from others. Low (LSE, n = 40) and high (HSE, n = 45) self-esteem participants were assessed in their interpersonal problems and psychiatric symptoms using self-reported questionnaires, and were compared on their decision making and emotional response during the UG. LSE was associated with depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition, LSE was associated with interpersonal problems, especially in the domains of socially inhibited, nonassertive, overly accommodating, self-sacrificing and cold/distant. During the UG, LSE women reported more anger towards unfair offers than HSE women. Our findings suggest that low self-esteem individuals experience high distress by interpersonal problems in several domains. Importantly, low self-esteem in women seems to be associated with an accentuated emotional response to unfair social exchanges. These results may contribute to treat social difficulties in this population.

Anxiety sensitivity mediates gender differences in post-concussive symptoms in a clinical sample,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is both prevalent and potentially disabling. Extant literature has demonstrated women to report greater post-concussive symptoms (PCS) compared to men, highlighting the necessity of investigations into malleable, gender-linked risk factors for PCS that hold promise for reducing this gender disparity. Anxiety Sensitivity (AS) and Distress Tolerance (DT) are gender-linked risk factors that may be related to PCS. Despite a breadth of research supporting elevated AS and reduced DT in women, no study to date has investigated whether AS and DT mediate gender differences in PCS. The current sample was composed of 59 participants selected from a larger study based on their report of a past TBI. Findings indicated that AS, but not DT, significantly mediated gender differences in PCS. The present results suggest that AS is a cognitive risk factor that can partially account for the gender disparity in the expression of PCS. AS may influence an individual's interpretation of PCS as dangerous, thereby amplifying the perception of PCS severity. This suggests that efforts to reduce the burden of TBI may benefit from targeting AS in prevention and treatment paradigms, especially among women.

"Intolerance of uncertainty, social anxiety, and generalized anxiety: Differences by diagnosis and symptoms","Research suggests that Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) is related to the severity of suffering in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). However, its role in Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) has not been extensively studied. This study examines IU in a clinical sample of 248 individuals referred to a tertiary care clinic. Few individuals had a diagnosis of pure SAD or pure GAD, but we examined differences of IU scores by diagnostic category. We further examined the relationships between IU scores, social anxiety scores, and worry through a structural equation model. We found that diagnostic category (SAD versus GAD) accounted for little variability in IU scores, but IU scores were strongly related to symptoms of both GAD and SAD. Results highlight that IU is related to both social anxiety and worry; however aspects of IU associated with being unable to act or avoiding uncertainty are more strongly associated with SAD symptoms, whereas aspects of IU more associated with general stress and perceiving uncertainty as unfair are more strongly associated with GAD symptoms. Our results suggest that IU is an important concept for both social anxiety and generalized anxiety, however the relationship between IU and symptoms of these disorders manifests differently.

"Determination of health anxiety, anxiety, and somatosensory amplification levels in individuals with normal coronary angiography","The objective of the present study is to determine the somatosensory amplification, anxiety, and depression levels in patients with normal coronary arteries. Thirty-five patients with normal coronary arteries and 35 healthy individuals of similar age and gender as the patient group were included in the study. Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SSAS), Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI-18), Penn State Anxiety Scale (PSWQ), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were applied to all participants. Comparison of the patient group with the control group demonstrated that SSAS (22.7 ± 8.2; 18.5 ± 5.98; p = 0.018), BAI (15.4 ± 9.43; 9.4 ± 7.3; p = 0.004), BDI (24.9 ± 13.5; 13.7 ± 7.5; p &lt; 0.001), PSWQ (55.3 ± 13.7; 33.8 ± 6.7; p &lt; 0.001), and HAI-18 (18.8 ± 8.7; 12.3 ± 7.1; p = 0.001) scores were statistically significantly higher in the patient group. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between SSAS, BAI, BDI, PSWQ, and HAI-18 scores. It was found that concerns about disease prevailed in patients having normal coronary arteries, the patients continued to amplify their somatic sensations, and their anxiety and depression scores were higher than those of healthy individuals. Thus, the necessity of these interventions should be assessed in detail in the future.

"The association between traumatic life events and psychological symptoms from a conservative, transdiagnostic perspective","Exposure to traumatic life events (TLEs) is strongly linked to the onset and exacerbation of an array of psychological sequelae. While studies yield minimal evidence of specificity for one disorder emerging in the aftermath of TLEs versus another, most studies do not adopt a conservative approach in controlling for multiple psychological symptoms linked to TLEs. The present study explored the association between TLEs and eight psychological constructs before and after adjusting for concurrent symptomatology in a diverse sample of 2342 undergraduates. We predicted three symptom domains would withstand conservative adjustments in their relationship to TLEs: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), borderline personality disorder (BPD), and attenuated positive psychotic symptoms (APPS). Results indicated that exposure to at least one TLE, but especially four or more TLEs, was significantly associated with PTSD and BPD symptoms even after controlling for concurrent symptoms. Additionally, the association between four or more TLEs and APPS persisted despite adjusting for covariates. Findings underscore the critical role that TLE histories play in posttraumatic stress, borderline personality, and attenuated psychotic symptom expression. The relationship between TLEs and depression, cannabis and other drug use, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety disappeared after adjusting for comorbid symptoms.

Stigma and social support in substance abuse: Implications for mental health and well-being,"Individuals with substance abuse may suffer from severe public and internalized stigma. Little is known about how social support can reduce stigma and improve mental health and well-being for them. This research examined how perceived stigma influences individuals in treatment for substance abuse, and whether internalized stigma and shame are mechanisms which link social support with better mental health and well-being. Sixty-four participants in treatment for substance abuse (alcohol, drugs), aged between 18 and 64, completed an online survey measuring perceived stigma, internalized stigma, shame, perceived social support, and mental health and well-being (self-esteem, depression and anxiety, sleep). We found that perceived stigma was associated with lower self-esteem, higher depression and anxiety, and poorer sleep. Furthermore, perceived social support followed the opposite pattern, and was associated with higher self-esteem, lower depression and anxiety, and better sleep. The effects of perceived stigma and of perceived social support on our outcome measures were mediated by internalized stigma and by internalized shame. Helping individuals with substance abuse to utilize their social support may be fruitful for combatting the negative impact of internalized stigma and shame on mental health and well-being.

How does gaze direction affect facial processing in social anxiety?—An erp study,"Previous behavioral studies have demonstrated an effect of eye gaze direction on the processing of emotional expressions in adults with social anxiety. However, specific brain responses to the interaction between gaze direction and facial expressions in social anxiety remain unclear. The present study aimed to explore the time course of such interaction using event-related potentials (ERPs) in participants with social anxiety. High socially anxious individuals and low socially anxious individuals were asked to identify the gender of angry or neutral faces with direct or averted gaze while their behavioral performance and electrophysiological data were monitored. We found that identification of angry faces with direct but not averted gaze elicited larger N2 amplitude in high socially anxious individuals compared to low socially anxious individuals, while identification of neutral faces did not produce any gaze modulation effect. Moreover, the N2 was correlated with increased anxiety severity upon exposure to angry faces with direct gaze. Therefore, our results suggest that gaze direction modulates the processing of threatening faces in social anxiety. The N2 component elicited by angry faces with direct gaze could be a state-dependent biomarker of social anxiety and may be an important reference biomarker for social anxiety diagnosis and intervention.

Prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among patients with chronic respiratory diseases in eight general hospitals in Jiangsu Province of China: A cross-sectional study,"Anxiety and depression are two common psychological disorders with high morbidity worldwide. Understanding of their prevalence of patients with chronic respiratory diseases is becoming more and more important for clinicians. The current study aims at investigation of the prevalence and potential risk factors of anxiety and depression among patients with chronic respiratory diseases. The psychological status, anxiety and depression, and the relevant risk factors of 1713 patients with chronic respiratory diseases from 8 general hospitals in Jiangsu Province of China were evaluated. The results showed that the patients with chronic respiratory diseases experiencing depression and anxiety accounted for 46.00% and 25.34%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that lower body mass index (BMI), sleep disorders, limitation of physical activity, and negative life events were significantly associated with an increased risk of both depressive and anxiety symptoms. Poor marital status including divorce, separation and widowerhood was markedly correlated with an increased risk of depression, and chronic pain was with anxiety symptoms, respectively. Collectively, the data demonstrated that depression and anxiety were highly prevalent among the patients with chronic respiratory diseases. It is greatly significant to take specific psychological measures to lower the incidence of depression and anxiety in these patients.

Subthreshold body dysmorphic disorder in adolescents: Prevalence and impact,"The aim of the current study was to establish the prevalence of subthreshold body dysmorphic disorder (subthreshold-BDD) in a community sample of adolescents, and to compare disorder correlates in individuals with subthreshold-BDD to those with probable full-syndrome BDD (probable-BDD) and those without BDD (non-BDD). Self-report questionnaires assessing DSM-IV BDD criteria, past mental health service use, and symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder, anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and eating disorders, were completed by 3149 Australian high school students (mean age = 14.6 years, 63.5% male). Male participants also completed measures assessing quality of life, muscularity concerns, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and peer problems. The prevalence of subthreshold-BDD was 3.4%, and probable-BDD was 1.7%. Compared to the non-BDD group, subthreshold-BDD was associated with elevated symptoms of comorbid psychopathology and greater past mental health service use, and in male-only measures, with poorer quality of life and elevated muscularity concerns. Subthreshold-BDD participants reported significantly lower mental health service use, and fewer symptoms of depression, eating disorders, and hyperactivity than probable-BDD participants, however, other comorbid symptoms did not differ significantly between these groups. These findings indicate that subthreshold-BDD is associated with substantial difficulties for adolescents in the general community. BDD screening should include subthreshold presentations, as these may be an important target for early intervention programs.

Identifying sub-categories of social fears using an alternative factor analytic structure of the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory,"Aims: This study evaluates an alternative factor structure of the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (Turner et al., 1989), a widely used measure of social anxiety. Existing models ignore variance due to the different social contexts where social fears are expressed. Method: Taking a different approach to scoring than previous studies, this investigation proposes a new model, which, in addition to 4–5 symptom dimensions, is able to capture the situations (strangers, authority figures, members of the opposite sex and people in general) that are of concern to the examinee. To test this model, all 96 items of the Social Phobia scale, rather than the average of the sub-items of its 23 questions were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis. Results: The model shows good fit and is superior to models ignoring the “situation” factors, which show good predictive validity in respect to real life demographics. Conclusion: Utilization of all single questions of the SPAI can capture a wider range of social fears related to social anxiety than using the average of the items, which has implications for the understanding and clinical assessment of social anxiety.

Influence of age and gender on mental health literacy of anxiety disorders,"This study explored the influence of age and gender on Mental Health Literacy (MHL) of various anxiety disorders. The aim was to determine whether the gender and age of participants and gender of the disorders character had a significant effect on their ability to recognise a range of anxiety disorders. A convenience sample of 162 individuals (aged 18–70yrs) completed one of two questionnaires, which differed only on the gender of the vignette's character. Participants had to label the “problems” of individual in six vignettes and state their opinion on how well adjusted the characters were in terms of happiness and work and personal relationships. ‘Correct’ labelling (using the official/technical term) of the different disorders varied from 3% to 29% of all participants. Gender differences of participants had a significant effect on literacy where females demonstrated higher MHL than males and the youngest group (18–29yrs) showed better MHL than older groups. There was a non-significant effect of vignette gender on recognition rates. The research points to the evidence that MHL remains relatively low for all anxiety disorders.

All study participants completed a sociodemographic data form and the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the State &amp; Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Distress Tolerance Scale. DSM-IV-TR Axis I diagnoses were evaluated by psychiatrists through face to face interviews in which a Structured Clinical Interview (SCID I) was administered. We found a statistically significant lower level of distress tolerance (DT) in our SDPP group. A negative relationship was found between levels of DT, depression and anxiety. The results of our study suggested that negative emotional symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and distress tolerance were frequently seen in parents of substance dependent patients.

The structure of vulnerabilities for social anxiety disorder,"Social anxiety disorder symptoms are generally proposed to be related to broad temperamental vulnerabilities (e.g., a low level of approach and high level of avoidance temperament), specific psychological vulnerabilities (e.g., fears of negative and positive evaluation), and additional disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder). However, existing tests of such a model have either not considered depressive symptoms or relied on samples of undergraduates. We examined these and related questions via a latent variable model in a large dataset ( N = 2253) that combined participants across a variety of studies. The model had adequate fit in the whole sample, and good fit in a subsample in which more participants completed the depression measure. The model indicated that low level of approach and high level of avoidance temperament contributed to fears of evaluation and social anxiety symptoms, and that fears of evaluation additionally contributed independently to social anxiety symptoms. The relationship between social anxiety and depressive symptoms was entirely accounted for by these vulnerabilities: Depressive symptoms were only predicted by avoidance temperament.

"Health status, health related behaviours and chronic health indicators in people with Tourette Syndrome: A Canadian population-based study","Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorder. The objective of this study was to compare self-perceived health status, health-related behaviours, and chronic health conditions in individuals with and without TS using population-based data. Data were derived from Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2010 and 2011 cycles. The CCHS is a national population-based cross-sectional survey that collects information related to health status for Canadians. We evaluated the association between TS and self-perceived health, health related behaviours and chronic health conditions. 122,884 Canadians participated with 122 participants diagnosed with TS. After controlling for age and sex, the TS population was significantly less likely to have good self-perceived physical health and significantly more likely to need help with instrumental activities of daily living. More individuals with TS were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, a mood disorder, or asthma. We observed no significant differences in health related behaviours between individuals with TS and the general population other than a higher odds of consultation for mental health. Individuals with TS experience a higher frequency of anxiety and mood disorders, and require more assistance with activities of daily living than the general population.

"Insulin resistance, atherogenicity, and iron metabolism in multiple sclerosis with and without depression: Associations with inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers and uric acid","Depression is accompanied by metabolic disorders in iron metabolism, lipoproteins, and insulin resistance. We measured plasma levels of ferritin, iron, lipids, insulin, and glucose and computed the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA2IR) and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) in MS patients with and without depression and healthy controls. Explanatory variables were serum uric acid, interleukin (IL)-6, lipid hydroperoxides (CL-LOOH), albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Depression was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), neurological disability using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and disease progression using ∆EDSS over five years earlier. HOMA2IR and insulin were predicted by diagnosis (increased in MS), age and body mass index (BMI); AIP by diagnosis, sex, BMI, CRP, and uric acid; triglycerides by diagnosis (higher in MS without depression), age, BMI and uric acid; ferritin by diagnosis (higher in MS), sex, CRP, and albumin; and iron by albumin. The HADS score was significantly predicted by ∆EDSS, gastro-intestinal symptoms, iron (inverse), and age. MS is characterized by significantly increased insulin resistance, which is determined by increased insulin levels; and increased ferritin, a biomarker of inflammation. Depression in MS is not associated with increased insulin resistance and atherogenicity but with lowered iron.

"A more rational, theory-driven approach to analysing the factor structure of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale","We endeavoured to analyze the factor structure of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during a screening programme in Hungary, using exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), testing both previously published models and newly developed theory-driven ones, after a critical analysis of the literature. Between April 2011 and January 2015, a sample of 2967 pregnant women (between 12th and 30th weeks of gestation) and 714 women 6 weeks after delivery completed the Hungarian version of the EPDS in South-East Hungary. EFAs suggested unidimensionality in both samples. 33 out of 42 previously published models showed good and 6 acceptable fit with our antepartum data in CFAs, whilst 10 of them showed good and 28 acceptable fit in our postpartum sample. Using multiple fit indices, our theory-driven anhedonia (items 1,2)—anxiety (items 4,5)—low mood (items 8,9) model provided the best fit in the antepartum sample. In the postpartum sample, our theory-driven models were again among the best performing models, including an anhedonia and an anxiety factor together with either a low mood or a suicidal risk factor (items 3,6,10). The EPDS showed moderate within- and between-culture invariability, although this would also need to be re-examined with a theory-driven approach.

Negative metacognitive beliefs moderate the influence of perceived stress and anxiety in long-term anxiety,"Metacognitive theory of emotional disorders (Matthews and Wells, 1994; Wells, 2009) suggests that metacognitive beliefs can play a causal role in the development and maintenance of anxiety symptoms. In this prospective study, we examine the relationships between metacognitive beliefs, perceived stress and anxiety in a non-clinical sample. Participants were 135 undergraduate students who completed a battery of questionnaire at two time points (3- months apart). Results revealed metacognitive beliefs do not predict long-term anxiety independently. However, moderation analyses demonstrated negative beliefs about uncontrollability and danger prospectively moderated the relationship between perceived stress and Time 2 anxiety. Negative metacognitive beliefs also interacted with baseline anxiety to predict the change in anxiety symptoms. The results confirm metacognitions play a causal role in anxiety and have implications for cognitive models and the treatment of anxiety.

Physical exercise ameliorates mood disorder-like behavior on high fat diet-induced obesity in mice,"Obesity is associated with mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate whether treadmill exercise had any benefits on mood disorder by high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity. Mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, control and exercise, high fat diet (HFD), and HFD and exercise. Obesity was induced by a 20-week HFD (60%). In the exercise groups, exercise was performed 6 times a week for 12 weeks, with the exercise duration and intensity gradually increasing at 4-week intervals. Mice were tested in tail suspension and elevated plus maze tasks in order to verify the mood disorder like behavior such as depression and anxiety on obesity. In the present study, the number of 5-HT- and TPH-positive cells, and expression of 5-HT1A and 5-HTT protein decreased in dorsal raphe, and depression and anxiety like behavior increased in HFD group compared with the CON group. In contrast, treadmill exercise ameliorated mood disorder like behavior by HFD induced obesity and enhanced expression of the serotonergic system in the dorsal raphe. We concluded that exercise increases the capacity of the serotonergic system in the dorsal raphe, which improves the mood disorders associated with HFD-induced obesity.

The Treatment Worries Questionnaire: Conjoined measures for evaluating worries about psychosocial treatment in youth and their parents,"Treatment worries, which surround requirements and results of obtaining treatment, may represent an important construct; however, previous measures were limited by their specificity, format, and lack of parent report. Therefore the present study examined the initial outcomes and psychometrics of corresponding measures of treatment worries in youth (Treatment Worries Questionnaire – Child; TWQ-C) and their parents (Treatment Worries Questionnaire—Parent; TWQ-P). Participants were 94 youth (7–17-years old) and parent dyads presenting for treatment of an anxiety disorder. Dyads completed the TWQ-C and TWQ-P along with additional measures prior to initiating treatment. Treatment worries were endorsed in the mild-moderate range by youth and the TWQ-C demonstrated good-excellent internal consistency, a three-factor structure, and consistent convergent and divergent relationships. Treatment worries were endorsed in the low-mild range by parents and the TWQ-P demonstrated fair-good internal consistency, a four-factor structure, and consistent divergent relationships, but variable (by factor) convergent relationships. The results provide information on treatment worries and support the use of the TWQ-C and TWQ-P as broad assessments of the concept. Low endorsement of worries among parents likely relates to the treatment-seeking nature of the sample. Future investigations using the TWQ-C and TWQ-P in a variety of samples is warranted.

Prevention of recurrent affective episodes using extinction training in the reconsolidation window: A testable psychotherapeutic strategy,"Stressors may initially precipitate affective episodes, but with sufficient numbers of recurrences, episodes can occur more autonomously. It is postulated the memory engram for these recurrent depressions moves from the conscious representational memory system to the unconscious habit memory system encoded in the striatum. If this were the case, cognitive behavior therapy targeted toward extinction of habit memories could be an effective maneuver for helping reverse the automaticity of affective episode recurrence. Extinction training in the reconsolidation window (which opens about 5min to 1h after active memory recall) can revise, reverse, or eliminate the long term memories associated with PTSD and other anxiety disorders and with drug abuse craving. We hypothesize that similar cognitive behavioral work in the reconsolidation window could inhibit stress-induced and spontaneous affective episodes. Some initial formulations of possible therapeutic strategies are presented and discussed, as well as caveats. It is hoped that preliminary exposition of this theoretical approach to recurrences in the affective disorders based on principles dependent on work in the reconsolidation window will lead to more detailed elaboration of the therapeutic maneuvers most likely to be successful and ones that can be specifically tested for their clinical efficacy.

Clinicians filled out questionnaires about current depressive symptoms in their patients, lifetime bipolar symptoms, global assessment of functioning and parental history of both major depression and bipolar disorder. Patients assessed current level of anxiety and depressive symptoms and antecedents of childhood ADHD symptoms. Results: Depressed adults with significant childhood ADHD symptoms had a specific pattern of their major depressive episode compared to depressed patients without such symptoms. Subjects with childhood ADHD symptoms were more likely to report lifetime symptoms of mania/hypomania and to have a parent with type I or II bipolar disorder. The developmental trajectories of familial risk for lifetime bipolar symptoms showed that parental bipolar disorder influenced lifetime bipolar symptoms both through a direct pathway and an indirect pathway involving childhood ADHD symptoms. Childhood ADHD and number of depressive symptoms both made direct contributions to lifetime bipolar symptoms.

Clinical and treatment-related determinants of subjective quality of life in patients with first-episode psychosis,"Subjective quality of life (SQoL) has been increasingly studied in first-episode psychosis (FEP). Prior research primarily examined the impact of psychiatric symptoms on SQoL. Relationship between treatment-related factors and SQoL is under-studied. In this study, 159 Chinese patients who had completed 2-year treatment from early intervention service in Hong Kong were recruited. Assessments on premorbid adjustment, clinical profiles including social anxiety measure, functioning, antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal side-effects and attitude toward medication treatment were conducted. SQoL was evaluated by Chinese version SF36 which generated mental and physical component summary (MCS and PCS) scores for analysis. Our results showed that more severe positive symptoms, higher level of depression, greater social anxiety, more negative attitude toward antipsychotic medications and greater degree of akathisia independently predicted lower MCS score. Higher social anxiety level and poorer functioning predicted lower PCS score. Our results indicate that affective and positive symptoms, functioning, and treatment-related variables are critical determinants of SQoL in FEP patients. These identified factors thus represent potentially malleable therapeutic targets for early detection and prompt intervention to promote enhancement of SQoL in the early stage of illness.

"Socio-demographic factors and long-term use of benzodiazepines in patients with depression, anxiety or insomnia","Former studies that have attempted to characterize individual socio-demographic factors associated with long-term benzodiazepine use were based on relatively small sample sizes and/or self-reported data. Our aim was to clarify this using large-scale primary health care data from Sweden. The present study covered 71 primary health care centres containing individual-level data from a total of 919, 941 individuals who visited a primary health care centre (PHCC) during the period 2001–2007. From this database we selected individuals 25 years or older with depression, anxiety and/or insomnia and who were prescribed a benzodiazepine within 0–90 as well as 91–270 days after their first clinical diagnosis of depression, anxiety and/or insomnia. Older age (OR, 2.92, 95% CI, 2.28–3.84), middle SES (OR, 1.22, 95% CI, 1.08–1.38), being on social welfare (OR, 1.40, 95% CI, 1.23–1.62) and not being married were associated with higher long-term benzodiazepine use. The PHCCs only explained a small part of the individual variation in long-term benzodiazepine use. Awareness of the impact on long-term benzodiazepine use of certain individual-level socio-demographic factors is important for health care workers and decision-makers who should aim at targeting general interventions at all primary health care centres.

Assessing future expectations and the two-dimensional model of affect in an Italian population,"Future-directed thinking has been described as part of two underlying systems that integrate dimensions of affect, motivational systems, orientation to the future, and future expectations, which are initiated at the cognitive, affective, biological, behavioral, and motivational levels. The main aim of the present study is to test the two underlying frameworks model and explore future expectations in a general Italian-speaking population (N = 345). Therefore, the second aim of the present paper is to confirm the factorial structure of the Subjective Probability Task (SPT; MacLeod et al., 1996), a questionnaire designed to assess specific positive and negative orientations towards the future. Results showed that the SPT has good psychometric properties and it is a reliable instrument to assess future-directed thinking. Moreover, our findings confirmed the role of future expectancies as cognitive correlates of depression and anxiety. Differently from previous studies (Clark and Watson, 1991; MacLeod et al., 1996), our results did not confirm that depression was characterized by low positive affect. We believe this paper contributes to the understanding of future expectancies and their relation with anxiety and depression, and will help to expand the availability of an instrument to assess future directed thinking.

Curiosity improves coping efficacy and reduces suicidal ideation severity among military veterans at risk for suicide,"Curiosity, the tendency to engage in novel and challenging opportunities, may be an important source of resilience for those at risk for suicide. We hypothesized that curiosity would have a buffering effect against risk conferred by multiple sources of distress, whereby curiosity would be associated with reduced suicidal ideation and increased coping efficacy. As part of a larger intervention trial designed to improve coping skills and reduce suicidal ideation, 117 military veterans with suicidal ideation completed measures of curiosity and distress (perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances) at baseline, and completed measures of suicidal ideation and coping efficacy (to stop negative thoughts, to enlist support from friends and family) at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-week follow up. Growth curve models showed that curiosity moderated the association between distress and suicidal ideation at baseline and that curiosity moderated the association between distress and increased coping efficacy to stop negative thoughts over time. Findings suggest that curiosity may buffer against the effect of heightened levels of distress on suicidal ideation and help facilitate stronger gains in coping efficacy over time. Additional work should further examine the role of curiosity as a protective factor for veterans with suicidal ideation.

Adaptive functions of self-focused attention: Insight and depressive and anxiety symptoms,"Maladaptive forms of self-focus, such as rumination, are considered transdiagnostic factors that contribute to depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, no or few studies have explored the possibility that adaptive forms of self-focus can also be a common factor that is negatively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. To test this possibility, we first examined the psychometric properties of a scale measuring adaptive forms of self-focus (the Self-Reflection and Insight Scale) on Japanese undergraduates ( n = 117). We replicated the two-factor structure of the scale: (a) self-reflection, which is a tendency to focus purposefully on self for self-regulation, and (b) insight, which is a sense of clear self-understanding. Second, we tested our specific hypothesis that these two factors negatively predict a common factor of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The results of structural equation modeling showed that insight (but not self-reflection) has a significant negative association with a latent variable that explains both depressive and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, this common-factor model explained the data better than a control model in which insight predicts depressive and anxiety symptoms individually. These results suggest that (lack of) insight plays an important role in psychological (mal)adjustment as a shared process in depressive and anxiety symptoms.

"Differences in psychological and somatic symptom cluster score profiles between subjects with idiopathic environmental intolerance, major depression and schizophrenia","Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance (IEI) has been associated with psychogenic factors and an increased number of comorbid psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety disorder. The purpose of the current study was to examine a possible overlap of psychological and somatic symptoms between subjects with IEI and patients with major depression and schizophrenia as well as to specify characteristic differences. The different symptom clusters included symptoms of chemical intolerance, neurotoxicity and psychological distress as well as measurements of mental health such as anxiety, depression, somatoform symptoms, and schizophrenia-specific disturbances in cognitive domains. IEI patients reported higher overall levels in physical symptoms such as chemical intolerance, neurotoxicity and somatic symptoms not attributable to an organic cause. Schizophrenia patients showed higher overall levels in self-experienced disturbances in several schizophrenia-specific cognitive domains, whereas general psychological distress, anxiety and depression were rated highest by patients with major depression. Importantly, the groups markedly differed in the shapes of profiles of various symptom clusters. Our results provide evidence that IEI patients can be distinguished on the phenomenological level from patients with major depression or schizophrenia, and that distinct domains of psychological and somatic symptoms are particularly problematic in specific diagnostic groups.

An examination of the anxiolytic effects of exercise for people with anxiety and stress-related disorders: A meta-analysis,"The literature regarding exercise for people with established anxiety disorders is equivocal. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the benefits of exercise compared to usual treatment or control conditions in people with an anxiety and/or stress-related disorders. Major electronic databases were searched from inception until December/2015 and a random effect meta-analysis conducted. Altogether, six randomized control trials (RCTs) including 262 adults (exercise n = 132, 34.74 [9.6] years; control n = 130, 37.34 [10.0] years) were included. Exercise significantly decreased anxiety symptoms more than control conditions, with a moderate effect size (Standardized Mean Difference = −0.582, 95%CI −1.0 to −0.76, p = 0.02). Our data suggest that exercise is effective in improving anxiety symptoms in people with a current diagnosis of anxiety and/ or stress-related disorders. Taken together with the wider benefits of exercise on wellbeing and cardiovascular health, these findings reinforce exercise as an important treatment option in people with anxiety/stress disorders.

"Predictors and mediators of trait anger across the psychosis continuum: The role of attachment style, paranoia and social cognition","Anger in the context of psychosis has a significant impact on treatment outcomes and serious implications for risk management. Understanding mechanisms underlying anger will improve interventions and inform strategies for prevention. This study is the first to examine the relationships between anger and key theoretical drivers across different phases of the psychosis continuum. A battery including measures of theory of mind, attachment, hostile attribution bias, paranoia and anger was administered to 174 participants (14 ultra-high risk, 20 first-episode, 20 established psychosis, 120 non-clinical participants). We tested the model that insecure attachment, paranoia, impaired theory of mind and hostile attribution bias would predict trait anger using multiple regression. Attachment avoidance, paranoia and hostile attribution bias were significantly associated with anger but attachment anxiety and theory of mind were not. Mediation analysis showed that paranoia partially mediated the relationship between avoidant attachment and anger but hostile attribution bias did not. Findings emphasise the importance of interventions targeting paranoia to reduce anger and the potential of preventive strategies focused on attachment relationships in early life or adulthood to reduce adult paranoia and anger.

The association between sleep dysfunction and psychosis-like experiences among college students,"Sleep problems are prominent and pervasive clinical issues experienced by many people with psychotic disorders, often causing distress and functional impairment. Sleep problems are also related to psychosis-like experiences (PLE; non-diagnosable phenomenon such as transient perceptual disturbances, unusual thoughts, periodic suspiciousness) in epidemiological studies. Prior studies in this field have used brief measures that precluded the ability to test (1) whether risk for psychosis-like experiences are related to specific sub-types of sleep disturbance, and (2) whether sleep disturbance is specifically related to clinically significant (i.e., distressing) psychosis-like experiences. The current project examined the relation between specific sleep issues, and PLEs and distress associated with PLEs, in a college sample. Participants ( N = 420) completed the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief (PQ-B), which assesses PLEs and associated distress, and the Iowa Sleep Disturbances Inventory – extended version (ISDI-E), which assesses thirteen separate disturbed sleep domains. Symptoms of fragmented sleep, sleep hallucinations, and night anxiety significantly correlated with PLEs, and several sleep domains were significantly associated with PLE-related distress.

"Relatives' expressed emotion, distress and attributions in clinical high-risk and recent onset of psychosis","It has been well-demonstrated that Expressed Emotion (EE) in caregivers of schizophrenia patients is related to their illness attributions, but little is known about relatives' cognitive and emotional appraisals at early stages of psychosis. This study examined differences on the relationships of EE with distress and illness attributions in 78 relatives of At-Risk Mental States (ARMS) and First-Episode of Psychosis (FEP) patients, and which of those variables better predicted EE. Criticism and Emotional Over-Involvement (EOI) were associated with distress and with several illness attributions in both groups. Anxiety was more strongly associated with criticism in ARMS than in FEP-relatives, and it was associated with EOI in the ARMS but not in the FEP-group. No differences on the relationships of EE with depression or attributions were found. Furthermore, distress and attributions of blame toward the patients predicted criticism. Attributions of control by the patient and emotional negative representation about the disorder predicted EOI. Findings highlight the need to focus on early family interventions that provide proper information and psychological support in accordance with the illness stage, to help relatives improve their understanding of the disorder, handle difficult thoughts and emotions, reduce negative appraisals, and prevent high-EE over the psychotic process.

The effect of childhood adversity on 4-year outcome in individuals at ultra high risk for psychosis in the Dutch Early Detection Intervention Evaluation (EDIE-NL) Trial,"Childhood adversity is associated with a range of mental disorders, functional impairment and higher health care costs in adulthood. In this study we evaluated if childhood adversity was predictive of adverse clinical and functional outcomes and health care costs in a sample of patients at ultra-high risk (UHR) for developing a psychosis. Structural Equation Modeling was used to examine the effect of childhood adversity on depression, anxiety, transition to psychosis and overall functioning at 4-year follow-up. In addition, we evaluated economic costs of childhood adversity in terms of health care use and productivity loss. Data pertain to 105 UHR participants of the Dutch Early Detection and Intervention Evaluation (EDIE-NL). Physical abuse was associated with higher depression rates (b = 0.381, p = 0.012) and lower social functional outcome (b = −0.219, p = 0.017) at 4-year follow-up. In addition, emotional neglect was negatively associated with social functioning (b = −0.313, p = 0.018). We did not find evidence that childhood adversity was associated with transition to psychosis, but the experience of childhood adversity was associated with excess health care costs at follow-up. The data indicate long-term negative effects of childhood adversity on depression, social functioning and health care costs at follow-up in a sample of UHR patients.

The majority (81.8%) of participants endorsed experiencing at least one PTE within their lifetime and 39.0% reported at least one interpersonal trauma (i.e., physical assault, sexual assault, other unwanted or uncomfortable sexual situation). The average number of PTE categories endorsed was 1.71 (SD = 1.30), and 8.7% of participants reported experiencing four or more separate PTE categories pre-college entry. Female gender and peer deviance were consistently associated with PTE exposure and symptoms of psychopathology. Furthermore, a history of interpersonal PTE exposure was associated with increased alcohol use (i.e., frequency and quantity), trauma related distress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. The data demonstrate high prevalence PTE exposure among young adults and the clinical significance of a PTE history.

‘Not just right’ experiences and incompleteness in body dysmorphic disorder,"The current studies examined the role of ‘not just right’ experiences (NJREs) and incompleteness (INC) in body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). In Study 1, a clinical BDD sample endorsed more severe NJREs than healthy controls, when controlling co-occurring symptoms of depression and anxiety. In Study 2, INC predicted reactivity to an in vivo task designed to evoke BDD-related concerns in an unselected sample. Study 3 demonstrated a positive relationship between INC and BDD symptom severity in a community sample. Study 4 examined in vivo sensory NJRE tasks and INC in a sample high and low in BDD symptoms. The high symptom group reported greater INC and reactivity to a visual NJRE task than their low symptom counterparts, when controlling for co-occurring symptoms of depression, anxiety, and OC symptoms. No group differences were observed for tasks assessing auditory and tactile NJREs. These studies demonstrate a unique relationship between INC/NJREs and BDD.

Evaluating PROMIS(®) applied cognition items in a sample of older adults at risk for cognitive decline,"PROMIS( ® ) Applied Cognition is a short self-assessment of cognitive abilities and concerns that eliminates the need for a trained rater and provides online question banks that can be uniformly used across health care providers. This 12-month prospective study of 281 elderly individuals evaluates self-perceptions of cognitive functioning in relation to objective cognition, or assessment by an external rater, and compares PROMIS ® Applied Cognition Abilities and Concerns subsets with commonly used “legacy” instruments. PROMIS ® correlated with objective legacy measures (the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] and Saint Louis University Mental Status [SLUMS] examination), depression (measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS]), anxiety, and activities of daily living. PROMIS ® and MMSE correlations remained after controlling for depression and anxiety. PROMIS ® associated more strongly than MMSE with depression, highlighting the relationship between subjective cognitive deficit and depression. One-year changes in PROMIS® correlated with one-year changes in MMSE and GDS. The PROMIS ® Abilities subset more strongly correlated with objective cognition, whereas the Concerns subset more strongly correlated with depression and activities of daily living. PROMIS ® seems to be a reasonable prescreening tool to identify patients with cognitive decline or psychological distress.

Relationships of neutrophil–lymphocyte and platelet–lymphocyte ratios with the severity of major depression,"We aimed to evaluate the neutrophil–lymphocyte (NLR) and platelet–lymphocyte (PLR) ratios of inpatients and outpatients suffering from different levels of major depression. In total, 100 inpatients and 60 patients treated at an outpatient clinic were included the study. The presence of mood and anxiety disorders was identified with the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition/ Clinical Version, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was used to assess the severity of major depression (MD). Inpatients and outpatients with MD did not differ in NLR or PLR. The PLRs of patients who had severe major depression with psychotic features were higher than those of patients with other types of depression, but no differences in NLRs were detected across types of depression. The PLRs were higher in patients with severe levels of major depression with psychotic features than in other patients. This parameter may be more predictive than is NLR for assessing the prognosis of major depression.

Depression and anxiety mediate the relationship between temperament and character and psychotic-like experiences in healthy subjects,"In this study we examined the hypothesis that depression and anxiety may mediate the relationship between personality traits and both positive and negative psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) in healthy adults. The Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE) scale, Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were administered to 492 healthy individuals. Multiple stepwise regression and mediation analyses were performed to examine whether depressive and anxiety symptoms influence the relationship between the TCI dimensions and positive and negative PLEs. Self-transcendence, persistence, novelty-seeking and self-directedness significantly predicted positive PLEs; self-directedness and harm avoidance were predictable for negative PLEs. Self-transcendence, self-directedness, persistence and harm avoidance also predicted the distress caused by positive PLEs, whereas self-directedness and harm avoidance predicted distress raised by negative PLEs. Depressive symptoms and the state of anxiety partially mediated the linkage between self-directedness and positive PLEs, and between self-directedness, harm avoidance and negative PLEs. Our findings confirm that the personality pattern influences both positive and negative PLEs as well as distress caused by experiencing positive and negative PLEs, and they indicate that certain personality traits may influence the development of PLEs via the emotional pathway of heightened depression and anxiety.

Assessment of attachment in psychosis: A psychometric cause for concern,"Attachment has recently been proposed as a key developmental construct in psychosis, in particular with respect to interpersonal functioning and social cognition. The current study examined the latent structure of the self-report Psychosis Attachment Measure (PAM) and its relationship to lower-level perceptual and higher-order inferential social cognitive processes. The PAM was administered to 138 psychiatrically stable outpatients with schizophrenia alongside a battery of symptom, social cognitive, and functional measures. PAM responses were analyzed using latent variable measurement models, which did not yield evidence of the coherent two-dimensional structure predicted by previous literature. A unidimensional subscale comprising 6 of the 16 original PAM items possessed the strongest psychometric properties. This subscale was generally uncorrelated with social cognitive measures and showed weak correlations with some symptoms measures and with community functioning. These results suggest that either the PAM may not measure attachment in psychosis or it may measure only attachment anxiety but demonstrate little construct validity in this population. These results tell a cautionary tale regarding making theoretical inferences on the basis of measures without coherent latent structure. Attachment measures with stronger psychometric properties will help clarify putative relationships between attachment and social cognitive processes in psychosis.

Typology of schizotypy in non-clinical young adults: Psychopathological and personality disorder traits correlates,"Few typological studies address schizotypy in young adults. Schizotypal traits were assessed on 466 college students using the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief (SPQ-B). Other measures evaluated personality traits previously associated with schizotypy (borderline, obsessionnal, and autistic traits), psychopathological symptoms (suicidal ideations, depressive and obsessive-compulsive symptoms) and psychosocial functioning. A factor analysis was first performed on SPQ-B results, leading to four factors: negative schizotypy, positive schizotypy, social anxiety, and reference ideas. Based on these factors, a cluster analysis was conducted, which yielded four clearly distinct groups characterized by ""Low"" (non schizotypy), ""High schizotypy"" (mixed positive and negative), ""Positive schizotypy"", and ""Social impairment"". Regarding personality disorder traits and psychopathological symptoms, the ""High schizotypy"" cluster scored higher than the ""Positive"" and the ""Social impairment"" groups, which scored higher than the ""Low"" cluster. The ""Positive"" group had higher levels of interpersonal relationships than in the ""High"" and the ""Social impairment"" clusters, suggesting that positive schizotypy was associated to benefits such as perceived social relationships. Nevertheless the ""Positive"" cluster was also linked to high levels of personality disorder traits and psychopathological symptoms, and to low academic achievement, at levels similar those observed in the ""Social impairment"" cluster, confirming an unhealthy side to positive schizotypy.

Baseline data from a randomized controlled trial beginning in residential settings (N = 302) was used. Mood disorders were present in 33.6%, and anxiety disorders in 29.6%, with no differences among stimulant use disorder groups. Panic disorder was more frequently present with other stimulant use disorder. Those with two or more comorbid psychiatric disorders were more often female, White, had more symptoms of depression, greater propensity and risk for suicidal behavior, lower functioning in psychiatric and family domains, lower quality of life, more symptoms with stimulant abstinence and greater likelihood of marijuana dependence. Those with one or more comorbid disorders had more medical disorder burden, lower cognitive and physical functioning, greater pain, and higher rates of other drug dependence. With current comorbid psychiatric disorders, the morbidity of stimulant use disorders increases. Use of validated assessments near treatment entry, and a treatment plan targeting not only substance use and comorbid psychiatric disorders, but functional impairments, medical disorder burden and pain, may be useful.

A sample of people with psychosis completed a semi-structured interview about psychotic symptoms and self-report measures of metacognitive beliefs (MCQ-30), anxiety and depression. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses suggested that unhelpful metacognitive beliefs predict negative affect in people with psychosis over and above symptom frequency and other topological characteristics of symptoms captured by the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale (PSYRATS).

Maladaptive Five Factor Model personality traits associated with Borderline Personality Disorder indirectly affect susceptibility to suicide ideation through increased anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns,"The current study investigated the relationship between maladaptive Five-Factor Model (FFM) personality traits, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns, and suicide ideation in a sample of 131 undergraduate students who were selected based on their scores on a screening questionnaire regarding Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) symptoms. Those who endorsed elevated BPD symptoms in a pre-screen analyses completed at the beginning of each semester were oversampled in comparison to those with low or moderate symptoms. Indirect effect (mediation) results indicated that the maladaptive personality traits of anxious/uncertainty, dysregulated anger, self-disturbance, behavioral dysregulation, dissociative tendencies, distrust, manipulativeness, oppositional, and rashness had indirect effects on suicide ideation through anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns. All of these personality traits correlated to suicide ideation as well. The maladaptive personality traits of despondence, affective dysregulation, and fragility were positive correlates of suicide ideation and predicted suicide ideation when all traits were entered in one linear regression model, but were not indirectly related through anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns. The implication for targeting anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns in evidence-based practices for reducing suicide risk in those with BPD is discussed.

The TEPS contained two subscales rating anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia. From the BDI-II an anhedonia subscale was extracted rating anhedonia-state. Trait consummatory anhedonia and state anhedonia were associated with low levels of total cholesterol or HDL and low levels of triglycerides respectively. Trait anticipatory anhedonia and state anhedonia were associated with suicidal ideations. The difficulty of identifying feelings component of alexithymia was associated with low levels of total cholesterol and LDL. A high level of suicidal ideation was associated with low levels of HDL. Higher levels of CRP were found in inpatients having recently attempted suicide compared with inpatients who had not attempted suicide. In mood and anxiety disorders, anhedonia and the “difficulty of identifying feelings” component of alexithymia (which has previously been found to be associated with suicide risk) could explain the relationship between serum lipid levels and higher suicide risk.

"PTSD, social anxiety disorder, and trauma: An examination of the influence of trauma type on comorbidity using a nationally representative sample","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) are highly comorbid (Collimore et al., 2010). Trauma may present a shared environmental factor contributing to the development of comorbidity; however, existent research has been hampered by use of restrictive samples and limitations in the range of traumas investigated. The current study examines the relationship between a broad range of potentially traumatic events and the comorbidity between PTSD and SAD using Wave 2 of the National Epidemiological Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions ( n = 34,653). Multiple logistic regressions and cross-tabulations were used to evaluate differences in the prevalence of potentially traumatic events among those who met criteria for comorbid PTSD-SAD compared to those with PTSD without SAD and SAD without PTSD. Those in the comorbid PTSD-SAD group were significantly more likely than those in the PTSD without SAD or SAD without PTSD groups to report experiencing specific types of assaultive violence, childhood maltreatment , and other shocking events. Associations between comorbidity and childhood maltreatment were significant for females only. Individuals diagnosed with comorbid PTSD-SAD are more likely than those diagnosed with either disorder alone to report exposure to specific types of traumatic events within their lifetime.

Clinical features and psychiatric comorbidities of borderline personality disorder patients with versus without a history of suicide attempt,"Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are at high risk for suicidal behavior. However, many BPD patients do not engage in suicidal behavior. In this study, we compared clinical features of BPD patients with or without a history of suicide attempts and healthy volunteers. Compared with healthy volunteers, both BPD groups had higher Affective Lability Scale (ALS), ALS—Depression-Anxiety Subscale, Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS), and Lifetime History of Aggression (LHA) scores and were more likely to have a history of temper tantrums. BPD suicide attempters had higher ALS, ALS—Depression-Anxiety Subscale and LHA scores and were more likely to have a history of non-suicidal self-injury or temper tantrums compared to BPD non-attempters. Also, BPD suicide attempters were more likely to have a history of comorbid major depressive disorder and less likely to have comorbid narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) in comparison to BPD non-attempters. About 50% of study participants in each BPD group had a history of comorbid substance use disorder (SUD). Our study indicates that BPD patients with a history of suicide attempt are more aggressive, affectively dysregulated and less narcissistic than BPD suicide non-attempters.

Evidence of complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) across populations with prolonged trauma of varying interpersonal intensity and ages of exposure,"The ICD-11 proposes different types of prolonged trauma as risk factors for complex PTSD (CPTSD). However, CPTSD's construct validity has only been examined in childhood abuse, and single trauma exposure samples. Thus, the extent to which CPTSD applies to other repeatedly traumatized populations is unknown. This study examined ICD-11's PTSD and CPTSD across populations with prolonged trauma of varying interpersonal intensity and ages of exposure, including: 1) childhood sexual abuse, 2) adulthood trauma of severe interpersonal intensity (refugees and ex-prisoners of war), and 3) adulthood trauma of mild interpersonal intensity (military veterans, and mental health workers). In support of the proposal, latent class analysis ( N = 820) identified, a 4-class solution representing “PTSD”, “CPTSD”, and “non-pathological” classes, but also an “Anxiety symptoms” class, and an alternative 5-class solution, with a “Dissociative PTSD-subtype” class. ICD-11's CPTSD was not exclusively associated with childhood abuse, but also with exposure to adulthood trauma of severe interpersonal intensity. Furthermore, all types of prolonged trauma were equally associated with the “Anxiety symptoms” class. Finally, of all the classes, the “CPTSD“ class was associated with the highest frequency of work-related functional impairment, indicating an association between the severity of prolonged trauma exposure and the level of posttraumatic residues.

Psychiatric correlates of past year adult bullying behaviors: Findings from the National Epidemiology Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions,"Previous research on bully perpetration and psychiatric outcomes has been limited to examination of lifetime associations and has not included evaluation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), despite previously reported correlations between PTSD and anger and aggression. The purpose of the present study was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the association between bullying behaviour and mental disorders within a past-year framework. Data was obtained from Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; n = 34,653), a nationally-representative survey of American adults. Cross-tabulations and logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between bullying behaviour and psychiatric diagnosis. A total of 239 individuals (138 males, 101 females) reported engaging in bullying behaviour within the past-year. Mood, anxiety, substance use, and personality disorders were all more common among bully perpetrators compared to others. Of note, strong associations were found between PTSD and bully perpetration. Findings from the current study demonstrate strong associations between bullying perpetration and mental health concerns. The proximity of bullying behaviors and mental health concerns may be important, suggesting avenues for efforts at intervention and bullying prevention.

Negative correlation between CSF zinc level and anxiety in male Chinese subjects,"Zinc is crucial for brain development and psychiatric regulation. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) zinc level and anxiety in a group of male Chinese subjects. Results demonstrated that zinc levels had no considerable interindividual variations, ranging from 8.37 to 16.83 µm. Correlation analyses revealed that CSF Zinc levels were positively correlated with education years ( r = 0.225, p = 0.024) and negatively correlated with SAS scores ( r = −0.287, p = 0.004), but not associated with age or BMI. In conclusion, this present study suggests that CSF zinc level is associated with anxiety.

Affective correlates of trichotillomania across the pulling cycle: Findings from an Italian sample of self-identified hair pullers,"Etiological models of trichotillomania (TTM) conceptualize hair pulling as a dysfunctional emotion regulation strategy; accordingly, some research has found that affective states change differentially across the hair pulling cycle. We explored emotional changes in a sample of Italian individuals reporting TTM. Eighty-nine participants reporting TTM completed a 12-item section of the Italian Hair Pulling Questionnaire online and rated the extent to which they had experienced 12 affective states before, during, and after hair pulling. Overall, participants reported increased levels of shame, sadness, and frustration from pre- to post-pulling, and decreased levels of calmness after hair pulling episodes. Moreover, participants reported increased pleasure and relief across the pulling cycle, and variations in the direction of change for anger and anxiety depending on the hair pulling phase. Lastly, reported boredom decreased across the hair pulling cycle. These findings highlight the importance of considering emotional changes experienced across the pulling cycle in Italian hair pullers.

State anxiety as a moderator of real world grocery shopping performance among people with serious mental illness,"Anxiety is frequently overlooked as a factor when examining task performance among individuals with serious mental illness. Given the known effects of anxiety on performance in general populations, it is important to examine anxiety and performance within a serious mental illness population. This study examined state anxiety during a grocery-shopping task among 106 individuals diagnosed with a serious mental illness. Results indicate that state anxiety may impact task performance through its relationship with knowledge about grocery-shopping skills. These data suggest the need to examine further the impact of anxiety on task performance in serious mental illness. Furthermore, the identification and treatment of anxiety in persons with SMI may serve to improve functional outcomes and rehabilitation efforts.

Cross-national differences in hypochondriasis symptoms between Korean and American outpatients with major depressive disorder,"Hypochondriasis is defined as the tendency to worry excessively about having a serious illness. This study aimed to investigate cross-national differences in hypochondriasis symptoms between Korean and American patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study examined 1592 Korean and 3744 American MDD outpatients of age ≥18 years using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q-SF). Korean MDD patients exhibited significantly higher scores for hypochondriasis than Americans after controlling for total HAM-D scores and demographic variables ( p &lt; 0.0001), even though Americans had significantly higher total HAM-D scores ( p &lt; 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that hypochondriasis was significantly associated with somatic and psychic anxiety, insomnia-middle, and suicide for both Korean and American MDD patients after adjusting for demographic covariates. Among all factors, somatic anxiety was the most strongly associated with hypochondriasis in both Korean (AOR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.31–3.52) and American (AOR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.69–2.31) MDD outpatients. Hypochondriasis symptoms are more prevalent among Korean than American MDD patients but appear to be associated with high levels of somatic anxiety regardless of culture. This suggests that cultural and personal factors play a shared role in the presentation of hypochondriasis symptoms.

Psychotic experiences and incident suicidal ideation and behaviour: Disentangling the longitudinal associations from connected psychopathology,"This study examines the longitudinal associations between psychotic experiences (PE) and incident suicidal ideation and behaviour in the general population, and to what degree the association may be confounded by non-psychotic psychopathology. Data from three prospective, general population cohorts were combined into one dataset ( n = 15,837) and analysed using logistic regression, controlling for continuous measures of depression, anxiety and mania symptoms. Analyses were conducted in the entire sample, and in subsamples stratified by presence or absence of mental disorders. The presence of PE at baseline increased the risk of incident suicidal ideation and behaviour. However, adjustment for dimensional measures of psychopathology reduced effect sizes, although PE remained significantly associated with suicide attempts. Further examination of the associations revealed that PE were only associated with suicide attempts in individuals with at least one mental disorder. Similarly, in individuals without mental disorders, the risk of suicidal ideation increased as PE co-occurred with more symptom domains. The results of this study confirm that individuals with PE are at increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. However, these associations are not specific, but reflect the increased risk of suicidal ideation in individuals with subthreshold multidimensional psychopathology and suicide attempts in individuals with co-occurring mental disorders.

Mild neurological impairment may indicate a psychomotor endophenotype in patients with borderline personality disorder,"The aim of the present study was to determine whether patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) show any neurological soft signs compared to healthy controls. Furthermore we sought to examine the role of common symptoms related to BPD, such as depression, anxiety or impulsivity, in association with neurological soft signs. Thirty patients with borderline personality disorder and thirty hospital-based controls were examined for neurological soft signs. The total score of neurological soft signs in BPD was significantly higher than controls. In terms of subscales, patients had higher scores in Sensory Integration and Motor Coordination and other neurological soft signs compared to control group. Multiple regression analysis showed that the impulsivity score was the best significant predictor of neurological soft signs in BPD. The increase of neurological soft signs in patients with BPD may address a non-focal neurological dysfunction in borderline personality disorder.

Validation of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) in French psychiatric and general populations,"The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) has been validated in general population samples in many countries. Interest in using this measure in clinical populations is growing, particularly for tertiary prevention and mental health promotion. This paper reports validation of the French WEMWBS in healthy and chronic remitted schizophrenia populations. The French WEMWBS was administered to 319 workers, 75 students and 121 patients. For non-patients, self-reported Trait- and State-Anxiety, Mindfulness, Positive and Negative Affect and the General Health Questionnaire were completed. For patients, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale, Birchwood Insight Scale, Social Adjustment Scale, and Global Assessment of Functioning scale were completed. Test-retest reliability and responsiveness to intervention was assessed at 6 months. Whatever the sample, response frequencies showed normal distributions, and internal consistency was good (Cronbach's α). Scree plots of eigenvalues suggested a single factor in the samples. The one-dimensional solution yielded suboptimal fit indices. Construct validity was confirmed. Significant improvement in scores was observed before and after intervention. Test-retest variation was non-significant. Impairment of insight and cognition in the assessed patients implies that attention must be paid before applying WEMWBS to all patients. Nevertheless, WEMWBS proved valid and reliable in a further European population, suggesting transcultural validity for both monitoring and evaluation of interventions in healthy as well as chronic remitted schizophrenia populations.

Self-reported emotion regulation in adults with Tourette's syndrome,"Recent work has reported mild impairments in social and emotional processing in Tourette's syndrome (TS), but deliberate attempts to use specific emotion regulation strategies have not been investigated previously. In the present study, adult participants with TS and no comorbidities (TS-alone) were compared to healthy control participants on several self-report measures assessing habitual use of reappraisal and suppression emotion regulation strategies. There were no group differences on measures of reappraisal, but the TS-alone group reported using suppression more frequently than the control group and this was true across a range of negative emotions. The groups did not differ on symptomatology scores of anxiety or depression, although more frequent use of suppression was associated with higher depressive symptomatology for the TS-alone group only. Further work is needed to examine potential factors that may influence emotion regulation in TS, including increased emotional reactivity or expertise in applying strategies to suppress tic symptoms.

Language and hope in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders,"Hope is integral to recovery for those with schizophrenia. Considering recent advancements in the examination of clients’ lexical qualities, we were interested in how clients’ words reflect hope. Using computerized lexical analysis, we examined social, emotion, and future words’ relations to hope and its pathways and agency components. Forty-five clients provided detailed narratives about their life and mental illness. Transcripts were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program (LIWC), which assigns words to categories (e.g., “anxiety”) based on a pre-existing dictionary. Correlations and linear multiple regression were used to examine relationships between lexical qualities and hope. Hope and its subcomponents had significant or trending bivariate correlations in expected directions with several emotion-related word categories (anger and sadness) but were not associated with expected categories such as social words, positive emotions, optimism, achievement, and future words. In linear multiple regressions, no LIWC variable significantly predicted hope agency, but anger words significantly predicted both total hope and hope pathways. Our findings indicate lexical analysis tools can be used to investigate recovery-oriented concepts such as hope, and results may inform clinical practice. Future research should aim to replicate our findings in larger samples.

“Not Just Right Experiences” as a psychological endophenotype for obsessive-compulsive disorder: Evidence from an Italian family study,"The heart of the obsessional process may be considered the subject's underlying impression that “something is wrong” or “that something is not just as it should be”. This phenomenon, labeled “not just right experiences” (NJREs), has increasingly been receiving attention as a possible marker of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The present study sought to add to the evidence that NJREs may be a putative endophenotype of obsessional symptoms. To this aim, measures of NJREs, obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms and psychological distress were compared in offspring of parents with and without OC symptoms. The offspring of parents with OC symptoms (N = 120) reported higher frequency and severity of NJREs compared to offspring of parents without OC symptoms (N = 106). Such differences remained significant for NJREs frequency and close to significance for NJREs severity, when general distress (i.e., anxiety and depression) was controlled. The possible role of NJREs as an endophenotype for OCD is discussed in reference to Gottesman and Gould criteria and the National Institute of Mental Health RDoC initiative.

Predictors of parent-child agreement on child anxiety diagnoses on the ADIS-IV-C/P,"Diagnostic agreement between parents’ and children's reports on children's anxiety problems is notoriously poor; however, very few investigations have examined specific predictors of inter-rater agreement on child anxiety diagnoses. This study examined predictors of categories of parent and child diagnostic endorsement on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children–IV. One hundred eight children (ages 7–13) and their parents completed structured diagnostic interviews for non-OCD/PTSD anxiety diagnoses and paper and pencil measures of functioning and impairment in a variety of domains. Parent-child agreement was statistically significant for social phobia and separation anxiety disorder, but was overall poor for all anxiety diagnoses. Externalizing disorder status, family accommodation frequency, and child rated impairment in various domains differentially predicted informant discrepancies for different anxiety disorders. These data are among the first to suggest variables that may explain parent-child concordance.

"Burnout and depression: Label-related stigma, help-seeking, and syndrome overlap","We investigated whether burnout and depression differed in terms of public stigma and help-seeking attitudes and behaviors. Secondarily, we examined the overlap of burnout and depressive symptoms. A total of 1046 French schoolteachers responded to an Internet survey in November–December 2015. The survey included measures of public stigma, help-seeking attitudes and behaviors, burnout and depressive symptoms, self-rated health, neuroticism, extraversion, history of anxiety or depressive disorder, social desirability, and socio-demographic variables. The burnout label appeared to be less stigmatizing than the depression label. In either case, however, fewer than 1% of the participants exhibited stigma scores signaling agreement with the proposed stigmatizing statements. Help-seeking attitudes and behaviors did not differ between burnout and depression. Participants considered burnout and depression similarly worth-treating. A huge overlap was observed between the self-report, time-standardized measures of burnout and depressive symptoms (disattenuated correlation: .91). The overlap was further evidenced in a confirmatory factor analysis. Thus, while burnout and depression as syndromes are unlikely to be distinct, how burnout and depression are socially represented may differ. To our knowledge, this study is the first to compare burnout- and depression-related stigma and help-seeking in the French context. Cross-national, multi-occupational studies examining different facets of stigma are needed.

Risk factors for self-directed violence in US Soldiers: A case-control study,"Military suicide has escalated in recent years, however almost no research has used military surveillance data to examine suicide risk factors. The aims of the current study were to compare suicide risk factors among US Soldiers who died by suicide, attempted suicide, and controls using a prospective case-control design. Controls were 247 Soldiers completing standard post-deployment assessment procedures. Cases were 276 suicide decedents ( n = 85) or suicide attempters ( n = 191), drawn from the Department of Defense Suicide Event Report. Compared to controls, suicide attempters and decedents had greater odds of failed intimate relationships, legal problems, and substance abuse problems in the past 90 days. Suicide attempters and decedents also had greater odds of a history of a mood disorder and prior suicide attempt compared to controls. Suicide decedents had greater odds of exposure to legal problems in the past 90 days and lower odds of ever having an anxiety disorder, compared to suicide attempters. Vigilance toward early detection of modifiable suicide risk factors such as relationship dissolution, mood disorders, substance abuse, and legal problems may help reduce suicide risk among US Soldiers.

The link between death anxiety and post-traumatic symptomatology during terror: Direct links and possible moderators,"The current wave of terrorism which is taking place in Israel is characterized by increased arbitrary attacks by individual terrorists, acting independently, with reduced ability to anticipate when and where the next attack will take place. This situation creates an atmosphere of fear and insecurity in the lives of many citizens. Accordingly, the current study aims to establish a connection between death anxiety and PTSD symptom severity, as well as to examine whether major personality characteristics may moderate this connection. Using an online survey, 429 adult participants were recruited, and filled out death anxiety and PTSD symptomatology scales, as well as a short version of the Big Five personality scale. Findings revealed that death anxiety was a significant predictor of posttraumatic symptom severity, as were personality characteristics. Moreover, two personality traits, emotional stability and conscientiousness, moderated the association between death anxiety and PTSD symptomatology. The importance of death anxiety as a factor which is associated with PTSD symptomatology is discussed.

Gender differences in attitudes towards antipsychotic medications in patients with schizophrenia,"Non-adherence was more frequent in male than in female psychiatric patients. This multi-center study in China examined the gender difference with regard to attitude towards antipsychotic medications and its associations with socio-demographic variables, insight, and psychopathology. Patients’ basic socio-demographic and clinical data were collected. Psychopathology and insight were measured with the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and the Insight and Treatment Attitudes Questionnaire (ITAQ), respectively. Their attitudes towards antipsychotic medications were assessed by two standardized questions. Nearly 39.6% (109/275) males and 31.1% (70/225) females reported negative attitudes towards antipsychotic medications. Binary logistic regression revealed that in males single marital status (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.3–6.4), rural residence (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2–0.7), longer duration of schizophrenia (OR = 1.0, 95% CI = 1.0–1.1), knowledge of medication (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.3–1.6) and the SCL-90 hostility subscale (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.9–1.0) were contributors to negative attitudes. In female patients, knowledge about medications (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.3–1.6), the SCL-90 somatization (OR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.8–0.9) and anxiety (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.0–1.2) subscales were contributors to negative attitudes.

Social adversities and psychotic symptoms: A test of predictions derived from the social defeat hypothesis,"Based on the social defeat (SD) hypothesis, this study examines the postulate that various social adversities converge into one common factor, and whether this factor has an effect on psychotic symptoms while controlling for its effect on depression and anxiety. Competing hypotheses arguing for the reverse effect were also tested. The study was a cross-sectional survey in a community sample (N = 2350) from Germany ( n = 786), Indonesia ( n = 844), and the United States ( n = 720). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and path analysis with structural equation modeling were used to test the hypotheses. In the CFA two factors reflecting current and past experiences of SD could be identified with acceptable fit. Path analysis indicated acceptable fit for both SD and reverse models, and both the path from current SD to psychotic symptoms and the reverse one were significant, although the former was stronger than the latter. Interestingly, the current but not the past SD factor was significantly associated with psychotic symptoms. Overall, the results indicate that postulates derived from the SD hypothesis fit the data. However, longitudinal research is needed to further confirm the postulated directionality of the associations.

E-mail support as an adjunct to cognitive-behavioral group therapy for social anxiety disorder: Impact on dropout and outcome,"The present study evaluates the impact of semi-individualized e-mail support as an adjunct to cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) on dropout and outcome. The effectiveness of additional semi-individualized e-mail support was evaluated for the whole sample and for a subsample of patients at risk of dropping out of therapy. A total of 91 patients with SAD were allocated either to the intervention condition (CBGT with e-mail support), or to the control condition (CBGT without e-mail support). Anxiety symptoms, depression, global symptomatology and life satisfaction were assessed at pretreatment, post-treatment and follow-up (3, 6 and 12 months). From pre-treatment to post-treatment, both groups improved significantly on all symptom measures. Therapy gains were maintained at the 1-year follow-up. Subsample analyses showed that CBGT+e-mail was more effective than CGBT alone in reducing symptom severity among patients missing at least two therapy sessions. Additionally, in this subgroup, those receiving additional e-mail support showed a tendency towards lower dropout rates. Based on the results of this study, semi-individualized e-mail support between sessions seems to enhance the effectiveness of CBGT for SAD patients at risk of dropping out of treatment and should be considered as an additional tool in clinical practice.

Serum levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) in drug-naive patients with generalized anxiety disorder,"Sex hormones, particularly estrogen, are suggested to play a role in the physiopathology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Estrogen functions through the estrogen receptors alpha and beta and the recently discovered G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1). This study aimed, for the first time, to evaluate serum GPER1 levels in drug-naive patients with GAD. This study included 40 newly diagnosed drug-naive patients with GAD aged between 18 and 50 years and 40 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Medical histories were obtained, and physical examinations and laboratory tests were conducted; the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) was also used for all participants. Serum GPER1 levels were measured. The serum GPER1 level was significantly higher in the patients with GAD than in the controls. A positive significant correlation was observed between the GPER1 level and the HAM-A score. The receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 85.0%, 82.5%, 82.9%, and 84.6%, respectively, for the presence of anxiety when the serum GPER1 value was ≥ 0.14 (the area under the curve was 0.904.). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that GPER1 levels were associated with the anxiety levels of patients, and that the serum GPER1 level was a valuable predictor of the presence of anxiety independent of gender.

Relationship between anxiety and medical disorders among compulsory military service candidates between the years 1998–2013,"One of the most common psychiatric diagnoses among adolescents is anxiety disorder. Many of the anxiety symptoms are expressed physiologically, and therefore can mimic other medical conditions. The aim of this study was to examine the association between anxiety disorders and other medical conditions sharing common symptoms with anxiety (MDSCSA: Irritable Bowel Syndrome, asthma, migraine and hyperhidrosis). The study was based on the national database of the candidates for military service in Israel. Data for the years 1998–2013 was retrieved to create the study dataset. The final cohort population was comprised of 1,229,461 military service candidates. Anxiety prevalence and its association with other medical conditions sharing the same symptoms was examined in the cohort. The results showed significant statistical association between anxiety and IBS, asthma, migraine and hyperhidrosis. These findings support the fact that there is a clear association between anxiety disorder and the examined medical conditions. Moreover, in the military setting, the primary care physician has an important role in giving a correct diagnosis for soldiers presenting with symptoms that can be regarded both to anxiety and to other physical illnesses.

Shared versus distinct genetic contributions of mental wellbeing with depression and anxiety symptoms in healthy twins,"Mental wellbeing and mental illness symptoms are typically conceptualized as opposite ends of a continuum, despite only sharing about a quarter in common variance. We investigated the normative variation in measures of wellbeing and of depression and anxiety in 1486 twins who did not meet clinical criteria for an overt diagnosis. We quantified the shared versus distinct genetic and environmental variance between wellbeing and depression and anxiety symptoms. The majority of participants (93%) reported levels of depression and anxiety symptoms within the healthy range, yet only 23% reported a wellbeing score within the “flourishing” range: the remainder were within the ranges of “moderate” (67%) or “languishing” (10%). In twin models, measures of wellbeing and of depression and anxiety shared 50.09% of variance due to genetic factors and 18.27% due to environmental factors; the rest of the variance was due to unique variation impacting wellbeing or depression and anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest that an absence of clinically-significant symptoms of depression and anxiety does not necessarily indicate that an individual is flourishing. Both unique and shared genetic and environmental factors may determine why some individuals flourish in the absence of symptoms while others do not.

Social anxiety and perception of (un)trustworthiness in smiling faces,"In social environments the smile can be driven by different motives and convey different emotions. This makes a smiling face ambiguous and amenable to alternative interpretations. We investigated how social anxiety is related to trustworthiness evaluation of morphed dynamic smiling faces depending on changes in the eye expression. Socially anxious and non-anxious participants judged the un/trustworthiness of people with different smiles. Social anxiety was related to reduced trustworthiness of (a) faces with a neutral mouth unfolding to a smile when the eyes were neutral at the beginning or end of the dynamic sequence, and (b) faces with a smiling mouth when happy eyes slightly changed towards neutrality, surprise, fear, sadness, disgust, or anger. In contrast, social anxiety was not related to trustworthiness judgments for non-ambiguous expressions unfolding from neutral (eyes and mouth) to happy (eyes and mouth) or from happy to neutral. Socially anxious individuals are characterized by an interpretation bias towards mistrusting any ambiguous smile due to the presence of non-happy eyes.

"When somatization is not the only thing you suffer from: Examining comorbid syndromes using latent profile analysis, parenting practices and adolescent functioning","Understanding somatization presents a challenge to clinicians because it is often associated with other syndromes. We addressed somatization’s comorbidity with other internalizing syndromes (anxiety, depression, withdrawal) using latent profile analysis. A representative sample of 3496 Israeli middle and high-school youths reported their internalizing symptoms, perceived parenting practices, psychosocial functioning, and health behaviors. Four profiles, similar across age and gender, were identified: overall-low (65.4%), moderately-high anxiety/depression/withdrawal (24.4%), high somatization (4.8%), and overall-high (5.4%). MANOVAs and follow-up ANOVAs revealed that for the most part the overall-high profile evinced the worst parenting, psychosocial functioning, and health behaviors (smoking and drinking), while the overall-low group evinced the best. For most variables the high somatization and moderately high profiles displayed midway results. However, the moderately-high profile reported higher levels of harsh parenting than the high somatization profile. The high somatization profile reported similar or higher levels of smoking, risk taking, vandalism, and rule violation than the overall-high group. High somatization, either alone or alongside anxiety, depression, and withdrawal, was associated with disruptive and risk-taking behaviors. This link might reflect problems in emotion and anger regulation and become stronger in adolescence because of dysregulation processes characterizing this period. Implications for practice are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2016
Effects of state and trait anxiety on sleep structure: A polysomnographic study in 1083 subjects,"Anxiety affects millions of people and has been shown to co-occur in combination with sleep disturbances, generating heavy medical costs and a huge socio-medico-economic burden. Sleep-studies in anxiety disorders are inconsistent and the effects of state and trait anxiety are unexplored. We selected 1083 patients from the database of a hospital sleep laboratory. The patients had polysomnography for different sleep disorders; their sleep initiation (sleep onset latency), sleep maintenance (total sleep time), non-rapid eye movement sleep-, and rapid eye movement sleep parameters; as well as their State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck depression scale were measured. In order to be included in our study, individuals needed to score in the low or high range on the State and/or Trait Subscales of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. We found that both state and trait anxiety affected non-rapid eye movement sleep parameters. Sleep onset latency changes predominantly associated to state anxiety while rapid eye movement parameters related to trait anxiety.

Examining the role of self-discrepancy and self-directed style in bulimia nervosa,"Two of the primary components within Integrative Cognitive Affective Therapy (ICAT) are self-discrepancy and self-directed style. Self-discrepancy includes both actual:ideal (discrepancy between oneself and who one wishes they were) and actual:ought (discrepancy between oneself and who one believes they ought to be). Self-directed style in ICAT refers to a variety of behaviors emitted by a person toward the self including self-blaming and self-affirming. This study explored main effects and interactions between self-discrepancy and self-directed style in relation to global eating disorder (ED) psychopathology, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Eighty treatment-seeking adults from the Midwest with BN or subthreshold BN completed interviews and self-report measures. Self-affirm and self-blame were associated with ED psychopathology, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Actual:ideal discrepancy was related to anxiety and actual:ought discrepancy was related to anxiety and depressive symptoms. Interactions were found between self-affirm and actual:ought discrepancy as well as self-blame and actual:ought discrepancy for depressive symptoms. High actual:ought was related to increased depressive symptoms regardless of levels of self-affirm or self-blame. Effect sizes for models were medium-to-large with anxiety models demonstrating the largest effects. This study provides further evidence supporting the ICAT model and treatment, which targets self-discrepancies, self-directed styles, and related emotional states.

"Prevalence, correlates, psychiatric comorbidities, and suicidality in a community population with problematic Internet use","We examined the prevalence, correlates, and psychiatric comorbidities of community-dwelling subjects with problematic Internet use (PIU). In an epidemiological survey of mental disorders among Korean adults conducted in 2006, 6510 subjects (aged 18–64 years) completed the Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV psychiatric disorders; Diagnostic Interview Schedule exploring pathological gambling; Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-Version 1.1 Screener; questionnaire for sleep disturbances; and questionnaire for suicidal ideations, plans, and attempts. Young's Internet Addiction Test was administered to 3212 individuals who had used the Internet within one month before the interviews in order to identify problematic Internet users (cutoff &gt; 39). The prevalence of PIU was 9.3% in the general population of South Korea. Being male, younger, never married, or unemployed were all associated with increased risks of PIU. Significant positive associations were observed between PIU and nicotine use disorders, alcohol use disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, pathological gambling, adult type ADHD symptoms, sleep disturbances, suicide ideas and suicide plans compare to subjects without PIU, after controlling for socio-demographic variables. These findings suggest that careful evaluation and management of such psychiatric disorders is needed for individuals with PIU.

Interpersonal hostility and suspicious thinking in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may struggle with hostility and suspicious thinking, but this has not been the subject of much research. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between hostility, suspicious thinking, and OCD severity. Participants included 66 outpatients in treatment for OCD, 27 in treatment for other disorders, and 68 students (n = 161). All completed the Inventory of Hostility and Suspicious Thinking (IHS), a measure of psychotic thinking/paranoia, the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). As expected, the IHS was significantly positively correlated with the BAI and BDI-II. Additionally, regression analyses revealed that individuals with OCD have higher levels of hostility than students. Hostility was also significantly positively associated with increased OCD severity. Hostility and suspicious thoughts are prominent in anxiety disorders in general, and thus necessitate continued research.

"The relative contributions of psychiatric symptoms and psychotropic medications on the sleep-wake profile of young persons with anxiety, depression and bipolar disorders","This study investigated the relative contribution of psychiatric symptoms and psychotropic medications on the sleep-wake cycle. Actigraphy and clinical assessments (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) were conducted in 146 youths with anxiety, depression or bipolar disorders. Independently of medications, mania symptoms were predictive of lower circadian amplitude and rhythmicity. Independently of diagnosis and symptoms severity: i) antipsychotics were related to longer sleep period and duration, ii) serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors to longer sleep period, and iii) agomelatine to earlier sleep onset. Manic symptoms and different subclasses of medications may have independent influences on the sleep-wake cycle of young people with mental disorders.

Interactive effect of negative affectivity and anxiety sensitivity in terms of mental health among Latinos in primary care,"From a public health perspective, primary care medical settings represent a strategic location to address mental health disapirty among Latinos. Yet, there is little empirical work that addresses affective vulnerability processes for mental health problems in such settings. To help address this gap in knowledge, the present investigation examined an interactive model of negative affectivity (tendency to experience negative mood states) and anxiety sensitivity (fear of the negative consequences of aversive sensations) among a Latino sample in primary care in terms of a relatively wide range of anxiety/depression indices. Participants included 390 Latino adults ( M age = 38.7, SD = 11.3; 86.9% female; 95.6% reported Spanish as first language) from a primary care health clinic. Primary dependent measures included depressive, suicidal, social anxiety, and anxious arousal symptoms, number of mood and anxiety disorders, and disability. Consistent with prediction, the interaction between negative affectivity and anxiety sensitivity was significantly related to suicidal, social anxiety, and anxious arousal symptoms, as well as number of mood/anxiety diagnoses and disability among the primary care Latino sample. The form of the interactions indicated a synergistic effect, such that the greatest levels of each outcome were found among those with high negative affectivity and high anxiety sensitivity. There was a trending interaction for depressive symptoms. Overall, these data provide novel empirical evidence suggesting that there is a clinically-relevant interplay between anxiety sensitivity and negative affectivity in regard to the expression of anxiety and depressive symptoms among a Latino primary care sample.

Reduced power spectra of heart rate variability are correlated with anxiety in patients with mild traumatic brain injury,"Anxiety is one of the most frequently diagnosed emotional disorders after a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI); however, predictors of anxiety after an mTBI remain uncertain. Recent research indicated that anxiety is associated with abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) which can be evaluated by a power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). In this study, we investigated whether a frequency-domain analysis of HRV could correlate with the occurrence of anxiety in mTBI patients. We recruited 165 Taiwanese patients diagnosed with an mTBI and 82 volunteer healthy controls from three affiliated hospitals of Taipei Medical University during 2010–2014. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was assessed at the 1st, 6th, and 12th weeks. We found that mTBI patients were more vulnerable to anxiety compared to healthy controls. The power spectral density of HRV was significantly lower in mTBI patients than in healthy controls. A correlation analysis indicated that anxiety was negatively significantly correlated with low- and high-frequency power at the 6th week. Our study suggests the clinical usefulness of HRV as a potential noninvasive tool for evaluating later anxiety in mTBI patients.

Longitudinal association between different levels of alcohol consumption and a new onset of depression and generalized anxiety disorder: Results from an international study in primary care,"Background: Several studies that have examined the full range of alcohol consumption have pointed to a possible non-linear association between alcohol use and the common mental disorders. Most of these studies are cross sectional and assessed psychiatric morbidity using non-specific instruments. Our aim was to investigate the longitudinal association between varying levels of alcohol consumption at baseline and the new-onset of depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), in a large international primary care sample. Methods: The sample consisted of 3201 primary care attenders from 14 countries in the context of WHO Collaborative Study of Psychological Problems in General Health Care. Alcohol use at baseline was assessed using AUDIT and the mental disorders were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: Light to moderate alcohol consumption at baseline was associated with a lower incidence of depression and GAD compared to abstinence while excessive alcohol consumption was associated with a higher incidence of depression but not GAD. This non-linear association was not substantially affected after adjustment for a range of possible confounding variables. Conclusion: Any causal interpretation of this association is difficult in the context of an observational study and further combined and consistent evidence from different sources is needed.

Development and community-based validation of eight item banks to assess mental health,"There is a need for precise but brief screening of mental health problems in a range of settings. The development of item banks to assess depression and anxiety has resulted in new adaptive and static screeners that accurately assess severity of symptoms. However, expansion to a wider array of mental health problems is required. The current study developed item banks for eight mental health problems: social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, drug use, psychosis and suicidality. The item banks were calibrated in a population-based Australian adult sample (N = 3175) by administering large item pools (45–75 items) and excluding items on the basis of local dependence or measurement non-invariance. Item Response Theory parameters were estimated for each item bank using a two-parameter graded response model. Each bank consisted of 19–47 items, demonstrating excellent fit and precision across a range of −1 to 3 standard deviations from the mean. No previous study has developed such a broad range of mental health item banks. The calibrated item banks will form the basis of a new system of static and adaptive measures to screen for a broad array of mental health problems in the community.

Psychiatric comorbidities in opioid-dependent patients undergoing a replacement therapy programme in Spain: The PROTEUS study,"Opioid-dependent patients show a high rate of psychiatric comorbidities. The prevalence and characteristics of patients with dual diagnosis have not been well established in Spanish opioid agonist treatment (OAT) programmes. Thus, 621 opioid-dependent patients enrolled in OAT programmes were assessed, using the EuropASI questionnaire, for psychiatric comorbidities, which were detected in 67% of patients (anxiety 53%, mood disorders 48%, sleep disorders 41%, substance-related disorders 36%). In addition, compared with patients without a dual diagnosis, patients with dual pathology were significantly older, used benzodiazepines and cannabis in significantly greater percentages, and showed significantly more frequent infectious and non-infectious comorbidities, worse overall working status, a lower proportion of drivers and higher levels of severity regarding medical, employment, alcohol, legal, family and psychological issues. Therefore, the data showed a very high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in opioid-dependent patients receiving OAT in Spain and several problems frequently associated with patients with dual diagnosis. Physicians treating opioid-dependent patients should be aware of these facts to correctly identify and manage patients with a dual diagnosis.

Psychosocial functioning in adolescent patients assessed with Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) predicts negative outcomes from age 18: A cohort study,"Presents a study which aims to investigate whether psychosocial functioning assessed with Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) before and after psychiatric treatment of adolescents predicts criminal convictions, psychiatric morbidity, suicide attempts, substance misuse, and accidents in early adulthood. In total, 4876 patients (mean age in years (SD)¼16.5 (0.9), and proportion of boys¼36%) with valid end-of-treatment CGAS data were included in this prospective follow-up study. The main finding was that patients with end-of-treatment CGAS scores up to 60 were at significantly increased risk for all adversities during the follow-up period into early adulthood (criminality, suicide attempt, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, eating disorder, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and substance misuse) except accidents. Thus, assessing psychosocial functioning with CGAS does not merely reflect the clinical variables but add specific prognostic information of importance for clinical decision-making. The results of this study suggest that psychosocial functioning, as measured with CGAS, at end-of-treatment provide clinically relevant and specific prognostic information beyond diagnostic categories that could be included in an overall prognostic assessment.

The violent content in attenuated psychotic symptoms,"The relationship between psychosis and violence has typically focused on factors likely to predict who will commit violent acts. One unexplored area is violence in the content of subthreshold positive symptoms. The current aim was to conduct an exploratory analysis of violent content in the attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS) of those at clinical high risk of psychosis (CHR) who met criteria for attenuated psychotic symptom syndrome (APSS). The APS of 442 CHR individuals, determined by the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes, were described in comprehensive vignettes. The content of these symptoms were coded using the Content of Attenuated Positive Symptoms Codebook. Other measures included clinical symptoms, functioning, beliefs and trauma. Individuals with violent content had significantly higher APS, greater negative beliefs about the self and others, and increased bullying. The same findings and higher ratings on anxiety symptoms were present when participants with self-directed violence were compared to participants with no violent content. Individuals reporting violent content differ in their clinical presentation compared to those who do not experience violent content. Adverse life events, like bullying, may impact the presence of violent content in APS symptoms. Future studies should explore violent content in relation to actual behavior.

Effects of perceived affectionless control parenting on working models of the self and other,"Attachment theory contends that insecure working models of the self and other built through negative attachment experiences are predisposing factors for depression and anxiety disorders. Meanwhile, patients with these psychiatric disorders tend to perceive that they received the affectionless control parenting, which is a combination of lack of care and overprotection. To test the hypothesis that the affectionless control parenting impairs the formation of positive working models, we examined the effects of perceived parenting styles on qualities of working models. The subjects were 691 healthy Japanese volunteers. Working models of the self and other were assessed by the Relationship Scales Questionnaire. Perceived parental rearing was evaluated by the Parental Bonding Instrument, which has the care and protection subscales. Parental rearing was classified into one of the four types defined by combinations of levels of care and protection. In all combinations of recipient sexes and parental sexes, the subjects with the affectionless control parenting (low care/high protection) had lower scores of the self-model and other-model than those with the optimal parenting (high care/low protection). The present study suggests that the affectionless control parenting impairs the formation of positive working models of the self and other.

Insomnia and hallucinations in the general population: Findings from the 2000 and 2007 British Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys,"Insomnia is common in people experiencing psychosis. It has been identified as a contributory cause of paranoia, but any causal relationship with hallucinations has yet to be established. We tested the hypotheses that insomnia i) has a cross-sectional association with hallucinations ii) predicts new inceptions of hallucinations and iii) that these associations remain after controlling for depression, anxiety, and paranoia. Data from the second (2000, N = 8580) and third (2007, N = 7403) British Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys were used to assess cross-sectional associations between insomnia and hallucinations. The 2000 dataset included an 18 month follow up of a subsample (N = 2406) used to test whether insomnia predicted new inceptions of hallucinations. Insomnia was associated with hallucinations in both cross-sectional datasets. Mild sleep problems were associated with 2–3 times greater odds of reporting hallucinations, whilst chronic insomnia was associated with four times greater odds. Insomnia was also associated with increased odds of hallucinations occurring de novo over the next 18 months. These associations remained significant, although with smaller odds ratios, after controlling for depression, anxiety and paranoia. This is the first longitudinal evidence that insomnia is associated with the development of hallucinatory experiences. Effective treatment of insomnia may lessen the occurrence of hallucinations.

The predictive value of early treatment response in antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode psychosis: Haloperidol versus olanzapine,"Early antipsychotic response predicts outcomes for psychotic patients, but recent evidence suggests that this may not be true for patients treated with olanzapine. In this study, we assessed the predictive value of early response to olanzapine or haloperidol in 75 antipsychotic-naive, first-episode psychosis inpatients. Patients were assessed weekly using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Regression analyses were used to determine whether improvement at week 2 or week 3 predicted improvement at hospital discharge. The majority of patients in both groups experienced a decrease in symptom severity of ≥ 50% at week 2. In the haloperidol group, week 2 improvement predicted improvement at discharge for all measures except the HAM-A. In the olanzapine group, week 2 improvement only predicted improvement at discharge for HAM-D scores. However, week 3 improvement in the olanzapine group predicted improvement at discharge for all measures except the HAM-A. Olanzapine non-responders at week 3 (but not week 2) benefited from having olanzapine switched to another antipsychotic. These results suggest that a 2 week trial of haloperidol is sufficient to predict treatment outcomes, while a 3 week trial is required for olanzapine.

Borderline personality features in depressed or anxious patients,"Anxiety and depression frequently co-occur with borderline personality disorder. Relatively little research examined the presence of borderline personality features and its main domains (affective instability, identity problems, negative relationships and self-harm) in individuals with remitted and current anxiety and depression. Participants with current ( n = 597) or remitted ( n = 1115) anxiety and/or depression and healthy controls ( n = 431) were selected from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Assessments included the Personality Assessment Inventory – Borderline Features Scale and several clinical characteristics of anxiety and depression. Borderline personality features were more common in depression than in anxiety. Current comorbid anxiety and depression was associated with most borderline personality features. Anxiety and depression status explained 29.7% of the variance in borderline personality features and 3.8% (self-harm) to 31% (identity problems) of the variance in the four domains. A large part of the variance was shared between anxiety and depression but both disorders also explained a significant amount of unique variance. The severity of anxiety and depression and the level of daily dysfunctioning was positively associated with borderline personality features. Individuals with a longer duration of anxiety and depression showed more affective instability and identity problems. These findings suggest that patients with anxiety and depression may benefit from an assessment of personality pathology as it may have implications for psychological and pharmacological treatment.

Angry-happy interpretations of ambiguous faces in social anxiety disorder,"Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is characterized by a tendency to interpret ambiguous social cues as negative. Here we tested whether interpretation of ambiguous faces differs between participants with SAD and non-anxious controls. Twenty-seven individuals with SAD and 21 non-anxious control participants completed an emotion recognition task in which they judged ambiguous morphed faces as happy or angry. Participants with SAD judged a higher proportion of the faces as angry compared to non-anxious participants, and were slower to judge faces as angry compared to happy, while no such reaction time bias manifested in the control group. Finally, happy judgments were slower in the SAD group compared to the control group, while angry judgments were faster in the SAD group compared to the control group.

"Depression and anxiety among patients with somatoform disorders, panic disorder, and other depressive/anxiety disorders in Taiwan","The aim of this study is to compare the severity of depression and anxiety in individuals with somatoform disorders, panic disorder, other depressive/anxiety disorders, and healthy controls in a Han Chinese population. According to the DSM-IV-TR-based diagnostic interviews, we recruited 152 subjects with somatoform disorders (SG), 56 with panic disorder (PG), 85 with other depressive/anxiety disorders (OG), and 179 without any psychiatric disorder (NG). The four groups reported on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) for depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Correlation analysis and multivariate regression analysis were used to determine the effects of demographic factors and psychiatric diagnoses on depressive and anxiety symptoms separately. BDI-II scores were not significantly different in SG, PG, and OG but were higher than NG. SG and PG had the highest BAI scores, whereas NG had the lowest. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that the associated factors for BDI-II were gender, residential location, somatoform disorders, panic disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder, whereas BAI was significantly associated with somatoform disorders, panic disorder, and MDD.

Patients' pre-treatment interpersonal problems as predictors of therapeutic alliance in long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy,"Information on how the patient's interpersonal problems predict alliance development during long-term therapy is lacking. The aim of this study was to explore how the patient's pre-treatment interpersonal problems predict the development of alliance in long-term psychotherapy. Altogether 128 adult outpatients experiencing mood or anxiety disorder were assigned to long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy in the Helsinki Psychotherapy Study. The Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP) total score and the eight octant scores, assessed at baseline, were used as predictors. The trajectories of change in patient- and therapist-rated Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) were used as outcome measures at 7, 12, and 36 months of follow-up after baseline. Study of the changes by time showed that the patient-rated alliance was significantly improved by the 36-month follow-up, i.e. the most usual end-point of therapy, in persons with higher pre-treatment level of the IIP total score. Low total IIP score and low to moderate level of hostile type problems showed no slope of improvement of patient-rated alliance during follow-up. The therapist-rated alliance showed a similar course as the patient-rated alliance with the exception of a faster improvement for higher IIP scores. In conclusion, a higher level of patients' interpersonal problems predicted favorable alliance development.

Posttraumatic stress symptoms and body mass index among World Trade Center disaster-exposed smokers: A preliminary examination of the role of anxiety sensitivity,"Among individuals exposed to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster on September 11, 2001, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and symptoms are both common and associated with increased cigarette smoking and body mass. However, there is little information on the specific processes underlying the relationship of PTSD symptoms with body mass. The current study is an initial exploratory test of anxiety sensitivity, the fear of internal bodily sensations, as a possible mechanism linking PTSD symptom severity and body mass index (BMI). Participants were 147 adult daily smokers (34.0% female) exposed to the WTC disaster (via rescue/recovery work or direct witness). The direct and indirect associations between PTSD symptom severity and BMI via anxiety sensitivity (total score and subscales of physical, cognitive, and social concerns) were examined. PTSD symptom severity was related to BMI indirectly via anxiety sensitivity; this effect was specific to physical concerns about the meaning of bodily sensations. Interventions focusing on anxiety sensitivity reduction (specifically addressing physical concerns about bodily sensations) may be useful in addressing elevated BMI among trauma-exposed persons.

The risk and protective factors in the development of childhood social anxiety symptoms among Chinese children,"The aim of this study was to explore the change and associated risk and protective factors of social anxiety symptoms among Chinese children. A 2-year longitudinal study was performed in a general primary and secondary school population in Anhui Province, China including 816 children in grades 3, 4, and 7. Children's social anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Social Anxiety Scales for Children (SASC) at three assessments. The overall prevalence of children's elevated social anxiety symptoms ranged from 15.2% to 16.4% across three assessments. Children's overall mean SASC scores were 5.6 (SD = 3.7), 5.3 (SD = 3.8), and 5.3 (SD = 4.1) at three assessments, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant. However, children's social anxiety symptom levels and change among different subgroups was not stable across 2-year follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that age, severe family dysfunction, quality of life, positive coping, negative coping, depressive symptoms and self-esteem were predictive factors for childhood elevated social anxiety symptoms.

Socio-demographic and clinical predictors of non-response/non-remission in treatment resistant depressed patients: A systematic review,"Up to one third of patients adequately treated for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) do not respond to multiple interventions. Many studies investigated predictors in MDD outcome, but no study focused on predictors of non-response or non-remission to antidepressants in subjects with treatment resistant depression (TRD). The present study aimed to evaluate possible socio-demographic and clinical predictors of non-response and non-remission in MDD patients who failed to benefit from at least one antidepressant trial. A total of 51 papers were included. A number of severity indicators, such as longer duration of depressive episode, moderate-high suicidal risk, anxious comorbidity, higher number of hospitalizations and higher dosage of antidepressants, were associated with non-response as well as age. Interestingly, severity of illness, as well as comorbid personality disorders and anxiety symptoms, had also a predictive value in non-remission with the addition of marital status. Considering limitations, selected studies were observational or randomized non controlled/controlled trials and different TRD definitions and outcome measures were used. Overall, predictors of outcome were similar to MDD, but specific socio-demographic and clinical factors should be considered in clinical practice to formulate a more focused treatment in TRD patients.

Combined therapy with interpersonal psychotherapy adapted for borderline personality disorder: A two-years follow-up,"Few investigations evaluated the long-term effects of psychotherapies in borderline personality disorder (BPD). In a previous study, we compared efficacy of combination of fluoxetine and interpersonal psychotherapy adapted to BPD (IPT-BPD) versus single fluoxetine administered for 32 weeks. This study is aimed to investigate whether the results obtained with the addition of IPT-BPD persist during a follow-up period. Forty-four patients who completed the 32 weeks trial underwent 24 months of follow-up receiving fluoxetine 20-40 mg/day. Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S), Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression and Anxiety (HDRS, HARS), Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), Satisfaction Profile (SAT-P), and Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI) were repeated at 6, 12, and 24 months. Statistical analysis was performed with the general linear model. Results showed that most of the differences between combined therapy and single pharmacotherapy at the end of the 32 weeks trial were maintained after 24 months follow-up. The addition of IPT-BPD to medication produced greater effects on BPD symptoms (impulsivity and interpersonal relationships) and quality of life (perception of psychological and social functioning) that endured after termination of psychotherapy. On the contrary, different effects on anxiety symptoms and affective instability were lost after 6 months.

An examination of generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymia utilizing the Rorschach inkblot method,"This study examined transdiagnostic features of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and dysthymia in an outpatient clinical sample. Fifteen patients who met DSM-IV criteria for GAD and twenty-one patients who met DSM-IV criteria for dysthymia but who did not have comorbid anxiety disorder were evaluated utilizing the Rorschach. Salient clinical variables were then compared. Results showed that patients with GAD scored significantly higher on variables related to cognitive agitation and a desire/need for external soothing. In addition, there was a trend for patients with GAD to produce higher scores on a measure of ruminative focus on negative aspects of the self. Thus, not surprisingly, GAD patients’ experienced more distress than the dysthymic patients. The implications of these findings are discussed with regards to better understanding the shared and distinct features of GAD and dysthymia.

Factors associated with suicidal risk among a French cohort of problem gamblers seeking treatment,"Compared to general population, pathological gamblers are 3.4 times more likely to attempt suicide. Our objective was to identify specific profiles of problem gamblers (PGs) with suicidal risk according to sociodemographic, clinical and gambling characteristics. The PGs cohort, called “EVALJEU”, consists in the inclusion of any new PG seeking treatment in our Department. Patients underwent a semi-structured clinical interview and completed self-report questionnaires. The “suicidal risk module” of the Mini International Psychiatric interview (MINI) allowed to constitute two groups of patients that were compared, according to the presence of a suicidal risk. A logistic regression was performed to identify factors related to suicidal risk in PGs. In our sample (N = 194), 40.21% presented a suicidal risk. A history of major depression and anxiety disorders were predictors of suicidal risk as well as the perceived inability to stop gambling. Suicidality is a significant clinical concern in PGs. Therefore, three specific predictors, identified by our study, must be assessed.

Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of depersonalization disorder: A consecutive case series,"Case reports and an open trial have reported promising responses to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to prefrontal and temporo-parietal sites in patients with depersonalization disorder (DPD). We recently showed that a single session of rTMS to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) was associated with a reduction in symptoms and increase in physiological arousal. Seven patients with medication-resistant DSM-IV DPD received up to 20 sessions of right-sided rTMS to the VLPFC for 10 weeks. Stimulation was guided using neuronavigation software based on participants’ individual structural MRIs, and delivered at 110% of resting motor threshold. A session consisted of 1Hz repetitive TMS for 15min. The primary outcome measure was reduction in depersonalization symptoms on the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS). Secondary outcomes included scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). 20 sessions of rTMS treatment to right VLPFC significantly reduced scores on the CDS by on average 44% (range 2–83.5%). Two patients could be classified as “full responders”, four as “partial” and one a non-responder. Response usually occurred within the first 6 sessions. There were no significant adverse events. A randomized controlled clinical trial of VLPFC rTMS for DPD is warranted.

Dysmorphic concern is related to delusional proneness and negative affect in a community sample,"Body image concerns are common in the general population and in some mental illnesses reach pathological levels. We investigated whether dysmorphic concern with appearance (a preoccupation with minor or imagined defects in appearance) is explained by psychotic processes in a community sample. In a cross-sectional design, two hundred and twenty six participants completed an online survey battery including: The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire; the Peters Delusional inventory; the Aberrant Salience Inventory; and the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale. Participants were native English speakers residing in Australia. Dysmorphic concern was positively correlated with delusional proneness, aberrant salience and negative emotion. Regression established that negative emotion and delusional proneness predicted dysmorphic concern, whereas, aberrant salience did not. Although delusional proneness was related to body dysmorphia, there was no evidence that it was related to aberrant salience. Understanding the contribution of other psychosis processes, and other health related variables to the severity of dysmorphic concern will be a focus of future research.

Normal interoceptive accuracy in women with bulimia nervosa,"Previous studies suggest that patients suffering from bulimia nervosa (BN) have difficulties in perceiving internal bodily signals, mostly assessed by self-report questionnaires. Whether interoception is, in this case, attenuated or not remains an open question. Therefore, interoceptive processes were examined in twenty-three patients with current BN and were compared to healthy participants. We investigated Interoceptive Accuracy (IAc) assessed by the heartbeat detection task and Interoceptive Awareness (IA) assessed by the Eating Disorder Inventory-2. Patients with BN and healthy participants did not differ in terms of IAc when controlling for BMI, depression and anxiety, whereas IA among BN patients was found to have decreased. Although IAc and IA were not related among controls, we observed an inverse correlation in BN, suggesting that an abnormal overlap between these two levels of interoceptive signal processing is present in BN. The current study introduces a new perspective concerning the role of interoceptive processes in BN and generates further questions regarding the therapeutic utility of methods targeting the interaction between different levels of interoception in the treatment of BN.

Effects of attention bias modification with short and long stimulus-duration: A randomized experiment with individuals with subclinical social anxiety,"This study investigated the differential effects of two attention bias modification (ABM) with different stimulus durations. Seventy-two undergraduates with subclinical social anxiety were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: an ABM condition with either a 100-ms or a 500-ms stimulus duration (ABM-100/ABM-500) or an attention placebo (AP) condition with either a 100-ms or a 500-ms stimulus duration (AP-100/AP-500). Participants completed the pre-assessments, eight attentional training sessions, and post-assessments. A modified Posner paradigm was used to assess changes in attentional processing. After completion of attentional training, the ABM-100 group significantly speeded up their responses to 100-ms invalid trials, regardless of the word type. The ABM-100 group also exhibited significant reduced latencies to 500-ms invalid social threat trials and a marginally significant reduced latencies to 500-ms invalid neutral trials. The ABM-500 group showed significant reduced latencies to 500-ms invalid social threat trials. Both ABMs significantly reduced participants’ fear of negative evaluations and interactional anxiousness relative to their comparative AP. The effects on social anxiety did not differ between the two ABMs. This study suggests that although both ABMs using short and long stimulus durations reduce some aspects of social anxiety, they influence participants’ attentional disengagement in different ways.

NEO-FFI personality clusters in trichotillomania,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether personality prototypes exist among hair pullers and if these groups differ in hair pulling (HP) characteristics, clinical correlates, and quality of life. 164 adult hair pullers completed the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI; Costa and McCrae, 1992) and self-report measures of HP severity, HP style, affective state, and quality of life. A latent class cluster analysis using NEO-FFI scores was performed to separate participants into clusters. Bonferroni-corrected t -tests were used to compare clusters on HP, affective, and quality of life variables. Multiple regression was used to determine which variables significantly predicted quality of life. Two distinct personality prototypes were identified. Cluster 1 (n = 96) had higher neuroticism and lower extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness when compared to cluster 2 (n = 68). No significant differences in demographics were reported for the two personality clusters. The clusters differed on extent of focused HP, severity of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as quality of life. Those in cluster 1 endorsed greater depression, anxiety, and stress, and worse quality of life. Additionally, only depression and cluster membership (based on NEO scores) significantly predicted quality of life.

Coordination difficulty and internalizing symptoms in adults: A twin/sibling study,"Increased anxiety and depression symptoms have been reported in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, and have been found to be associated with motor coordination difficulties, but little is known about the etiology of these associations. This study aimed to assess genetic, shared (making twins/siblings alike) and non-shared (individual-specific) environmental influences on the association between poor coordination and symptoms of anxiety and depressed mood using a sample of adult twin and sibling pairs. Participants were asked about their coordination skill and anxiety and depression symptoms. About half of the variance in coordination difficulty was explained by familial (combined genetic and shared environmental) influences, with the remaining variance explained by non-shared environmental influences. Phenotypic associations between coordination and anxiety (r = .46) and depression symptoms (r = .44) were largely underpinned by shared familial liability for the three traits. Non-shared environment accounted for about a third of the phenotypic association. Results suggest that both familial and non-shared environmental influences play a role in the etiology of coordination difficulty and its association with internalizing symptoms. The current study highlights that both biological and environmental pathways shared between these symptoms should be examined in future research to inform prevention and treatment approaches in clinical settings.

The manic phase of Bipolar disorder significantly impairs theory of mind decoding,"Bipolar disorder is associated with significant deficits in the decoding of others’ mental states in comparison to healthy participants. However, differences in theory of mind decoding ability among patients in manic, depressed, and euthymic phases of bipolar disorder is currently unknown. Fifty-nine patients with bipolar I or II disorder (13 manic, 25 depressed, 20 euthymic) completed the “Reading the Mind in the Eyes” Task (Eyes task) and the Animals Task developed to control for non-mentalistic response demands of the Eyes Task. Patients also completed self-report and clinician-rated measures of depression, mania, and anxiety symptoms. Patients in the manic phase were significantly less accurate than those in the depressed and euthymic phases at decoding mental states in the Eyes task, and this effect was strongest for eyes of a positive or neutral valence. Further Eyes task performance was negatively correlated with the symptoms of language/thought disorder, pressured speech, and disorganized thoughts and appearance. These effects held when controlling for accuracy on the Animals task, response times, and relevant demographic and clinical covariates. Results suggest that the state of mania, and particularly psychotic symptoms that may overlap with the schizophrenia spectrum, are most strongly related to social cognitive deficits in bipolar disorder.

Interpersonal risk for suicide in social anxiety: The roles of shame and depression,"Though research indicates that individuals with social anxiety disorder may experience elevated levels of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, two interpersonal risk factors critical for the development of suicidal desire, it remains unclear why. The current investigation considered how shame and depression may help to explain the relationship between social anxiety and interpersonal suicide risk factors. Participants ( N = 259), recruited using Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk, completed measures of social anxiety, interpersonal suicide risk factors, shame, and depression. Social anxiety was associated with greater thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. In addition, shame partially explained the association between social anxiety and thwarted belongingness, though the indirect effect was no longer significant after considering depression as a moderator. As predicted, shame was found to fully explain the association between social anxiety and perceived burdensomeness and this indirect effect was most pronounced among individuals with high comorbid depression. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

Cognitive and neural models of threat appraisal in psychosis: A theoretical integration,"Cognitive models of psychosis propose that maladaptive appraisals of anomalous experiences contribute to distress and disability in psychosis. Attentional, attributional and reasoning biases are hypothesised to drive these threat-based appraisals. Experimental and self-report data have provided support for the presence of these biases in psychosis populations, but recently there have been calls for neurobiological data to be integrated into these findings. Currently, little investigation has been conducted into the neural correlates of maladaptive appraisals. Experimental and neuroimaging research in social cognition employing threatening stimuli provide the closest equivalent of maladaptive appraisal in psychosis. Consequently, a rapprochement of these two literatures was attempted in order to identify neural networks relevant to threat appraisal in psychosis. This revealed overlapping models of aberrant emotion processing in anxiety and schizophrenia, encompassing the amygdala, insula, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex. These models posit that aberrant activity in these systems relates to altered emotional significance detection and affect regulation, providing a conceptual overlap with threat appraisal in psychosis, specifically attentional and attributional biases towards threat. It remains to be seen if direct examination of these biases using neuroimaging paradigms supports the theoretical integration of extant models of emotion processing and maladaptive appraisals in psychosis.

Adaptation and initial validation of the Patient Health Questionnaire—9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder—7 Questionnaire (GAD-7) in an Arabic speaking Lebanese psychiatric outpatient sample,"The Patient Health Questionnaire—9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder—7 (GAD-7) are short screening measures used in medical and community settings to assess depression and anxiety severity. The aim of this study is to translate the screening tools into Arabic and evaluate their psychometric properties in an Arabic-speaking Lebanese psychiatric outpatient sample. The patients completed the questionnaires, among others, prior to being evaluated by a clinical psychiatrist or psychologist. The scales’ internal consistency and factor structure were measured and convergent and discriminant validity were established by comparing the scores with clinical diagnoses and the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire—MDD subset (PDSQ—MDD). Results showed that the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 are reliable screening tools for depression and anxiety and their factor structures replicated those reported in the literature. Sensitivity and specificity analyses showed that the PHQ-9 is sensitive but not specific at capturing depressive symptoms when compared to clinician diagnoses whereas the GAD-7 was neither sensitive nor specific at capturing anxiety symptoms. The implications of these findings are discussed in reference to the scales themselves and the cultural specificity of the Lebanese population.

The combination of health anxiety and somatic symptoms: Specificity to anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns among patients in primary care,"Prior research has found that health anxiety is related to poor patient outcomes in primary care settings. Health anxiety is characterized by at least two presentations: with either severe or no/mild somatic symptoms. Preliminary data indicate that anxiety sensitivity may be important for understanding the presentation of health anxiety with severe somatic symptoms. We further examined whether the combination of health anxiety and somatic symptoms was related to anxiety sensitivity. Participants were adults presenting for treatment at a community health center ( N = 538). As predicted, the interactive effect between health anxiety and somatic symptoms was associated with anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns. Health anxiety shared a stronger association with anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns when coupled with severe, relative to mild, somatic symptoms. Contrary to predictions, the interactive effect was not associated with the other dimensions of anxiety sensitivity. We discuss the potential relevancy of anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns to the combined presentation of health anxiety and severe somatic symptoms, as well as how this dimension of anxiety sensitivity could be treated in primary care settings.

Penn State Worry Questionnaire—10: A new tool for measurement-based care,"The Penn State Worry Questionnaire—Past Week (PSWQ-PW) is an adaptation of the widely used Penn State Worry Questionnaire, measuring pathological worry weekly. However, it contains problematic negatively worded items and has not been validated in a large sample yet. To meet the needs of measurement-based care (MBC), we developed a shortened version (PSWQ-10) based on the PSWQ-PW, retaining only positively worded items, and examined its psychometric properties and clinical utility. Patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and other anxiety disorders completed the PSWQ-10 and other instruments during routine evaluation in an academic anxiety clinic. A second cohort from a perinatal clinic was evaluated similarly. The PSWQ-10 displayed excellent internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity, and criterion group validity. Patients with GAD scored significantly higher than those with other anxiety disorders but did not differ from those with MDD. The PSWQ-10 showed sensitivity to change over time and demonstrated excellent psychometric properties in the perinatal population. The PSWQ-10 is a reliable, valid, efficient, and straightforward worry-focused instrument that can be readily used in MBC and help clinicians objectively measure worry as a treatment outcome in broad clinical populations.

The performance of the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales as measures of clinical severity,"The aim of this study was to examine the performance of the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) against other measures of functioning and mental health in a full three-year cohort of admissions to a psychiatric hospital. A sample of N = 1719 patients (35.3% females, aged 17–78 years) was assessed using observer-rated measures and self-reports of psychopathology at admission. Self-reports were available from 51.7% of the sample (34.4% females, aged 17–76 years). Functioning and psychopathology were compared across five ICD-10 diagnostic groups: substance use disorders, schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, affective disorders, anxiety/somatoform disorders and personality disorders. Associations between the measures were examined, stratifying by diagnostic subgroup. The HoNOS were strongly linked to other measures primarily in psychotic disorders (except for the behavioral subscale), while those with substance use disorders showed rather poor links. Those with anxiety/somatoform disorders showed null or only small associations. This study raises questions about the overall validity of the HoNOS. It seems to entail different levels of validity when applied to different diagnostic groups. In clinical practice the HoNOS should not be used as a stand-alone instrument to assess outcome but rather as part of a more comprehensive battery including diagnosis-specific measures.

The following study examined comorbidity and psychosocial functioning in a well-characterized sample of adults with HPD ( N = 85) who met DSM-IV criteria, had at least moderate hair pulling severity, and participated in a clinical trial. Results revealed that 38.8% of individuals with HPD had another current psychiatric diagnosis and 78.8% had another lifetime (present and/or past) psychiatric diagnosis. Specifically, HPD showed substantial overlap with depressive, anxiety, addictive, and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders. The relationships between certain comorbidity patterns, hair pulling severity, current mood and anxiety symptoms, and quality of life were also examined.

How do attachment dimensions affect bereavement adjustment? A mediation model of continuing bonds,"The current study aims to examine mechanisms underlying the impact of attachment dimensions on bereavement adjustment. Bereaved mainland Chinese participants ( N = 247) completed anonymous, retrospective, self-report surveys assessing attachment dimensions, continuing bonds (CB), grief symptoms and posttraumatic growth (PTG). Results demonstrated that attachment anxiety predicted grief symptoms via externalized CB and predicted PTG via internalized CB at the same time, whereas attachment avoidance positively predicted grief symptoms via externalized CB but negatively predicted PTG directly. Findings suggested that individuals with a high level of attachment anxiety could both suffer from grief and obtain posttraumatic growth after loss, but it depended on which kind of CB they used. By contrast, attachment avoidance was associated with a heightened risk of maladaptive bereavement adjustment. Future grief therapy may encourage the bereaved to establish CB with the deceased and gradually shift from externalized CB to internalized CB.

Antenatal depression and hematocrit levels as predictors of postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms,"The aim of this study is to delineate the risk factors of antenatal depression and its consequences, including postnatal depression, and to examine whether the hematocrit (Hct) is associated with maternal depression. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Spielberger’s State Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Kennerley and Gath Maternity Blues Assessment Scale (KGB), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) were assessed at the end of term (T1) and 2–3 days (T2) and 4–6 weeks (T3) after delivery in 126 women with and without antenatal depression. The Hct was measured at T1. Antenatal depression was significantly predicted by lifetime depression and premenstrual syndrome and less education. Antenatal depression was not associated with obstetric or neonatal outcomes. Antenatal depression symptoms strongly predict depression and anxiety symptoms at T2 and T3. The EPDS, KGB, STAI and BDI, but not the HAMD, scores, were significantly lower at T3 than before. The incidence of depression significantly decreased from T1 (23.8%) to T2 (7.8%) and T3 (5.3%). T1 Hct values significantly predicted the T3 postnatal EPDS, STAI, KGB and BDI scores. Delivery significantly improves depression and anxiety symptoms.

Do bipolar subjects' responses to personality questionnaires lack reliability? Evidence from the PsyCoLaus study,"Differences in personality scores between subjects with and without mood disorders might result from response biases rather than specific personality traits per se. The aim of this study was to compare subjects with bipolar disorders (BPD) to non-bipolar subjects in terms of response quality to the NEO-FFI. Using data from the population-based cohort study PsyCoLaus, subjects were compared in terms of responses to the NEO-FFI, and indices of response quality were calculated. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed and controlled for sociodemographic factors, depressive episodes, dysthymia, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders. Consistent with the literature, subjects with BPD had higher scores in neuroticism and openness, and lower scores in conscientiousness. However, significant differences were measured for response reliability and validity. In particular, the indices of response quality including response reliability were lower in subjects with BPD suggesting that bipolar subjects might have more difficulty in providing consistent answers throughout questionnaires. However, regression models resulted in small associations between mania/hypomania and response quality, and showed that differences in response quality were mainly attributable to correlates of BPD instead of the presence of mania/hypomania itself. The current findings suggest that bipolar subjects’ responses to questionnaires are biased, making them less reliable.

"Schizotypal personality questionnaire—Brief revised (updated): An update of norms, factor structure, and item content in a large non-clinical young adult sample","This study updates and provides evidence for the dimensionality, reliability, and validity of a standard instrument for detection and measurement of schizotypy in non-clinical young adults. Schizotypy represents a set of traits on which both nonclinical and schizophrenia-spectrum populations vary meaningfully. These traits are linked to biological, cognitive, and social dimensions of serious mental illness (SMI), to clinical and subclinical variation in personal and social functioning, and to risk for SMI. Reliable and valid identification of schizotypal traits has important implications for clinical practice and research. Four consecutive independent samples of undergraduates were administered the SPQ-BR ( N = 2552). Confirmatory factor analyses suggested a minor item wording change improved reliability, and this Updated questionnaire was implemented for three-quarters of the sample (SPQ-BRU). A, single-order, nine-factor structure had acceptable psychometric properties. The best fitting second-order structure included four higher-order factors that distinguished Social Anxiety and Interpersonal factors. This differentiation was supported by differential relationships with treatment history. The Disorganized factor had the greatest unique relationship with personal and family treatment history. With few exceptions, factor loadings showed stability across samples. Overall, the higher-order and lower-order factors of schizotypy demonstrated reliability and convergent and discriminant validity; detailed psychometric data are presented in a supplement.

The role of anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns in suicidal ideation: A test of the Depression-Distress Amplification Model in clinical outpatients,"Suicide constitutes a significant public health burden as global suicide rates continue to increase. Thus, it is crucial to identify malleable suicide risk factors to develop prevention protocols. Anxiety sensitivity, or a fear of anxiety-related sensations, is a potential malleable risk factor for the development of suicidal ideation. The Depression-Distress Amplification Model (DDAM) posits that the anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns (ASCC) subfactor interacts with depressive symptoms to amplify the effects of depression and lead to suicidal ideation. The current study tested the DDAM across the two most widely-replicated factors of depressive symptoms (cognitive and affective/somatic) in comparison to a risk factor mediation model where ASCC are related to suicidal ideation via depressive symptoms. Participants included 295 clinical outpatients from a community clinic. The interaction between ASCC and depressive symptoms in the prediction of suicidal ideation was not significant for either cognitive or affective/somatic symptoms of depression. However, results revealed a significant indirect effect of ASCC through cognitive symptoms of depression in the prediction of suicidal ideation. These cross sectional findings are not consistent with the DDAM. Rather, the relationship may be better conceptualized with a model in which ASCC is related to suicidal ideation via cognitive symptoms of depression.

Stopping the past from intruding the present: Social anxiety disorder and proactive interference,"It has recently been suggested that social anxiety disorder (SAD) entails a deficit in down regulating unwanted (even non-threatening) memories. In the present study we test this hypothesis by comparing a sample of young adults diagnosed with SAD and healthy controls in their ability to resist proactive interference in a working memory task. Where participants performed similarly in the control condition of the memory task, participants with SAD were more susceptible to interference in the experimental condition than the healthy controls. This finding is in line with previous studies that show anxiety to be associated with impoverished executive control and, specifically, suggests that SAD entails a reduced ability to get rid of interfering memories.

This aim was tested in 590 young adults using a nonparametric bootstrapping procedure. After inclusion of the mediators, interpersonal schizotypy was no longer directly associated with either suicide ideation or lifetime suicide attempts. Depression and self-esteem mediated the relation between interpersonal schizotypy and suicide ideation. No variables mediated the relation between interpersonal schizotypy and lifetime suicide attempts, and there were no significant direct relations when mediators were included. Schizotypy appears to be a distal risk factor for suicidal behavior; assessing depressive symptoms and self-esteem may provide more proximal information about suicide risk, and may be targets for mitigating suicide risk in individuals with schizotypy.

Trait attentional control influences the relationship between repetitive negative thinking and psychopathology symptoms,"Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) has been implicated in several disorders (e.g., Clark (2005)). However, little research has examined how RNT influences other risk factors of psychopathology, such as attentional control. This study used prospective methodology to determine if relationships among various RNT styles and symptoms of psychological disorders are indirectly influenced by facets of attentional control. The sample included 376 participants who completed measures of RNT (worry, rumination, anticipatory processing, obsessions, intrusive thoughts and panic cognitions), psychopathology (generalized anxiety disorder, depression, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder), and attentional control at two time points. Several relationships between RNT forms and symptom levels were indirectly predicted by the focusing subscale of attentional control; however, the patterns of these relationships differed based on the disorder. The shifting subscale did not indirectly predict any relationship. Therefore, it appears that low focusing may be a particular risk factor for the development of later RNT and/or psychopathology symptoms.

Correlates of transient versus persistent psychotic symptoms among dependent methamphetamine users,"This study examined correlates of transient versus persistent psychotic symptoms among people dependent on methamphetamine. A longitudinal prospective cohort study of dependent methamphetamine users who did not meet DSM-IV criteria for lifetime schizophrenia or mania. Four non-contiguous one-month observation periods were used to identify participants who had a) no psychotic symptoms, (n = 110); (b) psychotic symptoms only when using methamphetamine (transient psychotic symptoms, n = 85); and, (c) psychotic symptoms both when using methamphetamine and when abstaining from methamphetamine (persistent psychotic symptoms, n = 37). Psychotic symptoms were defined as a score of 4 or greater on any of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale items of suspiciousness, hallucinations or unusual thought content. Relative no psychotic symptoms, both transient and persistent psychotic symptoms were associated with childhood conduct disorder and comorbid anxiety disorders. Earlier onset methamphetamine use and being male were more specifically related to transient psychotic symptoms, while a family history of a primary psychotic disorder and comorbid major depression were specifically related to persistent psychotic symptoms. We conclude that there are overlapping but also distinct clinical correlates of transient versus persistent psychotic symptoms, suggesting potentially heterogeneous etiological pathways underpinning the psychotic phenomena seen amongst people who use methamphetamine.

Symptom change trajectories during inpatient psychotherapy in routine care and their associations with long-term outcomes,"This study examined symptom change trajectories during inpatient psychotherapy and the association of these changes with long-term outcomes. In an observational multicenter study, weekly measurements of symptom severity were performed during inpatient treatment and 6 months after discharge. The symptom severity was measured using the 18-item scale of the Hamburg Modules for the Assessment of Psychosocial Health. The sample included 576 inpatients (mean age: 43.9 years; 77.6% female; main diagnoses: depressive (57.2%), adjustment (15.8%), anxiety (7.4%), and eating disorders (7.2%); mean treatment duration: 42.0 days). With empirically and clinically informed growth mixture models four subgroups of symptom change were revealed: gradual response (71%), early response (9%), delayed response (5%), and nonresponse (11%). Particularly low educational level, non-employment and chronic disorders were associated with unfavorable symptom courses (non- and delayed response). Long-term outcomes differed systematically across subgroups (p &lt; 0.001; η² = 0.165). The patients who responded early presented the highest rates of clinically significant improvement (43.9%) from admission to follow-up. Nearly all of these patients (92.7%) showed reliable improvement. Due to the high association of symptom change trajectories with long-term outcomes, results may contribute to interventions that are tailored to the needs of patients and may foster longer lasting therapeutic effectiveness.

"Dimensionality, psychometric properties and population-based norms of the German version of the Revised Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale (ACSS-FAD)","The aim of the present study was the validation of the Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale-Fearlessness about Death (ACSS-FAD) in a large population sample to further establish its reliability and validity, and to provide norm values. We assessed the ACSS-FAD, measures of depression, history of suicidal behavior, and anxiety in a representative sample of the German population ( N = 2513) and analyzed its dimensionality, invariance across sex and construct validity by means of confirmatory factor analysis, correlational analysis and analysis of variance. The one-factorial structure achieved satisfactory model fit after introducing several correlating error terms. Across sex, partial scalar invariance could be established. Depression and anxiety showed negative associations with the ACSS-FAD while no relation with past suicidal behavior was found. Because mean scores in the ACSS-FAD were affected by sex and age group, sex and age-specific norm values were calculated. Our findings support the one-factorial structure of the ACSS-FAD when the measurement model is slightly modified, pointing out the need of revising the wording of some items. The validity of the measure should be further examined in clinical samples.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorders: Double blind randomized clinical trial,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has become widely used as a therapeutic tool in psychiatric research. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of different frequencies of rTMS over right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in OCD. Forty five patients with OCD participated in the study. Patients were evaluated using: Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale (Y-BOCS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S). They were randomly classified into three groups: 1st group received 1 Hz rTMS; 2nd group received 10Hz rTMS; and 3rd group received sham stimulation all at 100% of the resting motor threshold for 10 sessions. They were followed up after the last treatment session and 3 months later. There was a significant ""time"" × ""group"" interaction for 1Hz versus Sham but not for 10Hz versus Sham. 1Hz versus 10Hz groups showed a significant interaction for Y-BOCS and HAM-A (P = 0.001 and 0.0001 respectively). 1Hz rTMS has a greater clinical benefit than 10Hz or Sham. There was also a significantly larger percentage change in GCI-S in the 1Hz group versus either 10Hz or sham. We conclude that 1Hz-rTMS, targeting right DLPFC is a promising tool for treatment of OCD.

Suicide risk among male substance users in residential treatment: Evaluation of the depression–distress amplification model,"Suicide is a leading cause of death and is significantly elevated among those with substance use disorders (SUDs). However, specific mechanisms of suicide in this population have been relatively understudied. The depression–distress amplification model posits that one pathway to increased suicide risk is through the intensification of depressive symptoms by anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns. However, this model has not been tested in populations with SUDs. The current study tested the depression–distress amplification model of suicide risk and examined the relation of anxiety sensitivity to suicide risk in a sample of men in residential SUD treatment. Consistent with prior work, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns were significantly associated with suicide risk. Moreover, and consistent with the depression–distress amplification model, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns related to elevated suicide risk among those with a current major depressive episode specifically, above and beyond insomnia (another risk factor for suicide) and relevant covariates. The results of this study corroborate the relevance of anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns and the depression–distress amplification model to suicide risk in an at-risk clinical sample of SUD patients. Findings suggest the importance of assessing anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns and targeting this vulnerability through brief interventions to reduce suicide risk.

"Community-oriented family-based intervention superior to standard treatment in improving depression, hopelessness and functioning among adolescents with any psychosis-risk symptoms","The aim of the present study was to compare change in functioning, affective symptoms and level of psychosis-risk symptoms in symptomatic adolescents who were treated either in an early intervention programme based on a need-adapted Family- and Community-orientated integrative Treatment Model (FCTM) or in standard adolescent psychiatric treatment (Treatment As Usual, TAU). 28 pairs were matched by length of follow-up, gender, age, and baseline functioning. At one year after the start of treatment, the matched groups were compared on change in functioning (GAF-M), five psychosis-risk dimensions of the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS), and self-reported anxiety, depression, and hopelessness symptoms (BAI, BDI-II, BHS). FCTM was more effective in improving functioning (20% vs. 6% improvement on GAF-M), as well as self-reported depression (53% vs. 14% improvement on BDI-II) and hopelessness (41% vs. 3% improvement on BHS). However, for psychosis-risk symptoms and anxiety symptoms, effectiveness differences between treatment models did not reach statistical significance. To conclude, in the present study, we found greater improvement in functioning and self-reported depression and hopelessness among adolescents who received a need-adapted Family- and Community-orientated integrative Treatment than among those who were treated in standard adolescent psychiatry.

Abnormal decision-making in generalized anxiety disorder: Aversion of risk or stimulus-reinforcement impairment?,"There is preliminary data indicating that patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) show impairment on decision-making tasks requiring the appropriate representation of reinforcement value. The current study aimed to extend this literature using the passive avoidance (PA) learning task, where the participant has to learn to respond to stimuli that engender reward and avoid responding to stimuli that engender punishment. Six stimuli engendering reward and six engendering punishment are presented once per block for 10 blocks of trials. Thirty-nine medication-free patients with GAD and 29 age-, IQ and gender matched healthy comparison individuals performed the task. In addition, indexes of social functioning as assessed by the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale were obtained to allow for correlational analyzes of potential relations between cognitive and social impairments. The results revealed a Group-by-Error Type-by-Block interaction; patients with GAD committed significantly more commission (passive avoidance) errors than comparison individuals in the later blocks (blocks 7,8, and 9). In addition, the extent of impairment on these blocks was associated with their functional impairment as measured by the GAF scale. These results link GAD with anomalous decision-making and indicate that a potential problem in reinforcement representation may contribute to the severity of expression of their disorder.

Psychopathological traits in college students from top-ranking French schools: Do autistic features impair success in science when associated with schizotypal traits?,"The link between personality and the interest of individuals for science has not been thoroughly explored. In this report, we studied psychopathological traits in students studying science in French top-ranking institutions. Three hundred and forty seven individuals answered questionnaires assessing autistic and schizotypal dimensions, as well as anxiety, depression symptomatology and attachment quality. A cluster analysis based on autistic and schizotypal traits led to the identification of 4 distinct profiles: a “low trait cluster”, a “moderate autistic trait cluster”, a “moderate schizotypal trait cluster” and a “high trait cluster” (HTC) composed of individuals with high scores on both autistic and schizotypal scales. Each cluster represented 20.1–27.1% of participants and was clearly different from the three others, both on autistic and on schizotypal dimensions. These groups could be also typified by their level of anxiety, depression or degraded attachment, which are proportional to the extent of psychopathological traits. Moreover, students from the HTC cluster displayed lower academic results, thus implying that autistic traits might impair success in science when they are associated with moderate schizotypal personality features. This study also suggests that depression and anxiety might mediate performance inhibition in the HTC group.

"Profiling the psychotic, depressive and anxiety symptoms in chronic ketamine users","Objective: Although concern about chronic ketamine abuse has grown, the characteristic symptomatology of chronic ketamine users has yet to be examined. This study aims to measure the psychotic, depressive and anxiety symptoms in chronic ketamine users. Methods: A group of chronic ketamine users in Guangzhou, China were evaluated. The socio-demographic and drug use characteristics of subjects were documented. Symptoms of psychosis, depression, anxiety were evaluated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The severity of the symptoms was identified by standard severity cutoffs. Results: The PANSS total score, positive symptom, negative symptom, general psychopathology subscale score were 45.3 ± 8.4, 8.0 ± 1.7, 13.2 ± 3.9 and 24.2 ± 4.9 respectively. BDI and BAI score was 13.1 ± 6.5 and 15.7 ± 9.6 respectively. 77.5% and 46.0% of the subjects showed moderate to severe depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms respectively. The BDI score was positively correlated with ketamine use frequency. The BAI score was positively correlated with ketamine use frequency. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms were commonly presented in chronic ketamine users. The higher ketamine use frequency and dosage were associated with more severe depressive symptoms.

None of the potential mediators (depression, anxiety, dissociation, mood swings and mania, assessed by the HAM-D, HAM-A and the CAARMS symptom scales) significantly mediated the total association between sexual abuse scores and transition. At the point of transition, the mechanistic pathway from sexual trauma to psychosis does not appear to operate through affective symptoms.

"Facial discrimination in body dysmorphic, obsessive-compulsive and social anxiety disorders","Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by preoccupation with perceived flaws in one's own appearance. Several risk factors such as aesthetic perceptual sensitivity have been proposed to explain BDD's unique symptomatology. Although research on facial discrimination is limited so far, the few existing studies have produced mixed results. Thus, the purpose of this study was to further examine facial discrimination in BDD. We administered a facial discrimination paradigm, which allows to assess the ability to identify slight to strong facial changes (e.g., hair loss, acne) when presented with an original (unmodified) facial image, relative to a changed (modified) facial image. The experiment was administered in individuals with BDD, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and mentally healthy controls (32 per group, respectively). Overall, groups did not differ with respect to their ability to correctly identify facial aberrations when presented with other people's faces. Our findings do not support the hypothesis of enhanced general aesthetic perceptual sensitivity in individuals with (vs. without) BDD.

Impaired face recognition is associated with social inhibition,"Face recognition is fundamental to successful social interaction. Individuals with deficits in face recognition are likely to have social functioning impairments that may lead to heightened risk for social anxiety. A critical component of social interaction is how quickly a face is learned during initial exposure to a new individual. Here, we used a novel Repeated Faces task to assess how quickly memory for faces is established. Face recognition was measured over multiple exposures in 52 young adults ranging from low to high in social inhibition, a core dimension of social anxiety. High social inhibition was associated with a smaller slope of change in recognition memory over repeated face exposure, indicating participants with higher social inhibition showed smaller improvements in recognition memory after seeing faces multiple times. We propose that impaired face learning is an important mechanism underlying social inhibition and may contribute to, or maintain, social anxiety.

Personality traits in the differentiation of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder during a depressive episode,"The aim of this study was to determine the differences in personality traits between individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) during a depressive episode, when it can be hard to differentiate them. Data on personality traits (NEO-FFI), mental disorders (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus) and socioeconomic variables were collected from 245 respondents who were in a depressive episode. Individuals with MDD (183) and BD (62) diagnosis were compared concerning personality traits, clinical aspects and socioeconomic variables through bivariate analyses (chi-square and ANOVA) and multivariate analysis (logistic regression). There were no differences in the prevalence of the disorders between socioeconomic and clinical variables. As for the personality traits, only the difference in Agreeableness was statistically significant. Considering the control of suicide risk, gender and anxiety comorbidity in the multivariate analysis, the only variable that remained associated was Agreeableness, with an increase in MDD cases. The brief version of the NEO inventories (NEO-FFI) does not allow for the analysis of personality facets. During a depressive episode, high levels of Agreeableness can indicate that MDD is a more likely diagnosis than BD.

"Personality disorders, but not cancer severity or treatment type, are risk factors for later generalised anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder in non metastatic breast cancer patients","This study aimed to determine whether personality disorders were associated with later Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in breast cancer patients. This longitudinal and multicentric study included 120 French non-metastatic breast cancer patients. After cancer diagnosis (T1) and 7 months after diagnosis (T3), we assessed MDD and GAD (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0). We assessed personality disorders 3 months after diagnosis (VKP). We used multiple logistic regression analysis to determine what were the factors associated with GAD and MDD at T3. At T3, prevalence rate was 10.8% for MDD and 19.2% for GAD. GAD at T3 was significantly and independently associated with GAD at T1 and with existence of a personality disorder, no matter the cluster type. MDD at T3 was significantly and independently associated with MDD at T1 and with the existence of a cluster C personality disorder. Initial cancer severity and the type of treatment used were not associated with GAD or MDD at T3. Breast cancer patients with personality disorders are at higher risk for GAD and MDD at the end of treatment. Patients with GAD should be screened for personality disorders. Specific interventions for patients with personality disorders could prevent psychiatric disorders.

Impaired non-verbal emotion processing in pathological gamblers,"Impaired perception of emotion in others has been described and confirmed in addictions with substances, but no such data exists regarding addictions without substances. As it has been hypothesized that toxic effect of substances on the brain was responsible for the impairments described, studying addictions without substances could be of interest to confirm this hypothesis. Twenty-two male pathological gamblers were compared to 22 male healthy controls matched for age and education level on non-verbal emotion perception tasks including faces, voices, and musical excerpts. Depression and anxiety levels were controlled for. Pathological gamblers significantly underestimated the intensity of peacefulness in music, and overall they were less accurate when reading emotion in voices and faces. They also overestimated emotional intensity in neutral voices and faces. Although anxiety levels did account for accuracy problems when detecting fear in voices and for overestimating emotions in neutral faces, anxiety levels did not explain the range of deficits observed. This is the first study showing non-verbal perception deficits in a purely behavioural addiction. These findings show that deficits in decoding non-verbal signals are associated with addictive behaviours per se, and are not due solely to toxic effects of substances on the brain.

Implementing the K-SADS-PL as a standard diagnostic tool: Effects on clinical diagnoses,"Diagnostic interviews are valuable tools for generating reliable and valid psychiatric diagnoses. However, little is known about the diagnostic effects of implementing such an interview into the standard diagnostic procedure of a child psychiatric clinic. Therefore, we reviewed discharge diagnoses of psychiatric patients (age: 8–12 years; combined sample of inpatients and day hospital patients) over two intervals before and after implementing the semi-structured diagnostic interview K-SADS-PL as a diagnostic tool during intake. Each interval was a two year period spanning from 2009–2010 (pre sample; n = 177) and from 2012–2013 (post sample; n = 132). The number of diagnoses per patient and the co-morbidity rate increased significantly in the post sample. Furthermore, the percentage of children with a nonspecific diagnosis “other mixed disorders of conduct and emotions” (ICD-10: F92.8) decreased significantly after using the K-SADS-PL. Regarding the main diagnostic categories, a significant increase in the number of anxiety disorders and stress-related and somatoform disorders was found in the post sample. The results suggest that implementing a semi-structured interview into the daily routine of child psychiatry may have a substantial impact on discharge diagnoses. Practical implications are discussed and ideas for future research are given.

The relation between anxiety and BMI—Is it all in our curves?,"The relation between anxiety and excessive weight is unclear. The aims of the present study were three-fold: First, we examined the association between anxiety and Body Mass Index (BMI). Second, we examined this association separately for female and male participants. Next, we examined both linear and non-linear associations between anxiety and BMI. The BMI was assessed of 92 patients (mean age: M = 27.52; 57% females) suffering from anxiety disorders. Patients completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Both linear and non-linear correlations were computed for the sample as a whole and separately by gender. No gender differences were observed in anxiety scores or BMI. No linear correlation between anxiety scores and BMI was observed. In contrast, a non-linear correlation showed an inverted U-shaped association, with lower anxiety scores both for lower and very high BMI indices, and higher anxiety scores for medium to high BMI indices. Separate computations revealed no differences between males and females. The pattern of results suggests that the association between BMI and anxiety is complex and more accurately captured with non-linear correlations.

A comparison of the nature and correlates of panic attacks in the context of Panic Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder,"Panic attacks occurring outside of Panic Disorder are not well-understood despite their inclusion as a diagnostic specifier in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This study compares panic attacks in the context of Panic Disorder compared to social anxiety in terms of their symptom frequency, severity, and clinical correlates. Method: Participants ( n = 404) were interviewed using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS-IV-L; Brown et al., 1994), from which we analyzed interviewer ratings of panic attacks and panic attack symptoms, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics. Results: Panic attacks in the context of Panic Disorder were characterized by a greater number and severity of symptoms compared to panic attacks in the context of Social Anxiety Disorder, and were associated with a history of traumatization, inpatient psychiatric treatment, and benzodiazepine use. Social anxiety panic attacks were associated with reduced physical health concerns. Cognitive panic attack symptoms were more prevalent in Panic Disorder and were associated with a variety of poor clinical correlates. Conclusions: Panic attacks in the context of Panic Disorder are more severe than those in social anxiety, and this may be driven by cognitive disturbances during those attacks.

Attenuated positive psychotic symptoms and social anxiety: Along a psychotic continuum or different constructs?,"Social anxiety commonly occurs across the course of schizophrenia, including in the premorbid and prodromal phases of psychotic disorders. Some have posited that social anxiety may exist on a continuum with paranoia; however, empirical data are lacking. The study aim was to determine whether attenuated positive psychotic symptoms are related to social anxiety. Young adults ( N = 1378) were administered the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ), which measures attenuated positive psychotic symptoms (APPS), and the Social Phobia Scale (SPS), which measures a subset of social anxiety symptoms. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to address the extent to which social anxiety and APPS tap distinct dimensions. Confirmatory factor analyses support the existence of a separate social anxiety factor scale and four separate, though interrelated, APPS factor domains (unusual thought content, paranoia/suspiciousness, disorganized thinking, and perceptual abnormalities). Additionally, social anxiety was significantly, but not differently related to each APPS domain, although the magnitude was reduced between social anxiety and distressing APPS. The current study suggests that social anxiety and attenuated positive psychotic symptoms are separable constructs, but are significantly associated with each other.

Illustrating the body: Cross-sectional and prospective investigations of the impact of life drawing sessions on body image,"Life drawing sessions, where individuals produce drawings of the human figure from observations of a live model, may contain embodying elements that promote healthier body image. Two pilot studies were conducted to test this hypothesis. In Study 1, 138 individuals recruited from life drawing sessions in London, UK, estimated how many sessions they had attended in their lifetime and completed measures of negative and positive body image. In women, greater attendance was significantly associated with higher body appreciation and lower drive for thinness and social physique anxiety. In men, greater attendance was significantly associated with higher body appreciation, but not drive for muscularity or social physique anxiety. In Study 2, 37 women took part in a life drawing session for the first time. Compared to pre-session scores, participants had significantly more positive state body image and appearance satisfaction after the session. The findings of these studies suggest that life drawing may promote healthier body image, particularly among women, but further research is needed.

Dissociation between implicit and explicit expectancies of cannabis use in adolescence,"Cannabis is one of the most commonly drugs used by teenagers. Expectancies about its effects play a crucial role in cannabis consumption. Various tools have been used to assess expectancies, mainly self-report questionnaires measuring explicit expectancies, but implicit measures based on experimental tasks have also been developed, measuring implicit expectancies. The aim of this study was to simultaneously assess implicit/explicit expectancies related to cannabis among adolescent users and non-users. 130 teenagers attending school (55 girls) were enrolled (Age: M = 16.40 years); 43.84% had never used cannabis (""non-users"") and 56.16% had used cannabis (""users""). They completed self-report questionnaires evaluating cannabis use, cannabis-related problems, effect expectancies (explicit expectancies), alcohol use, social and trait anxiety, depression, as well as three Implicit Association Tests (IAT) assessing implicit expectancies. Adolescents manifested more implicit affective associations (relaxation, excitation, negative) than neutral ones regarding cannabis. These were not related to explicit expectancies. Cannabis users reported more implicit relaxation expectancies and less negative explicit expectancies than non-users. The frequency of use and related problems were positively associated with the explicit expectancies regarding relaxation and enhancement, and were negatively associated with negative explicit expectancies and negative implicit expectancies. Findings indicate that implicit and explicit expectancies play different roles in cannabis use by adolescents. The implications for experimentation and prevention are discussed.

To facilitate research on the metacognitive model applied to health anxiety the present study reports on the development and initial evaluation of a new specific metacognitive measure of health anxiety, the Metacognitions Questionnaire-Health Anxiety (MCQ-HA). Principal components analysis identified 14 suitable items to be explored. Subsequent exploratory factor analysis of the MCQ-HA identified three factors: ""Beliefs that Thoughts can cause Illness"", ""Beliefs about Biased thinking"", and ""Beliefs that Thoughts are Uncontrollable"". Confirmatory factor analysis supported the three factor model with all selected goodness-of-fit statistics equivalent to or better than recommended values. Preliminary evidence suggests good internal-consistency, incremental, convergent and discriminant validity in relation to associated measures. The MCQ-HA appears to be a potentially useful predictor of health anxiety.

"Intrusive prospective imagery, posttraumatic intrusions and anxiety in schizophrenia","Trauma exposure and intrusive thoughts are commonly reported in both schizophrenia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Information processing accounts suggest that intrusions occur in the two conditions as a result of insufficient state and/or trait contextual processing in long-term memory. Most research has focused on intrusions about past events, while growing evidence suggests that intrusions about prospective imagined events warrants further investigation. Prospective intrusive imagery has yet to be examined in psychotic disorders but could provide crucial information regarding the aetiology and maintenance of psychotic symptoms. The current study examines the role of prospective intrusive imagery, posttraumatic intrusions and anxiety in schizophrenia. Fifty-seven participants (30 patients and 27 healthy controls) completed measures of trauma, PTSD, anxiety, general non-affective use of imagery, and intrusive prospective imagery. Patients reported significantly more intrusive prospective imagery relative to control participants but, importantly, not greater use of general non-affective imagery. Intrusive prospective imagery was associated with posttraumatic intrusions and anxiety in schizophrenia. The findings are consistent with information processing models of intrusions and psychosis, and provide novel insights for theoretical accounts, clinical formulation and therapeutic targets for psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia.

Evaluation of oxidative and antioxidative parameters in generalized anxiety disorder,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder. The exact causes of GAD still unknown, in addition to neurochemical and neuroanatomic disorders, genetic and environmental factors are discussed in etiology. In our study we aimed to evaluate the oxidative metabolism's status and investigate the role of oxidative metabolites in GAD. Blood samples were taken from enrolled subjects in appropriate way and total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and oxidative stress index (OSI) were studied in Harran University Biochemistry Labs. Results were compared between groups. The patients' TOS and OSI levels were significantly higher than control group. The patients' TAS levels were significantly lower than controls'. According to our findings, oxidative stress mechanism might have a role in GAD pathophysiology. In the future, total antioxidants may be used as a biologic marker in GAD etiology but more research is needed.

A latent class analysis of parental bipolar disorder: Examining associations with offspring psychopathology,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is highly heterogeneous, and course variations are associated with patient outcomes. This diagnostic complexity challenges identification of patients in greatest need of intervention. Additionally, course variations have implications for offspring risk. First, latent class analysis (LCA) categorized parents with BD based on salient illness characteristics: BD type, onset age, polarity of index episode, pole of majority of episodes, rapid cycling, psychosis, anxiety comorbidity, and substance dependence. Fit indices favored three parental classes with some substantively meaningful patterns. Two classes, labeled “Earlier-Onset Bipolar-I” (EO-I) and “Earlier-Onset Bipolar-II” (EO-II), comprised parents who had a mean onset age in mid-adolescence, with EO-I primarily BD-I parents and EO-II entirely BD-II parents. The third class, labeled “Later-Onset BD” (LO) had an average onset age in adulthood. Classes also varied on probability of anxiety comorbidity, substance dependence, psychosis, rapid cycling, and pole of majority of episodes. Second, we examined rates of disorders in offspring (ages 4–33, M age = 13.46) based on parental latent class membership. Differences emerged for offspring anxiety disorders only such that offspring of EO-I and EO-II parents had higher rates, compared to offspring of LO parents, particularly for daughters. Findings may enhance understanding of BD and its nosology (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2015
Therapists' and patients' stress responses during graduated versus flooding in vivo exposure in the treatment of specific phobia: A preliminary observational study,"Exposure therapy is considered an effective treatment strategy for phobic anxiety, however, it is rarely applied in clinical practice. The under-usage might be due to various factors of which heightened stress levels not only in patients but also in therapists are presumed to be of particular relevance. The present study aimed to investigate whether different forms of exposure might lead to varying physiological and psychological stress responses in therapists and phobic patients. 25 patients with specific phobia underwent individual cognitive behavioural therapy, performed by 25 psychotherapist trainees, applying exposure sessions in graduated form or the flooding technique. Patients and therapists provided subjective evaluations of stress and five saliva samples for analysis of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase either during two graduated exposure sessions or during one flooding session, while a regular therapy session served as control condition. Therapists displayed heightened salivary alpha-amylase release during exposure of the flooding, but not the graduated, type. Patients showed elevated salivary cortisol during flooding exposure numerically, however, not on a statistically significant level. Therapists reported more pronounced subjective stress during flooding compared to graduated exposure. Elevated stress levels should be addressed in clinical training in order to improve application of exposure in routine practice.

Attachment as a partial mediator of the relationship between emotional abuse and schizotypy,"Developmental theories highlight the salience of attachment theory in explaining vulnerability towards psychosis. At the same time there is increasing recognition that psychosis is associated with childhood trauma variables. This study explored the interaction between attachment and several trauma variables in relation to schizotypy levels in a non-clinical sample. 283 non-clinical participants completed online measures of schizotypy, attachment, childhood abuse and neglect. When five types of abuse/neglect were entered into a linear regression analysis emotional abuse was the sole independent predictor of schizotypy. Age, attachment anxiety and avoidance were independent predictors after the effects of emotional abuse were controlled for. The overall model was significant, explaining 34% of the variation in schizotypy. Moderation analysis indicated that the effect of emotional abuse was not conditional upon attachment. Parallel mediation analysis indicated small but significant indirect effects of emotional abuse on schizotypy through attachment avoidance (13%) and attachment anxiety (8%). We conclude that emotional abuse contributes to vulnerability towards psychosis both directly and indirectly through attachment insecurity.

Relationships between cyberchondria and obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions,"Researchers have recently begun to investigate a vicious cycle of escalating physical health concerns and online medical information seeking coined “cyberchondria”. Research has shown that cyberchondria is strongly associated with health anxiety (HA), but there is a dearth of work investigating the potential relationships between cyberchondria and other anxiety-related pathologies. One such condition is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which could theoretically be related to cyberchondria given the physical health relevant focus of certain types of OC symptoms. The current study sought to investigate the potential relationship between cyberchondria OCD across OC symptom dimensions. Community participants ( N = 468) were recruited via online crowdsourcing to complete a battery of self-report questionnaires including cyberchondria and OC measures. Structural equation modeling revealed significant unique associations between both contamination/washing and responsibility for harm/checking symptoms, and cyberchondria, such that greater cyberchondria was associated with greater OC symptoms after controlling for HA and trait negative affect. These results suggest that similar to proposed models of cyberchondria and HA, cyberchondria could potentially play a role in the development/maintenance of two dimensions of OC symptoms, or vice versa. Future work will need to determine the causal nature of these relationships or whether they are simply co-occurring phenomena.

A lifestyle intervention for primary care patients with depression and anxiety: A randomised controlled trial,"This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a diet and exercise lifestyle intervention on mental health outcomes for patients currently being treated for depression and/or anxiety in primary care. Patients ( n = 119) referred by general practitioners to the 12-week randomised controlled trial were assigned to either an intervention of six visits to a dual qualified dietitian/exercise physiologist (DEP) where motivational interviewing and activity scheduling were used to engage patients in individually-tailored lifestyle change (focussed on diet and physical activity), or an attention control with scheduled telephone contact. Assessments conducted at baseline ( n = 94) and 12 weeks ( n = 60) were analysed with an intent-to-treat approach using linear mixed modelling. Significant improvement was found for both groups on Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) scores, measures of nutrient intake and total Australian modified Healthy Eating Index (Aust-HEI) scores. Significant differences between groups over time were found only for iron intake and body mass index. Patients participating in individual consultations with a dietitian were more likely to maintain or improve diet quality than those participating in an attention control. This study provides initial evidence to support the role of dietitians in the management of patients with depression and/or anxiety.

Internet screening for anxiety disorders: Treatment-seeking outcomes in a three-month follow-up study,"Although many people use the internet to diagnose mental health problems, little is known about the relationship between internet self-diagnosis and treatment-seeking. The MACSCREEN (a validated, self-report screening tool for anxiety and depression) was posted on our clinic homepage and respondents were invited to take an anxiety test. Three months after completing the MACSREEN and a variety of symptom severity scales, respondents were emailed a follow up questionnaire asking about treatment-seeking behaviours. Of the 770 MACSCREEN respondents, 103 completed the follow-up questionnaire. Of these, 100% met criteria for at least one anxiety or mood disorder diagnosis and 51% sought treatment after completing the MACSCREEN. In the 49% who did not seek treatment, fear of medication (57%), discomfort talking to their doctor about anxiety (28%) and the belief that symptoms were not severe enough (28%) were cited as barriers. Compared to non-seekers, treatment-seekers were significantly more likely to meet screening criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Depression. Higher Sheehan Disability Scale scores and being married (versus single) significantly increased the odds of treatment-seeking, suggesting that functional impairment and disease burden on the family may be stronger predictors of treatment seeking than overall severity of symptoms.

Association of dietary diversity score with anxiety in women,"Evidence suggests that diet plays an important role in the development of mental disorders, especially anxiety. Dietary diversity score is an indicator for assessing diet quality. However, its association with anxiety has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to examine the association of dietary diversity score with anxiety. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 360 women attending health centers in the south of Tehran in 2014. General information among others were collected. Weight, height and waist circumference were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Dietary intake and anxiety score were assessed using a 24-h dietary recall and Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS) questionnaires, respectively. Dietary diversity score was computed according to the guidelines of FAO. About 35% of the participants were found to exhibit anxiety. The dietary diversity score in 12.5% of the subjects were between 1 and 3 (low dietary diversity score) but 87.5% scored between 4 and 7 (high dietary diversity score). The adjusted mean of anxiety score in subjects with high dietary diversity score was significantly lower than those with low dietary diversity score. Dietary diversity score was found to be inversely associated with anxiety. However, the causality between anxiety and dietary diversity could not be determined.

A prospective study of leukocyte telomere length and risk of phobic anxiety among women,"We prospectively examined the relation of relative telomere lengths (RTLs), a marker of biological aging, to phobic anxiety in later-life. RTLs in peripheral blood leukocytes were measured among 3194 women in the Nurses' Health Study who provided blood samples in 1989/90. The Crown-Crisp Phobic Index (CCI, range = 0–16) was assessed in 1988 and 2004. Only participants with CCI ≤ 3 (consistent with no meaningful anxiety symptoms) in 1988 were included. We related baseline RTLs to odds ratios (ORs) of incident high phobic anxiety symptoms (CCI ≥ 6). To enhance clinical relevance, we used finite mixture modeling (FMM) to relate baseline RTLs to latent classes of CCI in 2004. RTLs were not significantly associated with high phobic anxiety symptoms after 16 years of follow-up. However, FMM identified 3 groups of phobic symptoms in later-life: severe, minimal/intermediate, and non-anxious. The severe group had non-significantly shorter multivariable-adjusted mean RTLs than the minimal/intermediate and non-anxious groups. Women with shorter telomeres vs. longest telomeres had non-significantly higher likelihood of being in the severe vs. non-anxious group. Overall, there was no significant association between RTLs and incident phobic anxiety symptoms. Further work is required to explore potential connections of telomere length and emergence of severe phobic anxiety symptoms during later-life.

Pharmacogenetics of alcohol use disorders and comorbid psychiatric disorders,"Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) represent a significant health burden worldwide. Currently, there are three medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of AUDs, and other drugs are being prescribed off-label for this purpose. However, response rates for pharmacologic treatment are low, and extant research suggests that treatment effects may partially depend on genetic factors. Personalized medicine, or using a patient's genetics and/or personal history to determine efficacy of treatment prior to prescription, is an emerging tool that will help clinicians treat their patients more effectively and safely. This review systematically discusses current findings from AUD pharmacotherapy trials examining disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone, the injectable naltrexone, and topiramate. Furthermore, it presents pharmacogenetics findings associated with these medications in an attempt to further the field of personalized medicine. Research from trials examining AUDs and comorbid major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders is also presented, and pharmacogenetic findings for these treatments are discussed. Lastly, the authors comment on the present and future states of the field of personalized medicine for AUD.

Psychiatric comorbidity in women and men with eating disorders results from a large clinical database,"Psychiatric comorbidity is common in patients with eating disorders (ED), but prevalence estimates are heterogeneous, probably due to methodological differences between studies (population, diagnostic method, sampling procedure etc.) and a few studies include men. The aim of this study is to investigate psychiatric DSM-IV Axis I comorbidity in a large sample of adult patients, both males and females, with the whole spectrum of DSM-IV ED diagnoses. Initial presentation assessment data on 11,588 adult men and women presenting to specialist ED clinics in Sweden between 2008 and 2012 were extracted from a large clinical database. Diagnostics were based on semi-structured interviews (SCID-I) and the Structured Eating Disorder Interview (SEDI). Seventy-one percent of the patients with ED had at least one other Axis I disorder. The most common type of diagnosis was anxiety disorders (53%), where generalized anxiety disorder was the most common diagnosis. The highest levels of comorbidity were found for women with Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and men with Bulimia Nervosa (BN). Findings are consistent with previous research showing a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in both men and women with ED. The small gender differences observed seem negligible compared to the general similarity in comorbidity.

Associations between five-factor model of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and plasma levels of monoamine metabolite in patients with schizophrenia,"The five-factor model of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia symptoms is the most common multiple-factor model used in analyses; its use may improve evaluation of symptoms in schizophrenia patients. Plasma monoamine metabolite levels are possible indicators of clinical symptoms or response to antipsychotics in schizophrenia. We investigated the association between five-factor model components and plasma monoamine metabolites levels to explore the model's biological basis. Plasma levels of homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography in 65 Japanese patients with schizophrenia. Significant negative correlation between plasma 5-HIAA levels and the depression/anxiety component was found. Furthermore, significant positive correlation was found between plasma MHPG levels and the excitement component. Plasma HVA levels were not correlated with any five-factor model component. These results suggest that the five-factor model of the PANSS may have a biological basis, and may be useful for elucidating the psychopathology of schizophrenia. Assessment using the five-factor model may enable understanding of monoaminergic dysfunction, possibly allowing more appropriate medication selection. Further studies of a larger number of first-episode schizophrenia patients are needed to confirm and extend these results.

Prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder on a psychiatric inpatient ward and the value of a screening question,"The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) on an inpatient ward in the UK with a larger sample than previously studied and to investigate the value of a simple screening question during an assessment interview. Four hundred and thirty two consecutive admissions were screened for BDD on an adult psychiatric ward over a period of 13 months. Those who screened positive had a structured diagnostic interview for BDD. The prevalence of BDD was estimated to be 5.8% (C.I. 3.6–8.1%). Our screening question had a slightly low specificity (76.6%) for detecting BDD. The strength of this study was a larger sample size and narrower confidence interval than previous studies. The study adds to previous observations that BDD is poorly identified in psychiatric inpatients. BDD was identified predominantly in those presenting with depression, substance misuse or an anxiety disorder. The screening question could be improved by excluding those with weight or shape concerns. Missing the diagnosis is likely to lead to inappropriate treatment.

The present study sampled adults with a history of NSSI and compared those with and without BPD on (a) NSSI features, (b) co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and (c) severity of depression, suicidal ideation and emotion dysregulation. Participants (NSSI+BPD, n = 46; NSSI Only, n = 54) completed semi-structured interviews and self-report measures. Whereas the groups did not differ in age of NSSI onset, the NSSI+BPD group engaged in more frequent, recent and severe NSSI, and reported higher rates of skin carving, head banging, self-punching and self-scratching than the NSSI Only group. Participants with BPD also showed greater diagnostic comorbidity, particularly for anxiety disorders, but did not differ from participants without BPD in rates of mood, substance or psychotic disorders. The NSSI+BPD group reported more severe depressive symptomatology, suicidal ideation and emotion dysregulation than the NSSI Only group. Supplementary analyses on the subset of participants with recent (past year) NSSI revealed similarly medium to large differences between those with and without BPD.

"Imagining a brighter future: The effect of positive imagery training on mood, prospective mental imagery and emotional bias in older adults","Positive affect and optimism play an important role in healthy ageing and are associated with improved physical and cognitive health outcomes. This study investigated whether it is possible to boost positive affect and associated positive biases in this age group using cognitive training. The effect of computerised imagery-based cognitive bias modification on positive affect, vividness of positive prospective imagery and interpretation biases in older adults was measured. 77 older adults received 4 weeks (12 sessions) of imagery cognitive bias modification or a control condition. They were assessed at baseline, post-training and at a one-month follow-up. Both groups reported decreased negative affect and trait anxiety, and increased optimism across the three assessments. Imagery cognitive bias modification significantly increased the vividness of positive prospective imagery post-training, compared with the control training. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no difference between the training groups in negative interpretation bias. This is a useful demonstration that it is possible to successfully engage older adults in computer-based cognitive training and to enhance the vividness of positive imagery about the future in this group. Future studies are needed to assess the longer-term consequences of such training and the impact on affect and wellbeing in more vulnerable groups.

Obsessive-compulsive disorders and anxiety disorders: A comparison of personality and emotionality patterns,"Even though obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) and anxiety disorders (AD) have been separated in the taxonomy adopted by the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, many issues remain concerning the physiopathological similarities and differences between those categories. Our objective was therefore to explore and compare their personality and emotional features, with the assumption that the distinction of two independent spectrums should imply the existence of two partially distinct temperamental profiles. We used the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-R) and the Positive and Negative Emotionality (PNE) scale to compare two groups of patients with OCD ( n = 227) or AD ( n = 827). The latter group included patients with social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. Most temperament, character and emotionality measures showed no significant differences between both groups. In the personality measures results, only the self-directedness score (TCI-R) was significantly lower in OCD patients but this difference was not significant when the comparison was adjusted for the depressive scale score and age. Only lower PNE positive affects scores were obtained in OCD patients in the adjusted comparisons. These findings suggest that OCD and AD are not really distinguishable from the point of view of associated personality traits.

Daytime intrusive thoughts and subjective insomnia symptoms,"Insomnia is increasingly recognised as a 24h complaint that is associated with an increased risk of mood and anxiety disorders. However, the effects of insomnia symptoms on maladaptive daytime patterns of thinking are poorly understood. We examined the relationship between subjective insomnia symptoms, attentional control and negative thought intrusions during daytime in a large sample of undergraduates experiencing poor sleep. A total of 109 participants completed self-report measures of sleep quality, current sleepiness, anxiety and attentional control. A behavioural measure of intrusive thought required participants to control their attention during two focus periods separated by a 5min period of self-referential worry. Thought intrusions were sampled throughout the pre- and post-worry periods. Perceived insomnia severity was associated with the reduced ability to focus attention and uniquely associated with increased negative thought intrusions in the pre-worry period. These results support suggestions that acute episodes of poor sleep can dysregulate key networks involved in attentional control and emotion regulation, and that promote negative cognitive activity.

Asking patients about their general level of functioning: Is IT worth IT for common mental disorders?,"Functional disability (FD) is a diagnostic criterion for the psychiatric diagnosis of many mental disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); major depressive episode (MDE)). We aimed to assess the contribution of measuring FD to diagnosing GAD and MDE using clinical (Global Assessment of Functioning, GAF) and self-reported methods (Analog scale of functioning, ASF and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule WHODAS 2.0). Patients seeking professional help for mood/anxiety symptoms ( N = 244) were evaluated. The MINI interview was used to determine the presence of common mental disorders. Symptoms were assessed with two short checklists. Logistic and hierarchical logistic models were used to determine the diagnostic accuracy and the added diagnostic value of FD assessment in detecting GAD and MDE. For GAD, FD alone had a diagnostic accuracy of 0.79 (GAF), 0.79 (ASF) and 0.78 (WHODAS) and for MDE of 0.83, 0.84 and 0.81, respectively. Self-reported measures of FD improved the diagnostic performance of the number of symptoms (4% AUC increase) for GAD, but not for MDE. If assessed before symptom evaluation, FD can discriminate well between patients with and without GAD/MDE. When assessed together with symptoms, self-reported methods improve GAD detection rates.

Emotional trait and memory associates of sleep timing and quality,"Poor ability to remember the extinction of conditioned fear, elevated trait anxiety, and delayed or disrupted nocturnal sleep are reported in anxiety disorders. The current study examines the interrelationship of these factors in healthy young-adult males. Skin-conductance response was conditioned to two differently colored lamps. One color but not the other was then extinguished. After varying delays, both colors were presented to determine extinction recall and generalization. Questionnaires measured sleep quality, morningness–eveningness, neuroticism and trait anxiety. A subset produced a mean 7.0 nights of actigraphy and sleep diaries. Median split of mean sleep midpoint defined early- and late-“sleep timers”. Extinction was more rapidly learned in the morning than evening only in early timers who also better generalized extinction recall. Extinction recall was greater with higher sleep efficiency. Sleep efficiency and morningness were negatively associated with neuroticism and anxiety. However, neuroticism and anxiety did not predict extinction learning, recall or generalization. Therefore, neuroticism/anxiety and deficient fear extinction, although both associated with poor quality and late timing of sleep, are not directly associated with each other. Elevated trait anxiety, in addition to predisposing directly to anxiety disorders, may thus also indirectly promote such disorders by impairing sleep and, consequently, extinction memory.

However, only few studies have examined cytokine abnormalities in OCD with inconsistent results possibly due to confounding effects of medications and comorbid anxiety–depression. We examined 20 comorbidity free, drug free OCD patients and 20 age and sex matched healthy controls. Clinical severity was assessed using Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Hamilton anxiety rating scale, Hamilton depression rating scale and Clinical Global Impression. Levels of different cytokines, Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and Interferon (IFN)-γ were assessed using Cytometric Bead Array. OCD patients had significantly greater plasma levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α levels than controls but not IFN-γ. Reanalysis of data with only drug naïve patients (excluding 4 drug free patients) did not alter the results. Presence of these abnormalities in drug-naïve patients suggests the possible role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of OCD. Study findings have potential clinical utility in development of novel therapeutic options targeting cytokine aberrations in OCD.

"Incidence, clinical correlates and treatment effect of rage in anxious children","Episodic rage represents an important and underappreciated clinical feature in pediatric anxiety. This study examined the incidence and clinical correlates of rage in children with anxiety disorders. Change in rage during treatment for anxiety was also examined. Participants consisted of 107 children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and their parents. Participants completed structured clinical interviews and questionnaire measures to assess rage, anxiety, functional impairment, family accommodation and caregiver strain, as well as the quality of the child's relationship with family and peers. Rage was a common feature amongst children with anxiety disorders. Rage was associated with a more severe clinical profile, including increased anxiety severity, functional impairment, family accommodation and caregiver strain, as well as poorer relationships with parents, siblings, extended family and peers. Rage was more common in children with separation anxiety, comorbid anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and behavioral disorders, but not depressive symptoms. Rage predicted higher levels of functional impairment, beyond the effect of anxiety severity. Rage severity reduced over treatment in line with changes in anxiety symptoms. Findings suggest that rage is a marker of greater psychopathology in anxious youth. Standard cognitive behavioral treatment for anxiety appears to reduce rage without adjunctive treatment.

"Neuroinflammatory pathways in anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and obsessive compulsive disorders","As prevalence of anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and obsessive compulsive disorders continue to rise worldwide, increasing focus has been placed on immune mediated theories in understanding the underlying mechanisms of these disorders. Associations between the dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and these disorders have been recognized in the scientific literature, specifically in regard to cortisol levels, as well as changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The present commentary will systematically assess the scientific literature within the past decade in regard to the psychoneuroimmunology of anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and obsessive compulsive disorders. Understanding the mechanisms of these disorders is essential in order to determine efficacious and targeted treatment strategies, which may lead to substantial improvements in overall functioning, as well as significant decreases in societal and economic burden.

Adult attachment orientation and automatic processing of emotional information on a semantic level: A masked affective priming study,"Early adverse social experiences leading to attachment insecurity could cause heightened sensitivity to emotional information. Automatic processing of emotional stimuli conveys information about positive–negative differentiation and the so-called possessor vs. other-relevance of valence. The aim of the present study was to examine automatic processing of emotional and relevance type information on a semantic level as a function of adult attachment avoidance and anxiety. A masked affective priming task, varying valence and relevance of prime and target adjectives, was presented to a sample of 153 healthy adults. The Experiences in Close Relationships scale was administered to assess attachment orientation. Significant priming effects for valence and relevance were observed. Attachment avoidance, but not attachment anxiety, was significantly related to affective priming independently of trait anxiety and depression. Specifically, attachment avoidance was found to be related to affective priming effects based on other-relevant words. It can be concluded that automatic processing of emotional adjectives used to characterize safe or risky social environments is heightened in avoidant individuals. The avoidantly attached processing style has similarities with repressive coping, which is characterized by an enhanced early response to emotion stimuli followed by avoidant biases at a controlled processing level.

Individual differences in hedonic experience: Further evidence for the construct validity of the ACIPS,"We conducted three investigations to examine the convergent and discriminant validity of the Anticipatory and Consummatory Interpersonal Pleasure Scale (ACIPS; Gooding and Pflum, Psychiatry Research, 2014). In Study One, we used Mechanical Turk to individually administer the ACIPS to a diverse group of community adults aged 25–69. Reports of greater social/interpersonal pleasure was associated with greater sense of interpersonal connectedness with others, higher need to belong, and less likelihood of reporting anxiety during social interactions. In Studies Two and Three, participants were tested in group settings. Studies with undergraduate participants indicated that ACIPS scores are associated with measures of prosocial interactions and sociability as well as measures of anhedonia. Despite differences in testing conditions (i.e., online vs. paper administration) and heterogeneity in the samples in terms of educational level, geographical location, and age, the ACIPS demonstrated good convergent and discriminant validity. Taken together, these studies add to the increasing body of evidence for the construct validity of the ACIPS.

Child-focused treatment of pediatric OCD affects parental behavior and family environment,"This study aimed to investigate the impact of child-focused pediatric OCD treatment on parental anxiety, family accommodation and family environment. Forty-three parents (72.1% female, mean age±SD = 43.1±5.6 years) were evaluated at baseline and after their children's ( n =33, 54.5% female, mean age±SD =12.9±2.7 years) randomized treatment with Group Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy or fluoxetine for 14 weeks. Validated instruments were administered by trained clinicians. Parents were assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Family Accommodation Scale (FAS) and the Family Environment Scale (FES). The Yale-Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale was administered to children. Significant findings after the children's treatment include decreased family accommodation levels (participation, modification and distress/consequences domains); increased cohesion and active-recreational components of the family environment. In addition, changes in the FAS distress/consequences and the FES cohesion subscores were correlated with the children's clinical improvement. These results suggest that child-focused OCD treatment may have a positive impact on family accommodation and family environment. Future studies should further clarify the reciprocal influences of pediatric OCD treatment and family factors.

Course of symptom change during anxiety treatment: Reductions in anxiety and depression in patients completing the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management program,"When treating anxious patients with co-occurring depression, research demonstrates that both types of symptoms independently improve. The current analyses examined how reductions in anxiety and depression may be interrelated both during treatment, as well as over time following treatment. Participants were 503 individuals with one or more DSM-IV anxiety disorders who completed a collaborative care anxiety management program. Anxiety and depression were assessed at each treatment session (i.e., session by session data) and also at 6, 12, and 18-month post-baseline assessments (i.e., long-term outcomes data). Mediation analyses examined changes in symptoms in session by session data and long-term outcomes data. Anxiety and depression changed reciprocally in session by session data; change in anxiety mediated change in depression to a greater extent than vice versa. In the long-term outcomes data, change in anxiety mediated change in depression. However, the reverse mediation model of the long-term outcomes period revealed that accounting for changes in depression altered the effect of time on anxiety. Thus, temporal change during active treatment may share similarities with those related to maintaining gains after treatment, although differences arose in the reverse mediation models. Limitations of the methodology and implications of anxiety treatment for depression outcomes are discussed.

Cognitive emotion regulation in patients with schizophrenia: Evidence for effective reappraisal and distraction,"Negative emotions trigger psychotic symptoms, according to a growing body of evidence. Thus, there is a need for effective emotion regulation in schizophrenia. Reappraisal is an effective, cognitive emotion regulation strategy in healthy individuals. However, it is an open research question whether individuals with schizophrenia have difficulties in successfully applying reappraisal. This study experimentally tests the efficacy of reappraisal compared to distraction in patients with schizophrenia and non-clinical controls. An experimental design with group as between-subject factor (non-clinical controls versus patients with schizophrenia) and emotion regulation during anxiety induction as within-subject factor (reappraisal, distraction, no regulation). Seventeen patients with schizophrenia and 27 healthy participants were instructed to respond to anxiety-inducing stimuli by either using reappraisal, distraction or by just watching. Both reappraisal and distraction were effective in down-regulating anxiety, compared to no regulation. The main effect of group and the interaction of emotion regulation condition and group were not significant indicating that the efficacy of both cognitive emotion regulation strategies was independent of group. Patients with schizophrenia are able to apply reappraisal successfully under experimental conditions. Conclusions are limited by the small sample size of this pilot study. Clinical implications for cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis are discussed.

Anxiety sensitivity and mindful attention in terms of anxiety and depressive symptoms and disorders among Latinos in primary care,"The present investigation examined the interactive effects of anxiety sensitivity and mindful attention in relation to anxiety and depressive symptoms and psychopathology among 145 adult Latinos (85.5% female; Mage = 39.9, =10.8 and 98.6% used Spanish as their first language) who attended a community-based primary healthcare clinic. As expected, the interaction between anxiety sensitivity and mindful attention was significantly related to number of mood and anxiety disorders, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms. No significant interaction, however, was evident for panic (anxious arousal) symptoms. The form of the significant interaction indicated that Latinos reporting co-occurring higher levels of anxiety sensitivity and lower levels of mindful attention evinced the greatest levels of anxiety/depressive psychopathology, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms. These data provide novel empirical evidence suggesting that there is clinically-relevant interplay between anxiety sensitivity and mindful attention in regard to a relatively wide array of anxiety and depressive variables among Latinos in a primary care medical setting.

The impact of comorbidity profiles on clinical and psychosocial functioning in childhood anxiety disorders,"Despite the high rates of comorbidity in pediatric anxiety disorder samples, there are few studies that systematically examine differences in clinical and psychosocial functioning between different comorbidity profiles. Those that have, typically combine youth with comorbid conduct problem and those with comorbid ADHD, despite likely differences in the etiology and course of these conditions. This study compared the profile of children with a primary anxiety disorder without comorbidity to those with different comorbidity profiles in a treatment-seeking sample of 111 children recruited from community mental health settings. Anxiety severity and depressive symptomatology did not vary by comorbidity profile. Anxious children without comorbidity had lower levels of attention problems, rule breaking, aggressive and externalizing behaviors compared to the comorbid ADHD and comorbid conduct problems groups, as well as lower levels of functional impairment and social problems. There were some differences in clinical phenomenology and psychosocial functioning between the comorbid ADHD and comorbid conduct problems groups, with the conduct problems group having higher levels of rule breaking, aggressive and externalizing behaviors, as well as higher levels of functional impairment, providing preliminary evidence of separate clinical profiles.

Serum cytokines and anxiety in adolescent depression patients: Gender effect,"The present study compares the serum cytokine levels between adolescent depression patients and healthy controls and assesses correlation between depression, anxiety scores and serum levels of eight cytokines. Study also checked the variation in serum levels with medication status (medication free/naïve vs. patients on medication). Following clinical and psychometric assessment of 77 adolescent (aged 13−18 years) depression patients (49 males and 28 females; 56 medication free/naïve) and 54 healthy controls (25 males, 29 females), eight cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, TGF-β1 and IL-17A {denoted IL-17 throughout}) were measured in serum using ELISA. Depressed adolescents had significantly high levels of IL-2 ( p &lt;0.001) and IL-6 ( p = 0.03) as compared to controls. The female population skewed the result of one cytokine (IL-6) in patients. Anxiety scores showed positive correlation (only in female patients) with IL-1β, IL-10 and negative correlation with TGF-β1 and IL-17. The gender effect in relationship between anxiety and cytokines was not straightforward. On comparing study groups on the medication/naïve status, IL-2 and TGF-β1 showed significant difference between the groups ( p &lt;0.001, p=0.007 higher in medicated). Depression in adolescents was associated with elevation of proinflammatory serum cytokines with a gender bias for females. Anxiety scores correlated negatively with TGF-β1 and IL-17.

Randomized trial on the effectiveness of long- and short-term psychotherapy on psychosocial functioning and quality of life during a 5-year follow-up,"Knowledge is incomplete on whether long-term psychotherapy is more effective than short-term therapy in treating mood and anxiety disorder, when measured by improvements in psychosocial functioning and life quality. In the Helsinki Psychotherapy Study, 326 outpatients with mood or anxiety disorder were randomized to solution-focused therapy (SFT), short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (SPP), or long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (LPP), and followed up for 5 years from the start of treatment. The outcome measures comprised 4 questionnaires on psychosocial functioning, assessing global social functioning (Social Adjustment Scale (SAS-SR), sense of coherence (Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC)), perceived competence (Self-Performance Survey), dispositional optimism (Life Orientation Test (LOT)), and 1 questionnaire assessing quality of life (Life Situation Survey (LSS)). Short-term therapies improved psychosocial functioning and quality of life more than LPP during the first year. The only exceptions were LOT and perceived competence, which did not differ between SPP and LPP. Later in the follow-up, SOC and perceived competence showed significantly more improvement in LPP than in the short-term therapy groups. No direct differences between SFT and SPP were noted. Short-term therapy has consistently more short-term effects on psychosocial functioning and quality of life than LPP, whereas LPP has some additional long-term benefits on psychosocial functioning.

Cognitive risk profiles for anxiety disorders in a high-risk population,"The purpose of the present study was to identify subgroups of participants who may be at particularly high risk for anxiety pathology based on specific combinations of demographic characteristics and higher-order cognitive abilities in a population at disproportionate risk for deficits in cognitive abilities (i.e., smokers within the criminal justice system). Participants ( N = 495) provided demographic information, were administered a semi-structured diagnostic interview, and completed a number of measures assessing cognitive abilities. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) model using signal detection theory indicated that the strongest predictor of anxiety disorder diagnosis was race, with White participants having a 30.6% likelihood of diagnosis and participants in the non-White category (97% of which identified as Black/African American) having a 18.9% likelihood of diagnosis. Interestingly, the individual risk profile associated with the highest probability of having a current anxiety disorder was characterized by White participants with impaired response inhibition (58.6%), and the lowest probability of having a current anxiety disorder was among non-White males (13.9%). The findings, which indicated that White individuals with impaired response inhibition are at a disproportionately high risk for anxiety disorders, suggest a potential target for prevention and intervention.

“I will guide you” the indirect link between overparenting and young adults' adjustment,"This study addresses knowledge gaps regarding family dynamics, and identifies young adults at-risk for psychopathological symptoms. In particular, we examined overparenting and its associations with young adults' adjustment (distress and interpersonal sensitivity). Both direct and indirect relations were assessed, the latter through young adults' relational characteristics (attachment, psychological control perception, and boundaries diffusion perception). Also, the contribution of gender of parents and young adults was addressed. Questionnaires were collected from 89 Jewish-Israeli intact families. Mothers reported significantly more use of overparenting than fathers. More overparenting of fathers had a direct relation with less adjustment in young adults. This direct relation was partially mediated by higher levels of young adults' attachment anxiety (for the dependent variables distress and interpersonal sensitivity) and young adults' perceptions of parental psychological control (for the dependent variable distress). More overparenting of mothers was related to less interpersonal sensitivity for male young adults and for young adults who reported less parental psychological control. This study showed that parenting qualities and their interplay with young adults' relational characteristics continue to play an important role in the lives of young adult offspring. Therefore, clinicians dealing with young adults at risk for, or suffering from, psychopathology, should be attentive to overparenting and its possible implications.

Why are help-seeking subjects at ultra-high risk for psychosis help-seeking?,"In addition to attenuated psychotic symptoms, individuals at high clinical risk of developing psychosis display a wide range of psychopathological features. Some of these may be subjectively perceived as more troubling than others and may therefore be more likely to trigger help-seeking behavior. We aimed at investigating the nature and prevalence of symptoms subjectively considered most distressing by high-risk individuals at the time of their presentation to early recognition services and to determine their impact on baseline and longitudinal functional and clinical outcomes. The clinical records of 221 clients meeting ultra-high risk (UHR) criteria and receiving care at a specialized early intervention service (“Outreach and Support in South London”) between 2001 and 2011 were reviewed. Main outcome measures were reason to seek help as subjectively reported by the clients, comorbid DSM-IV SCID diagnoses, transition to psychosis, psychosocial functioning at baseline and after a median follow-up period of 4.5 years. Affective symptoms, i.e., depression and/or anxiety, were the most commonly reported subjective reasons to seek help (47.1%). Sub-threshold psychotic symptoms were reported by 39.8%. There was no significant association between subjective complaints at presentation and transition to psychosis. However, the group reporting affective symptoms as their main subjective reason to seek help at baseline had a significantly poorer longitudinal outcome in psychosocial functioning relative to the group reporting sub-threshold psychotic symptoms. Assessment of subjective complaints in UHR individuals at initial presentation may help to identify predictors of future functional outcome and tailor treatments accordingly.

Risk factors for incident depression in patients at first acute coronary syndrome,"The association between depression and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is well-established and the first seems to impact meaningfully on cardiac prognosis. Nonetheless only a few studies have evaluated the relationship between incident depression, defined as new cases in patients with no history of depression, and ACS. Therefore the aim of this study is to analyse the risk factors of incident depression in a sample of patients who were presenting their first ACS. 304 consecutive patients were recruited. The presence of major (MD) and minor (md) depression was assessed with the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD), whereas its severity was evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Evaluations were collected both at baseline and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 month follow ups. Out of 304 subjects (80.6% males), MD was diagnosed in 15 (4.9%) and md in 25 patients (8.2%). At baseline risk factors for a post-ACS depressive disorder were being women (MD only), widowed (md only) and having mild anhedonic depressive symptoms few days after the ACS. Clinicians should keep in mind these variables when facing a patient at his/her first ACS, given the detrimental effect of depression on cardiac prognosis.

Obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions and insomnia: The mediating role of anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns,"Existing research on the relationship between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and insomnia is scarce. Moreover, no research has examined potential mechanisms that may account for the observed relations among OCD and sleep difficulties. The cognitive concerns subscale of anxiety sensitivity (AS), which reflects fears of mental incapacitation, has been linked to both symptoms of OCD and insomnia and may serve as a mechanism for increasing sleep disturbance among patients with OCD. The current study examined the relationship between OCD symptoms and insomnia and the potential mediating role of AS cognitive concerns. The sample consisted of 526 individuals recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (Mturk), an online crowdsourcing marketplace. Results revealed distinct associations between the unacceptable thoughts domain of OCD and symptoms of insomnia. Additionally, AS cognitive concerns mediated the relationship between these constructs. Future research should seek to replicate these findings using clinical samples and prospective designs.

Changes in delusional dimensions and emotions over eight weeks of antipsychotic treatment in acute patients,"Delusional experiences can be considered on a range of dimensions including conviction, distress, preoccupation, and disruption, which have been shown to be related to depression and anxiety. This study aimed to test the hypotheses that delusional conviction is less responsive to antipsychotic treatment than delusional distress and preoccupation, and that depression and anxiety reduce alongside improvements in delusional dimensions. Forty acutely ill inpatients with delusions were assessed during their early stage of antipsychotic treatment. Interview data were analysed using mixed models for repeated measures. There was a significant reduction in psychotic symptoms over eight weeks, after controlling for baseline dosage of antipsychotics. We found no differential rate of improvement across delusional dimensions, and all dimensions improved over time. However, conviction ratings remained relatively high throughout the eight weeks. There was no significant improvement in anxiety and depression, and delusional preoccupation covaried with anxiety and depression throughout eight weeks, suggesting a relationship between emotional and delusional processes during the early recovery phase of psychosis.

Safety aid use and social anxiety symptoms: The mediating role of perceived control,"The use of safety aids, cognitive or behavioral strategies used to reduce or cope with anxiety, has emerged as a key construct of interest in anxiety disorders due to their role in the development and maintenance of anxiety symptoms. It has been suggested that individuals with anxiety engage in safety aid use to reduce their anxiety and feel more in control of a situation; however, no studies to date have examined the association between perceived control, that is, perceived level of control over internal events in anxiety provoking situations, and the use of safety aids. The purpose of the present study was to examine the association of perceived control, the use of safety aids, and symptoms of social anxiety. It was predicted that the association between safety aid use and social anxiety symptoms would be mediated by perceived control. This prediction was examined in a large sample of 281 participants. As predicted, perceived control was a significant mediator of the association between the use of safety aids and social anxiety symptoms. This effect remained significant after running a multiple mediation model with distress tolerance added as a competing mediator. Implications for future research are discussed.

Examining the unique relations between anxiety sensitivity factors and suicidal ideation and past suicide attempts,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS) has recently been linked to suicidality. Specifically, AS cognitive concerns has been implicated as a risk factor, and AS physical concerns as a protective factor, for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. However, no studies have used structural equation modeling (SEM) to address issues of skewed suicide variables and bifactor modeling of AS to address the high degree of overlap between the lower-order dimensions of AS that limit interpretation of these past findings. AS, suicidal ideation, past suicide attempts, and depression were assessed in a clinical sample of 267 individuals ( M age = 35.45 years, SD = 16.53; 52.1% female). The global AS and AS cognitive concerns factors were positively, significantly associated with suicidal ideation, though these effects were nonsignificant controlling for depression. The global AS factor was positively, significantly associated with suicide attempts, controlling for depression. The current study demonstrated that the relations between AS and suicidal ideation are not maintained when accounting for depression, suggesting that the relation between AS and suicidal ideation may be mediated by depression. The positive relation between global AS and suicide attempts is consistent with theories positing suicide attempts as a consequence of an inability to cope with intolerable distress.

Do biometric parameters of the hand differentiate schizophrenia from other psychiatric disorders? A comparative evaluation using three mental health modules,"The link between schizophrenia and anomalies in the distal upper limb is well documented. Preliminary studies have identified a number of biometric parameters of the hand by which schizophrenics can be distinguished from matched controls. The current study seeks to determine whether patients with schizophrenia can be singled out from a disparate group of other mental disorders by using the same parameters. We studied three groups, totaling 134 men: 51 diagnosed with schizophrenia, 29 with anxiety and mood disorders, and 54 comprising a control group. Seven parameters were studied: the proximal interphalangeal joint, the eponychia of the middle and ring digits, two dermatoglyphic features, and two constitutional factors. Examiners evaluated the parameters based on photographs and prints. An initial Mann Whitney comparison showed no significant difference between the control group and those identified with anxiety and mood disorders. We therefore accounted for them as a single group. In a discriminant analysis, an overall accuracy of 78.4% was established with a sensitivity of 80.4% (schizophrenics identified correctly) and a specificity of 77.1% (controls identified correctly). These results suggest that the biometric parameters employed may be useful in identifying patients with schizophrenia from a disparate group of other mental disorders.

A randomised trial of nutrient supplements to minimise psychological stress after a natural disaster,"After devastating flooding in southern Alberta in June 2013, we attempted to replicate a New Zealand randomised trial that showed that micronutrient (minerals, vitamins) consumption after the earthquakes of 2010–11 resulted in improved mental health. Residents of southern Alberta were invited to participate in a study on the potential benefit of nutrient supplements following a natural disaster. Fifty-six adults aged 23–66 were randomised to receive a single nutrient (vitamin D, n = 17), a few-nutrients formula (B-Complex, n = 21), or a broad-spectrum mineral/vitamin formula (BSMV, n = 18). Self-reported changes in depression, anxiety and stress were monitored for six weeks. Although all groups showed substantial decreases on all measures, those consuming the B-Complex and the BSMV formulas showed significantly greater improvement in stress and anxiety compared with those consuming the single nutrient, with large effect sizes (Cohen's d range 0.76–1.08). There were no group differences between those consuming the B-Complex and BSMV. The use of nutrient formulas with multiple minerals and/or vitamins to minimise stress associated with natural disasters is now supported by three studies. Further research should be carried out to evaluate the potential population benefit that might accrue if such formulas were distributed as a post-disaster public health measure.

"Relationships between coronary angiography, mood, anxiety and insomnia","The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the anxiety, depression and insomnia levels in the pre- and post-coronary angiography in patients undergoing elective coronary angiography due to suspected coronary artery disease. This prospective cross-sectional study consisted of 120 patients consecutively underwent coronary angiogram (CAG) between January and August 2014 in Departments of Cardiology. The mean age was 57.49 (SD ± 9.73), and 58.3% of the sample were women. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Profile of Mood States Scale, Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Insomnia Severity Index were used. Patients were subsumed under 2 groups as normal and critical according to the presence or the absence of visually severe stenosis in at least one coronary artery. Subjects with significant stenosis had greater mean scores on depression-dejection and anger-hostility sub-scales of the POMS in the post-angiography than pre-angiography scores. We found that older age and having a physical illness significantly contributed to the risk of having significant stenosis in coronary vasculature. Subjects with severe coronary artery stenosis scored higher on depression-dejection and anger-hostility sub-scales at the post-angiography time period relative to pre-angiography scores. Trait and state anxiety levels were found to be moderate higher in both groups.

Anxiety control and metacognitive beliefs mediate the relationship between inflated responsibility and obsessive compulsive symptoms,"Research has indicated that beliefs about inflated responsibility, beliefs about perceived control over anxiety-related events and reactions (anxiety control) and metacognitive beliefs about the need to control thoughts are associated with obsessive compulsive symptoms. In the current study we tested a mediation model of the interactions between these variables in predicting obsessive compulsive symptoms. Thirty-seven individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder and 31 controls completed the following self-report instruments: the Responsibility Attitude Scale, the Anxiety Control Scale, the Beliefs about Need to Control Thoughts sub-scale of the Metacognitions Questionnaire 30, and the Padua Inventory. Mann-Whitney U tests revealed that participants in the clinical group scored significantly higher than those in the non-clinical group on all variables. In the mediation model we found that the relationship between beliefs about inflated responsibility and obsessive compulsive symptoms was fully mediated by anxiety control and beliefs about the need to control thoughts. These findings provide support for the significant role played by beliefs about control in predicting the severity of obsessive compulsive symptoms.

Reactivity to 35% carbon dioxide in bulimia nervosa and panic disorder,"The inhalation of 35% carbon dioxide (CO₂) induces panic and anxiety in people with panic disorder (PD) and in people with various other psychiatric disorders. The anxiogenic effect of CO₂ in people with eating disorders has received sparse attention despite the fact that PD and bulimia nervosa (BN) have several common psychological and neurobiological features. This study compared CO₂-reactivity across three groups of participants: females with BN, females with PD, and female controls without known risk factors for enhanced CO₂-reactivity (e.g., social anxiety disorder, first degree relatives with PD). Reactivity was measured by self-reported ratings of panic symptomatology and subjective anxiety, analyzed as both continuous variables (change from room-air to CO₂) and dichotomous variables (positive versus negative responses to CO₂). Analyses of each outcome measure demonstrated that CO₂-reactivity was similar across the BN and PD groups, and reactivity within each of these two groups was significantly stronger than that in the control group. This is the first study to demonstrate CO₂-hyperreactivity in individuals with BN, supporting the hypothesis that reactivity to this biological paradigm is not specific to PD. Further research would benefit from examining transdiagnostic mechanisms in CO₂-hyperreactivity, such as anxiety sensitivity, which may account for this study's results.

The influence of eating psychopathology on autobiographical memory specificity and social problem-solving,"The primary aim was to examine the influence of subclinical disordered eating on autobiographical memory specificity (AMS) and social problem solving (SPS). A further aim was to establish if AMS mediated the relationship between eating psychopathology and SPS. A non-clinical sample of 52 females completed the autobiographical memory test (AMT), where they were asked to retrieve specific memories of events from their past in response to cue words, and the means-end problem-solving task (MEPS), where they were asked to generate means of solving a series of social problems. Participants also completed the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. After controlling for mood, high scores on the EDI subscales, particularly Drive-for-Thinness, were associated with the retrieval of fewer specific and a greater proportion of categorical memories on the AMT and with the generation of fewer and less effective means on the MEPS. Memory specificity fully mediated the relationship between eating psychopathology and SPS. These findings have implications for individuals exhibiting high levels of disordered eating, as poor AMS and SPS are likely to impact negatively on their psychological wellbeing and everyday social functioning and could represent a risk factor for the development of clinically significant eating disorders.

"Relationships between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dissociation, quality of life, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation among earthquake survivors","Researches have demonstrated that Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most common stress reactions in the face of disasters and significantly associated with a broad range of trauma-induced sequelaes including anxiety, depression, suicidality as well as functional impairments. To date, though many aspects of risk factors with respect to the development and maintenance of PTSD have been addressed, mediating role of dissociation has received relatively less attention. In the present study, we examined relations of PTSD with quality of life, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and mediational effect of pathological dissociation in these connections. 583 subjects most of whom experienced a severe earthquake participated in the study after two years of the disaster. We found that being female, being single, earthquake exposure, and having greater suicidal ideation were significant predictors of PTSD symptom severity. Role-Physical, Bodily-Pain, General Health and Role-Emotional subscales of the SF-36 were inversely associated with PTSD symptom severity. Pathological dissociation significantly mediated the substantial associations between predictors and PTSD symptom clusters. Chronic dissociation appears to put trauma exposed individuals in jeopardy of prolonged posttraumatic reactions by mediating the negative influences of risk factors in the face of experienced earthquake.

Health-related quality of life in posttraumatic stress disorder: 4 years follow-up study of individuals exposed to urban violence,"Evidence suggests that Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is associated with substantially reduced Health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study aimed to explore the impact of PTSD symptoms in HRQoL and its predictors in individuals exposed to urban violence. We follow-up a cohort of 267 individuals exposed to urban violence, derived from an epidemiological survey and clinical cases from an outpatient program of victims of violence, with and without PTSD, by assessing symptoms and other measures at two intervals, approximately 4 years apart. PTSD symptom severity was associated with poorer quality of life at baseline and at follow-up. Higher levels of depression and anxiety, new trauma experiences, more traumas in childhood and more PTSD arousal symptoms were all predictors of lower HRQoL over time. Results strongly suggest the need to assess HRQoL in addition to symptoms in order to assess the true severity of PTSD. These results have implications for the functional recovery in the treatment of PTSD.

Childhood trauma associates with clinical features of schizophrenia in a sample of Chinese inpatients,"This study examined the association between childhood trauma and clinical features, comorbid anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and suicidal and aggressive behaviors in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire—Short Form (CTQ-SF), the Impact of Events Scale—Revised (IES-R), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were administered to 182 Chinese inpatients with schizophrenia. The relationship between the severity and the number of traumatic experiences and clinical features were analyzed. Physical neglect (PN) in childhood was reported in 71.7% of this sample, followed by emotional neglect (EN, 58.6%), sexual abuse (SA, 39.9%), emotional abuse (EA, 31.7%) and physical abuse (PA, 22.2%). Significant negative correlations existed between age of onset and the EA scores. Significant positive correlations were found between the subscores of IES-R, STAI and CTQ-SF. Patients with history of suicidal or aggressive behaviors had significantly higher trauma scores than patients without such behaviors. Exposure to childhood trauma is associated with early age of onset, more PTSD and anxiety symptoms, and history of suicidal and aggressive behaviors. A dose-effect may exist between severity, number of trauma experiences, and clinical features.

Anxiety as a neurodevelopmental disorder in a neuronal subpopulation: Evidence from gene expression data,"The relationship between genes and anxious behavior, is nor linear nor monotonic. To address this problem, we analyzed with a meta-analytic method the literature data of the behavior of knockout mice, retrieving 33 genes whose deletion was accompanied by increased anxious behavior, 34 genes related to decreased anxious behavior and 48 genes not involved in anxiety. We correlated the anxious behavior resulting from the deletion of these genes to their brain expression, using the Allen Brain Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The main finding is that the genes accompanied, after deletion, by a modification of the anxious behavior, have lower expression in the cerebral cortex, the amygdala and the ventral striatum. The lower expression level was putatively due to their selective presence in a neuronal subpopulation. This difference was replicated also using a database of human gene expression, further showing that the differential expression pertained, in humans, a temporal window of young postnatal age (4 months up to 4 years) but was not evident at fetal or adult human stages. Finally, using gene enrichment analysis we also show that presynaptic genes are involved in the emergence of anxiety and postsynaptic genes in the reduction of anxiety after gene deletion.

Effect of intranasal oxytocin administration on psychiatric symptoms: A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies,"[Retraction notice: A retraction for this article was reported in Vol 263 of Psychiatry Research (see record 2018-17713-053). This article has been removed: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/ article-withdrawal). This article has been retracted at the request of the authors and Editor-in-Chief of the journal. It was brought to the authors' attention that there were several significant data analytic errors linked to the data entry and the software program that was used in the published meta-analysis comparing the effect of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo administration on psychiatric symptoms. Correcting these errors changed the main result of this study. The authors greatly apologize to the journal, the reviewers, and readers for the errors in the original article, and would like to thank the readers who brought the errors to their attention.] Clinical trials of intranasal administration of oxytocin for treating psychiatric problems have yielded mixed results. To conduct a quantitative review of placebo-controlled clinical trials of intranasally-administered oxytocin (OT) for psychiatric symptoms, manual and electronic searches using PubMed and PsycINFO were conducted. Of 1828 entries, 16 placebo-controlled studies totaling 330 participants were included in the analysis. The overall placebo-controlled effect size was moderately strong (Hedges' g = 0.67) and robust as suggested by the fail-safe N and funnel plot analysis. OT reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety, autism/repetitive behaviors, psychotic symptoms, and general psychopathology. In the combined sample, symptom reduction was moderated by frequency of administration. Publication year and diagnostic category did not moderate the effect of OT on the clinical outcome measures. We conclude that intranasal administration of OT is a potentially useful intervention for reducing psychiatric symptoms. However, more studies are needed to determine the best treatment target and to identify the mechanism of treatment change.

Cognitive flexibility differentiates young adults exhibiting obsessive-compulsive behaviors from controls,"The National Institute of Mental Health has proposed a shift toward classifying clusters of disorders on the basis of underlying biomarkers and neurological correlates. The present study sought to determine whether cognitive flexibility represents one such construct underlying obsessive-compulsive behaviors (OCBs), a cluster of behaviors characteristic of OCD and other body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs), including trichotillomania, pathological skin picking, nail biting, and tic disorders. One-hundred and twenty-four undergraduate students completed the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales, Padua Inventory—Washington State University Revision, Massachusetts General Hospital—Hairpulling Scale, Skin Picking Scale, and an Intradimensional/Extradimensional Shift (IDED) Test. Analyses were performed using a subsample of participants who met criteria for inclusion in the OCB group and a control group ( N = 56). Results indicated that young adults in the OCB group demonstrated significantly poorer performance on the IDED compared to controls. However, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that increased deficits in cognitive flexibility failed to predict worsened OCB severity—as assessed via a composite score. These results suggest that while cognitive flexibility differentiates those exhibiting OCBs from controls, it does not appear to be related to OCB severity. Future research is needed to replicate these results in larger clinical samples.

"Diurnal cortisol rhythm: Associated with anxiety and depression, or just an indication of lack of energy?","Dysregulation of hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal-activity has been associated with low back pain (LBP). The underlying mechanisms are not fully explained, but psychological mechanisms are considered important. In this study we examine the association between psychiatric disorders/symptoms measured with different instruments, and cortisol in a population with LBP. Participants ( n = 305) sick-listed 2–10 months due to non-specific LBP were included in the study. The screening instruments were the MINI-interview, HADS and HSCL-25. Saliva cortisol were measured on 2 consecutive days; at awakening, 30min later, at 15:00h and 22:00h. Results showed no associations between any of the main diagnostic categories from the MINI-interview, or anxiety/depression measured with HADS or HSCL-25 and cortisol. However, significant associations were found between low cortisol awakening response, low cortisol slope during the day and the somatization scale from HSCL-25 (dizziness or lack of energy, lack of sexual interest, the feeling that everything requires substantial efforts, difficulties to fall asleep, headache). The results indicate that cortisol, may not be directly associated with psychopathology, such as anxiety and depression, but instead are associated with one dimension of the psychopathology, namely lack of energy. This could help explain the inconsistency in the literature, and it should be explored further.

"Fermented foods, neuroticism, and social anxiety: An interaction model","Animal models and clinical trials in humans suggest that probiotics can have an anxiolytic effect. However, no studies have examined the relationship between probiotics and social anxiety. Here we employ a cross-sectional approach to determine whether consumption of fermented foods likely to contain probiotics interacts with neuroticism to predict social anxiety symptoms. A sample of young adults ( N = 710, 445 female) completed self-report measures of fermented food consumption, neuroticism, and social anxiety. An interaction model, controlling for demographics, general consumption of healthful foods, and exercise frequency, showed that exercise frequency, neuroticism, and fermented food consumption significantly and independently predicted social anxiety. Moreover, fermented food consumption also interacted with neuroticism in predicting social anxiety. Specifically, for those high in neuroticism, higher frequency of fermented food consumption was associated with fewer symptoms of social anxiety. Taken together with previous studies, the results suggest that fermented foods that contain probiotics may have a protective effect against social anxiety symptoms for those at higher genetic risk, as indexed by trait neuroticism. While additional research is necessary to determine the direction of causality, these results suggest that consumption of fermented foods that contain probiotics may serve as a low-risk intervention for reducing social anxiety.

Posttraumatic stress disorder's dysphoria dimension and relations with generalized anxiety disorder symptoms,"The present study investigated symptom relations between two highly comorbid disorders—posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)—by exploring their underlying dimensions. Based on theory and prior empirical research it was expected that the dysphoria factor of PTSD would be more highly related to GAD. As part of a longitudinal project of mental health among Ohio National Guard Soldiers, 1266 subjects were administered the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted to examine two models of PTSD and to determine which PTSD factors were more related to the GAD factor. The results indicate that the GAD factor was significantly more highly correlated with PTSD's dysphoria factor than with all other PTSD factors, including PTSD's reexperiencing factor, avoidance factor, and hyperarousal factor. Results indicate GAD was not significantly more highly correlated with numbing than most other factors of PTSD. The results are consistent with prior research. Implications of the results are discussed in regards to PTSD in DSM-5, comorbidity and diagnostic specificity.

Gender determines cortisol and alpha-amylase responses to acute physical and psychosocial stress in patients with borderline personality disorder,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by affective instability, unstable relationships, and identity disturbance. We measured salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and salivary cortisol levels in all participants during exposure to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and an electric stimulation stress. Seventy-two BPD patients were compared with 377 age- and gender-matched controls. The State and Trait versions of the Spielberger Anxiety Inventory test (STAI-S and STAI-T, respectively), the Profile of Mood State (POMS) tests, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Depression and Anxiety Cognition Scale (DACS) were administered to participants before electrical stimulation. Following TSST exposure, salivary cortisol levels significantly decreased in female patients and significantly increased in male patients compared with controls. POMS tension–anxiety, depression–dejection, anger–hostility, fatigue, and confusion scores were significantly increased in BPD patients compared with controls. In contrast, vigor scores were significantly decreased in BPD patients relative to controls. Furthermore, STAI-T and STAI-S anxiety scores and BDI scores were significantly increased in BPD patient compared with controls. DACS scores were significantly increased in BPD patient compared with controls. Different stressors (e.g., psychological or physical) induced different responses in the HPA and SAM systems in female or male BPD patients.

Therapist competence and therapeutic alliance are important in the treatment of health anxiety (hypochondriasis),"The role of treatment delivery factors (i.e., therapist adherence, therapist competence, and therapeutic alliance) is rarely investigated in psychotherapeutic treatment for health anxiety. This study aimed to investigate the role of the assessment perspective for the evaluation of treatment delivery factors and their relevance for treatment outcome. Therapist adherence, therapist competence, and therapeutic alliance were evaluated by independent raters, therapists, patients, and supervisors in 68 treatments. Patients with severe health anxiety (hypochondriasis) were treated with cognitive therapy or exposure therapy. Treatment outcome was assessed with a standardized interview by independent diagnosticians. A multitrait–multimethod analysis revealed a large effect for the assessment perspective of therapist adherence, therapist competence, and therapeutic alliance. The rater perspective was the most important for the prediction of treatment outcome. Therapeutic alliance and therapist competence accounted for 6% of the variance of treatment outcome while therapist adherence was not associated with treatment outcome. Therapist competence was only indirectly associated with treatment outcome, mediated by therapeutic alliance. Both therapeutic alliance and therapist competence demonstrated to be important treatment delivery factors in psychotherapy for health anxiety. A stronger consideration of those processes during psychotherapy for health anxiety might be able to improve psychotherapy outcome.

The impact of sensation seeking on the relationship between attention deficit/hyperactivity symptoms and severity of internet addiction risk,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of attention deficit/hyperactivity symptoms (ADHS) with severity of Internet addiction risk (SIAR), while controlling the effects of variables such as depression, anxiety, anger, sensation seeking and lack of assertiveness among university students. Cross-sectional online self-report survey was conducted in two universities among a representative sample of 582 Turkish university students. The students were assessed through the Addiction Profile Index Internet Addiction Form Screening Version (BAPINT-SV), the Psychological Screening Test for Adolescents (PSTA) and the Adult Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder Self-Report Scale (ASRS). The participants were classified into the two groups as those with high risk of Internet addiction (HRIA) (11%) and those with low risk of Internet addiction (IA) (89%). The mean age was lower in the group with HRIA, whereas depression, anxiety, sensation seeking, anger, lack of assertiveness and ADHS scores were higher in this group. Lastly, a hierarchical regression analysis suggested that severity of sensation seeking and ADHS, particularly attention deficiency, predicted SIAR. The severity of sensation seeking and ADHS, particularly attention deficit symptoms, are important for SIAR. Awareness of sensation seeking among those with high ADHS may be important in prevention and management of IA among university students.

Revisiting attentional processing of non-emotional cues in social anxiety: A specific impairment for the orienting network of attention,"People with social anxiety disorder (SAD) exhibit an attentional bias for threat (AB). Nevertheless, the focus on AB for emotional stimuli has led to neglect the exploration of basic attention deficits for non-emotional material among SAD patients. This study aimed to investigate the integrity of the attentional system in SAD. The Attention Network Test was used to precisely explore attentional deficits, and centrally the differential deficit across the three attentional networks, namely alerting (allowing to achieve and maintain a state of alertness), orienting (allowing to select information from sensory input by engaging or disengaging attention to one stimulus among others and/or shifting the attentional resources from one stimulation to another), and executive control (involving the top-down control of attention and allowing to resolve response conflicts). Twenty-five patients with SAD were compared to 25 matched controls. SAD patients exhibited a specific impairment for the orienting network ( p &lt; 0.001) but preserved performance for the alerting and executive networks. Complementary analyses revealed that this impairment may result from a faster attentional engagement to task-irrelevant material. The orienting impairment was highly correlated with the intensity of the social anxiety symptoms, but did not correlate either with trait-anxiety, state-anxiety, or depressive symptoms.

Screening instruments for a population of older adults: The 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7),"Screening tools that appropriately detect older adults' mental disorders are of great public health importance. The present study aimed to establish cutoff scores for the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress (K10) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scales when screening for depression and anxiety. We used data from participants ( n = 1811) in the Enquête sur la Santé des Aînés-Service study. Depression and anxiety were measured using DSM-V and DSM-IV criteria. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis provided an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.767 and 0.833 for minor and for major depression when using K10. A cutoff of 19 was found to balance sensitivity (0.794) and specificity (0.664) for minor depression, whereas a cutoff of 23 was found to balance sensitivity (0.692) and specificity (0.811) for major depression. When screening for an anxiety with GAD-7, ROC analysis yielded an AUC of 0.695; a cutoff of 5 was found to balance sensitivity (0.709) and specificity (0.568). No significant differences were found between subgroups of age and gender. Both K10 and GAD-7 were able to discriminate between cases and non-cases when screening for depression and anxiety in an older adult population of primary care service users.

Associations between attachment and psychopathology dimensions in a large sample of patients with psychosis,"Attachment theory is a powerful theoretical framework that complements and extents current models psychosis. We tested the hypothesis that attachment anxiety and avoidance are differentially associated with the severity of positive, negative and general psychopathology symptoms in patients with a diagnosis of psychosis. Five hundred patients with DSM-IV or ICD-10 diagnoses of psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, schizoaffective or non-affective psychosis) from independent samples from Netherlands, United Kingdom and Israel completed the Relationship Questionnaire. Psychopathology was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale. We used both categorical and dimensional approach to attachment data, which were analyzed using ANOVA with post-hoc tests, Pearson's correlations and multiple regression analysis. The conservative level of statistical significance was established ( p &lt; 0.001) to control for multiple testing. After adjustment for possible confounders, attachment anxiety predicted severity of positive symptoms as well as affective symptoms. Both attachment anxiety and avoidance were associated with severity of hallucinations and persecution Contrary to predictions, attachment avoidance was not associated with overall scores for negative symptoms, although there was some evidence of relatively weaker association between avoidance and social and emotional withdrawal.

Clinical presentation and pharmacotherapy response in social anxiety disorder: The effect of etiological beliefs,"Therapies for social anxiety disorder (SAD) leave many patients symptomatic at the end of treatment and little is known about predictors of treatment response. This study investigated the predictive relationship of patients' etiological attributions to initial clinical features and response to pharmacotherapy. One hundred thirty-seven individuals seeking treatment for SAD received 12 weeks of open treatment with paroxetine. Participants completed the Attributions for the Etiology of Social Anxiety Scale at baseline in addition to measures of social anxiety and depression at baseline and over the course of treatment. A latent class analysis suggested four profiles of etiological beliefs about one's SAD that may be characterized as: Familial Factors, Need to be Liked, Bad Social Experiences, and Diffuse Beliefs . Patients in the more psychosocially-driven classes, Need to be Liked and Bad Social Experiences , had the most severe social anxiety and depression at baseline. Patients in the Familial Factors class, who attributed their SAD to genetic, biological, and early life experiences, had the most rapid response to paroxetine.These results highlight the effect of biological and genetically-oriented etiological beliefs on pharmacological intervention, have implications for person-specific treatment selection, and identify potential points of intervention to augment treatment response.

Prevalence and correlates of co-prescribing psychotropic medications with long-term opioid use nationally in the Veterans Health Administration,"We used national data for fiscal year 2012 to examine demographic, psychiatric and medical diagnoses, indications for psychotropics, and service use correlates of psychotropic medication fills in Veterans with at least 10 opioid prescriptions during the year (the highest 29% of opioid users); and whether the Veteran was treated in a specialty mental health clinic. Of the 328,398 Veterans who filled at least 10 opioid prescriptions, 77% also received psychotropics, of whom: 74% received antidepressants, 55% anxiolytics/sedatives/hypnotics, and 26% three or more classes of psychotropic medications. Altogether, 87% had a psychiatric or medical indication; and 54% received mental health treatment. Veterans treated in a mental health clinic were prescribed more psychotropics and were more likely to have a documented psychiatric or medical indication than those treated solely in other settings. Indicated psychiatric diagnoses were the strongest predictors of specific class of psychotropics prescribed; anxiety disorder and insomnia were most strongly associated with anxioloytics/sedatives/hypnotics receipt. Since psychotropics and opioids can produce harmful side effects, especially when combined, and since they are likely prescribed by separate providers in different settings, coordinated consideration of the risks and benefits of co-prescribing these medications may be needed, along with further study of related adverse events.

We aimed to: (1) prospectively observe the actual development of school refusal behavior according to a history of separation anxiety symptoms (SAS) and (2) explore factors for predicting school refusal behavior in children who were just beginning primary school. The participants were 277 children, aged 6–7 years, who were expected to enter primary school in 2 months. The parents were surveyed about the child's history of SAS and their behavior. The children were questioned about anxiety symptoms. The children were surveyed about whether school refusal behavior developed or not after they entered primary school. Of the 248 children who responded to the follow-up survey, 7.66% of children met the criteria for school refusal behavior during the 3 months after entering school. We found no significant differences in the occurrence of school refusal behavior according to the children's SAS history. Familial risk factors for school refusal behavior included low parental educational level and a working mother. School refusal behavior by first graders cannot be fully explained by the expression of SAS and could be implicated in a more complex psychopathology.

"Specialized psychological and pharmacological treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder throughout the lifespan: A special series by the Accreditation Task Force (ATF) of the Canadian Institute for Obsessive Compulsive Disorders (CIOCD, www.ciocd.ca)","The World Health Organization ranks obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) among the leading causes of worldwide medical disability. Affecting approximately 3% of the population, OCD, with its damaging effect on psychosocial function, is among the most severe and impairing of mental disorders. In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5), OCD and related disorders form a separate classification, consistent with convergent research that indicates OCD is distinct from anxiety disorders in psychopathology and treatment requirements. Although evidence-based treatments have been developed for OCD, these are not accessible to many sufferers. Timely evidence-based treatment is recommended to avoid unnecessary progression to chronicity, disability, and intransigence of symptoms. Improvement in existing training models is needed to disseminate advanced specialty clinical skills to optimize illness recovery. This special series by The Canadian Institute for Obsessive Compulsive Disorders (CIOCD) Accreditation Task Force (ATF) critically reviews evidence-based psychological and pharmacological treatments for OCD throughout the lifespan.

Prevalence and comorbidity of eating disorders among a community sample of adolescents: 2-year follow-up,"The previous literature about comorbidity between eating disorders (ED) and other DSM-IV psychiatric disorders in adolescence has employed cross-sectional studies with clinical samples, where the comorbid disorders were diagnosed retrospectively. The present study aims to overcome these limitations by the analysis of comorbidity in a community population during 2-year follow-up. A semi-structured interview was applied to a teenager sample. Firstly, a cross-sectional and non-randomized study on psychiatric morbidity was conducted with 993 teenagers between the ages of 12 and 16 from five schools. Secondly, 326 students between 14 and 17 years old of one school were reassessed 2 years later in order to detect ED new cases and find associations with previous psychiatric disorders. The ED prevalence was 3.6%. Cross-sectional analysis revealed that 62.9% of individuals with an ED had comorbid disorders: anxiety disorders (51.4%), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (31.4%), oppositional defiant disorder (11.4%), and obsessive compulsive disorder (8.6%). Prospective longitudinal analysis showed an ED incidence rate of 2.76% over the course of 2 years. 22.2% of new cases had received previous psychiatric diagnoses, of which all were anxiety disorders. Thus, ED exhibited a high comorbidity rate among adolescent populations and anxiety disorders were the most common comorbid diagnosis.

"Social anxiety disorder in recent onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders: The relation with symptomatology, anxiety, and social rank","Social anxiety disorder (SAD) represents a common comorbidity in schizophrenia, but questions remain regarding how this comorbidity is related to symptomatology and self-perceptions. Forty-two patients with recent-onset schizophrenia were evaluated for SAD, and assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), as well as the Social Comparison Scale (SCS), which assessed how participants perceived themselves in relation with others (i.e. social rank). Eighteen patients met criteria for SAD (SZ+) while 24 patients did not (SZ−). Analysis of symptoms using a five-factor model of the PANSS revealed that the SZ− group had more severe symptoms than SZ+ on the Cognitive/Disorganization factor. Further analyses of individual symptoms demonstrated that the SZ− group was more affected in attention, abstract thinking, and cognitive disorganization (Cognitive/Disorganization symptoms), while the SZ+ group was more severely affected in anxiety, suspiciousness/persecution, and active social avoidance. Interestingly, severity of social anxiety symptom ratings correlated with certain PANSS symptoms only in the SZ− group. Perception of social rank, which was reduced in SZ+, displayed a trend level correlation with the positive symptoms in SZ−. Overall, the results suggest that SZ+ and SZ− may have different clinical profiles that could be important to consider when tailoring treatments for these patients.

Heart rate and respiratory response to doxapram in patients with panic disorder,"Panic disorder (PD) is characterized by anticipatory anxiety and panic, both causing physiological arousal. We investigated the differential responses between anticipatory anxiety and panic in PD and healthy controls (HC). Subjects (15 PD and 30 HC) received an injection of a respiratory stimulant, doxapram, with a high rate of producing panic attacks in PD patients, or an injection of saline. PD subjects had significantly higher scores in anxiety and panic symptoms during both conditions. Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) indices showed higher sympathetic activity (LF) during anticipatory anxiety and panic states, an increase in the ratio of LF/HF during the anticipatory and panic states and a decrease in parasympathetic (HF) component in PD patients. During doxapram PD subjects increased their LF/HF ratio while HC had a reduction in LF/HF. Parasympathetic component of HRV was lower during anticipatory anxiety in PD. In general, PD showed greater sympathetic and psychological responses related to anxiety and sensations of dyspnea, reduced parasympathetic responses during anticipatory and panic states, but no differences in respiratory response.

Hyperprolactinaemia: Psychological aspects and menstrual attitudes of women with schizophrenia,"Hyperprolactinemia is one of the most frequent consequences of antipsychotic medication, and it can have many adverse clinical effects, like infertility, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, menstrual irregularity, osteopenia and osteoporosis. Some researchers related high prolactin (PRL) levels to hostility, depression and anxiety. This study investigated the psychological effects and the attitudes towards menstruation among women who suffer from antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinaemia.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy vs. Psycho-education for patients with major depression who did not achieve remission following antidepressant treatment,"Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) showed efficacy for currently depressed patients. However, most of the available studies suffer from important methodological shortcomings, including the lack of adequate control groups. The present study aims to compare MBCT with a psycho-educational control group designed to be structurally equivalent to the MBCT program but excluding the main putative “active ingredient” of MBCT (i.e., mindfulness meditation practice) for the treatment of patients with major depression (MD) who did not achieve remission following at least 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Out of 106 screened subjects, 43 were randomized to receive MBCT or psycho-education and were prospectively followed for 26 weeks. MD severity was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Measures of anxiety, mindfulness, and quality of life were also included. All assessments were performed at baseline, 4, 8, 17 and 26-weeks. Both HAM-D and BDI scores, as well as quality of life and mindfulness scores, showed higher improvements, which were particularly evident over the long-term period, in the MBCT group than in the psycho-education group. Although limited by a small sample size, the results of this study suggest the superiority of MBCT over psycho-education for non-remitted MD subjects.

"Progress in mind: Focus on alcohol use disorders, an Elsevier resource centre","Harmful use of alcohol is one of the top five risks for burden of disease globally and in Europe; in 2012, 3.3 million net deaths (approximately 6% of all global deaths) were attributable to this risk factor. It is also linked to the development of a wide spectrum of alcohol use disorders, ranging from mild manifestations to a severe disease known as alcohol dependence. Alcohol dependence is a progressive, chronic, and relapsing brain disease resulting from the prolonged effects of alcohol on the brain. Alcohol dependence imposes a significant societal burden, with indirect societal costs reaching up to 0.64% of European countries' annual gross domestic product. With these facts in mind, it is important to recognize and manage alcohol dependence. Although the biological mechanisms behind the development of alcohol dependence are not fully known, factors that have been shown to influence its development include genetic predisposition, psychological problems, and social interactions. Alcohol use has also been linked to the development of hypertension, liver cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis, multiple types of cancer, and psychiatric comorbidities such as depression and anxiety disorders. With such severe effects on both individuals and society, it is important to recognize the characteristic signs and symptoms of alcohol dependence and explore new ways to better manage patients with this brain disease. Effective treatment approaches for alcohol dependence include biological, behavioral, and social components addressing the multiple aspects of this disease. Comprehensive, educational platforms in which to explore the many facets of this disease such as the Progress in Mind: Focus on Alcohol Use Disorders Resource Centre , will provide clinicians with the tools necessary for recognizing patients with alcohol dependence and managing their disease along with related comorbidities.

In the original article, there are errors in Tables 2 and 5 are concerning the SQ-48 subscale ""Vitality"", which items should be inverted. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-07248-038). Self-report measures of psychological distress or psychopathology are widely used and can be easily implemented as psychiatric screening tools. Positive psychological constructs such as vitality/optimism and work functioning have scarcely been incorporated. We aimed to develop and validate a psychological distress instrument, including measures of vitality and work functioning. A patient sample with suspected depressive, anxiety, and somatoform disorders ( N = 242) and a reference sample of the general population ( N = 516) filled in the 48-item Symptom Questionnaire (SQ-48) plus a battery of observer-rated and self-report scales (MINI Plus, MADR, BAS, INH, BSI), using a web-based ROM programme. The resulting SQ-48 is multidimensional and includes the following nine subscales: Depression (MOOD, six items), Anxiety (ANXI, six items), Somatization (SOMA, seven items), Agoraphobia (AGOR, four items), Aggression (AGGR, four items), Cognitive problems (COGN, five items), Social Phobia (SOPH, five items), Work functioning (WORK, five items), and Vitality (VITA, six items). The results showed good internal consistency as well as good convergent and divergent validity. The SQ-48 is meant to be available in the public domain for Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) and can be used as a screening/ monitoring tool in clinical settings (psychiatric and non-psychiatric), as a benchmark tool, or for research purposes.

"Mental disorders and thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability for suicide","Nearly all mental disorders increase suicide risk; however, some better predict ideation versus attempts. The interpersonal theory of suicide provides a framework to understand these relationships, via the constructs of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability. The current study examined the relationships between various mental disorders and theory constructs among 997 adult outpatients, controlling for sex and age. Disorders generally symptomatically associated with social withdrawal or potential liability to others (i.e., depressive and bipolar disorders, social phobia, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, certain drug dependence) were uniquely positively associated with thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. Disorders associated with potential exposure to painful and provocative events (i.e., posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, certain drug use) were associated with increased acquired capability. Notably, alcohol use disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder subtypes, and panic/agoraphobia were negatively associated with thwarted belongingness or perceived burdensomeness; avoidant personality disorder, and certain anxiety disorders and drug use disorders, were associated with decreased acquired capability. Importantly, disorders associated with both thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness may place individuals at greatest risk for suicide if acquired capability develops. Implications for comorbidity and suicide risk assessment and treatment are discussed.

Decreased serotonin &lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt; receptor responses in male patients with schizophrenia,"Serotonin (5-HT) 2C receptors in brain affect psychosis, reward, substance abuse, anxiety, other behaviors, appetite, body temperature, and other physiological measures. They also have been implicated in antipsychotic drug efficacy and side effects. We previously reported that the hyperthermia following administration of MK-212, a predominantly 5-HT 2C receptor agonist, was diminished in a small sample of patients with schizophrenia (SCH), suggesting decreased 5-HT 2C receptor responsiveness. We have now studied the responses to oral MK-212 and placebo in a larger sample of unmedicated male SCH ( n = 69) and normal controls (CON) ( n = 33), and assessed the influence of comorbid substance abuse (SA) on oral body temperature, behavioral responses, etc. The placebo-adjusted oral body temperature response to MK-212 was significantly lower in SCH compared to CON and not significantly different between the SCH with or without SA. Some behavioral responses to MK-212, e.g. self-rated feelings of increased anxiety, depression and decreased calmness, or good overall feeling, were significantly lower in the SCH patients compared to CON. These results add to the evidence for diminished 5-HT 2C receptor responsiveness in SCH patients compared to CON and are consistent with reported association of HTR2C polymorphisms, leading to decreased expression or function of the HTR2C in patients with SCH.

Assessing cognitive impairment using PROMIS &lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; applied cognition-abilities scales in a medical outpatient sample,"Having a brief, standardized, reliable, and valid self-rated test of perceived cognitive functioning could be beneficial in psychiatry clinical practice, research, and clinical trials. The PROMIS® Applied Cognition-Abilities scales were developed, evaluated, and distributed by the National Institutes of Health to measure perceived cognitive functioning. This study examines several aspects of the reliability and validity of the PROMIS® Applied Cognition-Abilities eight and four-item scales in a sample of adult and older adult medical outpatients ( N = 148). Internal consistency reliability was high for both PROMIS® cognition scales. The brief four-item scale was highly correlated with the full eight-item scale ( r s = 0.98). There was a moderate correlation between the PROMIS® Applied Cognition-Abilities scales and measures of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7). Subgroups of participants screening positively for depression or anxiety reported significantly worse cognitive functioning than medical controls, with large effect sizes. The base rates of individual items endorsed by depressed, anxious, and control participants are reported. More than 42% of depressed and anxious participants reported problems with their memory and concentration compared with fewer than 8% of medical controls. The field would benefit from studies using the PROMIS® Applied Cognition-Abilities scales in more demographically diverse samples and with other established measures of cognition.

The Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire in Bipolar I and II disorders: A preliminary report,"Patients with bipolar disorder have tendencies of higher impulsivity and sensation seeking, they might contribute differently to the emotional states of bipolar I (BD I) and II (BD II). We administered the Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ), the Plutchik–van Praag Depression Inventory (PVP), the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), and the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32) in 23 patients with BD I, 22 BD II, and 64 healthy volunteers. Both BD I and II scored higher on ZKPQ Impulsive sensation seeking (and its Impulsivity facet), Neuroticism–anxiety and Aggression–hostility, and on PVP and HCL-32 scales than controls did; BD I scored higher on MDQ and General sensation seeking facet than controls did. Compared to BD II, BD I scored higher on Impulsive sensation seeking (and General sensation seeking) and on MDQ. Moreover, General sensation seeking predicted MDQ, and Activity predicted HCL-32 in BD I. Aggression–hostility predicted HCL-32 in BD II. General sensation seeking predicted MDQ and HCL-32, and together with Neuroticism–anxiety, predicted PVP in controls. Our study suggests that Impulsive sensation seeking, and its General sensation seeking facet might help to delineate the two types of bipolar disorder.

"Major depressive disorder and smoking relapse among adults in the united states: A 10-year, prospective investigation","This study investigated the relation between major depressive disorder (MDD) and smoking relapse in the U.S. over a 10-year period. Data were drawn from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) Survey Waves I &amp; II. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the associations between past-year MDD in 1994, past-year MDD in 2005 and persistent depression (1994 and 2005) and risk of smoking relapse in 2005 among former smokers, adjusting for demographics, anxiety disorders, and substance use problems and smoking characteristics. Among former smokers, MDD in 1994, compared to without MDD in 1994, was associated with significantly increased odds of smoking relapse by 2005. Current MDD in 2005 was associated with an even stronger risk of relapse in 2005 and persistent depression even more strongly predicted relapse by 2005. These associations remained significant and were not substantially attenuated by the covariates. In conclusion, MDD appears to confer long-term vulnerability to smoking relapse among adults in the general population. These results suggest interventions for smoking cessation should include screening and treatment for MDD if programs are to be optimally effective at achieving initial quit success as well as enduring abstinence.

Baseline prevalence of Axis I diagnosis in the Ohio Army National Guard,"The goal of this study is to determine the pre-existing lifetime and current prevalence of DSM-IV Axis I disorders within the Ohio Army National Guard (OHARNG). Data was analyzed from the clinical subsample of the Ohio Army National Guard Mental Health Initiative (OHARNG MHI). Five hundred participants were provided with an in-depth clinical assessment using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID). Logistic regression examined the relationship between Axis I disorders and the number of deployments and gender. Prevalence of at least one DSM-IV lifetime disorder was 66.2%; substance use disorders were 52.2%, followed by mood disorders (30.0%) and anxiety disorders (22.0%). Prevalence of at least one current disorder was 24.8%; anxiety disorders (13.2%), mood disorders (7.6%), and substance use disorders (7.0%) were most frequent. Number of deployments was associated with PTSD (OR = 8.27, 95% CI 2.10–32.59, p = 0.003), alcohol use disorder (OR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.07–2.92, p = 0.025), and any substance use disorder (OR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.12–3.05, p = 0.016). Gender (OR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.10–3.73, p =0.024) was associated with any mood disorder. The results provide baseline information on the most prevalent mental disorders within the OHARNG.

The association of healthcare seeking behavior for anxiety and depression among patients with lower urinary tract symptoms: A nationwide population-based study,"Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) have a negative impact on the quality of life, and may relate to anxiety and depression. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that LUTS are associated with anxiety and depression using a nationwide population-based database in Taiwan. Data were obtained from a random population sample of about one million enrollees in the National Health Insurance program from 2001 to 2009, and consisted of 22,980 LUTS patients and 45,960 matched controls. The records of healthcare seeking for anxiety and depression were collected 2 years before and after the diagnosis of LUTS. The results showed that patients with LUTS had a significantly higher prevalence of anxiety or depression than the matched controls (11.45% vs. 5.72%). After controlling for sociodemographic variables and other major systemic diseases, the odds ratios for anxiety, depression, either anxiety or depression, and both anxiety and depression, were 2.05, 2.19, 2.14, and 2.56, respectively. There was an association between LUTS and the stress-related common mental disorders, and there seemed to be an additive effect of anxiety and depression on the association with LUTS. These findings imply a psychological role in the pathogenesis or sequelae of LUTS.

Anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns predict suicide risk,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS) cognitive concerns, which reflects fears of mental incapacitation, have been previously associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. The first study aim was to replicate and extend upon previous research by investigating whether AS cognitive concerns can discriminate between those at low risk versus high risk for suicidal behavior. Secondly, we aimed to test the incremental predictive power of AS cognitive concerns above and beyond known suicide risk factors (i.e., thwarted belongingness and insomnia). The sample consisted of 106 individuals (75% meeting current criteria for an Axis I disorder) recruited from the community. Results revealed that AS cognitive concerns were a robust predictor of elevated suicide risk after covarying for negative affect, whereas AS social and physical concerns were not. Those with high, relative to low, AS cognitive scores were 3.67 times more likely to be in the high suicide risk group. Moreover, AS cognitive concerns significantly predicted elevated suicide risk above and beyond relevant suicide risk factors. Results of this study add to a growing body of the literature demonstrating a relationship between AS cognitive concerns and increased suicidality. Incorporating AS cognitive concerns amelioration protocols into existing interventions for suicidal behavior may be beneficial.

Validation of four measures of mental health against depression and generalized anxiety in a community based sample,"There is a need to validate screening measures of affective and generalized anxiety disorders for use in epidemiological surveys of mental health in the general population. This study examined the diagnostic accuracy of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scales (GAS, GDS) and the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) Mental Health Component Summary Scale (MCS-12) in a population based longitudinal study in Australia. We report analyses of two narrow age birth cohorts in the Personality and Total Health (PATH) through life study (ages 32–36 and 52–58). Depressive episodes (severe, moderate, and mild), dysthymia and generalized anxiety disorder were diagnosed according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria using the World Health Organisation (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) as a criterion. All scales had high concordance with their target 30-day diagnoses, with area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) ranging between 0.85 and 0.90. The PHQ-9, GDS, GAS and MCS-12 were all valid instruments for identifying possible cases of depression and anxiety, and assessing the severity of these common mental disorders in the general population. We report recommended cut-points for each scale, though note that the optimal cut-point on mental health screening instruments may vary depending on the context of test administration.

Coping styles: Longitudinal development from ages 17 to 33 and associations with psychiatric disorders,"Relationships of coping styles to maturation, sex, and psychiatric diagnoses are not well defined. Accordingly, we examined their development from late-adolescence into adulthood, and their associations with psychiatric disorders. We assessed coping styles in 970 subjects prospectively, at mean ages 17, 24, 29, and 33, using the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations . Selected DSM-IV-TR lifetime psychiatric disorders were assessed at age 24. We found that reliance on adaptive task-oriented coping (TOC) increased sharply from ages 17 to 24, (effect size [ES] = 0.94), and stabilized thereafter; less adaptive emotion-oriented coping (EOC) declined continuously over time. Men and women had similar TOC scores from ages 17 to 33, but women had moderately higher EOC scores at age 17 (ES = 0.53). Greater reliance on EOC at age 24 was associated with more major depressive or anxiety disorders, adjusted for stressors and sex. Greater use of TOC at age 17 was associated with less risk for drug or alcohol abuse/dependence by age 24 after adjusting for sex and stressors. In conclusion, coping styles generally became more adaptive with maturation, though women used EOC more than men. Additionally, greater reliance on TOC in late-adolescence may reduce risks for substance use disorders.

Selective attention deficits in obsessive–compulsive disorder: The role of metacognitive processes,"While initial studies supported the hypothesis that cognitive characteristics that capture cognitive resources act as underlying mechanisms in memory deficits in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), the influence of those characteristics on selective attention has not been studied, yet. In this study, we examined the influence of cognitive self-consciousness (CSC), rumination and worrying on performance in selective attention in OCD and compared the results to a depressive and a healthy control group. We found that 36 OCD and 36 depressive participants were impaired in selective attention in comparison to 36 healthy controls. In all groups, hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that age, intelligence and years in school significantly predicted performance in selective attention. But only in OCD, the predictive power of the regression model was improved when CSC, rumination and worrying were implemented as predictor variables. In contrast, in none of the three groups the predictive power improved when indicators of severity of obsessive–compulsive (OC) and depressive symptoms and trait anxiety were introduced as predictor variables. Thus, our results support the assumption that mental characteristics that bind cognitive resources play an important role in the understanding of selective attention deficits in OCD and that this mechanism is especially relevant for OCD.

The stages of recovery in relation to the other subjective and objective aspects of psychosis,"The Stages of Recovery Instrument (STORI; Andresen et al., 2006) was used among 110 patients with psychosis. Recovery stages relationship with attribution, the way of experiencing illness and its phase and symptoms were analyzed. The samples were drawn from treatment facility including in-patient unit. The subgroups of recovering patients were identified: moratorium (27%), awareness (32%), preparation (30%) and rebuilding (11%). The achievement of higher stages of the recovery was correlated with: less severe symptoms of psychosis (with the exception of anxiety and depression, which have no impact on the stages of recovery), medical attribution (I am ill), integrative attitude toward the experience of psychosis, and the absence of involuntary hospitalizations. The logistic regression analysis model indicated the independent significance of the medical attribution, the integrating attitude toward psychotic experience and the remission of symptoms. Other clinical variables and social characteristics did not differentiate between the stages of recovery in any significant way. No juxtaposition as such was found between the processes of recovery and being ill, but rather a complementary relation. Recovery has been found to be enhanced by the remission of psychotic symptoms, medical attribution and integrative attitude toward the experience of psychotic crisis.

Hyperscanning and avoidance in social anxiety disorder: The visual scanpath during public speaking,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a debilitating mental illness which is thought to be maintained in part by the aberrant attentional processing of socially relevant information. Critically however, research has not assessed whether such aberrant attentional processing occurs during social-evaluative contexts characteristically feared in SAD. The current study presents a novel approach for the assessment of the visuocognitive biases operating in SAD during a social-evaluative stressor. For this task, clinically socially anxious participants and controls were required to give a brief impromptu speech in front of a pre-recorded audience who intermittently displayed socially positive or threatening gestures. Participant gaze at the audience display was recorded throughout the speech. Socially anxious participants exhibited a significantly longer visual scanpath, relative to controls. In addition, socially anxious participants spent relatively longer time fixating at the non-social regions in between and around the confederates. The findings of the present study suggest that SAD is associated with hyperscanning and the attentional avoidance of social stimuli.

Child behaviour checklist emotional dysregulation profiles in youth with disruptive behaviour disorders: Clinical correlates and treatment implications,"Two Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) profiles were correlated to poor self-regulation, Deficient Emotional Self-Regulation (DESR) (elevation between 1 and 2 Standard Deviations (SD) in Anxiety/Depression, Aggression, Attention subscales), and Dysregulation Profile (DP) (elevation of 2 Standard Deviations or more). We explored youths with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Conduct Disorder (CD) whether these profiles are associated with specific clinical features. The sample included 57 patients with DESR profile and 41 with DP profile, ages 9 to 15 years, all assigned to a non-pharmacological Multimodal Treatment Program. No differences resulted between groups in demographic features, diagnosis ratio, and comorbidities with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Bipolar Disorder (BD), and Anxiety Disorder. The DP group was associated with higher scores in Withdrawn, Social Problem, Thought, Rule Breaking, and Somatic CBCL subscales, and higher scores in Narcissism and Impulsivity (but not Callous–Unemotional (CU)), according to the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD). After treatment, patients with DESR improved their personality traits (Narcissistic and Callous–Unemotional, but not Impulsivity), while changes in CBCL scales were modest. Patients with DP improved scales of Attention, Aggression, Anxiety–Depression, Rule Breaking, Withdrawal, Social Problem and Thought, while personality features did not change.

Panic disorder and health-related quality of life: The predictive roles of anxiety sensitivity and trait anxiety,"Panic disorder (PD) is a very common anxiety disorder and is often a chronic disabling condition. However, little is known about the factors that predict health-related quality of life (HRQOL) other than sociodemographic factors and illness-related symptomatology that explain HRQOL in only small to modest degrees. This study explored whether anxiety-related individual traits including anxiety sensitivity and trait anxiety can predict independently HRQOL in panic patients. Patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia ( N = 230) who met the diagnostic criteria in the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV were recruited. Stepwise regression analysis was performed to determine the factors that predict HRQOL in panic disorder. HRQOL was assessed by the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Anxiety sensitivity was an independent predictor of bodily pain and social functioning whereas trait anxiety independently predicted all of the eight domains of the SF-36. Our data suggests that the assessment of symptomatology as well as individual anxiety-related trait should be included in the evaluation of HRQOL in panic patients.

Is a gin and tonic more like gin or tonic? A comparison of comorbid and non-comorbid anxiety disorder diagnostic pairs,"Despite findings indicating that anxiety disorders are more likely to co-occur with each other than occur in isolation, little research has explored precise areas of overlap and differentiation among comorbid pairs of anxiety disorders. Furthermore, many studies comparing phenomena across anxiety disorders define comparison groups based on principal diagnoses, with lesser regard for comorbid diagnoses, raising the question as to whether this is a valid approach to analyzing comparisons. To better understand the extent to which comparisons by principal diagnoses are valid, the current study investigated whether comorbid hierarchically opposing diagnostic pairs showed similarities and differences from their non-comorbid, or “pure”, counterparts on measures of clinician-rated functioning, specific symptoms, vulnerability factors, and demographic characteristics. The study included a total of 353 participants with diagnoses of either Panic Disorder (PD) only, Social Phobia (SP) only, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) only, or some comorbid pair of the three. Consistent with hypotheses, results demonstrated that hierarchically opposing diagnostic pairs showed more overlap than differentiation with each other and with non-comorbid counterparts on measures of a given specific non-comorbid diagnosis, indicating that defining comparisons by principal diagnoses may be invalid and misleading. The implications regarding the nosological structure of the DSM and research practice will be discussed.

Relationship between atypical depression and social anxiety disorder,"In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of atypical and non-atypical depression comorbidity on the clinical characteristics and course of social anxiety disorder (SAD). A total of 247 patients with SAD were enrolled: 145 patients with a current depressive episode (unipolar or bipolar) with atypical features, 43 patients with a current depressive episode with non-atypical features and 25 patients without a lifetime history of depressive episodes were compared regarding sociodemographic and clinical features, comorbidity rates, and severity of SAD, depression and functional impairment. Thirty four patients with a past but not current history of major depressive episodes were excluded from the comparisons. 77.1% of current depressive episodes were associated with atypical features. Age at onset of SAD and age at initial major depressive episode were lower in the group with atypical depression than in the group with non-atypical depression. History of suicide attempts and bipolar disorder comorbidity was more common in the atypical depression group as well. Atypical depression group has higher SAD and depression severity and lower functionality than group with non-atypical depression. Our results indicate that the presence of atypical depression is associated with more severe symptoms and more impairment in functioning in patients with SAD.

The aim of this study was to compare the prediction of intelligence on the level of psychiatric symptoms and psychosocial functioning in psychotherapies of different lengths. A total of 251 outpatients from the Helsinki Psychotherapy Study, aged 20–46 years, and suffering from mood or anxiety disorders were allocated to two long-term and two short-term therapies. Intelligence was assessed at baseline with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-R). Psychiatric symptoms and psychosocial functioning were assessed 5–10 times during a 5-year follow-up using two primary symptom measures (HDRS and HARS) and one primary measure of psychosocial functioning (GAF). Short-term therapy was more effective than long-term therapy during the first year of follow-up. During the second to fourth follow-up year no differences between short- and long-term therapies or the intelligence groups were found. At the fifth follow-up year, however, long-term psychotherapy showed a statistically significantly larger change in all three primary measures compared to short-term therapy among those with higher intelligence.

Ethnic differences in prevalence and correlates of self-harm behaviors in a treatment-seeking sample of emerging adults,"The present study examined differences between White and ethnic minority emerging adults in the prevalence of self-harm behaviors—i.e., non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicide attempts (SA)—and in well-documented risk (i.e., depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, suicidal ideation (SI), substance use, abuse history) and protective factors (i.e., religiosity/spirituality, family support, friend support) associated with NSSI and SAs. Emerging adults ( N = 1156; 56% ethnic minority), ages 17–29 ( M = 22.3, S.D. = 3.0), who were presented at a counseling center at a public university in the Northeastern U.S., completed a clinical interview and self-report symptom measures. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between risk and protective factors in predicting history of NSSI-only, any SA, and no self-harm separately among White and ethnic minority individuals. Ethnic differences emerged in the prevalence and correlates of NSSI and SAs. Social anxiety was associated with SAs among White individuals but with NSSI among ethnic minority individuals. Substance use was a more relevant risk factor for White individuals, and friend support was a more relevant protective factor for ethnic minority individuals. These findings suggest differing vulnerabilities to NSSI and SAs between White and ethnic minority emerging adults.

"Social anxiety disorder in the Chinese military: Prevalence, comorbidities, impairment, and treatment-seeking","The objective of this work is To investigate the prevalence, comorbidities, impairment, and treatment-seeking of social anxiety disorder in the Chinese military personnel. Military personnel ( n = 11,527) were surveyed from May to August 2007 using a multistage whole cohort probability sampling method. A Chinese version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used for assessment, and a military-related socio-demographic questionnaire was used to describe the prevalence distribution. A unified survey was performed to investigate 11 different social situations. The short-form health survey was used to assess role impairment. The 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of social anxiety disorder were 3.34% (95% CI: 3.25–3.42%) and 6.22% (95% CI: 6.11–6.32%), respectively. Social anxiety disorder was associated with increased odds of depression, substance abuse, panic attacks/disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Childhood foster, female, stressful life events, younger age, and being divorced/widowed increase the incidence of social anxiety disorder. Treatment-seeking was relatively rare. Social anxiety disorder is a common disorder in military personnel in China, and it is a risk factor for subsequent depressive illness, substance abuse and other mental disorder. Early detection and treatment of social anxiety disorder are important because of the low rate of treatment-seeking.

Changes in quality of life following group CBT for anxiety and depression in a psychiatric outpatient clinic,"The present study examined the relationship between quality of life and symptom change following group CBT treatment for anxiety or depression in a psychiatric hospital outpatient setting. One hundred seventy seven outpatients undergoing eight sessions of group CBT for anxiety ( n = 124) or mood disorders ( n = 53) participated. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (Zung-SRDS), Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) were administered at baseline and post-treatment. Additionally, the QOLI and SWLS scores of those who achieved reliable improvement or clinically significant symptom change were compared to those who experienced no reliable symptom improvement. There were significant changes across the QOLI, SWLS, BAI and Zung-SRDS outcome measures between baseline and post-treatment, with moderate to very large effect sizes observed. Patients with reliable or clinically significant change in their symptoms experienced significant increases in QOLI and SWLS scores when compared to those whose symptoms did not change reliably. Overall, in a psychiatric hospital outpatient setting, group CBT appeared to be successful in increasing quality of life and satisfaction with life in addition to reducing anxiety and depression symptoms.

When social anxiety co-occurs with substance use: Does an impulsive social anxiety subtype explain this unexpected relationship?,"Although most conceptualizations of social anxiety emphasise that socially anxious individuals are overtly shy, and utilise avoidant behavioural strategies (e.g., risk-aversion, passivity, and submissiveness), there is tentative support for the existence of an approach-motivated subtype, characterised by risk taking and a greater propensity for substance misuse. It is likely that this subtype may help explain the reported co-occurrence of substance misuse and social anxiety. The current study sought to test via latent class analysis whether an approach-motivated social anxiety subtype could be identified within a community sample. A self-report questionnaire was completed by 351 participants (age: 18–74 years). Two distinct social anxiety subgroups were identified: one characterised by prototypical SAD symptomatology (i.e., behavioural inhibition and risk-avoidance), the second by elevated levels of rash impulsiveness, reward sensitivity, risk-taking and co-occurring substance use problems. The current findings provides support for the existence of a distinct approach-motivated social anxiety subtype and indicates that impulsivity may be critical to understanding the comorbid substance use symptomatology of these individuals.

A comparison of inpatients with anxious depression to those with nonanxious depression,"Anxiety symptoms are common for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Anxious depression has been considered MDD with high levels of anxiety symptoms. The objective of this study was to investigate the factors associated with anxious depression for Chinese inpatients with MDD. A total of 174 acutely ill patients were enrolled. Baseline demographic variables, suicide risk, depression severity, quality of life (QOL), and daily functional impairment were assessed. Those MDD patients with a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) anxiety/somatization factor score≥7 were defined as anxious depression. Logistic regression was employed to examine the factors associated with anxious depression. One hundred and forty-one (81.0%) of the subjects reported anxious depression. Patients with anxious depression were more likely to have melancholic features, to be older, to experience more severe depression, to be at greater risk of suicide, to have more pain, poorer quality of life, and more severe functional impairment. Anxious depression is common in inpatients with MDD. These findings suggest that anxious depression significantly differs from nonanxious depression on several clinically relevant variables. These data add to a growing body of evidence that anxious depression is a more complex presentation of depression.

Pathways to social anxiety: The role of reinforcement sensitivities and emotion regulation,"Past research has demonstrated a strong relationship between threat sensitivity and social anxiety; however, the relationship between reward sensitivity and social anxiety is less clear. Further, the role that emotion regulation (ER) may play in the expression of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is rarely considered. The current study tested whether two emotion regulation strategies (emotional suppression and cognitive reappraisal) mediated associations between threat sensitivity and reward sensitivity and social anxiety in a community sample (402 adults, 78% female; M age = 32.49, S.D. age = 11.53). Path analyses indicated that low reappraisal mediated the relationship between high threat sensitivity and high social anxiety; and both low reappraisal and high suppression mediated the relationship between low reward sensitivity and high social anxiety. These results highlight the potential role that emotion regulation plays in the relationship between trait motivation and social anxiety.

"Mood, anxiety, and personality disorders among first and second-generation immigrants to the United States","A careful examination of the multigenerational relationship between immigrant status and mental disorders can provide important information about the robustness and nature of the immigrant-mental health link. We examine immigrant status as a protective factor against mental illness, assess intergenerational effects, examine differences across race/ethnicity, and report the prevalence of mood, anxiety, and personality disorders of immigrants across major world regions. We employ data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) and compare first ( n = 5363) and second-generation ( n = 4826) immigrants from Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America to native-born Americans ( n = 24,461) with respect to mental disorders. First-generation immigrants are significantly less likely than native-born Americans to be diagnosed with a mood, anxiety, or personality disorder, though the prevalence of mental health diagnoses increases among second generation immigrants. Similar results were observed for immigrants from major world regions as the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was lower among immigrants from Africa, Latin America, Europe, and Asia compared to native-born Americans. Findings provide evidence in support of the notion that the immigrant paradox may be extended to include mood, anxiety, and personality disorders in the United States.

"Illness severity, trait anxiety, cognitive impairment and heart rate variability in bipolar disorder","Numerous studies have documented a significant association between symptom severity and cognitive functioning in bipolar disorder (BD). These findings advanced speculations about a potential link between the physiological stress associated with illness severity and cognitive dysfunction. To explore this hypothesis, the current study employed heart rate variability (HRV) as a physiological measure that is sensitive to the effects of chronic stress, and a scale of trait anxiety for assessing a psychological condition that is correlated with hyper sympathetic arousal. Analyses indicated that BD patients with High Illness Severity reported more symptoms of trait-anxiety (i.e., State Trait Anxiety Inventory), performed more poorly on a computerized neuropsychological battery (i.e., CNS Vital Signs), and exhibited a more constricted HRV profile (i.e., lower SDNN with elevated LF/HF ratio) than patients with Low Illness Severity. Illness severity was determined by a history of psychosis, illness duration, and number of mood episodes. A third group of healthy controls ( n = 22) performed better on the neuropsychological battery and exhibited a healthier HRV profile than the BD groups. This study provides preliminary evidence that illness severity and cognitive impairment in BD may be associated with state anxiety and neuro-cardiac alterations that are sensitive to physiological stress.

Personality disorders in heart failure patients requiring psychiatric management: Comorbidity detections from a routine depression and anxiety screening protocol,"Several international guidelines recommend routine depression screening in cardiac disease populations. No previous study has determined the prevalence and comorbidities of personality disorders in patients presenting for psychiatric treatment after these screening initiatives. In the first stage 404 heart failure (HF) patients were routinely screened and 73 underwent structured interview when either of the following criteria were met: (a) Patient Health Questionnaire ≥10; (b) Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire ≥7); (c) Response to one item panic-screener. Or (d) Suicidality. Patients with personality disorders were compared to the positive-screen patients on psychiatric comorbidities. The most common personality disorders were avoidant (8.2%), borderline (6.8%) and obsessive compulsive (4.1%), other personality disorders were prevalent in less than &lt;3% of patients. Personality disorder patients had significantly greater risk of major depression (risk ratio (RR) 1.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–13.3), generalized anxiety disorder (RR 3.2; 95% CI 1.0–10.0), social phobia (RR 3.8; 95% CI 1.3–11.5) and alcohol abuse/dependence (RR 3.2; 95% 1.0–9.5). The findings that HF patients with personality disorders presented with complex psychiatric comorbidity suggest that pathways facilitating the integration of psychiatric services into cardiology settings are warranted when routine depression screening is in place.

"The Critical Warzone Experiences (CWE) Scale: Initial psychometric properties and association with PTSD, anxiety, and depression","The objective of the present research was to develop and evaluate a critical warzone experiences (CWE) scale for use with Iraq/Afghanistan veterans. The psychometric properties of the CWE were evaluated across three independent samples of Iraq/Afghanistan veterans. Despite its brevity (7 items), the CWE exhibited good internal consistency (average α = 0.83), good temporal stability (1-year test–retest reliability = 0.73), good concurrent validity with lengthier measures of warzone experiences (average r = 0.74), and a clear unidimensional factor structure (average factor loading = 0.69). Study 2 confirmed the CWE's factor structure through confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling demonstrated a strong association between CWE and post-deployment mental health, β = 0.49, p &lt; 0.001. Study 3 provided further support for the predictive validity of the CWE by demonstrating that it was associated with PTSD diagnosis, clinician-rated PTSD symptom severity, and global functional impairment in an independent sample of Iraq/Afghanistan veterans (average r = 0.59). While replication of these findings in more diverse samples is needed, the preliminary evidence from these studies indicates that the CWE is a brief, reliable, and valid measure of critical warzone experiences among Iraq/Afghanistan war veterans.

Do patients with different mental disorders show specific aspects of shame?,"Shame is related to several mental disorders. We assume that facets of shame, namely bodily, cognitive and existential shame, may occur in typical patterns in mental and personality disorders. An excessive level of shame may lead to psychopathological symptoms. However, a lack of shame may also lead to distress, for instance as it may facilitate violation of social norms and thus may promote interpersonal problems. In this study we investigated facets of shame in females suffering from various mental disorders and personality disorders presumably associated with specific aspects of shame. Women suffering from borderline personality disorder (BPD, n = 92), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, n = 86), major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 17), social anxiety disorder (SAD, n = 33), and a community sample (COM, n = 290) completed the SHAME questionnaire, which is a newly developed instrument to assess adaptive and maladaptive aspects of shame. BPD patients reported the highest level of existential shame compared to all other groups. Compared to the controls, SAD patients displayed stronger bodily and cognitive shame, and ADHD showed lower bodily shame. As assumed, specific aspects of shame were found in different patient groups. It may be important to specifically address these specific aspects of shame in psychotherapy.

Development and initial evaluation of Transdiagnostic Behavior Therapy (TBT) for veterans with affective disorders,"Considerable attention has focused on the growing need for evidence-based psychotherapy for veterans with affective disorders within the Department of Veteran Affairs. Despite, and possibly due to, the large number of evidence-based protocols available, several obstacles remain in their widespread delivery within Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. In part as an effort to address these concerns, newer transdiagnostic approaches to psychotherapy have been developed to provide a single treatment that is capable of addressing several, related disorders. The goal of the present investigation was to develop and evaluate a transdiagnostic psychotherapy, Transdiagnostic Behavior Therapy (TBT), in veterans with affective disorders. Study 1 provided initial support for transdiagnostic presentation of evidence-based psychotherapy components in veterans with principal diagnoses of affective disorders ( n = 15). These findings were used to inform the development of the TBT protocol. In Study 2, an initial evaluation of TBT was completed in a second sample of veterans with principal diagnoses of affective disorders ( n = 29). The findings of Study 2 demonstrated significant improvements in symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, posttraumatic stress, and related impairment across participants with various principal diagnoses. Together, the investigation provided preliminary support for effectiveness of TBT in veterans with affective disorders.

Posttraumatic stress disorder in African Americans: A two year follow-up study,"The present study was a prospective, naturalistic, longitudinal investigation of the two year course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a sample of African Americans with anxiety disorders. The study objectives were to examine the two year course of PTSD and to evaluate differences between African Americans with PTSD and anxiety disorders and African Americans with anxiety disorders but no PTSD with regard to comorbidity, psychosocial impairment, physical and emotional functioning, and treatment participation. The participants were 67 African Americans with PTSD and 98 African Americans without PTSD (mean age 41.5 years, 67.3% female). Individuals with PTSD were more likely to have higher comorbidity, lower functioning, and they were less likely to seek treatment than those with other anxiety disorders but no PTSD. The rate of recovery from PTSD over two years was 0.10 and recovery from comorbid Major Depressive Disorder was 0.55. PTSD appears to be persistent over time in this population. The rates of recovery were lower than what has been reported in previous longitudinal studies with predominantly non-Latino Whites. It is imperative to examine barriers to treatment and factors related to treatment engagement for this population.

Shame amplifies the association between stressful life events and paranoia amongst young adults using mental health services: Implications for understanding risk and psychological resilience,"Shame is associated with a range of psychological disorders, and is a trans-diagnostic moderator of the association between stressors and symptoms of disorder. However, research has yet to investigate shame in relation to specific psychotic symptoms in clinical groups. In order to address this, the present study investigated shame in young adults with mental health problems, to test whether shame was i) directly associated with paranoia, a prevalent psychotic symptom, and ii) a moderator of the association between stress and paranoia. Sixty participants completed measures of stressful events, paranoia, shame, depression and anxiety. Results from a cross-sectional regression analysis suggested that shame was associated with paranoia after the stressful life event measure was entered into the model, and shame moderated the association between stress and paranoia. For individuals scoring high on shame, shame amplified the association between stress and paranoia, but for low-shame individuals, the association between stress and paranoia was non-significant. These findings suggest that high levels of shame could confer vulnerability for paranoia amongst clinical groups, and that resistance to experiencing shame could be a marker of resilience.

Individual residual symptoms and functional impairment in patients with depression,"The aim of treatment of depression is remission of symptoms and functioning. Although there is a relationship between remission of symptoms and remission of functioning, it is not known how individual residual symptoms are related to functioning. Here we report a post-hoc analysis of two studies which treated depressed patients with duloxetine in an open fashion for 10–12 weeks. We evaluated the association of individual residual symptoms and functional impairment in patients who remitted or partially remitted after acute treatment. Logistic regression was used to investigate residual symptoms associated with functional impairment at endpoint. Our results suggest that in partial remitters, the only residual symptom associated with a reduction in the risk of having impaired function was the resolution of painful physical symptoms (PPS). In patients who remitted, the presence of residual core mood symptoms (CMS), particularly in patients without any anxiety, predicted impaired functioning. The resolution of PPS in the presence of residual CMS was associated with less risk of impaired functioning. Our results contribute to understand better the role of specific residual symptoms on functional impairment. To achieve normal functioning, intervention on specific residual symptoms is recommended.

Hair thyroid hormones concentration in patients with depression changes with disease episodes in female Chinese,"Abnormal function of thyroid and deregulation of level of blood thyroid hormones, including triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), have been observed in patients with major depression. Nevertheless, no consistent conclusion can be drawn from previous reports. Hair hormones reflect average hormones levels in a certain period and have been involved in the studies of psychiatric diseases. However, no research has elucidated the relation between hair thyroid hormones level and depression. In the present study, we explored the correlation between thyroid hormones and major depression by analyzing and comparing the levels of hair thyroid hormones in patients with depression ( n = 30) and healthy controls ( n = 30). Our results showed that the levels of hair T3 and T4 were significantly lower in patients with depression in disease episode than that in pre-disease episode or in healthy controls. Moreover, patients with depression in pre-disease episode had a higher hair T4 level than healthy controls. No significant correlation was observed between hair T3 or T4 levels and the Hamilton depression rating scale and Hamilton anxiety rating scale scores. Our results indicate that hair thyroid hormones levels change with the episodes of depressions, which may be helpful for pathological studies of depression.

"An investigation into reasoning biases, mood and cognitive state, and subclinical delusional ideation","Following research on reasoning and the continuum of delusional ideation, the present study attempted to investigate the impact of different experimentally-induced states (stress, paranoia, and neutral) on the jumping-to-conclusions reasoning bias in individuals with varying levels of subclinical delusional ideation (SDI). Participants ( N = 117) completed a measure of subclinical delusional ideation (the Peters et al. Delusions Inventory or PDI; Peters et al., 1999); and were randomly assigned to receive one of two experimental inductions (stress or paranoia), or no experimental induction; their performance on two probabilistic reasoning tasks—one easy and one challenging – was assessed. Although no differences were found between individuals with high vs. low subclinical delusional ideation in the no induction condition or following the paranoia induction, in the stress-induction condition, individuals with high levels of subclinical delusional ideation were significantly less likely to jump to conclusions on the easy reasoning task. No significant effects emerged on the more challenging task. Assessment of post-test paranoid thinking indicated our paranoia induction did not have its intended effect. Importantly, because there was no pre-test of anxiety, paranoid thinking, or reasoning to determine if they shifted after the inductions, results need to be interpreted with caution.

Orienting and maintenance of attention to threatening facial expressions in anxiety—An eye movement study,"Cognitive models posit that anxiety disorders stem in part from underlying attentional biases to threat. Consistent with this, studies have found that the attentional bias to threat-related stimuli is greater in high vs. low anxious individuals. Nevertheless, it is not clear if similar biases exist for different threatening emotions or for any facial emotional stimulus. In the present study, we used eye-tracking to measure orienting and maintenance of attention to faces displaying anger, fear and disgust as threats, and faces displaying happiness and sadness. Using a free viewing task, we examined differences between low and high trait anxious (HTA) individuals in the attention they paid to each of these emotional faces (paired with a neutral face). We found that initial orienting was faster for angry and happy faces, and high trait anxious participants were more vigilant to fearful and disgust faces. Our results for attentional maintenance were not consistent. The results of the present study suggest that attentional processes may be more emotion-specific than previously believed. Our results suggest that attentional processes for different threatening emotions may not be the same and that attentional processes for some negative and some positive emotions may be similar.

"The impact of childhood parental loss on risk for mood, anxiety and substance use disorders in a population-based sample of male twins","Previous studies have identified the relationship between parental loss and psychopathology later in life. However, this relationship varied depending on the kind of loss, the parent involved, and the type of psychopathology. In the present study, we examined the association between parental loss (any loss, death, and separation) during childhood and lifetime risk for seven common psychiatric and substance use disorders in a sample of 2605 male twins from the Virginia population-based twin registry. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we also examined the extent to which the influence of parental loss contributes to adult psychopathology. Parental separation was associated with a wide range of adult psychopathology, whereas parental death was specifically associated with phobia and alcohol dependence. Maternal and paternal separations were almost equally associated with most forms of psychopathology. SEM suggested that parental loss accounted for about 10% of the variance of adult psychopathology, of which parental separation had the strongest impacts on risk for depression and drug abuse/dependence (11% of the total variance). Our findings suggest that early parental separation has stronger and wider effects on adult psychopathology than parental death.

Blood manganese levels in relation to comorbid behavioral and emotional problems in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"Patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) appear to be more vulnerable to the development of other psychiatric disorders than the general population. The proposed neurotoxic mechanisms of manganese involve striatal dopamine neurotransmission, implicated in the pathophysiology of ADHD. We investigated whether the adverse impact of manganese is particularly pronounced in children with ADHD. Blood manganese concentration and diagnosis of ADHD were assessed in a general population of 890 children, aged 8–11 years. The main outcome measure was the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). A significant interaction was found between ADHD status and blood manganese level in predicting CBCL total problems score as well as anxiety/depression, social problems, delinquent behavior, aggressive behavior, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. The directions of the interactions indicated that blood manganese level was more positively correlated with CBCL scores in ADHD children than in the healthy population. In ADHD children, only the fifth quintile of blood manganese concentration was significantly associated with the CBCL total problems score. ADHD children may be more vulnerable than the general school-age population to the neurotoxic effects of manganese exposure, which lead to an elevated risk of developing comorbid mental conditions.

"Public perceptions of stigma towards people with schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety","Stigma is one of the greatest challenges facing people with a psychiatric diagnosis. They are widely stigmatised by the general public in the western world. The aim of this study was to examine public stigma attitudes towards schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) 2008 opinions survey ( n = 1070) was utilised. Percentage of endorsements for stigma items were initially compared to the previous 1998 and 2003 databases. Overall stigma attitudes had decreased (from 1998 to 2008) but increased since 2003. A principal components factor analysis identified that stigma attitudes have the same three factors structure across all diagnoses; negative stereotypes, patient blame and inability to recover. Schizophrenia was significantly associated with the most negative stereotypes, least blamed and viewed as least likely to recover compared to anxiety and depression. Public and individualised interventions that target diagnostic variability in stigma attitudes need to be developed and examined in future research.

Characteristics of suicide completers with a psychiatric diagnosis before death: A postmortem study of 98 cases,"The objective of this research was to classify the deaths of 98 victims of suicide in Tel Aviv, Israel between the years 2007 and 2010. This was done by examining background features and clinical characteristics among suicide completers with histories of a prior psychiatric hospitalization using logistic regression modeling. 34% of the sample (33/98) was given at least one psychiatric diagnosis upon discharge from a prior psychiatric hospitalization. Throughout their lifetime, those with psychiatric diagnoses were significantly more likely to have histories of mental health treatment (psychotherapy and psychotropic medication), psychopathology and suicidality among family members, prior suicide attempts and familial or emotional crisis as compared with those without a psychiatric diagnosis. During their last life phase, those with prior psychiatric diagnoses were also significantly more likely to have received psychotherapeutic treatment, expressed a lack of desire to live and presented with affective symptoms (e.g. depression, anxiety, adaptation difficulty and nervousness) as compared with those without such histories. Thus, focusing on high risk populations, such as those with psychiatric illnesses and deciphering the role of mental health treatment, familial predisposition, prior suicide attempt and sub-clinical symptoms in relation to suicide can inform future prevention practices.

Laryngoscope 94, 176–178) and its extracted 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (Goudsmit, N., Coleman, E., Seckinger, R.A., Wolitzky, R., Stanford, A.D., Corcoran, C., Goetz, R.R., Malaspina, D., 2003. A brief smell identification test discriminates between deficit and non-deficit schizophrenia. Psychiatry Research 120, 155–164). Smell identification did not significantly differ between CHR subjects and controls. Among CHR subjects, smell identification did not predict schizophrenia (N=19; 27%) within 2 years, nor was it associated with negative or positive symptoms. This is the third prospective cohort study to examine smell identification in CHR subjects, and overall, findings are inconclusive, similar to what is found for other disorders in adolescents, such as autism spectrum, attention deficit and anxiety disorders. Smell identification deficit may not have clear utility as a marker of emergent schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.

A baseline controlled examination of a 5-day intensive treatment for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder,"This study extends support for a 5-day intensive exposure and response prevention (ERP) treatment protocol for pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Twenty-two children with OCD received ERP treatment twice daily for 5 days. The treatment also emphasized teaching children and parents how to conduct ERP independently after they returned home. Symptoms were assessed at four time-points: Baseline, 4 weeks later at pre-treatment, one week after the intensive treatment 5-day treatment, and at 3 month follow-up. Changes on the primary outcome measure, clinician severity ratings on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children, and secondary measures, indicated that OCD symptoms remained stable from the evaluation to baseline and improved significantly from baseline to follow-up. Moreover, parental accommodation of OCD decreased significantly from baseline to post-treatment and from post-treatment to follow-up. These data suggest that the 5-day intervention demonstrates efficacy in reducing OCD symptoms and may initiate change in parent accommodation that continues to improve after the family returns home.

"Prevalence, incidence, and comorbidity of clinically diagnosed obsessive–compulsive disorder in Taiwan: A national population-based study","Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic debilitating anxiety disorder significant in intrusive thoughts and compensation repetitive behaviors. Few studies have reported on this condition Asia. This study estimated the prevalence, incidence and psychiatric comorbidities of OCD in Taiwan. We identified study subjects for 2000–2008 with a principal diagnosis of OCD according to the International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic criteria by using National Health Research Institute database. These patients received either outpatient or inpatient care for their condition. Rates were directly age- and sex-adjusted to the 2004 Taiwan population distribution. The estimated mean annual incidence was 27.57 per 10⁵ inhabitants and the one year prevalence was 65.05 per 10⁵ inhabitants. Incidence and prevalence increased with age, peaking at age 18–24 years in males and at 35–44 years in females. About 53% of adults (≥18 years) and 48% of child and adolescent patients (6–17 years) had one or more comorbid psychiatric conditions. The most common comorbid diagnosis was depressive disorders for both adult and child-adolescent patients. We found a lower prevalence and incidence of clinically diagnosed OCD than that of community studies. Many Asian patients with OCD also had various psychiatric comorbidities, a clinically relevant finding.

Adaption of cardio-respiratory balance during day-rest compared to deep sleep—An indicator for quality of life?,"Heart rate and breathing rate fluctuations represent interacting physiological oscillations. These interactions are commonly studied using respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) of heart rate variability (HRV) or analyzing cardiorespiratory synchronization. Earlier work has focused on a third type of relationship, the temporal ratio of respiration rate and heart rate (HRR). Each method seems to reveal a specific aspect of cardiorespiratory interaction and may be suitable for assessing states of arousal and relaxation of the organism. We used HRR in a study with 87 healthy subjects to determine the ability to relax during 5 day-resting periods in comparison to deep sleep relaxation. The degree to which a person during waking state could relax was compared to somatic complaints, health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression. Our results show, that HRR is barely connected to balance (LF/HF) in HRV, but significantly correlates to the perception of general health and mental well-being as well as to depression. If relaxation, as expressed in HRR, during day-resting is near to deep sleep relaxation, the subjects felt healthier, indicated better mental well-being and less depressive moods.

Impact of childhood exposure to psychological trauma on the risk of psychiatric disorders and somatic discomfort: Single vs. multiple types of psychological trauma,"We examined whether childhood exposure to multiple types of potentially traumatic events (PTEs) relative to a single type of PTE is associated with a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders and greater somatic discomfort in Korean adults. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview 2.1 (K-CIDI 2.1) was administered to 6027 subjects aged 18–74 years. Subjects who experienced a traumatic event before the age of 18 years, the childhood trauma exposure group, were compared with controls without childhood exposure to PTEs. In the childhood trauma exposure group, subjects who experienced only a single type of PTE and subjects who experienced two or more types of PTEs were compared further. Childhood exposure to PTEs was linked to a wide range of psychiatric comorbidities, with a higher risk for exposure to multiple types of PTEs than for exposure to a single type of PTE. Obsessive–compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and somatoform disorder were significantly associated with exposure to multiple types of PTEs but not with exposure to a single type of PTE. Exposure to multiple types of PTEs was associated with reports of marked fatigue and pain. Future research should examine the psychiatric sequelae associated with various types of childhood PTEs.

In action or inaction? Social approach–avoidance tendencies in major depression,"In depression, approach deficits often impair everyday social functioning, but empirical findings on performance-based measurements of approach–avoidance behavior remain conflicting. To investigate action tendencies in patients with depression, the current study used an explicit version of the Approach–Avoidance Task (AAT). In this task, participants responded to emotional faces by either pulling a joystick toward (approach) or pushing it away from themselves (avoid). Reaction times to happy and angry expressions with direct and averted gaze were assessed in 30 patients with major depressive disorder and 20 matched healthy controls. In contrast to healthy individuals, depressed patients did not show approach–avoidance tendencies, i.e., there was no dominant behavioral tendency and they reacted to happy and angry expressions likewise. These results indicate that behavioral adjustments to different emotional expressions, gaze directions or motivational demands were lacking in depression. Crucially, this distinguishes depressed patients not only from healthy individuals, but also from other clinical populations that demonstrate aberrant approach–avoidance tendencies, e.g., patients with social anxiety or psychopathy. As responding flexibly to different social signals is integral to social interactions, the absence of any social motivational tendencies seems maladaptive, but may also provide opportunities for modifying action tendencies in a therapeutic context.

Test of the depression distress amplification model in young adults with elevated risk of current suicidality,"Suicide is a leading cause of death among young adults and the rate of suicide has been increasing for decades. A depression distress amplification model posits that young adults with comorbid depression and anxiety have elevated suicide rates due to the intensification of their depressive symptoms by anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns. The current study tested the effects of anxiety sensitivity subfactors as well as the depression distress amplification model in a very large sample of college students with elevated suicide risk. Participants were 721 college students who were at elevated risk of suicidality (scored &gt; 0 on the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation). Consistent with prior work, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns, but not physical or social concerns, were associated with suicidal ideation. Consistent with the depression distress amplification model, in individuals high in depression, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns predicted elevated suicidal ideation but not among those with low depression. The results of this study corroborate the role of anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns and the depression distress amplification model in suicidal ideation among a large potentially high-risk group of college students. The depression distress amplification model suggests a specific mechanism, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns, that may be responsible for increased suicide rates among those with comorbid anxiety and depression.

A study of poor insight in social anxiety disorder,"We investigated levels of insight among patients with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) as compared to patients with Obsessive−Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and evaluated whether levels of insight in SAD were related to specific sociodemographic and/or clinical features. Thirty-seven SAD patients and 51 OCD patients attending a tertiary obsessive−compulsive and anxiety disorders clinic were assessed with a sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire, a structured diagnostic interview, the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS), the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and the Treatment Adherence Survey-patient version (TAS-P). According to the BABS, SAD patients exhibited insight levels that were as low as those exhibited by OCD patients, with up to 29.7% of them being described as “poor insight” SAD. Although poor insight SAD patients were more frequently married, less depressed and displayed a statistical trend towards greater rates of early drop-out from cognitive-behavioral therapy, their insight levels were not associated with other variables of interest, including sex, age, employment, age at onset, duration of illness, associated psychiatric disorders, SPIN and SDS scores. Patients with poor insight SAD might perceive their symptoms as being less distressful and thus report fewer depressive symptoms and high rates of treatment non-adherence.

"The severity of Internet addiction risk and its relationship with the severity of borderline personality features, childhood traumas, dissociative experiences, depression and anxiety symptoms among Turkish University Students","The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of Internet addiction (IA) risk with the severity of borderline personality features, childhood traumas, dissociative experiences, depression and anxiety symptoms among Turkish university students. A total of 271 Turkish university students participated in this study. The students were assessed through the Internet Addiction Scale (IAS), the Borderline Personality Inventory (BPI), the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-28), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The rates of students were 19.9% ( n = 54) in the high IA risk group, 38.7% ( n = 105) in the mild IA risk group and 41.3% ( n = 112) in the group without IA risk. Correlation analyses revealed that the severity of IA risk was related with BPI, DES, emotional abuse, CTQ-28, depression and anxiety scores. Univariate covariance analysis (ANCOVA) indicated that the severity of borderline personality features, emotional abuse, depression and anxiety symptoms were the predictors of IAS score, while gender had no effect on IAS score. Among childhood trauma types, emotional abuse seems to be the main predictor of IA risk severity. Borderline personality features predicted the severity of IA risk together with emotional abuse, depression and anxiety symptoms among Turkish university students.

"The prevalence, comorbidity and risks of prolonged grief disorder among bereaved Chinese adults","Few epidemiological studies have investigated prolonged grief disorder (PGD) in the general population of Asian countries, including China. The aim of this study was to explore the rates and risks of PGD, and the association between PGD, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety in bereaved Chinese adults. The PG-13, PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were administered to 445 subjects. Prevalence within the general population of China was 1.8% (i.e., 8/445). Among the eight subjects who met the PGD diagnosis, 75%, 87.5% and 75% scored above the cut-off point on the PCL-C, SDS and SAS, respectively, although a portion remained free from comorbidity. ANOVA, correlation analysis and stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that kinship to deceased, age of the deceased, religion belief and cause of death were predictive of prolonged grief. A small proportion of bereaved persons may exhibit PGD. There is a substantial but far from complete overlap between PGD and the other three diagnoses. Bereaved parents and the widowed have high risk of PGD. These findings highlight the need for prevention, diagnosis and treatment for PGD patients.

Low baseline &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;CO₂ predicts poorer outcome from behavioral treatment: Evidence from a mixed anxiety disorders sample,"Low levels of end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( p CO₂)—the amount of carbon dioxide measured from expired air—are commonly found in individuals with anxiety disorders but have not been examined as predictors of outcome from anxiety treatment. The current study examined pre-treatment baseline p CO₂ as a predictor of outcome from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for anxiety disorders. Sixty-one individuals with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) defined principal anxiety disorder diagnosis completed 12 sessions of either CBT or ACT. Baseline p CO₂ was measured prior to entering treatment. Self-reported anxiety symptoms and quality of life were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up from baseline. Low baseline p CO₂ was associated with higher anxiety symptoms and lower quality of life across follow-up timepoints, above and beyond baseline symptom severity. These results suggest that low baseline p CO₂ predicts poorer outcome from CBT and ACT for anxiety and may warrant treatment that directly addresses respiratory dysregulation. ©2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Overlap between autistic and schizotypal personality traits is not accounted for by anxiety and depression,"Autism spectrum and schizophrenia spectrum disorders are classified separately in the DSM-5, yet research indicates that these two disorders share overlapping features. The aim of the present study was to examine the overlap between autistic and schizotypal personality traits and whether anxiety and depression act as confounding variables in this relationship within a non-clinical population. One hundred and forty-four adults completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21. A number of associations were seen between autistic and schizotypal personality traits. However, negative traits were the only schizotypal feature to uniquely predict global autistic traits, thus highlighting the importance of interpersonal qualities in the overlap of autistic and schizotypal characteristics. The inclusion of anxiety and depression did not alter relationships between autistic and schizotypal traits, indicating that anxiety and depression are not confounders of this relationship. These findings have important implications for the conceptualisation of both disorders.

Predictors of the risk factors for suicide identified by the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behaviour,"The Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS) has been supported by recent research. However, the nature of the models' three major constructs – perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness and acquired capability—requires further investigation. In this paper, we test a number of hypotheses about the predictors and correlates of the IPTS constructs. Participants aged 32–38 from an Australian population-based longitudinal cohort study ( n = 1167) were assessed. IPTS constructs were measured by items from the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ) and Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale (ACSS), alongside demographic and additional measures, measured concurrently or approximately 8 years earlier. Cross-sectional analyses evaluating the IPTS supported earlier work. Mental health was significantly related to all three IPTS constructs, but depression and anxiety caseness were associated only with perceived burdensomeness. Various social support measures were differentially associated with the three constructs. Stressful events and lifetime traumas had robust independent associations with acquired capability for suicide only. The IPTS model provides a useful framework for conceptualising suicide risk. The findings highlight the importance of perceived social support in suicide risk, identify the importance of personality and other factors as new avenues of research, and provide some validation for the independence of the constructs.

Social organizational stressors and post-disaster mental health disturbances: A longitudinal study,"Social organizational stressors are well-known predictors of mental health disturbances (MHD). However, to what extent these stressors predict post-disaster MHD among employed victims hardly received scientific attention and is clearly understudied. For this purpose we examined to what extent these stressors independently predict MHD 1.5 years post-disaster over and above well-known risk factors such as disaster exposure, initial MHD and lack of general social support, life-events in the past 12 months and demographics ( N = 423). Exposure, social organizational stressors and support were significantly associated with almost all examined mental health disturbances on a bi-variate level. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that these stressors, i.e. problems with colleagues, independently predicted anxiety ( Adj. OR = 5.93), depression ( Adj. OR = 4.21), hostility ( Adj. OR = 2.85) and having two or more mental health disturbances ( Adj. OR = 3.39) in contrast to disaster exposure. Disaster exposure independently predicted symptoms of PTSD symptoms ( Adj. OR = 2.47) and agoraphobia ( Adj. OR = 2.15) in contrast to social organizational stressors. Importantly, levels of disaster exposure were not associated nor correlated with (levels of) social organizational stressors. Findings suggest that post-disaster mental health care programs aimed at employed affected residents, should target social organizational stressors besides disaster-related stressors and lack of general social support.

Prolonged grief following the recent death of a daughter among mothers who experienced distal losses during the Khmer Rouge era: Validity of the prolonged grief construct in Cambodia,"This study addressed the validity of the prolonged grief (PG) construct in a Cambodian context. Eighty mothers who lost a young adult daughter stemming from a crowd stampede incident during the annual water festival were interviewed at the six-month post-loss point along with a control group of similarly aged women who were not recently bereaved. Both groups were assessed for PG, PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms and well as for the number of distal losses experienced during the Khmer Rouge (KR) regime—knowing that all the women were old enough to have lived through the KR regime. Support for the discriminant validity of PG was shown in a factor analysis in which its core symptoms were distinguished from anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms. Also, support was found for its incremental validity as shown in the unique sensitivity of PG in distinguishing the two groups when controlling for the other symptoms. Lastly, a positive relationship was found between the number of distal deaths experienced during the KR regime and PG symptom severity among the group of recently bereaved mothers, providing support for the predictive validity of PG. Implications as well as study limitations are discussed.

Comparing perceived public stigma and personal stigma of mental health treatment seeking in a young adult sample,"Perceived public stigma regarding seeking mental health treatment can be a barrier to accessing services for young adults. While factors associating with personal stigma regarding how one would view and treat others have been identified, the discrepancies between perceived and personal stigma have received less research attention. We designed the current study to expand on previous research and examine the discrepancies between perceived public stigma and personal stigma among a sample of 386 primarily White and Asian college students. Participants completed surveys of mental health symptoms, treatment experience and attitudes, perceived public, and personal stigma. Overall, participants generally reported greater perceived public stigma than personal stigma; an effect that was particularly evident for women and those with mental health symptoms. The majority of participants disagreed with items assessing personal stigma. Negative attitudes toward treatment and anxiety symptoms associated with perceived public stigma, while male gender, Asian ethnicity, and negative attitudes toward treatment associated with personal stigma. Findings have implications for interventions and marketing programs to help change perceptions about mental health stigma to encourage utilization of services for those young people who could benefit from care.

Fatigue and relating to others 3 months after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake,"Most inhabitants of Tohoku district suffer from chronic fatigue after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Chronic fatigue following disasters may lead to serious illness, even death. Posttraumatic growth appears to counteract fatigue. We predicted that the chronic fatigue would be inversely related to the posttraumatic growth factor “relating to others,” as represented by mutual helping and a strong sense of connection with humanity. Young 59 healthy volunteers, residing in Miyagi prefecture, were recruited 3 months after the disaster. We measured the subjects' total scores on the Japanese version of the Checklist Individual Strength questionnaire (CIS), the Trait Anxiety (T-A) subscale of the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and four subscores on the posttraumatic growth inventory (PTGI). Stepwise regression analyses were conducted with score on the CIS as the dependent variable and other scores as independent variables. Scores on the “relating to others” factor of the PTGI showed a significant negative relationship with the CIS score, whereas the scores on the T-A subscale of the STAI and the CES-D were positively related to the CIS score. Human ties and mutual help were negatively related to the degree of the chronic fatigue.

Anxiety mediates the association between cannabis use and attenuated positive psychotic symptoms,"Cannabis use has been associated with a continuum of psychotic experiences. However, it is unclear whether mood and anxiety symptoms account for increases in attenuated positive psychotic symptoms (APPS) among cannabis users. We predicted that depression and anxiety symptoms would mediate the relation between cannabis use and APPS, and between cannabis use and endorsement of eight or more distressing APPS (D-APPS), a potentially more clinically meaningful group. Young adults (n=674) completed the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ); Drug Use Frequency measure; Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Trait Form, Anxiety Subscale; and Social Phobia Scale. Results indicated that symptoms of trait anxiety, but not symptoms of depression or social anxiety, mediated the relationship between cannabis use and APPS, as well as the relationship between cannabis use and D-APPS. Results indicate that symptoms of trait anxiety may play a role in the relation between cannabis use and APPS. Findings underscore the importance of considering clinical characteristics co-occurring with psychotic symptoms, such as affective symptoms, when examining the association between cannabis use and psychotic symptoms.

Alexithymia in schizophrenia: Associations with neurocognition and emotional distress,"While alexithymia, or difficulties identifying and describing affect, has been commonly observed in schizophrenia, little is known about its causes and correlates. To test the hypothesis that deficits in emotion identification and expression result from, or are at least related to, deficits in neurocognition and affective symptoms, we assessed alexithymia using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and neurocognition using the MATRICS battery among 65 adults with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in a non-acute phase of illness. Partial correlations controlling for the effects of social desirability revealed that difficulty identifying feelings and externally oriented thinking were linked with greater levels of neurocognitive deficits, while difficulty describing feelings was related to heightened levels of emotional distress. To explore whether neurocognition and affective symptoms were uniquely related to alexithymia, a multiple regression was conducted in which neurocognitive scores and affective symptoms were allowed to enter to predict overall levels of alexithymia after controlling for social desirability. Results revealed both processing speed and anxiety uniquely contributed to the prediction of the total score on the TAS-20. Results suggest that dysfunctions in both cognitive and affective processes may be related to alexithymia in schizophrenia independently of one another.

Overarousal interacts with a sense of fearlessness about death to predict suicide risk in a sample of clinical outpatients,"Converging evidence suggests that acute states of overarousal are common prior to suicidal behavior. Yet, there has been very little theory-driven research of these phenomena. We consider two competing theoretical perspectives. The first is consistent with the interpersonal theory of suicide, which suggests that the prospect of engaging in lethal suicidal behavior should elicit some degree of arousal; however, the effect of arousal will be particularly relevant when considered in the context of an individual's capability for suicide. The second perspective draws from escape-based models, which would suggest that arousal alone should result in increased suicide risk, given the distress associated with high arousal states. Results indicated that the interaction of overarousal and capability for suicide was associated with suicidal symptoms. As overarousal increased, suicidal symptoms increased among high capability individuals and decreased among low capability individuals. These effects were observed beyond the effects of depression, anxiety, age, gender, and marital status. There was no significant main effect of overarousal. Results support a perspective in line with the interpersonal theory, suggesting that overarousal states may be particularly dangerous for individuals who have developed the capability for suicide.

Subjects included members and veterans of Canadian Forces seeking treatment at a hospital-based Operational Stress Injury Clinic ( n = 404). Sleep disturbances and nightmares were measured using individual items on the PTSD Checklist – Military Version (PCL—M), while the suicidality item of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used as a stand-alone item to assess presence or absence of suicidal ideation. Regression analyses were used to determine the respective impact of (1) insomnia and (2) nightmares on suicidal ideation, while controlling for presence of probable PTSD, MDD, GAD, and AUD. We found that 86.9% of patients reported having problems falling or staying asleep and 67.9% of patients reported being bothered by nightmares related to military-specific traumatic events. Neither sleep disturbances nor nightmares significantly predicted suicidal ideation; instead, probable MDD emerged as the most significant predictor. The clinical implications of these findings and their potential impact on treatment guidelines are discussed.

Rasch analysis was applied using RUMM 2030 software to assess the overall fit for unidimensionality. Neither the MADRS₁₀ nor the HAM-D₁₇ was found to fit the Rasch model for unidimensionality. The HAM-D₆ (containing the items of depressed mood, guilt, work and interests, psychomotor retardation, psychic anxiety, and somatic general) as well as the analogue MADRS5 were tested for unidimensionality by use of the RUMM 2030 programme, and only the HAM-D₆ was accepted. When testing for invariance across rating weeks or centres, the RUMM 2030 had to be supplemented with the Friedman two-way analysis of variance by ranks. The HAM-D₆ but not the MADRS₅ was accepted. It was therefore concluded that the HAM-D6 is a psychometrically valid outcome scale to measure change in clinical trials of antidepressants.

Examining the cognitive model of caregiving – A structural equation modelling approach,"The study tests assumptions from the ""cognitive model of caregiving"" (Kuipers et al., 2010), which aims to inform interventions for carers of people with psychoses. The sample comprised 61 relatives of patients with schizophrenia. Standardized psychological assessments were conducted twice within 6 months including Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ-EU), a short form of the Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL K9), the Family Questionnaire (FQ), scales measuring control attributions of the Illness Perception Questionnaire for Schizophrenia (IPQS-R) and emotions toward the ill relative. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse data. We identified two pathways: (a) from ""attributing control to relatives"" to distress, intermediated by anxiety for the patient and emotional overinvolvement (EOI), and (b) from ""attribution control to patient"" to distress, intermediated by anger about the patient and criticism. The model provided a good fit to the data and was successfully replicated at a second point in time. We were able to find supporting evidence for a cognitive model of caregiving. Control attributions and emotions of informal caregivers are important when interventions are planned reducing expressed emotion and burden of caregivers.

Approximately one-third of the veterans reported SI. In multivariate models, PTSD and anxiety diagnoses, severe depression symptoms, being married, and SI assessment by a mental health clinician were associated with more mental health visits in the subsequent year. Depression, PTSD, and anxiety diagnoses, and SI assessment by a mental health clinician were associated with receiving antidepressants. Presence of SI did not significantly affect subsequent year mental health utilization when adjusting for diagnostic and clinician variables, but inaugural visits involving mental health clinicians were consistently associated with subsequent mental health care.

Context and explicit threat cue modulation of the startle reflex: Preliminary evidence of distinctions between adolescents with principal fear disorders versus distress disorders,"Anxiety and depression are prevalent, impairing disorders. High comorbidity has raised questions about how to define and classify them. Structural models emphasize distinctions between “fear” and “distress” disorders while other initiatives propose they be defined by neurobiological indicators that cut across disorders. This study examined startle reflex (SR) modulation in adolescents with principal fear disorders (specific phobia; social phobia) ( n = 20), distress disorders (unipolar depressive disorders, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder) ( n = 9), and controls ( n = 29) during (a) baseline conditions, (b) threat context conditions (presence of contraction pads over the biceps muscle), and (c) an explicit threat cue paradigm involving phases that signaled safety from aversive stimuli (early and late stages of safe phases; early stages of danger phases) and phases that signaled immediate danger of an aversive stimulus (late stages of danger phases). Adolescents with principal fear disorders showed larger SRs than other groups throughout safe phases and early stages of danger phases. SRs did not differ between groups during late danger phases. Adolescents with principal distress disorders showed attenuated SRs during baseline and context conditions compared to other groups.

Attachment anxiety moderates the relationship between childhood maltreatment and attention bias for emotion in adults,"Research indicates that some individuals who were maltreated in childhood demonstrate biases in social information processing. However, the mechanisms through which these biases develop remain unclear—one possible mechanism is via attachment-related processes. Childhood maltreatment increases risk for insecure attachment. The internal working models of self and others associated with insecure attachment may impact the processing of socially relevant information, particularly emotion conveyed in facial expressions. We investigated associations among child abuse, attachment anxiety and avoidance, and attention biases for emotion in an adult population. Specifically, we examined how self-reported attachment influences the relationship between childhood abuse and attention bias for emotion. A dot probe task consisting of happy, threatening, and neutral female facial stimuli was used to assess possible biases in attention for socially relevant stimuli. Our findings indicate that attachment anxiety moderated the relationship between maltreatment and attention bias for happy emotion; among individuals with a child abuse history, attachment anxiety significantly predicted an attention bias away from happy facial stimuli.

Sluggish cognitive tempo and peer functioning in school-aged children: A six-month longitudinal study,"Although research demonstrates sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms to be statistically distinct from other child psychopathologies (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], anxiety, depression, and oppositionality) and associated with social impairment, all studies conducted to date have been cross-sectional. Thus, while extant research demonstrates an association between SCT and social functioning, it is entirely unknown whether or not SCT longitudinally predicts increases in social impairment. This study provides an initial examination of the prospective association between SCT symptoms and children's peer functioning. Teachers of 176 children in 1st–6th grades (ages 6–13; 47% boys) provided ratings of children's psychopathology (i.e., SCT, ADHD, anxious/depressive, and oppositional/ conduct problems) and peer functioning (i.e., popularity, negative social preference, peer impairment), and peer functioning was assessed again 6 months later. Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that, above and beyond child demographics, other psychopathologies, and baseline peer functioning, SCT symptoms were significantly associated with poorer peer functioning at the 6-month follow-up. In addition, 75% of children with high levels of SCT were rated as functionally impaired in the peer domain, in contrast to only 8% of children with low SCT. Further research is needed with larger samples to examine SCT over a longer developmental period and with other domains of adjustment.

Threat processing in generalized social phobia: An investigation of interpretation biases in ambiguous facial affect,"Facial affect is one of the most important information sources during the course of social interactions, but it is susceptible to distortion due to the complex and dynamic nature. Socially anxious individuals have been shown to exhibit alterations in the processing of social information, such as an attentional and interpretative bias toward threatening information. This may be one of the key factors contributing to the development and maintenance of anxious psychopathology. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether a threat-related interpretation bias is evident for ambiguous facial stimuli in a population of individuals with a generalized Social Anxiety Disorder (gSAD) as compared to healthy controls. Participants judged ambiguous happy/fearful, angry/fearful and angry/happy blends varying in intensity and rated the predominant affective expression. The results obtained in this study do not indicate that gSAD is associated with a biased interpretation of ambiguous facial affect.

Family load estimates and risk factors of anxiety disorders in a nationwide three generation study,"The present study investigated how often anxiety disorders with different ages of onset occurred in affected families compared to control families. Furthermore, the study addressed the impact of sex, region of residence, year and month of birth, and parental age at birth. The sample included N=1373 child and adolescent psychiatric participants born between 1952 and 2000 and registered in the Danish Psychiatric Central Register (DPCR) who developed an anxiety disorder before the age of 18. N =4019 controls without any psychiatric diagnosis before age 18, were matched for age, sex, and residential region. Psychiatric diagnoses were also obtained for parents, siblings, and offspring. A family load component was obtained by using various mixed regression models. Anxiety disorders occurred significantly more often in case than in control families. Having a mother, father, or a sibling with the disorder was proven to be a risk factor. Female sex, year of birth, and region of residence were also associated with having an anxiety disorder. Furthermore, case relatives did not develop an anxiety disorder earlier than control relatives. These findings, based on a very large and representative dataset, provide further and solid evidence for the family aggregation of anxiety disorders.

Chronic fatigue syndrome and personality: A case-control study using the alternative five factor model,"Neuroticism is the personality dimension most frequently associated with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Most studies have also shown that CFS patients are less extraverted than non-CFS patients, but results have been inconsistent, possibly because the facets of the extraversion dimension have not been separately analyzed. This study has the following aims: to assess the personality profile of adults with CFS using the Alternative Five-Factor Model (AFFM), which considers Activity and Sociability as two separate factors of Extraversion, and to test the discriminant validity of a measure of the AFFM, the Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire, in differentiating CFS subjects from normal-range matched controls. The CFS sample consisted of 132 consecutive patients referred for persistent fatigue or pain to the Department of Medicine of a university hospital. These were compared with 132 matched normal population controls. Significantly lower levels of Activity and significantly higher levels of Neuroticism-Anxiety best discriminated CFS patients from controls. The results are consistent with existing data on the relationship between Neuroticism and CFS, and clarify the relationship between Extraversion and CFS by providing new data on the relationship of Activity to CFS.

"Anxiety, depression, impulsivity and substance misuse in violent and non-violent adolescent boys in detention in China","The present investigation aims to identify the factors which differentiate violent from non-violent juvenile offenders, with a particular emphasis on the association between internalizing psychiatric morbidity (i.e. anxiety and depression), impulsivity, substance misuse, and violence. A total of 323 incarcerated male juvenile offenders from one of three Youth Detention Centers (YDCs) in China were recruited between August 2007 and November 2008. Interviews were conducted by trained psychiatrists using the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11), the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), and the Birleson Depression Self-Rating Scale (DSRS) to assess impulsivity, anxiety and depression, respectively. The Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Present and Lifetime (K-SADS-PL) was also used to assess psychiatric diagnoses. Violent offenders had significantly higher BIS-11 total scores, and attention and nonplanning subscale scores ( p &lt; 0.05). In the multiple logistic regression model, substance use disorders (SUD) and BIS-11 total scores independently predicted violence. Prison-based treatment services designed to reduce impulsivity and substance misuse in juvenile detention facilities should be prioritized.

Text messaging: Are dependency and Excessive Use discretely different for Japanese university students?,"Text messaging may be excessive and young people may be dependent on it. We distributed the Self-perception of Text-message Dependency Scale (STDS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) to 223 Japanese university students in a two-wave study, separated by a 5-month interval. The STDS yielded a three-factor structure. The STDS scores across the two measurement occasions were stable across time (except for the Relationship Maintenance subscale). A hierarchical cluster analysis suggested a three-class structure interpreted as Normal Users, Excessive Users, and Dependent Users. Excessive Users and Dependent Users were characterized by a young age at initial mobile phone use, more frequent use of text messaging, higher Novelty Seeking, and better Other-Model patterns of adult attachment. Unlike Excessive Users, Dependent Users were characterized by lower Self-directedness, poorer Self-Model of adult attachment, and higher anxiety and depression. The Excessive Users, but not the Dependent Users, were characterized by high Reward Dependence and Co-operativeness. The present study demonstrated that the STDS has a robust factor structure, good construct validity, and temporal stability (except for Relationship Maintenance subscale); students could be classified into normal, excessive, and Dependent Users of the text messaging; and Dependent Users were characterized by Excessive Use and personality immaturity.

The prospective role of defeat and entrapment in depression and anxiety: A 12-month longitudinal study,"The concepts of “defeat” (representing failed social struggle) and “entrapment” (representing an inability to escape from a situation) have emerged from the animal literature, providing insight into the health consequences of low social rank. Evolutionary models suggest that these constructs co-occur and can lead to the development of mental disorders, although there is limited empirical evidence supporting these predictions. Participants ( N = 172) were recruited from economically deprived areas in North England. Over half of participants (58%) met clinical cut-offs for depression and anxiety, therefore we conducted analyses to establish whether participant outcomes were dependent on baseline defeat and entrapment levels. Participants completed measures of defeat, entrapment, depression and anxiety at two time-points twelve months apart. Factor analysis demonstrated that defeat and entrapment were best defined as one factor, suggesting that the experiences co-occurred. Regression analyses demonstrated that changes in depression and anxiety between T1 and T2 were predicted from baseline levels of defeat and entrapment; however, changes in defeat and entrapment were also predicted from baseline depression and anxiety. There are implications for targeting perceptions of defeat and entrapment within psychological interventions for people experiencing anxiety and depression and screening individuals to identify those at risk of developing psychopathology.

Medication burden in bipolar disorder: A chart review of patients at psychiatric hospital admission,"Individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) often receive complex polypharmacy regimens as part of treatment, yet few studies have sought to evaluate patient characteristics associated with this high medication burden. This retrospective chart review study examined rates of complex polypharmacy (i.e., ≥ 4 psychotropic medications), patterns of psychotropic medication use, and their demographic and clinical correlates in a naturalistic sample of adults with bipolar I disorder (BDI; N = 230) presenting for psychiatric hospital admission. Using a computer algorithm, a hospital administrator extracted relevant demographic, clinical, and community treatment information for analysis. Patients reported taking an average of 3.31 (S.D. = 1.46) psychotropic medications, and 5.94 (S.D. = 3.78) total medications at intake. Overall, 82 (36%) met criteria for complex polypharmacy. Those receiving complex polypharmacy were significantly more likely to be female, to be depressed, to have a comorbid anxiety disorder, and to have a history of suicide attempt. Women were significantly more likely than men to be prescribed antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and stimulants, even after controlling for mood episode polarity. Study data highlight the high medication burden experienced by patients with BD, especially those who are acutely symptomatic. Data also highlight the particularly high medication burden experienced by women with BD; a burden not fully accounted for by depression.

Alexithymia in patients with substance use disorders: State or trait?,"Previous research on substance use disorders (SUD) has yielded conflicting results concerning whether alexithymia is a state or trait, raising the question of how alexithymia should be addressed in the treatment of SUD-patients. The absolute and relative stabilities of alexithymia were assessed using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and its subscales. In total, 101 patients with SUD were assessed twice during a 3-week inpatient detoxification period while controlling for withdrawal symptoms and personality disorder traits. The relative stability of the total TAS-20 and subscales was moderate to high but showed remarkable differences between baseline low, moderate, and high alexithymic patients. A small reduction in the mean levels of the total TAS-20 scores and those of one subscale revealed the absence of absolute stability. The levels of alexithymia were unrelated to changes in withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety- and depression-like symptoms. The differences between low, moderate, and high alexithymic patients in terms of the change in alexithymia scores between baseline and follow-up indicated a strong regression to the mean. The findings suggest that alexithymia in SUD patients as measured using the TAS-20 is both a state and trait phenomenon and does not appear to be related to changes in anxietyand depression-like symptoms.

Bifactor structural model of symptom checklists: SCL-90-R and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) in a non-clinical community sample,"The Derogatis symptom checklist (SCL-90-R) and its short version, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), are widely used instruments, despite the fact that their factor structures were not clearly confirmed. The goals of this research were to compare four measurement models of these instruments including one-factor, nine-factor, a second-ordered factor model and a bifactor model, in addition to testing the gender difference in symptom factors in a community sample. SCL-90-R was assessed in a large community survey which included 2710 adults who represent the population of Hungary. Statistical analyses included a series of confirmatory factor analyses and multiple indicator multiple cause (MIMIC modeling). The responses to items were treated as ordinal scales. The analysis revealed that the bifactor model yielded the closest fit in both the full SCL-90-R and BSI; however the nine-factor model also had an acceptable level of fit. As for the gender differences, women scored higher on global severity, somatization, obsession-compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression and anxiety factors. Men scored higher on hostility and psychoticism. The bifactor model of symptom checklist supports the concept of global symptom severity and specific symptom factors. Global symptom severity explains the large correlations between symptom factors.

Psychopathological and personality traits underlie decision making in recent onset medication naïve anorexia nervosa: A pilot study,"The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) analyzes the ability of participants to sacrifice immediate rewards in view of a long term gain. Anorexia Nervosa (AN) in addition to weight loss and body image disturbances is also characterized by the tendency to make decisions that may result in long-term negative outcomes. Studies that analyzed IGT performance in patients with AN were not consistent with each other. Fifteen adolescents with AN and 15 matched controls carried out IGT after being clinically and neuropsychologically evaluated. An interesting generalized estimating equation approach showed that four independent clinical variables, and not the group, explained IGT performances, such as blocks repetition, anxiety, psychogenic eating disorders and self transcendence. The impairment of decision making is not related to the diagnosis of AN, but it is driven by high levels of anxiety and self transcendence. Instead, some psychogenic eating disorders traits, related to illness severity, positively affected IGT performance in the whole sample. IGT impairment in AN found by prior studies could be related to these clinical features which are not always taken into account.

Social support as a predictor of the outcome of depressive and anxiety disorder in short-term and long-term psychotherapy,"Social support is known to be important for well-being of individuals, but it is not clear how it predicts psychotherapy outcome in patients suffering from depressive or anxiety disorders. The aim of the present study was to study the prediction of social support on the outcome of short-term and long-term psychotherapy. In the Helsinki Psychotherapy Study, 326 psychiatric outpatients, aged 20–46 years, and suffering from depressive or anxiety disorders, were randomly assigned to short-term psychotherapy (short-term psychodynamic or solution-focused) or long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy. The level of social support at baseline was assessed using the Brief Inventory of Social Support and Integration (BISSI). Psychiatric symptoms were assessed with the Symptom Check List, Global Severity Index (SCL-90-GSI) at baseline and four times during a 3-year follow-up. Patients with a high level of social support before treatment benefitted more from long-term than short-term therapy at the 3-year follow-up, whereas patients with a low level of social support experienced no such benefit. Pretreatment social support seems to predict differentially short- and long-term psychotherapy and thus needs to be acknowledged when evaluating patient0s resources and treatment options. More research is needed to verify these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2014
Eating disorders: Predictors of change in the quality of life of caregivers,"Eating disorders (EDs) have a strong impact on the quality of life (QoL) of caregivers. This study explores the longitudinal changes in the QoL of ED caregivers at 1 (T1; n =109) and 2 years (T2; n =32) follow-up, and identifies predictors of improvement at 1-year follow-up. ED outpatients also completed a battery of tests at T1 ( n =69) and T2 ( n =11). Multivariate hierarchical linear mixed models were used, in which the caregivers' 1-year changes in QoL, anxiety and depression scores were analysed as the dependent variables. Predictor variables were the caregivers' perception of burden, perception of the severity of the patient's ED, kinship data, and the ED person's scores on QoL, anxiety depression and ED symptoms. Higher scores in mental health and low perception of burden at baseline predicted improved caregiver QoL at 1-year follow-up. The caregivers' QoL improved if the perception of burden decreased over time and if depression of the patient improved. The results suggest that interventions directed to reduce the caregivers' perception of burden and to improve the mental health of the ED patients would lead to improved caregiver QoL. The high attrition rate at T2 made prediction analyses unviable.

Temperament and character and psychopathy in male conduct disordered offenders,"Adult male offenders with high psychopathy scores are characterized by high Novelty Seeking, low Harm Avoidance and low Cooperativeness; temperament and character traits that may moderate treatment outcomes. This is the first study to investigate if a similar profile is present in juveniles. One hundred and twenty two incarcerated juvenile male offenders who met the criteria for conduct disorder in the absence of current psychiatric disorder (e.g. psychosis, depression, anxiety) were rated on the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and the Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL: YV). PCL: YV total score was positively correlated with Novelty Seeking but negatively correlated with Cooperativeness and Harm Avoidance. Examination of the PCL: YV facets indicated a significant negative correlation between Harm Avoidance and PCL: YV Interpersonal and PCL: YV Antisocial; and Reward Dependence and Cooperativeness and PCL: YV Lifestyle/Behavioral. Relationships were primarily with lifestyle/behavioral and antisocial facets of psychopathy. The TCI profile resembles that seen in adult offenders and has implications for treatment as low cooperativeness and reward dependency are likely to be key responsivity factors that need to be addressed in treatment planning.

The importance of distinguishing between the different eating disorders (sub)types when assessing emotion regulation strategies,"People with eating disorders (ED) have difficulties regulating their emotions adaptively. Little is known about differences and similarities between different types of ED and how these regulation difficulties relate to other emotional problems. The present study examines maladaptive (suppression) and adaptive (cognitive reappraisal) emotion regulation strategies in women with different ED and relationships with anxiety and depression levels. In 32 women with AN restrictive subtype (ANR), 32 with AN binge-purge subtype (ANBP), 30 with bulimia nervosa (BN), 29 with binge eating disorder (BED), and 64 healthy women, the ERQ (emotion regulation) as well as STAI-T (anxiety), BDI-SF (depression), and EDDS (eating pathology) were administered. Women across different ED subtypes were inclined to suppress emotions and lacked the capacity to reappraise emotions (except women with ANBP). Correlational relations of suppression and reappraisal with anxiety and depression levels differed across ED groups. Emotion regulation problems were found across ED subtypes. However, the types of emotion regulation problems, and the effect of coexisting other emotional problems such as anxiety and depression may differ across ED subtypes. These findings illustrate the importance to of considering ED subtypes in emotion regulation research rather than consider ED as a whole.

An initial investigation of the relationships between hoarding and smoking,"Cigarette smokers have increased rates of mood and anxiety-related conditions. Hoarding is another anxiety-related condition that has yet to be examined in relation to smoking behavior. The current investigation sought to examine smoking rates among a sample of individuals with hoarding disorder and individuals with non-hoarding obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Additionally, we examined the relationship between hoarding symptoms and reasons for smoking. Participants in Study 1 consisted of 57 individuals with non-hoarding OCD or hoarding disorder. Participants in Study 2 consisted of 661 adult daily smokers. Results revealed that a significantly greater proportion of individuals diagnosed with hoarding were current smokers compared to the non-hoarding OCD group. Additionally, hoarding severity was associated with negative affect reduction expectancies. These results provide important information regarding smoking behaviors within hoarding disorder. Given the poor treatment outcomes and negative health risks associated with hoarding, this information could inform future research and treatment programs.

Help-seeking adolescents from Australia ( N = 147; mean age: 17.7 years; 58.8% female) completed the original, 90-item MASQ. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the construct validity (a 3-factor structure) of the original MASQ and the MASQ-D30. Internal consistencies and correlations with other instruments were calculated and compared between versions. CFA showed that the intended 3-factor structure fit adequately to the MASQ-D30 data (CFI = 0.95; RMSEA = 0.08). Internal consistencies ranged from 0.85 to 0.92 across the scales and patterns of correlations with the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) indicated adequate convergent/divergent properties. Importantly, the observed psychometric characteristics were comparable with the original MASQ and alternative short-forms.

The latent structure of generalized anxiety disorder in midlife adults,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is identified as a discrete disorder in the DSM-5, but evidence suggests that GAD and the related construct of pathological worry possesses a dimensional latent structure. The objective of this study was to ascertain the latent structure of GAD using taxometric methods. A subsample of adults ( N =2061) from the Midlife in the United States Study, a national sample of Americans, provided the data. Additional data from individuals who were re-interviewed 10 year later ( n =1228) were also analyzed. Items corresponding to the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for GAD were used to generate indicators for the taxometric analyses. Multiple taxometric procedures provided no evidence that GAD has a categorical or taxonic latent structure. Instead, the results were more consistent with the proposition that GAD exists on a continuum. Evidence that GAD is dimensional suggests that dichotomizing individuals into GAD versus non-GAD groups will typically result in decreased statistical power. They also suggest that any diagnostic thresholds for identifying GAD are likely to be arbitrary. The findings are consistent with models that locate GAD within the framework of extant dimensional models of personality and with research that emphasizes a multifactorial etiology for GAD.

Participants with NPD reported higher levels of explicit shame than non-clinical controls, but lower levels than patients with BPD. Levels of guilt-proneness did not differ among the three study groups. The implicit shame-self associations (relative to anxiety-self associations) were significantly stronger among patients with NPD compared to nonclinical controls and BPD patients.

"Attachment insecurities, maladaptive perfectionism, and eating disorder symptoms: A latent mediated and moderated structural equation modeling analysis across diagnostic groups","Although 96–100% of individuals with eating disorders (EDs) report insecure attachment, the specific mechanisms by which adult insecure attachment dimensions affect ED symptomatology remain to date largely unknown. This study examined maladaptive perfectionism as both a mediator and a moderator of the relationship between insecure attachment (anxiety and avoidance) and ED symptomatology in a clinical, treatment seeking, sample. Insecure anxious and avoidant attachment, maladaptive perfectionism, and ED symptomatology were assessed in 403 participants from three medium size specialized care centres for EDs in Italy. Structural equation modeling indicated that maladaptive perfectionism served as mediator between both insecure attachment patterns and ED symptomatology. It also interacted with insecure attachment to predict higher levels of ED symptoms—highlighting the importance of both insecure attachment patterns and maladaptive aspects of perfectionism as treatment targets. Multiple-group comparison analysis did not reveal differences across diagnostic groups (AN, BN, EDNOS) in mediating, main and interaction effects of perfectionism. These findings are consistent with recent discussions on the classification and treatment of EDs that have highlighted similarities between ED diagnostic groups and could be viewed through the lens of the Trans-theoretical Model of EDs. Implications for future research and intervention are discussed.

Pre-morbid alexithymia in panic disorder: A cohort study,"Whether alexithymia is a personality trait which increases the risk of Panic Disorder (PD) is still debated. In this prospective study, alexithymic levels were evaluated before, during and after an anxious episode. Therefore, the alexithymic levels, the presence of PD and the severity of anxious-depressive symptoms were evaluated, at intervals of about 1 month, in pregnant women, attending the Centers for Prenatal Care, using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Twenty-one women affected by PD and 256 healthy women (controls) were included in the study. Women who developed PD, compared to controls, showed similar TAS-20 and HADS scores during the pre-morbid phase, a significant increase of them during PD and a significant decrease after symptoms improvement, whereas no change was observed in controls. Our data suggest that in pregnant women alexithymia does not represent a personality trait that increases the risk of developing PD, and they support the hypothesis that alexithymia is a state dependent phenomenon in PD pregnant women.

All subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, except emotional functioning, were lower than normal at baseline. Little change in patients' QOL was observed during the waiting period. In the HADS, there were significantly higher anxiety scores in caregivers than in patients both at baseline and after 1–2 months and the third assessment, with the difference after 3–5 months reaching almost significance. Caregivers' anxiety levels increased significantly. Relatives showed more depression than patients only at month 1–2 and a significant increase in depression from baseline to month 1–2. In patients, depression scores remained relatively stable throughout all visits. Our results emphasize the importance of evaluation of psychic stress especially in relatives during the waiting period for LTx.

Prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the first trimester of pregnancy and factors associated with current suicide risk,"This study aimed to describe the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and to identify the factors associated with Current Suicide Risk (CSR) in the first trimester of pregnancy. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) was employed to diagnose mental disorders in 239 women enrolled in a prospective cohort in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Serum lipids, leptin and socio-economic status were the independent variables. CSR, the dependent variable, was entered as binary (yes/no) variable into crude and adjusted Poisson regression models with robust variances. CSR was found to be the main psychiatric syndrome (18.4%), followed by agoraphobia (17.2%), major depressive disorder (15.1%) and generalized anxiety disorder (10.5%). Women with CSR showed higher mean levels of cholesterol (169.2 vs. 159.2; p = 0.017), high density lipoprotein (50.4 vs. 47.7; p = 0.031) and low density lipoprotein (102.8 vs. 95.6; p = 0.022) when compared to women without CSR. The adjusted regression model showed a higher prevalence ratio (PR) of CSR among pregnant women with generalized anxiety disorder ( PR = 2.70, 95% CI: 1.36–5.37), with ≥ two parturitions ( PR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.22–4.93), and with major depressive disorder ( PR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.08–4.12). We have shown that generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder and higher parity are associated with CSR in the first trimester of pregnancy.

The influence of shift work on cognitive functions and oxidative stress,"Shift work influences health, performance, activity, and social relationships, and it causes impairment in cognitive functions. In this study, we investigated the effects of shift work on participants' cognitive functions in terms of memory, attention, and learning, and we measured the effects on oxidative stress. Additionally, we investigated whether there were significant relationships between cognitive functions and whole blood oxidant/antioxidant status of participants. A total of 90 health care workers participated in the study, of whom 45 subjects were night-shift workers. Neuropsychological tests were administered to the participants to assess cognitive function, and blood samples were taken to detect total antioxidant capacity and total oxidant status at 08:00. Differences in anxiety, depression, and chronotype characteristics between shift work groups were not significant. Shift workers achieved significantly lower scores on verbal memory, attention–concentration, and the digit span forward sub-scales of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), as well as on the immediate memory and total learning subscales of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT). Oxidative stress parameters were significantly associated with some types of cognitive function, including attention–concentration, recognition, and long-term memory. These findings suggest that night shift work may result in significantly poorer cognitive performance, particularly working memory.

The effect of focused attention and open monitoring meditation on attention network function in healthy volunteers,"Mindfulness meditation techniques are increasingly popular both as a life-style choice and therapeutic adjunct for a range of mental and physical health conditions. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which mindfulness meditation and its constituent practices might produce positive change in cognition and emotion. Our study directly compared the effects of Focused Attention (FA) and Open-Monitoring (OM) meditation on alerting, orienting and executive attention network function in healthy individuals. Participants were randomized to three intervention groups: open-focused meditation, focused attention, and relaxation control. Participants completed an emotional variant of the Attention Network Test (ANT) at baseline and post-intervention. OM and FA practice improved executive attention, with no change observed in the relaxation control group. Improvements in executive attention occurred in the absence of change in subjective/self-report mood and cognitive function. Baseline levels of dispositional/trait mindfulness were positively correlated with executive control in the ANT at baseline. Our results suggest that mindfulness meditation might usefully target deficits in executive attention that characterise mood and anxiety disorders.

Depressive symptoms and sleep: A population-based polysomnographic study,"The goals of the present study were to determine the prevalence of depression in the adult population of Sao Paulo, Brazil and to explore the relationship among sociodemographic, physical and psychological factors, sleep-related symptoms and polysomnography parameters. Participants of a cross-sectional study ( N = 1101) were administered questionnaires and submitted to polysomnography. A score 420 in the Beck Depression Inventory was used to describe depression. Results revealed that the prevalence of depression was 10.9%. Estimates were higher in women and were significantly higher among housewives, non-workers and individuals with lower education and income. A combination of sleep-related symptoms and impaired quality of life was 2.5 times more frequent among depressed than non-depressed. Co-morbid insomnia and anxiety were positively associated to depressive symptomatology. There were no alterations in the polysomnography parameters, in either group. The occurrence of sleep apnea with values on the apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 5 was similar and frequent in both groups (around 30%). The findings suggest that depressive symptoms were associated with low education, low income, severe comorbid symptomatology, and impaired quality of life. Considering the high prevalence of sleep apnea, these results point to potential social and financial burdens associated with the depressive symptomatology and various sleep diagnoses.

More stressors prior to and during the course of bipolar illness in patients from the United States compared with the Netherlands and Germany,"Considerable data suggest that compared to some European countries, in the U.S. there are more childhood onset bipolar disorders, more adverse courses of illness, and greater treatment resistance. Psychosocial variables related to these findings have not been adequately explored. Therefore we analyzed psychosocial stressors in three time domains: childhood; the year prior to illness Onset; and the Last Episode from questionnaires in 968 outpatients (mean age 41) with bipolar I or II disorder; 676 from four sites in the U.S. and 292 from three in the Netherlands and Germany (abbreviated here as Europe). Compared to the Europeans, those from the U.S. had significantly more stressors in childhood and prior to the last episode. Stressors prior to the last episode were related to: childhood stressors; an earlier age at illness onset; anxiety and substance abuse comorbidity; lower income; both parents having an affective illness; and feeling more stigma. These data suggest a greater prevalence of adverse life events in childhood and over the course of bipolar illness in the U.S. compared to the Netherlands and Germany. Clinical, therapeutic, and public health approaches to these illness-relevant stressors require further exploration.

Do depression and anxiety mediate the relationship between meta-cognitive beliefs and psychological dimensions of auditory hallucinations and delusions in schizophrenia?,"We investigated if depression and anxiety mediate the relationship between meta-cognitive beliefs and psychological dimensions of delusions and hallucinations in schizophrenia subjects ( n = 74). Depression, but not anxiety, mediated the relationship between certain dysfunctional meta-cognitive beliefs and psychological dimensions of delusions. Although direct effects between hallucination dimensions and certain meta-cognitive beliefs were found, anxiety and depression did not serve as mediators in this relationship. The results suggest a significant pathway from meta-cognition to delusions through depression.

Predictors of quality of life and caregiver burden among maternal and paternal caregivers of patients with eating disorders,"This prospective study investigated quality of life and caregiver burden of 244 parent caregivers of 113 Spanish patients with Eating Disorders (ED). One hundred eleven mothers and 70 fathers fulfilled the inclusion criteria. ED patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Eating Attitudes Test-26. Caregivers completed the HADS, the Short Form-12 (SF-12), the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire-EU version, and the Anorectic Behaviour Observation Scale. Descriptive statistics, ANOVA, Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were applied. Among mothers, anxiety and depression and patient age contributed to poorer quality of life. Caregiver variables that affected the burden for mothers were marital status, the mental subscale of the SF-12, and the mother's perception of the severity of her child's illness. Caregiver variables that affected the burden for fathers were the caregiver's anxiety and the physical domain of the SF-12. Among mothers but not fathers, being married was a protective factor of caregiver burden. Our findings suggest that mothers and fathers have different perceptions of their quality of life and caregiver burden, and that mothers of patients with ED may be in considerable need for extra psychosocial support.

"The impact of self-efficacy, alexithymia and multiple traumas on posttraumatic stress disorder and psychiatric co-morbidity following epileptic seizures: A moderated mediation analysis","This study investigated the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and psychiatric co-morbidity following epileptic seizure, whether alexithymia mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and psychiatric outcomes, and whether the mediational effect was moderated by the severity of PTSD from other traumas. Seventy-one ( M = 31, F = 40) people with a diagnosis of epilepsy recruited from support groups in the United Kingdom completed the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 and the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale. They were compared with 71 people ( M = 29, F = 42) without epilepsy. For people with epilepsy, 51% and 22% met the diagnostic criteria for post-epileptic seizure PTSD and for PTSD following one other traumatic life event respectively. For the control group, 24% met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD following other traumatic life events. The epilepsy group reported significantly more anxiety and depression than the control. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis showed that self-efficacy was significantly correlated with alexithymia, post-epileptic seizure PTSD and psychiatric co-morbidity. Alexithymia was also significantly correlated with post-epileptic seizure PTSD and psychiatric co-morbidity. Mediation analyses confirmed that alexithymia mediated the path between self-efficacy and post-epileptic seizure PTSD and psychiatric co-morbidity. Moderated mediation also confirmed that self-efficacy and PTSD from one other trauma moderated the effect of alexithymia on outcomes. To conclude, people can develop posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and psychiatric co-morbidity following epileptic seizure. These psychiatric outcomes are closely linked with their belief in personal competence to deal with stressful situations and regulate their own functioning, to process rather than defend against distressing emotions, and with the degree of PTSD from other traumas.

Relationship between maladaptive cognitions about sleep and recovery in patients with borderline personality disorder,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been associated with maladaptive cognitive processes including dysfunctional attitudes and a negative attribution style. Comorbid insomnia affects the course of multiple psychiatric disorders, and has been associated with the absence of recovery from BPD. Because dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes are common among patients with insomnia, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between maladaptive sleep-related cognitions and recovery status (symptomatic remission plus good concurrent psychosocial functioning) in patients with BPD. Two hundred and twenty three BPD patients participating in the McLean Study of Adult Development (MSAD) were administered the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep questionnaire (DBAS-16) as part of the 16-year follow-up wave. Maladaptive sleep cognitions were compared between recovered ( n = 105) and non-recovered ( n = 118) BPD participants, in analyses that adjusted for age, sex, depression, anxiety, and primary sleep disorders. Results demonstrated that non-recovered BPD patients had significantly more severe maladaptive sleep-related cognitions as measured by the overall DBAS-16 score. These results demonstrate an association between dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep and recovery status among BPD patients. Further research is warranted to evaluate treatments targeted towards maladaptive sleep-related cognitions, and their subsequent effects on the course of BPD.

Freshman year mental health symptoms and level of adaptation as predictors of Internet addiction: A retrospective nested case-control study of male Chinese college students,"A retrospective nested case-control study was designed to explore whether freshman year mental health status and level of adaptation are predictors of Internet addiction. The study cohort was 977 college students at a university in northwest China. In the first college year, the students' mental health status and adaptation level were assessed using the Chinese College Student Mental Health Scale (CCSMHS) and the Chinese College Student Adjustment Scale (CCSAS). In the following 1–3 years, 62 Internet-addicted subjects were identified using Young's 8-item diagnostic questionnaire. Controls were matched for demographic characteristics. Using logistic regression analysis, freshman year mental health status, including factors such as somatization, anxiety, depression and self-contempt, and freshman year adaptive problems were found to be causal factors and predictors of Internet addiction. Freshman with features of depression, learning maladaptation and dissatisfaction could be an important target-intervention population for reducing Internet addiction.

The role of anxiety sensitivity in the experience of menstrual-related symptoms reported via daily diary,"The current study examined the interactive effects of Anxiety Sensitivity (AS) and menstrual cycle phase in the experience of menstrual-related symptoms. Participants were 55 community women who completed prospective tracking of menstrual-related symptoms across at least one full menstrual cycle using the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) and completed the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) once in their premenstrual and follicular cycle phases. Results revealed that women with higher levels of AS reported greater menstrual-related symptoms, regardless of cycle phase, as compared to women with lower levels of AS. These findings suggest that AS may be an important psychological factor involved in the experience of psychological and somatic symptoms across the menstrual cycle. Results are consistent with previous literature documenting the role of AS in menstrual-related symptoms as well as in other physical health conditions.

French version of the Family Attitude Scale: Psychometric properties and relation of attitudes to the respondent's psychiatric status,"The Family Attitude Scale (FAS) is a self-report measure of critical or hostile attitudes and behaviors towards another family member, and demonstrates an ability to predict relapse in psychoses. Data are not currently available on a French version of the scale. The present study developed a French version of the FAS, using a large general population sample to test its internal structure, criterion validity and relationships with the respondents' symptoms and psychiatric diagnoses, and examined the reciprocity of FAS ratings by respondents and their partners. A total of 2072 adults from an urban population undertook a diagnostic interview and completed self-report measures, including an FAS about their partner. A subset of participants had partners who also completed the FAS. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed an excellent fit by a single-factor model, and the FAS demonstrated a strong association with dyadic adjustment. FAS scores of respondents were affected by their anxiety levels and mood, alcohol and anxiety diagnoses, and moderate reciprocity of attitudes and behaviors between the partners was seen. The French version of the FAS has similarly strong psychometric properties to the original English version. Future research should assess the ability of the French FAS to predict relapse of psychiatric disorders.

Treatment inadequacy in primary and specialized care patients with depressive and/or anxiety disorders,"All guidelines on major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders recommend pharmacotherapy and/or psychological treatment for moderate to severe disease. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate treatment inadequacy, both pharmacological and psychological, in a large naturalistic cohort of subjects with MDD and anxiety disorders from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. All subjects with a current 6-month diagnosis were included ( n = 1662). Demographic data, clinical features and actual medication use were assessed in face-to-face interviews. In moderate to severe MDD, 43% of the subjects were not treated sufficiently with antidepressants or psychological treatment. In primary health care patients, this undertreatment was 70%. In moderate to severe anxiety disorders, 44% of the subjects were not treated sufficiently with antidepressants, benzodiazepines or psychological treatment. Among antidepressant users with moderate to severe MDD, 21% of the pharmacotherapy was inadequate with respect to drug choice, dose and every day use. Undertreatment and pharmacotherapeutic inadequacy are common in moderate to severe MDD and anxiety disorders. Both are more pronounced in primary care than in specialized care. This may be partly due to differences in disease recognition and help seeking behaviour.

Cone of direct gaze as a marker of social anxiety in males,"The fear of being scrutinised is a core feature of social anxiety disorder and socially anxious individuals overestimate being ‘looked at’. A recent development in the vision sciences is a reliable psychophysical index of the range of eye gaze angles judged as being directed at oneself (Cone of Direct Gaze: CoDG). We tested the CoDG as a measure of “being looked at” in social anxiety. Participants were stratified into high/low social anxiety groups and asked to judge whether they were being ‘looked at’ by computerised male faces varying in eye gaze deviation and facial emotion. High socially anxious males had a wider CoDG than low socially anxious males; high and low socially anxious females did not differ. Fearful faces elicited narrower cones than neutral or angry faces; however, the effect size was small and not evident for the high socially anxious males. Measures of subjective reactions to the study, and to being looked at in general, indicated that the results may be in part due to males suffering more discomfort when being looked at. The results show that measures derived from psychophysics, in this case, the CoDG, have potential as clinical and research tools for measuring anxiety about being scrutinised.

The current study examined associations between BIS/BAS sensitivity, ERD, and SQ to depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in an undergraduate sample ( n = 459). Positive relationships between BIS sensitivity and both ERD and stress symptoms, and negative relationships between BAS-reward sensitivity and both ERD and depression symptoms were observed. Furthermore, ERD were positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Succeeding analyses revealed differential relationships between ERD and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among good quality and poor quality sleepers.

Anxiety comorbidity in schizophrenia,"Diagnostic and treatment hierarchical reductionisms have led to an oversight of anxiety syndromes in schizophrenia. Nevertheless, recent data have indicated that anxiety can be a significant source of morbidity in this patient group. This paper reviews current knowledge concerning anxiety comorbidity in schizophrenia, its epidemiology, course, and treatment. A computerized search of the literature published from 1966 to July 2012 was conducted on Medline. Comorbid anxiety disorders are present in 38.3% of subjects with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The most common anxiety disorder is social phobia followed by post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. The presence and severity of symptoms of anxiety are associated with more severe clinical features and poorer outcomes. Available literature on the treatment consists primarily of case reports and open trials. Fragments of data support the notion of treating these anxiety states and syndromes as co-occurring clinical conditions with adjunctive medications and psychosocial interventions. However, additional work remains to be done on this issue before firm conclusions can be drawn.

Predictors of trait dissociation and peritraumatic dissociation induced via cold pressor,"Understanding which factors predict individual dissociative response during stressful situations is important to clarify the nature of dissociation and the mechanisms associated to its use as a coping strategy. The present study examined (1) whether experiential avoidance (EA), anxiety sensitivity (AS), depressive symptoms, and state anxiety concurrently predicted trait dissociation (TD)—absorption, amnesia, depersonalization, and total TD scores—and laboratory induced dissociation (LID); and (2) whether TD and catastrophizing predicted LID. We also examined whether catastrophizing mediated the relationships between both AS and depressive symptoms and LID. A total of 101 female undergraduate students participated in a cold pressor task, which significantly induced dissociation. Results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that AS at Time 1 (9 months before the experimental session), as well as depressive symptoms and catastrophizing at the time of the experiment (Time 2), predicted LID at Time 2. Depressive symptoms at Time 2 predicted total TD, absorption, and amnesia scores. AS at Time 1 and depressive symptoms at Time 2 predicted depersonalization. AS, depressive symptoms, and catastrophizing seem to facilitate the use of dissociative strategies by healthy individuals, even in response to non-traumatic but discomforting stress.

Social anxiety is associated with general but not specific biases in emotion recognition,"Misreading facial expressions as signals of social disapproval, such as anger and disgust, may maintain social anxiety. If so, manipulating face processing could be therapeutic. It remains unclear, however, whether socially anxious individuals are in fact more sensitive to disapproving emotions. We assessed decoding of, and cost attributions to, emotional expressions in high and low socially anxious females ( n = 102) using five emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) expressed at 15 intensities (9–65%), providing 75 stimuli (see Supplementary Material). The decoding task briefly presented the stimuli and participants identified the emotion. The cost attribution task asked individuals to rate each stimulus for how costly it would be for them to interact with the person. Random effects regression indicated that social anxiety was not associated with overall decoding accuracy but was associated with a response bias. High socially anxious individuals had a lower threshold for decoding emotions but also more frequently classified low intensity emotions incorrectly. These effects were not emotion-specific. Socially anxious individuals also attributed excessive social cost to expressions of negative valence. Our results provide a novel conceptual framework for understanding emotion decoding in social anxiety, indicating the importance of considering both accuracy and response bias.

Nonverbal expressive behaviour in schizophrenia and social phobia,"Expressive behaviour plays a crucial role in the success of social interactions. Abnormality of expressive behaviour has been reported in interpersonal interactions of patients suffering from schizophrenia and social phobia, two debilitating mental disorders with important social deficits. However, no study has compared the expressive behaviour in these two disorders. Thirty schizophrenia patients, 21 social phobia patients and 30 healthy controls were evaluated and compared on expressive, cognitive and clinical dimensions. Expressive behaviour was assessed using the Motor Affective subscale of the Motor- Affective-Social-Scale (MASS). Covariables include the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the anxiety level Liebowitz-Social-Anxiety-Scale (LSAS) and cognitive tasks. After controlling for depression, schizophrenia and social phobia patients both exhibited significantly fewer expressive behaviours compared to healthy controls. Moreover, our results showed specific signatures: schizophrenia patients performed fewer spontaneous gestures (hand gestures and smiles) whereas social phobia patients had an impaired ability to produce voluntary smiles in comparison to healthy controls. Interestingly, poor social functioning was significantly correlated with a decrease of expressive behaviour for schizophrenia patients. Expressive behaviour is impaired in different ways in social phobia and schizophrenia and is associated in schizophrenia with poorer social functioning. The Motor Affective subscale of the MASS is an interesting tool for assessing the dysfunction of interpersonal expressive behaviour in mental disorders.

Using a hybrid model to investigate the comorbidity and symptom overlap between social phobia and the other anxiety disorders and unipolar mood disorders,"New hybrid models of psychopathology have been proposed that combine the current categorical approach with symptom dimensions that are common across various disorders. The present study investigated the new hybrid model of social anxiety in a large sample of participants with anxiety disorders and unipolar mood disorders to improve understanding of the comorbidity and symptom overlap between social phobia (SOC) and the other anxiety disorders and unipolar mood disorders. Six hundred and eighty two participants from a specialized outpatient clinic for anxiety treatment completed a semi-structured diagnostic interview and the Multidimensional Assessment of Social Anxiety (MASA). A hybrid model symptom profile was identified for SOC and compared with each of the other principal diagnoses. Significant group differences were identified on each of the MASA scales. Differences also were identified when common sets of comorbidities were compared within participants diagnosed with SOC. The findings demonstrated the influence of both the principal diagnosis of SOC and other anxiety disorders and unipolar mood disorders as well as the influence of comorbid diagnoses with SOC on the six symptom dimensions. These findings highlight the need to shift to transdiagnostic assessment and treatment practices that go beyond the disorder-specific focus of the current categorical diagnostic systems.

The cognitive attentional syndrome: Examining relations with mood and anxiety symptoms and distinctiveness from psychological inflexibility in a clinical sample,"Wells's (2009) metacognitive theory suggests that inflexible and recurrent styles of thinking in response to negative thoughts, feelings, and beliefs underlie mood and anxiety symptoms. Wells termed such styles of thinking as the cognitive attentional syndrome (CAS). Using a clinical sample ( N = 132) of patients with either a primary mood or anxiety disorder, we examined relations between the CAS and mood (depression) and anxiety (generalized anxiety, social anxiety, obsessive–compulsive, and panic) symptoms. We also examined the distinctiveness of the CAS from the related construct of psychological inflexibility. The CAS shared significant positive associations with all of the assessed symptoms, but appeared particularly relevant to depression and generalized anxiety symptoms. Despite having a strong significant positive correlation with psychological inflexibility, the CAS tended to share unique relations with symptoms after controlling for psychological inflexibility. These results broadly support the purported transdiagnostic importance of Wells's theory and indicate that intervention strategies targeting the CAS might be useful in treating certain disorders.

Psychiatric comorbidity among adults with schizophrenia: A latent class analysis,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that often co-occurs with and can be exacerbated by other psychiatric conditions. There have not been adequate efforts to examine schizophrenia and psychiatric comorbidity beyond pairwise examination using clusters of diagnoses. This study used latent class analysis to characterize patterns of 5-year psychiatric comorbidity among a national sample of adults with schizophrenia. Baseline data from 1446 adults with schizophrenia across 57 sites in the United States were analyzed. Three latent classes were identified labeled Solely Schizophrenia, Comorbid Anxiety and Depressive Disorders with Schizophrenia, and Comorbid Addiction and Schizophrenia. Adults in the Solely Schizophrenia class had significantly better mental health than those in the two comorbid classes, but poorer illness and treatment insight than those with comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders. These results suggest that addiction and schizophrenia may represent a separate latent profile from depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. More research is needed on how treatment can take advantage of the greater insight possessed by those with schizophrenia and comorbid anxiety and depression.

Religious coping among psychotic patients: Relevance to suicidality and treatment outcomes,"Religious coping is very common among individuals with psychosis, however its relevance to symptoms and treatment outcomes remains unclear. We conducted a prospective study in a clinical sample of n = 47 psychiatric patients with current/past psychosis receiving partial (day) treatment at McLean Hospital. Subjects completed measures of religious involvement, religious coping and suicidality prior to treatment, and we assessed for psychosis, depression, anxiety and psychological well-being over the course of treatment. Negative religious coping (spiritual struggle) was associated with substantially greater frequency and intensity of suicidal ideation, as well as greater depression, anxiety, and less well-being prior to treatment (accounting for 9.0–46.2% of the variance in these variables). Positive religious coping was associated with significantly greater reductions in depression and anxiety, and increases in well-being over the course of treatment (accounting for 13.7–36.0% of the variance in change scores). Effects remained significant after controlling for significant covariates. Negative religious coping appears to be a risk factor for suicidality and affective symptoms among psychotic patients. Positive religious coping is an important resource to this population, and its utilization appears to be associated with better treatment outcomes.

Mood states were evaluated using Profile of Mood States questionnaires (POMS).

Mean 5-HT concentrations were significantly higher and mean tension/anxiety scores of POMS were significantly lower in late (but not early) postpartum than in the third trimester or non-pregnant controls. 5-HT concentrations correlated with tension/anxiety in the third trimester and late postpartum, indicating an important role for the 5-HT system in the regulation of tension/anxiety in healthy postpartum women. The mechanism underlying the changes in the 5-HT system may be rapid inhibition induced by the marked decrease in estradiol after delivery and gradual excitation caused by lactation-induced brain oxytocin release during the postpartum period.

Fasting in mood disorders: Neurobiology and effectiveness. A review of the literature,"Clinicians have found that fasting was frequently accompanied by an increased level of vigilance and a mood improvement, a subjective feeling of well-being, and sometimes of euphoria. Therapeutic fasting, following an established protocol, is safe and well tolerated. We aim in this article to explore the biological mechanisms activated during fasting that could have an effect on brain function with particular focus on mood (we do not discuss here the mechanisms regulating eating behavior) and to provide a comprehensive review on the potential positive impact of therapeutic fasting on mood. We explored Medline, Web of Science and PsycInfo according to the PRISMA criteria (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis). The initial research paradigm was: [(fasting OR caloric restriction) AND (mental health OR depressive disorders OR mood OR anxiety)]. Many neurobiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain fasting effects on mood, such as changes in neurotransmitters, quality of sleep, and synthesis of neurotrophic factors. Many clinical observations relate an early (between day 2 and day 7) effect of fasting on depressive symptoms with an improvement in mood, alertness and a sense of tranquility reported by patients. The persistence of mood improvement over time remains to be determined.

Left DLPFC rTMS stimulation reduced the anxiety bias effect or how to restore the positive memory processing in high-anxiety subjects,"In the present research we explored the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in memory retrieval process of positive vs. negative emotional stimulus, as a function of the anxiety levels. Anxiety behavior showed a consistent attentional bias toward negative and aversive memories, induced by a right frontal cortical superiority. This effect was analyzed by using a rTMS paradigm that induced a cortical activation of the left DLPFC. Subjects, who were divided in two different groups depending on their anxiety level (high/low-anxiety, State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory, STAI), were required to perform a task consisting of two experimental phases: an encoding-phase, where some lists composed by positive and negative emotional words were presented to the subjects; and a retrieval-phase, where the old stimuli and new stimuli were presented for a recognition performance. We found that the rTMS stimulation affects the memory retrieval of emotional material. High-anxiety subjects benefit in greater measure from the left DLPFC stimulation with a reduced negative bias. This result suggested that left DLPFC activation favors the memory retrieval of positive emotional information and might limit the “unbalance effect” induced by a right hemispheric superiority at a high level of anxiety. The potentiality of TMS for anxiety behavior modulation was also discussed.

Relief of cannabis withdrawal symptoms and cannabis quitting strategies in people with schizophrenia,"This study examined the response to cannabis withdrawal symptoms and use of quitting strategies to maintain abstinence in people with schizophrenia. A convenience sample of 120 participants with schizophrenia who had at least weekly cannabis use and a previous quit attempt without formal treatment were administered the 176-item Marijuana Quit Questionnaire to characterize their “most serious” (self-defined) quit attempt. One hundred thirteen participants had withdrawal symptoms, of whom 104 (92.0%) took some action to relieve a symptom, most commonly nicotine use (75%). 90% of withdrawal symptoms evoked an action for relief in a majority of participants experiencing them, most frequently anxiety (95.2% of participants) and cannabis craving (94.4%). 96% of participants used one or more quitting strategies to maintain abstinence during their quit attempt, most commonly getting rid of cannabis (72%) and cannabis paraphernalia (67%). Religious support or prayer was the quitting strategy most often deemed “most helpful” (15%). Use of a self-identified most helpful quitting strategy was associated with significantly higher one-month (80.8% vs. 73.6%) and one-year (54.9% vs. 41.3%) abstinence rates. Actions to relieve cannabis withdrawal symptoms in people with schizophrenia are common. Promotion of effective quitting strategies may aid relapse prevention.

Dysregulation in pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder,"Although obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and common co-occurring conditions share deficits in self-regulatory abilities, there has been minimal examination of impaired self-regulation (dysregulation) in youth with OCD. This study examined the association of dysregulation with symptom severity, impairment, and treatment outcome in pediatric OCD. Clinicians assessed obsessive-compulsive severity, family accommodation and global severity in 144 youth with OCD. Youth completed self-report severity ratings of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and both children and parents completed parallel ratings of obsessive-compulsive impairment. Ninety-seven youth received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and were re-assessed after treatment. Dysregulation was assessed using the CBCL-Dysregulation Profile. Before treatment, dysregulated youth exhibited greater obsessive-compulsive symptom severity, depressive mood, family accommodation, and impairment than non-dysregulated youth. The magnitude of dysregulation directly predicted child-rated impairment, parent-rated impairment, and family accommodation, beyond obsessive-compulsive severity. The magnitude of pretreatment dysregulation predicted treatment discontinuation but not treatment response. Obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and dysregulation level significantly decreased after CBT. Dysregulated youth with OCD presented as more clinically severe than their nondysregulated counterparts, and may require more individualized interventions to reduce dysregulated behavior to prevent CBT attrition. For treatment completers, CBT was associated with a decrease in dysregulation level.

Stigma and perception of psychological distress and depression in australian-trained medical students: Results from an inter-state medical school survey,"Stigmatisation towards depression has previously been reported amongst medical students from a variety of backgrounds. This study explored personal and perceived stigmas associated with depression, and their relationship with demographics, knowledge of depression, levels of personal stress and history of medical illness amongst Australian-trained medical students. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken amongst students enrolled June-to-August 2009 across four Australian medical schools. In total, 1010 students completed the survey, a response rate of 29.6%. Approximately 25% of students reported a past history of depression. Higher stress (K-10 scores) was reported by females and those with a past history of depression. On a scale of 0-to-5, the mean (± S.D.) personal and perceived stigma depression scores were 1.83 ± 1.49 and 4.05 ± 1.42 respectively. In multivariate analysis, higher perceived stigma and K-10 scores, a past history of anxiety and Year 3 of medical school indicated higher personal stigma scores. Perceived stigma was positively associated with K-10 scores, personal stigma scores, and a Caucasian background. Our findings suggest a high level of personal and particularly perceived stigma associated with depression amongst medical students, especially those displaying higher levels of stress. Adequate support and screening for psychological stress may de-stigmatise depression and improve mental health amongst future Australian doctors.

Nature adventure rehabilitation for combat-related posttraumatic chronic stress disorder: A randomized control trial,"Chronic combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (CR-PTSD) is a condition with many treatment barriers. Nature Adventure Rehabilitation (NAR) as a second line or as a supplemental intervention has the potential to overcome some of these barriers and incorporate aspects of successful treatment modalities for PTSD within an experiential learning paradigm. In a pre-post controlled trial, CR-PTSD veterans ( n = 22) underwent a 1-year NAR intervention compared to a waiting list (WL) control group ( n = 20). Posttraumatic symptoms (PTS), depression, functional problems, quality of life, perceived control over illness (PCI) and hope were measured by self report measures. PTS, emotional and social quality of life, PCI, hope and functioning improved significantly. Change in PTS was contingent upon change in PCI. The current study is the first to present NAR as a promising supplemental intervention for chronic CR-PTSD. NAR seems to work through a process of behavioral activation, desensitization, gradual exposure to anxiety evoking situations and gaining control over symptomatology.

"Experiential, autonomic, and respiratory correlates of CO₂ reactivity in individuals with high and low anxiety sensitivity","Psychometric studies indicate that anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a risk factor for anxiety disorders such as panic disorder (PD). To better understand the psychophysiological basis of AS and its relation to clinical anxiety, we examined whether high-AS individuals show similarly elevated reactivity to inhalations of carbon dioxide (CO₂) as previously reported for PD and social phobia in this task. Healthy individuals with high and low AS were exposed to eight standardized inhalations of 20% CO₂-enriched air, preceded and followed by inhalations of room air. Anxiety and dyspnea, in addition to autonomic and respiratory responses were measured every 15 s. Throughout the task, high AS participants showed a respiratory pattern of faster, shallower breathing and reduced inhalation of CO₂ indicative of anticipatory or contextual anxiety. In addition, they showed elevated dyspnea responses to the second set of air inhalations accompanied by elevated heart rate, which could be due to sensitization or conditioning. Respiratory abnormalities seem to be common to high AS individuals and PD patients when considering previous findings with this task. Similarly, sensitization or conditioning of anxious and dyspneic symptoms might be common to high AS and clinical anxiety. Respiratory conditionability deserves greater attention in anxiety disorder research.

Public perceptions of risk in criminality: The effects of mental illness and social disadvantage,"We examined how different types of mental illness elicited varying levels of predicted criminality and compared this with factors which might also elicit a negative response, specifically, a criminal history and social disadvantage. A sample of 243 participants undertook an anonymous, online experiment. Each participant was exposed to one of six vignettes: three involved mental illness (schizophrenia, depression/anxiety, or alcohol dependency); two in which socio-economic background was manipulated; and a control. The impact of mental illness, history of criminality and social disadvantage on the likelihood that the character in the vignette would commit future crime, and levels of sympathy, trust and potential for rehabilitation in the character were measured. Age and personal experience of mental illness and/or criminal behaviour in the participants was also examined. The sample were significantly more likely to think that a character would ‘possibly’ commit future crime if he had mental illness in comparison to the control, but crimes were expected to be minor. Significantly more discriminatory behaviour was reported towards the character with no mental illness but a disadvantaged background. Familiarity ameliorated this effect. Prejudice towards those with a criminal past and a disadvantaged background may be stronger than prejudice against those with mental illnesses.

A preliminary evaluation of leukocyte phospho-glucocorticoid receptor as a potential biomarker of depressogenic vulnerability in healthy adults,"The mechanism of maladaptive chronic stress response involves altered phosphorylation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In this study, we investigated if important depressogenic vulnerability factors, such as neuroticism and self-reports of negative affective states, may be associated with alterations in levels of the GR and GR phosphoisoforms in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy adults. In 21 women and 16 men we evaluated PMBC levels of total GR (tGR), GR phosphorylated at serine 211 (pGR-S211) and serine 226 (pGR-S226) and correlated these data with personality traits and current reports of stress, anxiety and depression. Also, we assessed plasma cortisol levels in all tested subjects. Our results showed that in women nuclear pGR-S226 was positively correlated with neuroticism and current reports of depression, anxiety and stress, while the ratio of nuclear pGR-S211/pGR-S226 was negatively correlated with reports of depression. None of the aforementioned correlations were significant inmen. No significant relations between cortisol levels and any of GR parameters were observed. These preliminary findings highlight the value of GR phosphorylation-related research in identifying molecular biomarkers of depressogenic vulnerability, at least in women.

Depression and social anxiety in help-seeking patients with an ultra-high risk for developing psychosis,"Knowledge on associations between ultra-high risk (UHR) for developing psychosis and on nonpsychotic psychopathology in help-seeking populations is limited with respect to differences between male and female patients. The present study tests the hypothesis that both social anxiety and depression are highly prevalent in an UHR population, particularly among women. From February 2008 to February 2010 baseline data were collected from help-seeking subjects (14–35 years) who were included in the Dutch Early Detection and Intervention Evaluation (EDIE-NL) trial. Two recruiting strategies were used: a two-stage screening strategy in a population of consecutive help-seeking and distressed subjects of secondary mental health services, and a referral strategy. This study included 201 patients with a mean age of 22.7 years. Of these, 102 (51%) were female, 58% of the patients met the criteria for clinical depression on the Beck Depression Inventory and 42% met the criteria for clinical social phobia on the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale. Women showed more depression and social anxiety than men. The results support the hypothesis that UHR is associated with depression and social anxiety, particularly in women. Screening a help-seeking population with depression and anxiety may be effective in detecting patients at UHR for developing psychosis.

"Prevalence, correlates, and comorbidities of four DSM-IV specific phobia subtypes: Results from the Korean Epidemiological Catchment Area study","Although several studies have detected differences in clinical features among specific phobias, there is a shortage of detailed national data on the on the DSM-IV SP subtypes, particularly in the Asian population. To examine the prevalence, demographic and other correlates, and co-morbidities of DSM-IV SP subtypes in a nationwide sample of Korean adults. We recruited 6510 participants aged 18–64 years for this study. Lay interviewers used the Composite International Diagnostic Interview to assess participants. We analyzed socio-demographics, health-related correlates and frequencies of comorbid mental disorders among participants with SP and each subtypes compared to unaffected adults. The prevalence of lifetime DSM-IV SP was 3.8%, and animal phobias were the most prevalent type of SP. Blood–injection–injury phobia was negatively associated with education, whereas situational phobia was positively associated with education. The strongest mental disorder comorbidity was associated with situational phobia; there is a higher probability of comorbid mood (OR = 5.73, 95% CI = 2.09–15.73), anxiety (OR = 7.54, 95% CI = 2.34–24.28), and somatoform disorders (OR = 7.61, 95% CI = 1.64–35.22) with this subtype. Blood–injection–injury phobia was highly associated with alcohol dependence (OR = 9.02, 95% CI = 3.54–23.02). Specific phobias are heterogeneous with respect to socio-demographic characteristics and comorbidity pattern. Implications of the usefulness of current subtype categories should continue to be investigated.

Alexithymia and personality in relation to social anxiety among university students,"The aims of the present study were to investigate the relationship of social anxiety symptoms with alexithymia and personality dimensions in university students and to control the effects of depression and anxiety on this relationship. A total of 319 university students (85 males and 234 females) from two different universities in Ankara were investigated with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). We found that subscales of the LSAS (fear or anxiety and avoidance) were positively correlated with depression and alexithymia and ""difficulty in identifying feelings"" (DIF) and ""difficulty in describing feelings"" (DDF) subscales of the TAS-20. Harm avoidance (HA) showed positive correlations with subscales of the LSAS, whereas self-directedness (SD) showed negative correlations with these subscales. High TAS-20 DDF and HA and low SD predicted fear or anxiety LSAS subscale scores, whereas high TAS-20 DDF, HA and depression scores were predictors for LSAS avoidance subscale scores. Although our sample is not representative of the whole Turkish university student population, we conclude that both fear or anxiety and avoidance were mainly interrelated with DDF and HA, although the causal relationship is not clear.

In the face of danger: Exploring the attentional blink to emotional facial expressions in PTSD,"There is a wealth of evidence demonstrating an attentional bias to threat-related information in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders. However, there is an ongoing debate whether an enhanced identification of threatening information or rather difficulties to disengage from such signals of danger constitute this bias. The present study used a dual target rapid visual presentation paradigm to examine the temporal allocation of attention to facial expressions of anger and happiness in 16 Palestinian victims of torture with PTSD and 16 control subjects. Findings revealed that signals of threat seem to interfere with already processed information in individuals suffering from PTSD. In contrast, PTSD does not facilitate attention to threatening information. The data provide support for detrimental disengagement as an underlying mechanism of the attentional bias toward threat in PTSD, possibly contributing to symptom development and maintenance.

Prevalence and features of generalized anxiety disorder in Department of Veteran Affairs primary care settings,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a highly prevalent distressing condition for individuals in both community and community primary care settings. However, despite the high prevalence of GAD identified in epidemiological studies, little is known about GAD and its related symptoms and impairments in veteran populations. The present study investigated the prevalence, comorbidity, physical and mental health impairment, and healthcare utilization of veteran participants with GAD, as well as comparing symptoms of GAD and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Veterans ( N = 884) participated in a cross-sectional investigation in primary care clinics in four Veteran Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) and completed diagnostic interviews and self-report questionnaires; a chart review was conducted to assess their VAMC healthcare utilization. A large number of participants (12%) met diagnostic criteria for GAD, reporting significantly worse emotional health, pain, and general health, in addition to increased mental healthcare utilization and antidepressant medications. In addition, GAD was found in 40% of participants with PTSD, resulting in more severe symptoms and impairment than in patients with GAD alone. These findings provide evidence of high prevalence and severe impairment associated with GAD in veterans and highlight the need for improved recognition, assessment, and treatments for GAD.

Validation of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Severity Scale in African Americans with obsessive-compulsive disorder,"The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is widely used in the assessment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but the psychometric properties of the instrument have not been examined in African Americans with OCD. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the properties of the Y-BOCS severity scale in this population. Participants were 75 African American adults with a lifetime diagnosis of OCD. They completed the Y-BOCS, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM). Evaluators rated OCD severity using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) and their global assessment of functioning (GAF). The Y-BOCS was significantly correlated with both the CGI and GAF, indicating convergent validity. It also demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.83) and divergent validity when compared to the BAI and BDI-II. Confirmatory factor analyses tested five previously reported models and supported a three-factor solution, although no model exhibited excellent fit. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted, supporting a three-factor solution. A linear regression was conducted, predicting CGI from the three factors of the Y-BOCS and the MEIM, and the model was significant. The Y-BOCS appears to be a valid measure for African American populations.

Reliability and validity of the Arabic Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) in a clinical sample,"This study aimed at investigating the reliability and validity of the Arabic Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) as a first child and adolescent anxiety screening tool in the Arab World. The English parent (SCARED-P) and child (SCARED-C) versions were translated into Arabic and administered along with the Arabic Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to 77 parents and 67 children attending a Psychiatry clinic. DSM-IV-TR diagnoses were made by a psychiatrist without knowledge of the scale scores. Internal consistency was confirmed by Cronbach's α = 0.92 for SCARED-P and 0.91 for SCARED-C. Their subscales had internal consistencies between 0.65 and 0.89. Parent–child agreement was r = 0.67, p &lt; 0.001. SCARED-P demonstrated good discriminant validity between participants with anxiety disorders and those with other psychiatric disorders ( t (72) = 3.13, p = 0.003). For SCARED-C, this difference was significant when participants with depressive disorders were excluded ( t (43) = 2.58, p = 0.01). Convergent validity was evident through a significant correlation between SCARED-P and the parent SDQ emotional subscale ( r = 0.70, p &lt; 0.001), and SCARED-C and the child SDQ emotional subscale ( r = 0.70, p &lt; 0.001). Divergent validity with the SDQ hyperactivity subscale was observed as no significant correlation was found.

The 5-HTTLPR genotype and depressiveness link: Contribution of aspects of environment and gender,"This study examined the association of 5-HTTLPR with depressiveness in a population-representative sample, analyzing separately interpersonal and non-interpersonal adverse life events, and stratified subjects by education level. Participants were divided into two groups according to their education level: subjects with either basic, secondary or vocational education and subjects who had a university degree or were pursuing university education. The history of stressful life events in the preceding year was self-reported. 5-HTTLPR for triallelic classification was genotyped. No significant 5-HTTLPR genotype main effect nor interaction of 5- HTTLPR with total number of stressful life events was found. Nevertheless, the 5-HTTLPR gender interaction effect on depressiveness was significant in case of interpersonal but not non-interpersonal stressful life events. Female s'-allele carriers had lower depressiveness in association with lower exposure to interpersonal adverse events. Thus, although 5-HTTLPR s-allele carriers, especially women, show increased trait anxiety due to threat in interpersonal situations, they also gain more in lower stress conditions. Males had higher depressiveness in association with higher exposure to interpersonal adverse events if they had the l′/l′ genotype.

Suicidal ideation and risk factors in primary care patients with anxiety disorders,"The presence of an anxiety disorder is associated with greater frequency of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Given the high personal and societal costs of suicidal behaviors, suicide prevention is a priority. Understanding factors present within individuals with anxiety disorders that increase suicide risk may inform prevention efforts. The aims of the present study were to examine the prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviors, as well as factors associated with suicide risk in patients with anxiety disorders in primary care. Data from a large scale randomized controlled study were analyzed to assess prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, as well as factors associated with suicide risk. Results revealed that suicidal ideation and behaviors were relatively common in this group. When examining mental and physical health factors jointly, presence of depression, mental health-related impairment, and social support each uniquely accounted for variance in suicide risk score. Methodological limitations include cross-sectional data collection and lack of information on comorbid personality disorders. Moreover, patients included were from a clinical trial with exclusion criteria that may limit generalizability. Results highlight the complex determinants of suicidal behavior and the need for more nuanced suicide assessment in this population, including evaluation of comorbidity and general functioning.

Salivary alpha-amylase and cortisol responsiveness following electrical stimulation stress in obsessive–compulsive disorder patients,"Salivary α-amylase (sAA) serves as a marker of sympathoadrenal medullary system (SAM) activity. Salivary AA has not been extensively studied in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. In the current study, 45 OCD patients and 75 healthy volunteers were assessed with the Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (Y–BOCS), the Profile of Mood State (POMS), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Measures of heart rate variability (HRV), sAA, and salivary cortisol were also obtained following the application of electrical stimulation stress. The Y–BOCS and POMS Tension–Anxiety, Depression–Dejection, Anger–Hostility, Fatigue, and Confusion scores were significantly increased in patients with OCD compared with healthy controls. In contrast, Vigor scores were significantly decreased in patients with OCD relative to scores in healthy controls. There was no difference in HRV between the patients and the controls. Salivary AA levels in female and male OCD patients were significantly elevated relative to controls both before and after electrical stimulation. In contrast, there were no differences in salivary cortisol levels between OCD patients and controls. The elevated secretion of sAA before and after stimulation may suggest an increased responsiveness to novel and uncontrollable situations in patients with OCD. An increase in sAA might be a characteristic change of OCD.

Psychological predictors of the recovery from mood or anxiety disorder in short-term and long-term psychotherapy during a 3-year follow-up,"Choice of optimal treatment length for psychiatric patients requires knowledge about the patients’ pre-treatment suitability. This study compares the prediction of seven psychological suitability measures on changes in psychiatric symptoms in short- and long-term psychotherapy over a 3-year follow-up. The psychological suitability of 326 outpatients from the Helsinki Psychotherapy Study, aged 20–46 years, and suffering from mood or anxiety disorders, was assessed at baseline using the Suitability for Psychotherapy Scale (SPS) before randomly assigning them to solution-focused therapy, short-term or long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy. Psychiatric symptoms (Symptom Checklist-90 Global Severity Index) were assessed at baseline and seven times during follow-up. Three patient groups with different prognosis were found when a cumulative SPS score, summing up the values of the seven single suitability measures, was used to predict symptom development: patients with more good (4 or more) than poor values benefited more from short-term therapy, patients with more poor (4–6) than good values benefited more from long-term therapy, and patients with all seven values poor failed to benefit from either short- or long-term therapy. The SPS can apparently be applied before the start of treatment to predict the amount of therapy patients need to recover, although its suitability in therapies of different types needs to be confirmed.

A clinical and neurobiological case of IgM NMDA receptor antibody associated encephalitis mimicking bipolar disorder,"Autoimmune encephalitis associated with IgG antibodies to the N -methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor subunit NR1 (NMDAR) presents with neurological symptoms, such as seizures, and especially psychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations, psychosis, agitation and anxiety. To date, however, the pathological relevance of IgM NMDAR antibodies remains elusive. Here, we describe clinical, neuroradiological and neurobiological findings of a 28-year-old male presenting with IgM NMDAR antibodies coincident with autoimmune encephalitis characterized by symptoms of bipolar disorder. After repeated steroid treatment, cognitive and psychiatric abnormalities improved and no NMDAR antibody was detectable. Using primary neuronal cultures, we demonstrate that patient’s serum containing IgM NMDAR antibodies reduced the detection of NMDAR on neuronal cells and decreased cell survival. Although NMDAR encephalitis with IgG antibodies is increasingly recognized and diagnosed, atypical presentations with NMDAR antibodies with immunoglobulin subclasses other than IgG pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Further clinical and neurobiological studies are needed to study the pathophysiological relevance of IgM NMDAR antibodies.

Cortisol response and desire to binge following psychological stress: Comparison between obese subjects with and without binge eating disorder,"While stress and negative affect are known to precede ""emotional eating"", this relationship is not fully understood. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between induced psychological stress, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, and eating behavior in binge eating disorder (BED). The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was applied in obese participants with ( n = 8) and without BED ( n = 8), and normal weight controls ( n = 8). Psychological characteristics, eating-related symptoms, and cortisol secretion were assessed. Baseline stress, anxiety and cortisol measures were similar in all groups. At baseline desire to binge was significantly higher among the BED group. While the TSST induced an increase in cortisol levels, a blunted cortisol response was observed in the BED group. In the BED group, a positive correlation was found between cortisol (area under the curve) levels during the TSST and the change in VAS scores for desire to binge. Post-TSST desire to binge and sweet craving were significantly higher in the BED group and correlated positively with stress, anxiety, and cortisol response in the BED group only. These results suggest chronic down-regulation of the HPA axis in participants with BED, and a relationship between psychological stress, the acute activation of the HPA axis, and food craving.

Selective intentional forgetting in adolescents with social anxiety disorder,"Anxiety in young adults has recently been linked to reduced capacities to inhibit the processing of non-affective perceptual distractors. However, no previous research has addressed the relationship between social anxiety disorder (SAD) and the ability to intentionally inhibit no longer relevant memories. In an experimental study with adolescents diagnosed with SAD and matched nonclinical controls, a selective directed forgetting procedure was used to assess the extent to which anxious individuals showed lower memory impairment for to-be-forgotten information than their non-anxious counterparts. The results revealed that while the nonclinical sample group demonstrated the ability to selectively forget when instructed, the anxious adolescents demonstrated good memory for to-be-forgotten material and therefore failed to forget. Interestingly, more severe SAD symptomatology inversely predicted a degree of forgetting. We conclude that the main difference between socially anxious and non-anxious participants is specifically related to the ability to intentionally forget and could reflect cognitive functioning that is associated with vulnerability to anxiety.

Longitudinal course of panic disorder with and without agoraphobia using the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC),"Few naturalistic, longitudinal studies of panic disorder with and without agoraphobia (PD/PDA) exist, limiting our knowledge of the temporal rates of incidence, relapse, and chronicity, or the factors that predict category transition. Data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) wave 1 ( n = 43,093) and wave 2 ( n = 34,653) were utilized to determine transitional rates, and predictors of category transitions, over a 3-year period. Analyses revealed very high 3-year remission rates for PD and PDA (75% and 67%, respectively), although relapse also was relatively frequent (PD = 12%; PDA = 21%). Logistic regression revealed previous history of panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder/major depression (GAD/MDD), nicotine dependence, female sex, younger age, and major financial crises to be reliable predictors of incidence and relapse. The direction and magnitude of association of many predictor variables were similar for PD and PDA, with notable exceptions for social anxiety and romantic relationship factors. Clinicians should be aware of the relapsing–remitting nature of PD and PDA and, thus, take caution to not reduce or eliminate effective treatments prematurely. Similarly, the current study suggests clinicians pay particular attention to concurrent factors relevant to relapse in PD/PDA that may also be clinically addressed (e.g., co-morbid MDD/GAD and nicotine dependence).

"Evening salivary alpha-amylase, major depressive disorder, and antidepressant use in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA)","Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) may be a suitable index for sympathetic activity and dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. The relationship between antidepressants and depression with sAA levels was studied, since antidepressants were previously shown to have a profound impact on heart rate variability as an ANS indicator. Data are from 1692 participants of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) who were recruited from the community, general practice, and specialized mental health care. Differences in evening sAA levels were examined between patient groups (i.e., 752 current major depressive disorder [MDD], 611 remitted MDD, and 329 healthy controls) and between 46 tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) users, 307 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) users, 97 users of another antidepressant, and 1242 non-users. Each participant sampled twice at 22.00h and 23.00h. In multivariable analysis, there was a trend over the three groups with increasing sAA levels from controls to remitted MDD to current MDD that approached significance. Furthermore, in comparison to non-users of antidepressants, TCA rather than SSRI users showed higher sAA levels, that persisted after multivariable adjustment. The present study shows that higher evening sAA levels in depressed patients, indicative of an increased sympathetic activity, may be induced by TCAs.

Cognitive regulation of negative affect in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,"Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) exhibit common cognitive deficits that may impede the capacity for self-regulating affect. We examined the use of particular cognitive strategies for regulating negative affect in SZ and BD, and their associations with levels of mood symptomatology. Participants were 126 SZ, 97 BD, and 81 healthy controls (HC) who completed the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS). Patients with SZ and BD reported more frequent rumination, catastrophising and self-blame, and less use of putting into perspective, relative to HC. Additionally, SZ patients were more likely to engage in other-blame, compared to HC. The most consistent predictors of symptomatology for SZ were self-blame and catastrophising, while for BD were rumination and reduced positive reappraisal. These findings demonstrate maladaptive use of cognitive strategies to self-regulate negative affect in SZ and BD, resembling those reported previously for unipolar depression. The ineffective use of adaptive cognitive reframing strategies in both patient groups may reflect the impact of their shared cognitive deficits, and requires further investigation. Remediation of cognitive capacities contributing to ineffective self-regulation may facilitate reduced mood symptomatology in SZ and BD.

Body image concerns in professional fashion models: Are they really an at-risk group?,"Although professional models are thought to be a high-risk group for body image concerns, only a handful of studies have empirically investigated this possibility. The present study sought to overcome this dearth of information by comparing professional models and a matched sample on key indices of body image and appeared-related concerns. A group of 52 professional fashion models was compared with a matched sample of 51 non-models from London, England, on indices of weight discrepancy, body appreciation, social physique anxiety, body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, internalization of sociocultural messages about appearance, and dysfunctional investment in appearance. Results indicated that professional models only evidenced significantly higher drive for thinness and dysfunctional investment in appearance than the control group. Greater duration of engagement as a professional model was associated with more positive body appreciation but also greater drive for thinness. These results indicate that models, who are already underweight, have a strong desire to maintain their low body mass or become thinner. Taken together, the present results suggest that interventions aimed at promoting healthy body image among fashion models may require different strategies than those aimed at the general population.

Attentional bias for affective visual stimuli in posttraumatic stress disorder and the role of depression,"An attentional bias for trauma-related verbal cues was frequently demonstrated in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using variants of the emotional Stroop task (EST). However, the mechanisms underlying the Stroop-effect are ill-defined and it is yet unclear how the findings apply to different paradigms and stimulus modalities. To address these open questions, for the first time a spatial-cuing task with pictorial cues of different emotional valence was administered to trauma-exposed individuals with and without PTSD, and non-trauma-exposed controls. Groups did not show different response profiles across affective conditions. However, a group effect was evident when comparing depressed with non-depressed individuals: Those with depression showed delayed attending towards trauma-related cues and faster attending away from negative cues. In correlational analyses, attentional avoidance was associated with both depression and PTSD symptom severity. These findings highlight the need for research on trauma populations and anxiety in general to pay closer attention to depression as an important confound in the study of emotional information processing.

Psychological consequences of terrorist attacks: Prevalence and predictors of mental health problems in Pakistani emergency responders,"Earlier research showing moderate to high prevalence rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health problems in emergency personnel has mostly been carried out in Western countries. Data from non-Western countries are largely lacking. The current study aimed to gather evidence on the prevalence of PTSD, anxiety, and depression in N = 125 Pakistani emergency workers, most of whom ( n = 100; 80%) had been exposed to terrorist attacks. Fifteen percent of participants showed clinically relevant levels of PTSD, and 11–16% of participants reported heightened levels of anxiety or depression. Neither the experience of terrorist attacks per se nor the severity of the attack experienced was related to symptom severities. However, symptom levels of PTSD were related to a number of predictor variables, including subjective threat, peritraumatic dissociation, past traumas, rumination, and avoidant coping. Only a few variables were predictive of levels of anxiety and depression. In sum, a substantial subgroup of emergency workers experienced mental health problems, and prevalences were in the high range of those reported in earlier studies focusing on emergency personnel in Western countries.

"Symptoms of prolonged grief, depression, and adult separation anxiety: Distinctiveness and correlates","Research has shown that prolonged grief disorder (PGD) is a disorder distinct from other disorders including major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study aimed to extend this research by examining the distinctiveness of symptoms of PGD relative to symptoms of adult separation anxiety disorder, also taking into account depression. Data were available from 205 bereaved individuals who completed measures tapping these symptoms together with a complementary measure of mental and physical health. Findings showed that symptoms of PGD, depression, and adult separation anxiety disorder were better conceptualized as distinct dimensions instead of a unitary dimension of distress. Correlations between the three symptom clusters were moderate to large. Cause of loss was the single variable that was associated with all three symptom clusters with loss due to violent cause giving rise to more severe symptoms. All three symptom clusters were associated with lower concurrent mental and physical health.

Cognitive style in bipolar disorder sub-types,"Clearer understanding of psychological processes and mechanisms such as cognitive style inform more targeted psychological treatments for mood disorders. Studies to date have focused on bipolar I disorder or combined bipolar sub-types, precluding identification of any distinctive cognitive style profiles. We examined cognitive style separately in the bipolar sub-types, contrasted with unipolar and non-clinical controls. A total of 417 participants (94 bipolar I, 114 bipolar II, 109 unipolar, 100 healthy controls) completed cognitive style measures including the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale, Inferential Styles Questionnaire, Stress Appraisal Measure and the Behavioural Inhibition System/Behavioural Activation System Scale. Overall, cognitive styles were similar in unipolar and bipolar participants, but with styles relevant to the Behavioral Activation System differentiating bipolar I disorder in particular. State anxiety influenced negative inferential style in unipolar participants and appraisal of stress in bipolar II participants. Analyses restricted to bipolar I vs. II comparisons revealed subtle differences in terms of dispositional stress appraisal, with higher scores on two stress appraisal sub-scales in the bipolar I group. Further exploration of cognitive style in bipolar sub-types is indicated in order to determine whether there are specific psychological vulnerabilities that would benefit from more targeted psychological interventions.

Mood variability predicts the course of suicidal ideation in individuals with first and second episode psychosis,"Suicide risk is high in early psychosis. Recent research has suggested that mood variability may be associated with levels of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. This has not been investigated in individuals during and following a first or second episode of non-affective psychosis. Repeated-measures data over 18 months from a large randomised controlled trial for cognitive behaviour therapy ( N = 309) were analysed using latent growth curve modelling, whereby both the variability and the level of depression, anxiety and guilt were entered as predictors of suicidality. The variability of depression, but not guilt and anxiety, predicted the course of suicidality even when controlling for a large range of potential confounders. The level of depression, anxiety and guilt for each participant also strongly predicted the development of suicidality. The findings support the theory that variability in depression may contribute to the formation of suicidal ideation and related behaviour. More variable depression may be harder to predict and intervene against, and therefore increase the likelihood that suicidality escalates. The levels of emotions may also be an important determinant. This has implications for the treatment and assessment of suicidality in early psychosis.

Predictors of generalized anxiety disorder stigma,"The stigma associated with mental illness can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including delaying or avoiding help seeking. Identifying the characteristics of people who are more likely to hold stigmatizing attitudes enables the development of targeted stigma reduction programs. However, no previous research has systematically examined the predictors of anxiety stigma. This study used the Generalized Anxiety Stigma Scale (GASS) to assess the predictors of personal stigma and perceived stigma associated with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. A community sample of 617 Australian adults completed a survey that included the GASS, the Depression Stigma Scale, exposure to anxiety disorders, emotional distress and a range of demographic characteristics. Linear regression models indicated that women, people with greater exposure to anxiety disorders and people reporting a previous anxiety diagnosis had lower personal stigma toward anxiety. Higher exposure to anxiety disorders and rurality were significantly associated with higher perceived anxiety stigma. Results also suggested that respondents who had only been exposed to anxiety disorders through the media tended to be no more stigmatizing than respondents who had direct contact with people with an anxiety disorder. Media campaigns may be an effective vehicle for decreasing stigmatizing views in the community.

Assessment of self-reported negative affect in the NIH Toolbox,"We report on the selection of self-report measures for inclusion in the NIH Toolbox that are suitable for assessing the full range of negative affect including sadness, fear, and anger. The Toolbox is intended to serve as a ""core battery"" of assessment tools for cognition, sensation, motor function, and emotional health that will help to overcome the lack of consistency in measures used across epidemiological, observational, and intervention studies. A secondary goal of the NIH Toolbox is the identification of measures that are flexible, efficient, and precise, an agenda best fulfilled by the use of item banks calibrated with models from item response theory (IRT) and suitable for adaptive testing. Results from a sample of 1763 respondents supported use of the adult and pediatric item banks for emotional distress from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS ® ) as a starting point for capturing the full range of negative affect in healthy individuals. Content coverage for the adult Toolbox was also enhanced by the development of a scale for somatic arousal using items from the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ) and scales for hostility and physical aggression using items from the Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ).

Quality of life in obsessive-compulsive disorder: The role of mediating variables,"This study examined the association of various clinical features of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with quality of life (QoL) in 102 adults with a principal diagnosis of OCD. Participants were assessed by trained clinicians using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule 4th edition, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, and an unstructured clinical interview. Subjects completed the MOS-36 Item Short Form Health Survey, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. Obsessive-compulsive symptom severity was negatively correlated with emotional health, social functioning and general health QoL. Depressive symptoms mediated the relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and emotional health, social functioning and general health QoL. Additionally, interference of obsessive-compulsive symptoms mediated the relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and emotional health, social functioning and general health QoL. Resistance against obsessive-compulsive symptoms mediated the relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and social functioning QoL. Diminished QoL is present in persons with OCD and is essential in understanding the complete clinical picture of OCD.

A possible association between panic disorder and a polymorphism in the preproghrelin gene,"The aim of the study was to investigate whether polymorphisms in the preproghrelin gene are associated with anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder, in humans. Panic disorder is a severe anxiety disorder, characterized by sudden attacks of intense fear or anxiety in combination with somatic symptoms. The preproghrelin gene codes for two gut-derived circulating peptides that have been linked to anxiety-like behaviour in rodents: ghrelin (an orexigenic, pro-obesity hormone) and obestatin. In the present study, we genotyped three missense mutations in the preproghrelin gene in 215 patients suffering from panic disorder and in 451 controls. The A allele of the rs4684677 polymorphism was significantly associated with panic disorder, while there were no significant associations with the two other polymorphisms studied. We conclude that the rs4684677 (Gln90Leu) polymorphism in the preproghrelin gene may be associated with increased risk of panic disorder. It will be important to confirm these findings in additional panic disorder patient groups.

Impact of combat and non-military trauma exposure on symptom reduction following treatment for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder,"Military veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently report exposure to multiple other traumas in addition to their military experiences. This study aimed to examine the impact of exposure-related factors for military veterans with PTSD on recovery after participation in a group-based treatment program. Subjects included 1548 military veterans with PTSD participating in specialist veterans’ PTSD programs across Australia. The study included measures of PTSD, depression, anxiety and alcohol use. Analyses of variance found higher combat exposure was associated with more severe PTSD at intake. No differences in PTSD intake severity were evident in those with additional nonmilitary trauma. Severity of combat exposure did not affect treatment outcomes, although those with low combat exposure and additional non-military trauma (which included high rates of molestation) did report reduced symptom improvement. These findings have implications for considerations of optimal interventions for those with lower levels of combat exposure and additional non-military trauma.

A comparison study of body dysmorphic disorder versus social phobia,"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) shares many characteristics with social phobia (SP), including high levels of social anxiety and avoidance, but to our knowledge no studies have directly compared these disorders’ demographic and clinical features. Demographic and clinical features were compared in individuals with BDD (n=172), SP (n=644), and comorbid BDD/SP (n=125). SP participants had a significantly earlier age of onset and lower educational attainment than BDD participants. BDD participants were significantly less likely to ever be married than SP participants, had a greater likelihood of ever being psychiatrically hospitalized, and had significantly lower mean GAF scores than SP participants. The two groups had different comorbidity patterns, which included a greater likelihood for BDD participants to have comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or an eating disorder, vs. a greater likelihood for SP participants to have a comorbid non-OCD anxiety disorder. The comorbid BDD/SP group had significantly greater morbidity across several domains than the SP only group, but not the BDD only group. In summary, although BDD and SP were similar across many demographic and clinical features, they had important differences. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings and address similarities and differences between these disorders across a broader range of variables.

A cross-cultural replication of an interactive model of anxiety sensitivity relevant to suicide,"Recent findings indicate a relationship between anxiety sensitivity (AS) and suicide in a variety of populations in the United States. However, the link between AS and suicide has not been evaluated in other cultures. Suicide rates in Russia are among the highest worldwide making it an excellent choice to evaluate the cross-cultural robustness of these findings. The current investigation sought to replicate and extend the investigation of AS subfactors (i.e., cognitive, physical, and their interaction) in relation to suicidality in a sample of Russian adults. Participants were 390 adults recruited from Moscow using a geographic sampling method. Findings from the current study indicate that the interaction of AS cognitive concerns and AS physical concerns are associated with elevated rates of suicidality and previous suicide attempt, above and beyond negative affectivity and hazardous alcohol use. Clinicians may benefit from implementing AS reduction strategies with individuals who endorse elevated suicide risk as well as elevated AS cognitive concerns and low AS physical concerns.

"Depression, anxiety and obsessive–compulsive symptoms in relation to nutritional status and outcome in severe anorexia nervosa","Depression, anxiety and obsessive–compulsive disorder are frequently reported to co-occur with anorexia nervosa (AN). There is clinical consensus that depressive symptoms and anxiety may in part be sequelae of malnutrition in AN. However, evidence-based data are still very rare. The present study among severe AN patients investigates links between these psychological variants and nutritional status at admission and subsequent to nutritional rehabilitation. Twenty-four women with AN diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) were included prospectively and consecutively at hospitalisation. Nutritional status was assessed by body mass index (BMI). Several psychological aspects were assessed using various scales for depression, anxiety, social phobia, obsessive and eating behaviour symptoms. Follow-up weights and heights at 4–12 years after hospital discharge were measured in 18 patients. BMI and all the scores except the Yale-Brown obsessive–compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) showed significant improvement between admission and discharge. This study highlights the fact that some of the depressive and anxiety symptoms at least partially decrease with nutrition rehabilitation. The improvement in the scores on the psychometric scales between admission and discharge was not correlated with BMI improvement. Psychometric scores at admission and at discharge were not correlated with BMI at follow-up. BMI at follow-up was correlated with minimum lifetime BMI ( r = 0.486, P = 0.04). Future studies should use a better indicator for nutritional status than BMI alone, and should also consider the initial degree of weight loss and the rate at which weight was lost.

The severity of symptoms was assessed using expanded version of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-E). Exploratory factor analyses and then confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. A four-factor structure was found, with positive, negative, depressive and excitement factors. In the confirmatory factor analysis, the only symptomatic dimension confirmed at all follow-ups was the negative factor (emotional withdrawal, motor retardation, blunted affect and conceptual disorganization) as derived from the 20-year follow up in exploratory factor analysis. The positive syndrome derived from the three-year follow-up (hostility, suspiciousness, unusual thought content and hallucinations) was confirmed at the seven- and 20-year follow-ups. In the depressive syndrome the model from the 12-year follow-up (guilt, depression, suicidality, anxiety and somatic concern) was confirmed for the follow-ups after seven and 20 years.

Caregivers provided sociodemographic information and completed the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Short-Form 12 (SF-12) and the Anorectic Behaviour Observation Scale (ABOS). The same information was requested one year later. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) provided satisfactory fit indexes. Almost all of the factor loadings were above 0.40. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were mostly superior to 0.70. The correlation coefficients between the IEQ domains and the other questionnaires were lower than the Cronbach’s alpha coefficients. Known-groups validity was supported by significant differences in the IEQ mean scores according to certain variables, as contact hours, living with the patient, type of caregiver and gender. The indexes employed for the evaluation of responsiveness were between 0.13 and 0.99. The IEQ has good psychometric properties and can be used to evaluate burden among caregivers of patients with ED.

Depressive and anxiety disorders on-the-job: The importance of job characteristics for good work functioning in persons with depressive and anxiety disorders,"This study examines the importance of job characteristics on absence and on-the-job performance in a large group of employees with diagnosed depressive and anxiety disorders. In a sample of 1522 employees (1129 persons with and 393 persons without psychopathology) participating in Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA, n = 2981) we examined associations between job characteristics and work functioning (absenteeism and work performance) in multinominal logistic regression models. Job characteristics were working hours, psychosocial working conditions and occupational status. As expected, depressed and anxious patients were at significantly elevated risk for absenteeism and poor work performance. In analyses adjusted for psychopathology, absenteeism and poor performance were significantly lower among persons reporting high job support, high job control, less working hours, self-employed and high skilled jobs. Associations were comparable between persons with and without psychopathology. High job support, high job control and reduced working hours were partially related to work functioning in both workers with- and without-psychopathology. Since depressed and anxious employees are at a substantially increased risk for absenteeism and poor work performance, strategies that improve job support and feelings of control at work may be especially helpful to prevent poor work functioning in this at-risk group of employees.

Gaze behaviour in social blushers,"Gaze aversion could be a central component of social phobia. Fear of blushing is a symptom of social anxiety disorder (SAD) but is not yet described as a specific diagnosis in psychiatric classifications. Our research consists of comparing gaze aversion in SAD participants with or without fear of blushing in front of pictures of different emotional faces using an eye tracker. Twenty-six participants with DSM-IV SAD and expressed fear of blushing (SAD+FB) were recruited in addition to twenty-five participants with social phobia and no fear of blushing (SAD-FB). Twenty-four healthy participants aged and sex matched constituted the control group. We studied the number of fixations and the dwell time in the eyes area on the pictures. The results showed gaze avoidance in the SAD-FB group when compared to controls and when compared to the SAD+FB group. However we found no significant difference between SAD+FB and controls. We also observed a correlation between the severity of the phobia and the degree of gaze avoidance across groups. These findings seem to support the claim that social phobia is a heterogeneous disorder. Further research is advised to decide whether fear of blushing can constitute a subtype with specific behavioral characteristics.

Association between serotonin transporter promoter polymorphisms and psychological distress in a diabetic population,"Investigations into serotonin transporter and anxiety and depression have shown an association between stress, depression onset and genotype. We investigated the relationship between 5-HTTLPR genotype and depression and anxiety in a population with diabetes mellitus, a condition associated with high rates of stress and depression. Participants were classified according to ‘S’ and ‘L’ alleles as well as the modification of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs25531. The 5-HTTLPR low-expression genotype group (S or LG allele carriers) had significantly higher psychological distress (K10) scores (N = 234, P = 0.047). Subsequent analysis revealed that the effect of genotype was related to anxiety symptoms rather than depression symptoms. Furthermore, the main effect of genotype was not observed when the modification of the SNP polymorphism was not taken into account. Findings suggest that 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 genotype is associated with psychological distress in a sample of subjects with diabetes.

Building on this research, we explored the impact of social anxiety, measured by the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), and depression and trait anxiety reported on the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), on the relationship of schizotypy, measured by the Schizotypy Personality Questionnaire-Brief Revised (SPQ-BR), to cannabis use (n = 220 schizotypy, 436 controls) and frequent use and cannabis-related problems among users (n = 88 schizotypy, 83 controls) in college undergraduates. Among cannabis users, social anxiety moderated the relationships of schizotypy to frequent cannabis use and more cannabis-related problems in the total schizotypy group, and across high-positive, negative, and disorganized schizotypy subgroups. Depression and trait anxiety also moderated the relationship of schizotypy to frequent cannabis use and more cannabis-related problems, but results varied across high-positive, negative, and disorganized schizotypy subgroups. Results suggest therapeutically targeting negative affective states may be useful in psychosocial intervention for cannabis-related problems in schizotypy.

Schizotypal traits and neurocognitive functioning among nonclinical young adults,"Neurocognitive deficits and their relationship with symptoms have been documented in schizophrenia and at-risk samples. Limited research has examined relationships of schizotypal traits with cognitive functioning among nonclinical samples. To expand this literature and elucidate a dimensional model of psychosis-proneness, we examined the relationship of schizotypal traits with estimated intellectual functioning, simple and complex attention/working memory, verbal fluency and visuospatial abilities in a nonclinical sample of 63 young adults. As hypothesized, aspects of neurocognition were more closely associated with negative (than positive or disorganized) schizotypal traits. For the total sample, poorer visuospatial performance was associated with more negative and overall schizotypal traits. The magnitude of the majority of findings was strengthened after controlling for depression and anxiety. No other findings were significant. Results partially support Meehl's (1962, 1990) view that processes underlying schizophrenia are expressed along a continuum. Findings suggest a relationship of schizotypal traits with neurocognition that is differentiated by trait dimensions, beyond the contribution of general psychiatric symptoms. Findings have implications for better understanding etiology and potential risk factors for psychosis. While sex distribution did not enable direct examination of sex effects, evidence in the field argues for continued exploration of differential patterns by sex.

Behavioral and cognitive impulsivity in obsessive–compulsive disorder and eating disorders,"This study compared self-reported impulsivity and neurocognitively assessed response inhibition in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorder (ED), and healthy control participants. Participants completed the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), stop-signal reaction time task, and measures of OCD and ED symptomatology (Yale-Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale and Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire). Compared to controls, both clinical groups reported higher levels of impulsivity on the BIS-11 however; only the OCD demonstrated increased stop-signal reaction time. Heightened levels of self-reported impulsivity may reflect the experience of anxiety in both OCD and ED populations whereas a lack of inhibitory control may represent a specific behavioral deficit in OCD.

"Neuropsychological performance, impulsivity, ADHD symptoms, and novelty seeking in compulsive buying disorder","We examined the neuropsychological performance of people with compulsive buying disorder (CBD) and control subjects, along with trait impulsivity, symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and selected personality characteristics. Subjects received a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery, depression and ADHD symptom assessment, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and a version of the Temperament and Character Inventory. Persons with CBD ( n =26) and controls ( n =32) were comparable in terms of age, sex, and years of education. Subjects with CBD had a mean age of 36.3 years (S.D.=15.7) and an age at onset of 19.7 years (S.D.=7.0). Compulsive buyers had more lifetime mood, anxiety, and impulse control disorders. People with Compulsive buying performed significantly better on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence Picture Completion task, a test of visual perception; otherwise, there were no consistent differences in neuropsychological measures. They also had elevated levels of self-reported depression, ADHD symptoms, trait impulsivity, and novelty seeking. In conclusion, compulsive buyers have greater lifetime psychiatric comorbidity than controls, and higher levels of self-rated depression, ADHD symptoms, trait impulsivity, and novelty seeking. The present study does not support the notion that there is a pattern of neuropsychological deficits associated with CBD.

Neuropsychological functions impairment in different subtypes of bipolar disorder with or without comorbid anxiety disorders,"Bipolar disorder (BP) patients with comorbid anxiety disorders (ADs) showed more severe clinical characteristics and psychosocial function impairment, worse response to treatment, and more substance use than those without AD. However, few studies focus on differences in neuropsychological function between BP-I and BP-II and patients with and without AD. Seventy-nine BP patients in their interepisode state classified into four groups—BP-I without AD (BP-I − AD ) ( n = 22), BP-I with AD (BPI + AD ) ( n = 20), BP-II without AD (BP-II − AD ) ( n = 18), BP-II with AD (BP-II + AD ) ( n = 19), and healthy controls (HC) ( n = 30)—were given neuropsychological tests. BP-I + AD patients did less well than BP-I − AD patients, but only in working memory. BP-II + AD patients did less well than the BP-II − AD patients in visual immediate memory, visual delayed memory, working memory, and psychomotor speed. BP-I + AD has limited effects on neuropsychological performance. However, significant effects were found only in BP-II + AD patients compared with BPII − AD patients. We hypothesized that comorbid AD worsens neuropsychological performance more in BP-II than in BP-I patients.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in chronic fatigue syndrome patients,"Psychopathological disorders are frequent in chronic fatigue syndrome patients. The present study examines the presence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a sample of adult chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients, and evaluates its clinical consequences in this population. CFS patients were assessed for childhood and adult ADHD by clinical interview and ADHD-specific scales. Psychopathological comorbidities were evaluated by clinical examination and questionnaires. Forty-seven of 158 CSF patients (29.7%) were diagnosed of childhood ADHD and in 33 (20.9%), the condition persisted into adulthood. CFS patients with adult ADHD had an earlier CSF onset, more severe anxiety and depression symptoms, and a higher risk of suicide than CFS patients without ADHD. Using lineal regression analysis, we found that depressive symptoms and ADHD severity were significant predictors of fatigue intensity. Consequently, ADHD may be common in CFS patients, and is associated with a more severe psychopathologic clinical profile.

Association between the Rorschach Ego Impairment Index and the Level of Personality Organization interview assessment in depressive and anxiety disorder patients,"The level of personality functioning, relevant for treatment planning, can be evaluated by the Rorschach Comprehensive System (CS) Ego Impairment Index-2 (EII-2) and by interview assessment of the severity of personality pathology. However, few studies on the association between these assessment methods have been reported. This study examines the strength of association between the EII-2 and its subcomponents with the interview-based Level of Personality Organization (LPO) assessment scale, and investigates their mutual associations with psychiatric symptoms, diagnoses, and history. Altogether, 315 mood or anxiety disorder outpatients without severe personality pathology were assessed with the LPO and tested with the CS, on which the EII-2 and its subcomponents (FQ-, WSum6, Critical contents, M-, PHR, GHR, and R) were calculated. Significant, but weak association between the EII-2 and the LPO was found. The WSum6, a measure of thought disorder, was the only EII-2 subcomponent significantly associated with the LPO. Both measures were consistently associated with psychiatric symptoms, diagnoses and history. The findings partially support the EII-2 and the LPO as consistently associated, relatively independent measures of the severity of personality pathology. More research on the incremental benefits of the measures is needed in clinical populations, covering non-severe and complex psychopathology.

Emotional intelligence in anorexia nervosa: Is anxiety a missing piece of the puzzle?,"Problematic emotional processing has been implicated in the genesis and maintenance of anorexia nervosa (AN). This study built on existing research and explored performance-based emotional intelligence (EI) in people with AN. The Mayer–Salovey–Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) was administered to 32 women diagnosed with AN and 32 female healthy controls (HC). Compared to HC women, the AN group demonstrated significantly lower total EI scores and poorer ability to understand how emotions can progress and change over time. Despite scores within the broadly average range compared to published EI norms, there was a general pattern of poorer performance in the AN sample. Self-reported anxiety symptoms were the strongest predictor of EI, over and above a diagnosis of AN. This study adds to the literature documenting the socioemotional phenotype of AN, suggesting this group of individuals may find it relatively difficult to carry out accurate reasoning about emotions, and to use emotions and emotional knowledge to enhance thought. Anxiety was highlighted as a putative variable partially explaining why people with AN demonstrated lower EI compared to controls. Implications for further research are discussed, including the need to explore the specificity of EI difficulties in AN using larger samples and additional control groups.

Compulsive hoarders: How do they differ from individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder?,"Hoarding has been considered a subtype of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Planned revisions to the diagnostic criteria propose that hoarding form a separate diagnosis in a larger category of obsessive compulsive related disorders. To date, there have been few direct comparisons between hoarding and those with other symptoms of OCD. This study builds on work that suggests compulsive hoarding, while similar to OCD, comprises a clinically distinct condition. Three groups were compared: those with OCD without compulsive hoarding symptoms ( n = 102), those with compulsive hoarding but not OCD ( n = 21), and individuals who satisfied both criteria ( n = 25). The groups were compared on obsessionality, compulsivity, overvalued ideas, depression, and anxiety. The two hoarding groups were also compared on hoarding symptoms and savings cognitions. Results indicated that the hoarding-only group reported fewer symptoms than both OCD groups, including fewer obsessions and compulsions and lower depression. Both hoarding groups showed significantly higher overvalued ideas when compared to the OCD-only group. These results suggest that hoarders experience less subjective distress than those with OCD, yet have greater difficulty in challenging dysfunctional cognitions associated with the presenting condition. These findings suggest that individuals with hoarding, whether with or without OCD, will show greater difficulty engaging in cognitive-behavioral interventions.

"Depression, anxiety, and stress as predictors of postconcussion-like symptoms in a non-clinical sample","This study examined the relationship between postconcussion-like symptoms and depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress respectively. Seventy-one university students with a negative concussion history completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and the British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory (BC-PSI). A multiple regression was conducted using the three DASS subscale scores as predictors of postconcussion-like symptoms. Depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress were significantly positively correlated with postconcussion-like symptoms at the bivariate level. When these three factors were examined together 72.9% of variance in BC-PSI total scores was explained overall. Stress and depressive symptoms emerged as significant multivariate predictors explaining 15% and 3% of unique variance, respectively. Anxiety was not a significant multivariate predictor. These results suggest that stress may be a more important predictor of postconcussion-like symptoms than previously identified. Findings are interpreted in light of Iverson (2012) conceptual model of poor outcomes from mild traumatic brain injury.

Loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials in patients with borderline personality disorder—Impact of psychopathology,"Alterations of the central serotonergic system are considered to be involved in the pathophysiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD). The loudness dependence of the N1/P2 component of auditory evoked potentials (LD) has been shown to indirectly reflect central serotonergic activity. The aim of this study was to investigate LD in patients with BPD compared to healthy controls, and to evaluate the association between LD and psychopathology such as anxiety, anger or impulsiveness. Female patients with BPD were included and compared to age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Self-rating instruments, such as the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) were used to assess clinical scores of anxiety, anger, and impulsiveness. Evoked potentials were recorded following the application of acoustic stimuli with increasing intensities; the LD was analysed using dipole source analysis. The mean LD was significantly higher in patients with BPD compared to controls. In the entire sample there were significant positive correlations of LD with state anxiety scores and STAXI subscores. The data contribute to the knowledge of neurophysiological alterations in patients with BPD, supporting the hypothesis of serotonergic dysregulation in the pathophysiology of the disorder. The significant clinical correlations suggest monoaminergic modulations of psychopathology on the symptom level.

Neurotrophic factors in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the levels of neurotrophins (NF) of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in different stages of treatment and their relationship with OCD clinical features. Forty patients with OCD and 40 healthy controls had Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), and Glial Cell-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GNDF) plasma levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients with OCD were further examined with the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Patients with OCD exhibited significantly lower levels of BDNF and significantly increased levels of NGF as compared to healthy controls. In OCD, statistically significant negative correlations between BDNF levels and number of working days lost per week were found. Additional analyses revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between both NGF and GDNF and severity of washing symptoms. Plasma levels of NF were not affected by age, age at OCD onset, gender, major depressive disorder, the relative dose of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors being prescribed, or the use of antipsychotics. Our findings suggest that patients with OCD may exhibit a particular NF profile, with functional impairment correlating with BDNF levels and severity of washing symptoms correlating with NGF and GDNF levels.

Disability associated with mental disorders in metropolitan China: An application of the quantile regression approach,"Recently active mental disorders are associated with substantial disability, but there is little research on residual disability once symptoms have subsided. The aim of this study is to estimate the degree to which recent disability might be due to recent or past history of mental disorders using a quantile regressions (QR) model that makes it possible to study the full range of disability. Data were from cross-sectional surveys of Chinese living in Beijing and Shanghai, China (n = 1628). The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule and the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview were used to assess recent disability and common mental disorders, respectively. Recently active mental disorders are found to be associated with elevated levels of disability, especially for current substance use disorder. Anxiety disorders stand out with high levels of disability. Individuals at the higher disability levels show large variations in their disability levels. These epidemiological estimates from China add to the evidence based on the global burden of neuropsychiatric disorders, quantifying the hypothesized influence of recently active and past disorders with the novel QR approach. In future studies, we hope to complete more detailed studies of the causal role of mental disorders in the development of disability.

Factor structure analysis of the SCL-90-R in a community-based sample of African American women,"The empirical literature pertaining to anxiety and related disorders in African Americans continues to be sparse, raising significant doubt upon the valid assessment of anxiety and related disorders in African American samples. The identification of culturally valid instruments that accurately identify the symptomatology associated with anxiety and related constructs as well as differentiating individuals who meet criteria for anxiety and related disorders would undoubtedly enhance our understanding of anxiety and related constructs in diverse populations while assisting researchers in identifying ingredients for culturally sensitive therapies (CSTs). The current study represents a major stride in this area through examination of the factor structure of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R) in a community-based sample of African American women. Ninety-one African American women completed the SCL-90-R as part of a larger investigation of anxiety and related disorders in African American parent–child dyads.

Examination of the trait facets of the five-factor model in discriminating specific mood and anxiety disorders,"Structural models of the mood and anxiety disorders postulate that each disorder has a shared component that can account for comorbidity and its own unique component that distinguishes it from others. The principal aim of the current study was to determine the extent to which the 30 facets of the Five-Factor Model (FFM), as measured by the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R), contribute to the identification of the unique component in mood and anxiety disorders in treatment-seeking clinical samples. Participants ( N = 610) were psychiatric outpatients with principal DSM-IV diagnoses (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized social phobia (GSP), panic disorder with/without agoraphobia (PD; PD/A) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Results suggest that approximately half of the variance in differences between these diagnoses is associated with specific characteristics represented by the FFM facets. Unique personality profiles for the MDD, GSP, PTSD and, to a lesser extent, OCD groups emerged. Broad traits of the FFM, when broken into more narrow components at the facet level, contribute significantly to the identification of unique aspects associated with specific mood and anxiety disorders. The integration of lower and higher levels of structural examination of the mood and anxiety disorders is discussed.

Symptom levels and initial appraisal of hospital treatment in patients with schizophrenia,"The initial appraisal of treatment by inpatients with schizophrenia has been found to be a significant predictor of clinical outcomes. The study aim was to examine whether specific types of symptoms are associated with the initial appraisal of treatment after controlling other patient characteristics. Data of 2105 inpatients with schizophrenia (ICD-10 F20-9) were pooled from three national and international multi-centre studies. Patients were interviewed within the first week of their inpatient admission. Higher levels of manic and positive symptoms were significantly associated with a less favourable initial appraisal of treatment, whilst no association was found with depression/anxiety and negative symptoms. Detained patients had more negative initial treatment appraisals, and the association with manic symptoms was significantly stronger in detained patients compared to those admitted voluntarily. Whilst patient-reported outcomes in psychiatry are usually associated with mood symptoms, this appears not to be the case for the initial appraisal by inpatients with schizophrenia. The association with manic and positive symptoms may be explained by the influence of such symptoms on the hospital experience. Focusing on the initial management of mania and positive symptoms might improve patients’ appraisal of treatment in the inpatient environment.

Pathological gambling severity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders in individuals with and without anxiety disorders in a nationally representative sample,"While anxiety disorders (ADs) and pathological gambling (PG) frequently co-occur with each other and other Axis I and Axis II disorders, previous studies have not examined the relative influence of ADs on the co-occurrences between PG severity and non-anxiety psychopathologies. The current study used data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions ( N = 43,093) to examine the influence of past-year ADs on the associations between past-year PG severity measures based on DSM-IV criteria for PG and non-anxiety psychiatric disorders. The findings revealed that increased PG severity was associated with Axes I and II psychopathology in both the groups with and without ADs. Significant anxiety-by-gambling-group interactions were also observed, particularly with respect to mood and personality disorders. The interactions indicate a stronger relationship between PG severity and psychopathology in participants without ADs than in those with ADs. Future research should investigate specific factors contributing to the co-occurrence of anxiety, gambling, and other psychiatric disorders and how the co-occurrences might influence clinically relevant phenomena such as treatment selection or course.

The role of ethnic identity in symptoms of anxiety and depression in African Americans,"Ethnic identity has been identified as a factor contributing to resilience and coping in African Americans. Ethnic identity includes positive feelings of ethnic affirmation and belonging, appreciation for one’s ethnic identity, and increased ethnic behaviors. This study examines the role of ethnic identity in symptoms of anxiety and depression. Participants were an adult student and community sample ( N = 572), administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression Scale (CES-D), State Trait Anxiety Inventory–state portion (STAI-S), and Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM). Compared to European Americans, African Americans reported significantly greater depression and more negative state anxiety, as well as higher levels of ethnic identity. For African Americans, higher ethnic identity was correlated to reduced anxiety and depression, whereas this was not true for European Americans. Findings support the proposition that a strong, positive ethnic identity may serve a protective role among African Americans by moderating the relationship between discriminatory experiences and psychological well-being. An Afrocentric perspective may also contribute to reduced anxiety due to a greater emphasis on a present versus future-oriented worldview. Clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed.

The effect of early onset common mental disorders on educational attainment in Australia,"Early onset mental disorders may lead to the early termination of education and thereby have long term adverse social and economic consequences on outcomes such as employment and financial security. This issue is important to address as governments seek to develop new ways to minimise the impacts of mental health problems and maximise workforce participation. The current investigation examines the impact of early onset affective, anxiety and substance use disorders on the early termination of secondary school education in Australia. The analyses used data from those aged between 20 and 34 in the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (NSMHWB) ( n = 2055). The NSMHWB is a population based survey administered by the Australian Bureau of Statics and included a WMH-CIDI 3.0 assessment to determine whether respondents met diagnostic criteria for any lifetime affective, anxiety, and/or substance use disorder as well as age of onset information. The results show that early onset mental disorders are significantly associated with the termination of secondary education in Australia, particularly early onset substance use disorders such as alcohol, cannabis and stimulant use. These disorders were most likely to disrupt completion in the middle years of high school (year 10 completion), in comparison to the final year 12 milestone. Policies and interventions promoting prevention and early intervention and offering educational support for young people with psychiatric illness and substance use problems, should intervene prior to the middle years of high school to help prevent adverse social and economic consequences.

Attentional processes and responding to affective faces in youth with borderline personality features,"This study examined attentional biases for emotional faces in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Twenty-one outpatient youth (aged 15–24 years) meeting three or more DSM-IV BPD criteria and 20 community-derived participants (aged 15–24 years) with no history of psychiatric problems and not meeting any BPD criteria completed a modified dot-probe task that tested automatic (30 ms) and controlled (500 ms) stages of information processing. The findings indicate that, compared with healthy controls, youth with borderline features were faster to respond to congruent rather than incongruent fear stimuli. This effect was independent of state anxiety and was observed during the 30 ms presentation of fearful faces. There was no significant effect for happy or angry faces. Youth with borderline features were also slower to respond to incongruent rather than paired neutral trials, indicating difficulties in disengaging attention from the perceived threat. Such differences were not found for the healthy controls. Thus, youth with borderline features had an attentional bias for fearful faces that reflected difficulty in disengaging attention from threatening information during preconscious stages of attention. This finding extends previous research highlighting the diminished capacity for affect regulation and subsequent engagement in behavioural strategies to avoid distress in BPD. Future research should explore the relationship between information processing, emotion regulation in adult BPD samples.

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index in older primary care patients with generalized anxiety disorder: Psychometrics and outcomes following cognitive behavioral therapy,"The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a widely used, comprehensive self-report measure of sleep quality and impairment, which has demonstrated good psychometric properties within various populations, including older adults. However, the psychometric properties of the PSQI and its component scores have not been evaluated for older adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Additionally, changes in PSQI global or component scores have not been reported following cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) of late-life GAD. This study examined (1) the psychometric properties of the PSQI within a sample of 216 elderly primary care patients age 60 or older with GAD who were referred for treatment of worry and/or anxiety; as well as (2) response to CBT, relative to usual care, for 134 patients with principal or coprincipal GAD. The PSQI demonstrated good internal consistency reliability and adequate evidence of construct validity. Those receiving CBT experienced greater reductions in PSQI global scores at post-treatment, relative to those receiving usual care. Further, PSQI global and component scores pertaining to sleep quality and difficulties falling asleep (i.e., sleep latency and sleep disturbances) demonstrated response to treatment over a 12-month follow-up period. Overall, results highlight the usefulness of the PSQI global and component scores for use in older adults with GAD.

Lifetime mood symptoms and adult separation anxiety in patients with complicated grief and/or post-traumatic stress disorder: A preliminary report,"A minority of bereaved individuals experiences symptoms of complicated grief (CG) that are associated with significant distress and impairment. CG is currently under consideration for inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) and a major issue is whether or not it can be differentiated from major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical features of CG with those of PTSD and CG+PTSD. A total sample of 116 patients (66 PTSD, 22 CG and 28 CG+PTSD) was recruited. Assessments included: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I disorders (SCID-I/P), Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG), Adult Separation Anxiety Questionnaire (ASA-27), Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), and Mood Spectrum-Self Report (MOODS-SR) lifetime version. CG was strongly associated with female gender. MDD comorbidity was more common among patients with CG while bipolar disorder was highest among those with PTSD+CG. Patients with CG+PTSD reported significantly higher ASA-27 scores compared to patients with either CG or PTSD alone. Patients with CG+PTSD or PTSD alone reported significantly higher scores on the manic component of the MOODS-SR. No significant differences were reported in the WSAS scores. Our results support differences between CG and PTSD that are important for the consideration of including CG as a new disorder in the DSM-V.

Genetic association study of individual symptoms in depression,"The heritability of some individual depressive symptoms has been well established. However, the causal genes related to individual depressive symptoms and genetic effects on the courses of individual depressive symptoms are still unclear. We examined these issues in 241 Korean patients who met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depression. Patients entered a 12-week clinical trial with antidepressants. A total of 1399 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 79 candidate genes were assessed. The rs557762 and the TT haplotype in the 11th haplotype block of the GRIA3 gene were associated with feelings of guilt in females. The GGCCGGGC haplotype in the first haplotype block of TPH1 was significantly associated with middle insomnia. The ACAG haplotype in the 13th haplotype block of the GRIK2 gene was associated with somatic anxiety. Moreover, the effect of the rs557762 on guilt significantly varied across times. Our results indicate that there are associations between particular gene polymorphisms and some individual depressive symptoms.

"Psychiatric morbidities, sleep disturbances, suicidality, and quality-of-life in a community population with medically unexplained pain in Korea","We examined the psychiatric morbidities, sleep disturbances, suicidality, quality-of-life, and psychological distress of community-dwelling subjects in Korea who had medically unexplained pain. A total of 6510 subjects (age 18–65years) participated in this study. A medically unexplained pain symptom (MUS-pain) was defined as pain lasting for 6 months or longer that was sufficiently severe to cause significant distress or to materially interfere with normal activities in the previous year, and that could not be explained by a medical condition or substance use/abuse. Diagnostic assessments were based on responses to the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, which was administered by lay colleagues. The presence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) disorders, sleep disturbances, suicidal tendency, quality-of-life issues, and psychological distress was determined in subjects with and without MUS-pain. There were significant positive associations between MUS-pain and nicotine dependence and withdrawal, alcohol dependence, major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and psychotic disorder. In addition, subjects with MUS-pain reported more sleep disturbances, suicidality, psychological distress, and a poorer quality-of-life than did subjects without MUS-pain. The results of this study suggest that clinicians should carefully evaluate and treat comorbid psychiatric problems in individuals with MUS-pain.

Psychopathology and offense types in detained male juveniles,"A substantial proportion of violent crime is committed by juveniles. In detained juveniles, high rates of psychopathology have been found. The objective of this study was to determine psychopathology associated with offense characteristics in detained male adolescents. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used to assess juvenile detainees. The final sample included 275 males (mean age = 16.45, S.D. = 1.27 years). Multivariate logistic regressions yielded significant associations between psychopathology and specific offense types: The presence of substance use disorders (without alcohol) (SUD) was found to predict drug-related crimes, and the presence of alcohol use disorders (AUD) without further SUD were a predictor of violent crime, especially in older juveniles. The absence of anxiety disorder, especially in younger juveniles, was found to be relevant for the prediction of robbery. The results of the study suggest that the use and abuse of legal and illegal substances might be a trigger for serious violent and drug-related crimes in juveniles.

Social cognition disorders in military police officers affected by posttraumatic stress disorder after the attack of An-Nasiriyah in Iraq 2006,"Emotional numbness in individuals affected by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be a result of the depletion of emotional capacities. The ability to process emotions in a social context is a part of social cognition, which is still an under-explored topic in PTSD. The present study investigated deficits in social cognition, such as emotion recognition and theory of mind, and their relationship to emotional numbing in 35 military police officers who were in Iraq in April 2006 during a terrorist attack in An-Nasiriyah. Our results indicated that individuals suffering from PTSD showed deficits in social cognition when compared with healthy subjects. These disorders seemed to involve emotional numbing rather than clinical symptoms such as anxiety and depression. Future research directions are suggested to improve the measurement of emotional functioning in PTSD.

Sublingual apomorphine as a neuroendocrine probe,"Subcutaneous apomorphine, a dopaminergic agonist, is used as a neuroendocrine probe for assessing central dopaminergic activity. The aim of our study was to test sublingual apomorphine for the same purpose. We administered sublingual apomorphine in a weight-dependent dose (0.033 mg/kg) to 42 healthy men. Prolactin and growth hormone levels were measured before and after the administration at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min. Subjects filled in Zung's self-assessment scores of anxiety (SAS) and depression (SDS) questionnaires before and after the test. Areas under the curve for prolactin and growth hormone levels were calculated using the trapezoidal rule. All subjects showed decreased prolactin, and 40/42 subjects showed increased growth hormone, in response to sublingual apomorphine. Average peak value for prolactin was −4.6 ± 1.8 μg/l. Average peak value for growth hormone was 8.1 ± 8.5 ng/ml for the whole group, and 9.6 ± 8.1 ng/ml after exclusion of two negative growth hormone responders. Sublingual apomorphine produced no major side effects. Significant decreases in SAS (21.5 ± 5.7 vs. 20.6±5.5) and SDS (9.7 ± 7.8 vs. 7.8 ± 6.8) scores were observed after the test. Sublingually administered apomorphine appears to be well tolerated and useful as a neuroendocrine marker of central dopaminergic activity.

Potential role of cortical 5-HT &lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the anxiolytic action of cyamemazine in benzodiazepine withdrawal,"The antipsychotic cyamemazine is a potent serotonin 5-HT 2A receptor (5-HT 2AR ) antagonist. A positron emission tomography (PET) study in human patients showed that therapeutic doses of cyamemazine produced near saturation of 5-HT 2AR occupancy in the frontal cortex, whereas dopamine D₂ occupancy remained below the level for motor side effects observed with typical antipsychotics. Recently, numerous studies have revealed the involvement of 5-HT 2AR in the pathophysiology of anxiety and a double-blind, randomized clinical trial showed similar efficacy of cyamemazine and bromazepam in reducing the anxiety associated with benzodiazepine withdrawal. Therefore, we reviewed the above articles about 5-HT 2AR and anxiety in order to understand better the anxiolytic mechanisms of cyamemazine in benzodiazepine withdrawal. The 5-HT 2AR is the most abundant serotonin receptor subtype in the cortex. Non-pharmacological studies with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and genetically modified mice clearly showed that cortical 5-HT 2AR signaling positively modulates anxiety-like behavior. With a few exceptions, most other studies reviewed here further support this view. Therefore, the anxiolytic efficacy of cyamemazine in benzodiazepine withdrawal can be due to a 5-HT 2AR antagonistic activity at the cortical level.

A pilot study on the validity of using pictures and videos for individualized symptom provocation in obsessive–compulsive disorder,"Distressing symptom-related anxiety is difficult to study in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) due to the disorder's heterogeneity. Our aim was to develop and validate a set of pictures and films comprising a variety of prominent OCD triggers that can be used for individually tailored symptom provocation in experimental studies. In a two-staged production procedure a large pool of OCD triggers and neutral contents was produced and preselected by three psychotherapists specialized in OCD. A sample of 13 OCD patients and 13 controls rated their anxiety, aversiveness and arousal during exposure to OCD-relevant, aversive and neutral control stimuli. Our findings demonstrate differences between the responses of patients and controls to OCD triggers only. Symptom-related anxiety was stronger in response to dynamic compared with static OCD-relevant stimuli. Due to the small number of 13 patients included in the study, only tentative conclusions can be drawn and this study merely provides a first step of validation. These standardized sets constitute valuable tools that can be used in experimental studies on the brain correlates of OCD symptoms and for the study of therapeutic interventions in order to contribute to future developments in the field.

Variation in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene and treatment response to venlafaxine XR in generalized anxiety disorder,"Antidepressant drugs are the preferred choice for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, the choice of pharmacotherapy is determined on a trial-and-error basis, as the underlying mechanisms of treatment response are unknown. We examined whether the COMT gene, which has been known to play a role in antidepressant treatment response in major depressive disorder (MDD), has a pharmacogenetic effect in antidepressant treatment response in GAD. In our study, 156 patients diagnosed with GAD received venlafaxine XR treatment as part of an 18-month relapse prevention study. Genotypes were obtained for the COMT functional variant rs4680 (Val158Met) for all patients; however, pharmacogenetic analysis was only conducted for the European American population ( n = 112). We found no significant association between our primary Hamilton Anxiety Scale outcome measure and rs4680. However, we did find a nominally significant allelic association between this variant and a secondary treatment outcome measure (CGI-I) in our European American population ( n = 112). Furthermore, we show a slight dominant effect of the A-allele with the CGI-I measure in the European American population indicating a possible pharmacogenetic role of rs4680 in antidepressant treatment outcome in GAD. Further studies in a larger population are needed to confirm this effect.

"Personality traits, cognition and volumetric MRI changes in elderly patients with early-onset depression: A 2-year follow-up study","Previous studies revealed personality changes in elderly patients with early-onset depression (EOD) that persist in euthymic stages. However, depression in older patients is a complex disorder that may affect not only personality, but also cognition and brain structure. To address this issue, a cross-sectional comparison and 2-year follow-up of 28 EOD elderly patients and 48 healthy controls included detailed neurocognitive assessment, estimates of brain volumes in limbic areas and white matter hyperintensities, as well as evaluation of the Five Factor Model of personality, in a remitted mood state. Results revealed that cognitive performances as well as brain volumes were preserved in EOD patients both at baseline and at follow-up. The increased Neuroticism factor and Anxiety facet scores as well as the decreased Warmth and Positive Emotions facet scores found at baseline reached the level of healthy controls after 2years. Only the Depression facet scores remained significantly higher in EOD patients compared to controls upon follow-up. Results were independent of depressive relapse since baseline (25% of patients). These findings suggest that both cognitive performances and brain volumes show long-term preservation in older EOD patients. In contrast, the depression-related personality facet might be a trait like marker that persists in the long-term evolution of this disorder.

Motor impairment in children with anxiety disorders,"This study examined the frequency and degree of motor impairment in referred children with anxiety disorders (AnxDs), compared with children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), children with comorbid AnxDs and ADHD, and nonreferred controls. All participants ( n =141; 90 males, 51 females; mean age: 10 years, 1 month; range: 7–13 years) had an IQ greater than 70. Diagnoses of mental disorders were established using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children (Kiddie-SADS). Motor ability was assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC). We found that children with AnxDs exhibited significantly higher total impairment scores on the M-ABC than controls, but were not significantly different from children with ADHD or children with comorbid AnxDs and ADHD. All clinical groups exhibited similar profiles of motor impairment. A total of 19 (46%) children with AnxDs scored below the 5th percentile on the M-ABC, indicating that motor function is impaired in many children with AnxDs to a degree that probably interferes with their activities of daily living. These results support the notion that assessment of motor function is important in understanding the daily challenges of children with AnxDs.

Personality profile of adult ADHD: The alternative five factor model,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed disorders in childhood affecting around 3% to 5% of adults worldwide. Most of the studies have been carried out using the Five Factor Model (FFM). Given the value and importance of describing adult ADHD in terms of general personality structure for a better conceptualization of this disorder, this study contributes adding new data on an Alternative Five Factor Model (AFFM) of personality. The aim of the present study is twofold: To assess the personality profile of adults with ADHD under the AFFM perspective, and to test the discriminant validity of the Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ) in differentiating ADHD subjects vs. normal range controls. A sample of 217 adults (64% male) meeting ADHD diagnosis (DSM-IV) was paired by age and sex with 434 normal-range controls. Logistic regression analysis showed that high scores on Neuroticism-Anxiety, Impulsivity and General Activity, and low on Work Activity were the most powerful predictors of being endorsed with an ADHD diagnosis. Results may suggest refinements in the personality assessment of ADHD as it seems that the ZKPQ provides more specific subscales for the description and conceptualization of this disorder.

Alexithymia is not a stable personality trait in patients with substance use disorders,"The construct of alexithymia as a vulnerability factor for substance use disorders (SUD) is under debate, because of conflicting research results regarding alexithymia as a state or trait phenomenon. The absolute and relative stability of alexithymia were evaluated in a pre-post design as part of a randomised controlled trial, controlling for several co-variates. Assessments were done with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI) at baseline and follow-up of a 3-month trial of inpatient Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) with or without a Shared Decision Making intervention for 187 SUD patients. Paired sample t -tests and analyses of variance were performed to assess absolute stability, intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for relative stability and multivariate linear regression models were used to evaluate the relation between co-variates and change in alexithymia. Mean level reduction of total TAS-20 and two subfactors demonstrated no absolute stability, but change in alexithymia differed for patients with low, moderate and high alexithymia scores. Relative stability of alexithymia was moderate to high for the total population, but differed according to low, moderate and high alexithymia scores. The EuropASI “psychiatry” domain, covering anxiety and depression, was related to alexithymia, but CBT-related variables were not. In conclusion, alexithymia is partly a state-dependent phenomenon, but not a stable personality trait in this SUD population.

Exploring the role of obsessive–compulsive relevant self-worth contingencies in obsessive–compulsive disorder patients,"This article examines whether self-worth contingencies in the personal domains of cleanliness, morality, hoarding, certainty, accuracy, religion and respect for others have specific associations with obsessive symptoms and cognitions in individuals with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Fifty-seven patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD completed the Obsessional Concerns and Self Questionnaire (OCSQ), designed to assess the extent to which respondents consider OCD content domains relevant to their self-worth, along with a battery of other instruments. Results indicate that the OCSQ is more associated with OCD than with non-OCD anxiety symptoms, and that it is also associated with comorbid depressive symptoms in OCD patients. Moreover, the OCSQ—Order and Cleanliness and Hoarding dimensions are associated with their symptom counterparts (i.e., contamination, checking, order, hoarding and neutralizing). OCSQ domains were highly associated with dysfunctional beliefs about obsessions. However, only the OCSQ scores, but not the dysfunctional beliefs, predicted OCD symptoms. These results support cognitive conceptualizations implicating self-concept in OCD development, and they suggest the need to further analyze the influence of self-worth in OCD development and maintenance.

"Serum concentrations of CRP, IL-6, TNF-α and cortisol in major depressive disorder with melancholic or atypical features","The aim of the present study was to explore possible differences between serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and cortisol concentration in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) with melancholic features, and MDD with atypical features. As secondary aim, we investigated possible associations with clinical features such as suicidal ideation, number of episodes, duration of depression and symptomatology severity. We included 55 MDD patients (32 with melancholic features and 23 with atypical features) and 18 healthy controls. When compared to healthy controls, MDD with melancholic or atypical features showed higher CRP and IL-6, but not TNF-α. Cortisol concentration was higher in MDD with melancholic type, in comparison to the atypical type of MDD or controls. A positive correlation was found between the severity of depressive symptoms, concentrations of IL-6 and cortisol in the MDD group with melancholic features, while a negative correlation was observed between IL-6 and CRP in the MDD group with atypical feature. Also, in the MDD group with atypical features, there was a correlation between the severity of anxiety symptoms based on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HARS), concentration of CRP, and the duration of symptoms. In conclusion, we observed several differences in serum CRP, IL-6, and cortisol concentrations in MDD patients considering clinical features as well.

Psychological correlates in patients with different levels of hypertension,"The evidence linking essential systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) with psychological characteristics remains equivocal. The aims of this study were to assess clinical and subclinical distress, psychosocial aspects and psychological well-being in treated hypertensive patients and to evaluate the psychosocial variables associated with higher levels of blood pressure according to guidelines for hypertension management. A consecutive series of 125 hypertensive patients were evaluated using both self- and observer-rated reliable measures. Generalized anxiety disorder, minor depression, demoralization and alexithymia were the most frequent diagnoses. Cluster analysis revealed an association of three distinct symptomatological groups such as the Anxiety–Depression, the Alexithymia and the Somatization groups, with different levels of hypertension. In particular, patients with moderate to severe hypertension were more frequently in the Anxiety–Depression and the Alexithymia groups, whereas the Somatization cluster has been shown to be associated with isolated systolic hypertension. The results provide new insight into the psychosocial characteristics among patients with different levels of SAH according to recent guidelines of the management of hypertension. They also outline the need to monitor the clinical course of hypertensive patients characterized by these specific clinical and subclinical psychological conditions.

Social anxiety and social cognition: The influence of sex,"Current theoretical models predict a negative relationship between social anxiety and performance on measures of social cognition, yet there appears to be relatively little research that directly examines this relationship and the potential interaction of sex. Two samples of undergraduates self-reporting either a high (n = 27; 59% female) or low (n = 29; 62% female) level of social anxiety on the abbreviated Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory completed two social cognition measures: the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (Eyes Test) and The Awareness of Social Inference Test—Parts 2 and 3). A multivariate analysis of variance revealed a significant group by sex interaction on overall social cognition performance. Follow-up analyses indicated that males with high and low levels of social anxiety did not differ on any of the social cognition measures. In contrast, females with high social anxiety performed significantly better on the Eyes Test and the TASIT—Part 3 than females with low social anxiety. Contrary to expectations, results of this study suggest that females with high social anxiety may exhibit better-developed social cognition abilities than those with low social anxiety. These preliminary results have clinical implications in the treatment of individuals with social phobia.

Schizophrenia comorbid with panic disorder: Evidence for distinct cognitive profiles,"Patients with comorbid schizophrenia and panic symptoms share a distinct clinical presentation and biological characteristics, prompting some to propose panic psychosis as a separate subtype of schizophrenia. Less is known about these patients' neuropsychological profiles, knowledge of which may facilitate target-specific treatments and research into the etiopathophysiology for such cases. A total of 255 schizophrenia patients with panic disorder (n =39), non-panic anxiety disorder (n =51), or no anxiety disorder (n =165) were assessed with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Revised, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the Trail Making Test, the Controlled Oral Word Association Test, the Animal Naming subtest of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, and the Wechsler Memory Scale—Revised. Psychotic symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Patients with panic disorder demonstrated a higher verbal IQ and better problem solving, set switching, delayed recall, attention, and verbal fluency as compared to schizophrenia patients without comorbid anxiety. The schizophrenia-panic group reported a higher level of dysthymia on stable medication. Our findings suggest that patients with schizophrenia and comorbid panic disorder exhibit distinct cognitive functioning when compared to other schizophrenia patients. These data offer further support for a definable panic-psychosis subtype and suggest new etiological pathways for future research.

Psychological characteristics of early remitters in patients with panic disorder,"We aimed to examine whether anxiety sensitivity and agoraphobic fear could affect the time taken to remission after 24 weeks of open-label escitalopram treatment of patients with panic disorder (PD). We recruited 158 patients, and 101 patients completed the study. Clinical severity and psychological characteristics were assessed at baseline and 4, 12, and 24 weeks after the treatment, using the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), the Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety and Depression, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-Revised (ASI-R), the Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire (APPQ), and the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS). Remission was defined as the absence of full panic attacks and PDSS scores of 7 or less. Completing patients were stratified according to the time taken to remit: early ( n = 20) and late ( n = 58) remission and non-remission groups ( n = 23). There were no significant differences among the three groups at baseline on the CGI-S and the PDSS mean scores. However, early remitters had significantly lower scores than late remitters and non-remitters on the ASI-R and APPQ. In conclusion, anxiety sensitivity and agoraphobic fear can affect the time to remission after pharmacotherapy, and clinicians should consider the psychological characteristics of PD patients in order to achieve an optimal response to pharmacotherapy.

Evaluation of the factor structure of symptoms in patients with schizophrenia,"Considering the widespread use of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and its factors around the world in clinical trials, it is clearly necessary to perform a transcultural validation of the factor structure of the PANSS. The purpose of the present study was to examine the PANSS factor structure in a Korean sample of subjects with schizophrenia. A total of 150 outpatients were assessed using the PANSS and other clinical rating scales. Principal component analyses revealed five factors, i.e., negative, cognitive/disorganization, positive, excitement, and depression/anxiety dimensions, which accounted for 64.1% of the total variance. All five factors showed good internal consistency, suggesting that the reliability of the factors extracted was adequate. Significant correlations were found between the five components of the PANSS and the corresponding clinical rating scales. The results of the present study indicate that the five-factor model best fit the data from our patients and that it was validated transculturally. The factor structures should be further validated using various neurobiological methods to ultimately help in clarifying the heterogeneity and pathogenesis of symptomatology in schizophrenia.

Sensory phenomena associated with repetitive behaviors in obsessive-compulsive disorder: An exploratory study of 1001 patients,"A substantial number of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) report compulsions that are preceded not by obsessions but by subjective experiences known as sensory phenomena. This study aimed to investigate the frequency, severity, and age at onset of sensory phenomena in OCD, as well as to compare OCD patients with and without sensory phenomena in terms of clinical characteristics. We assessed 1,001 consecutive OCD patients, using instruments designed to evaluate the frequency/severity of OC symptoms, tics, anxiety, depression, level of insight and presence/severity of sensory phenomena. All together, 651 (65.0%) subjects reported at least one type of sensory phenomena preceding the repetitive behaviors. Considering the sensory phenomena subtypes, 371 (57.0%) patients had musculoskeletal sensations, 519 (79.7%) had externally triggered “just-right” perceptions, 176 (27.0%) presented internally triggered “just right,” 144 (22.1%) had an “energy release,” and 240 (36.9%) patients had an “urge only” phenomenon. Sensory phenomena were described as being as more severe than were obsessions by 102(15.7%) patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that the following characteristics were associated with the presence of sensory phenomena: higher frequency and greater severity of the symmetry/ordering/arranging and contamination/washing symptom dimensions; comorbid Tourette syndrome, and a family history of tic disorders. These data suggest that sensory phenomena constitute a poorly understood psychopathological aspect of OCD that merits further investigation.

The influence of personality and dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions on the severity of insomnia,"Previous findings suggest that personality traits and dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions may perpetuate insomnia, but findings concerning this have been scarce. Thus, we hypothesized that personality and sleep-related cognitions influence the severity of insomnia, and investigated the association personality and sleep-related cognitions had with various sleep-related parameters, including severity of insomnia. Forty-four patients with psychophysiological insomnia were assessed using The Temperament and Character Inventory, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Dysfunctional Belief and Attitudes toward Sleep Scale, the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Insomnia severity was significantly and positively correlated with harm avoidance, self-transcendence and sleep-related cognitions, and negatively correlated with novelty seeking, reward dependence, and cooperativeness. Dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions were positively correlated with insomnia severity and sleep quality. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that sleep-related cognitions, depression and reward dependence scores were significant determinants of insomnia severity, and that sleep-related cognitions and self-transcendence were significant positive determinants of sleep quality. Reward dependence, depression and sleep-related cognitions were associatedwith insomnia severity, and comparison with previous findings implied that ‘internalizing behavior’ and depression may be more plausible candidates for the link between personality and insomnia than anxiety. Considering the major role of cognitive–behavioral treatment (CBT) in the treatment of insomnia, assessment of these factors and management of sleep-related cognitions may help alleviate symptoms in patients with insomnia.

Different measures of impulsivity in patients with anxiety disorders: A case control study,"The relationship between anxiety and impulsivity is controversial and not well explored. The present investigation aims to compare impulsivity, measured by different rating tools, in patients with anxiety disorders vs. healthy controls. Forty-seven subjects with different anxiety disorders and 45 matched controls underwent diagnostic and symptomatological evaluations by the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I) Plus 5.0, Bech-Raphaelsen Depression and Mania Scale (BRDMS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Hypomania Check List (HCL-32) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI); temperamental evaluations by the Questionnaire for the Affective and Anxious Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Modified (TEMPS-M), the Separation Anxiety Sensitivity Index (SASI), the Interpersonal Sensitivity Symptoms Inventory (ISSI); and psychometric and a neurocognitive evaluations of impulsivity using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and the Immediate and Delayed Memory Task (IMT-DMT). Subjects with anxiety disorders were more impulsive than the controls in all the explored measures, with higher scores in symptomatological and, temperamental scales. Patients with anxiety disorders but without a lifetime history of comorbid major mood episodes had greater trait and state impulsivity than controls.

Association of comorbid anxiety with social functioning in school-age children with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"Although attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently comorbid with disruptive behavior disorders, less is known about ADHD and comorbid anxiety. To improve understanding about the association of anxiety and social functioning, we studied 223 6 to 9 year-old ethnically diverse boys and girls ( M =7.4 years) with and without ADHD. According to parents, children with ADHD and anxiety ( n =46) and ADHD only ( n =71) were consistently less socially competent than comparison children (i.e., no anxiety and ADHD: n =80) and children with anxiety only ( n =26), who did not differ from one another. A similar pattern emerged for teacher ratings where youth with ADHD only and ADHD with anxiety exhibited the most social problems, but they did not differ from each other. These data suggest that comorbid anxiety does not exacerbate social dysfunction among 6 to 9 year-old children with ADHD. We consider findings within a developmental psychopathology framework to further understand social development in children with ADHD and anxiety.

The relationship between childhood exposure to trauma and intermittent explosive disorder,"There has been a paucity of research linking intermittent explosive disorder (IED) to trauma and posttraumatic stress responses, despite evidence that trauma is strongly associated with anger reactions.

Participants were 4844 trauma-exposed and 731 non trauma-exposed adults who took part in the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R). Findings indicated that IED was associated with greater trauma exposure, PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) diagnosis, and first exposure to traumatic events in childhood. Exploratory analyses investigating the link between IED and age at first trauma exposure across trauma types suggested that IED is related to childhood exposure to interpersonal traumatic events. These findings are discussed in the context of developmental trauma and cycles of violence models.

Depersonalization disorder and anxiety: A special relationship?,"A significant association between anxiety and depersonalization has been found in healthy controls and psychiatric patients irrespective of underlying conditions. Although patients with depersonalization disorder (DPD) often have a history of severe anxiety symptoms, clinical observations suggest that the relation between anxiety and depersonalization is complex and poorly understood. Using relevant rating scales, levels of anxiety and depersonalization were assessed in 291 consecutive DPD cases. ‘High’ and ‘low’ depersonalization groups, were compared according to anxiety severity. Correlation and multivariate regression analyses were also used to assessed the contribution of anxiety to the phenomenology and natural course of depersonalization. A low but significant association between depersonalization and anxiety (as measured by Beck's Anxiety Inventory) was only apparent in those patients with low intensity depersonalization, but not in those with severe depersonalization. Levels of anxiety did not seem to make specific contributions to the clinical features of depersonalization itself, although DPD patients with high anxiety seem characterised by additional non-specific perceptual symptoms. The presence of a ‘statistical dissociation’ between depersonalization and anxiety adds further evidence in favour of depersonalization disorder being an independent condition and suggests that its association with anxiety has been overemphasized.

Hypersensitivity to hypercapnia: Definition/(s),"Empirical evidence indicates that panic disorder (PD) patients experience hypersensitivity to hypercapnia, a condition in which the blood level of carbon dioxide exceeds the normal value. The importance of this research line is substantial and indeed, hypercapnic hypersensitivity has been advanced as a possible endophenotype of panic. Definitions of “hypersensitivity,” however, have varied. The purpose of this brief review is to delineate and critique different definitions of hypercapnic hypersensitivity. Several definitions—panic attack rate, panic symptoms including dyspnea, subjective anxiety, and respiratory disturbance—are explored. The review concludes that although no ideal definition has emerged, marked anxiety post-hypercapnia has substantial support as a putative trait marker of PD. The term “subjective hypersensitivity” (Coryell et al., 2001) is re-introduced to denote pronounced anxiety post-hypercapnia and recommended for use along with its previous definition: increased self-reported anxiety measured on a continuous visual analog scale, already widely in use. Due to the well-established link between panic and respiration, definitional candidates focusing on aberrant respiratory response—less investigated as trait markers of PD in high risk studies—warrant scrutiny as well. Several reasons why definitional clarity might be beneficial are presented, along with ideas for future research.

Sex differences on emotional processing are modulated by subclinical levels of alexithymia and depression: A preliminary assessment using event-related potentials,"Several studies have suggested that women are more sensitive than men to emotions in general. Event-related potential (ERP) studies have demonstrated N2 and P3b modulations, suggesting that women allocate more attentional resources to emotions than men do. However, the exact origin of this emotional modulation by sex is still a matter of debate. We wondered whether these sex differences might be due to some specific personality traits of women and men. Thirty participants (15 males and 15 females) were selected so that there were no sex differences on alexithymia, or depression and anxiety scales. The participants were asked to complete a “modified emotional” oddball task, in which they had to detect deviant stimuli among frequent neutral ones as quickly as possible. Behavioral performance, N2 and P3b ERP data were analyzed. When personality factors were controlled for, the sex differences on N2 and P3b components of the ERPs disappeared. Moreover, linear regression analyses showed that alexithymia was much better than sex at predicting the N2 latencies, while depression was the best factor for predicting the P3b latency. These results suggest that personality factors should be taken into account when sex differences on emotional processing are investigated.

Anxiety and negative self-schemas mediate the association between childhood maltreatment and paranoia,"This study examined affective and psychological routes from childhood maltreatment to increased paranoia in adulthood. Recent anxiety and negative beliefs about the self partially accounted for the associations between emotional or physical abuse and paranoia. However, as full mediation did not occur, other psychological, social and biological pathways require exploration.

Behavioral inhibition and PTSD symptoms in veterans,"Behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperamental bias to respond to novel stimuli with avoidance behaviors, is a risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear whether BI accounts for additional variance in PTSD symptom severity beyond that accounted for by general anxiety. Here, 109 veterans (mean age 50.4 years, 9.2% female) provided self-assessment of PTSD symptoms, state and trait anxiety, combat exposure, and current (adult) and retrospective (childhood) BI. Adult BI was correlated with anxiety and PTSD symptom severity, especially cluster C (avoidance) symptoms, but not with combat exposure. A regression model including adult BI, state and trait anxiety, and combat exposure was able to correctly classify over 80% of participants according to presence or absence of severe PTSD symptoms. Because avoidance behaviors are a core component of PTSD, self-assessments of BI may be an important tool in understanding PTSD and potentially assessing vulnerability to the disorder.

Depression in youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder: Clinical phenomenology and correlates,"This study examined differences in clinical presentation and functional impairment in youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with or without comorbid depressive disorders and sought to determine the predictors of youth-reported depressive symptoms. One-hundred and sixty youth were reliably diagnosed with OCD and comorbid disorders using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV: Parent version (Silverman and Albano, 1996) and confirmed by an experienced clinician. Sixteen percent ( n = 25) had a comorbid diagnosis of a current depressive disorder (DD). Significantly more females than males had a DD. Those with a DD showed increased OCD symptom severity, OCD-related functional impairment, and family accommodation relative to those without a comorbid DD. Depressive symptoms were significantly positively correlated with years of age, degree of OCD symptom severity, measures of OCD-related functional impairment, and non-OCD anxiety symptoms. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that age, gender, functional impairment, and non-OCD anxiety were significant predictors of depressive symptoms, even when OCD symptom severity was controlled. Notably, functional impairment was a partial mediator of the relationship between OCD symptom severity and depression levels, suggesting depression levels are the product of both degree of symptoms and amount of day-to-day impairment. Results are discussed in terms of implications for assessment and treatment.

Ethnic variation in the prevalence of depression and anxiety in primary care: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Primary care plays a key role in the detection and management of depression and anxiety. At present it is not clear if the prevalence of depression and anxiety in primary care differs between migrants and ethnic minorities (MI) and natives and ethnic majorities (MA). A systematic review and a meta-analysis of studies comparing the prevalence of depression and anxiety in MI and MA in primary care were performed. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EMBASE and through hand-search. We included 25 studies, most of which had a relatively small sample size. Significant variations were found in the prevalence of anxiety and depression across studies. Pooled analyses were carried out for 23 studies, based on random-effects models. Pooled RR of depression and anxiety in MI were 1.21 (95% CI 1.04–1.40, p = 0.012) and 1.01 (95% CI 0.76–1.32, p = 0.971), with high heterogeneity (I² = 87.2% and I² = 73%). Differences in prevalence rates among studies can be accounted for by inclusion criteria, sampling methods, diagnostic instruments and study design. Further research on larger samples and with culturally adapted instruments is needed to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety in MI seeking help for these disorders.

Efficacy of an internet-based intervention for posttraumatic stress disorder in Iraq: A pilot study,"In the past 20 years, war and human rights violations have led to high rates of exposure to traumatic events among the Iraqi population. Due to the ongoing violence, many physicians and mental health professionals have left Iraq in recent years. The Internet offers new possibilities for the psychological treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in conflict areas. A therapist-supported cognitive-behavioral treatment manual that has been evaluated in Western countries was translated into Arabic and culturally adapted. The treatment was conducted via the Internet by Arabic-speaking therapists and was evaluated in an uncontrolled pilot study with 15 participants. Main outcome measures were PTSD (Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS)), depression, anxiety (Hopkins Symptom Check List-25 (HSCL-25)), and quality of life (EUROHIS). The intervention resulted in a highly significant decrease in symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Quality of life was higher at posttreatment. All treatment effect sizes were in the large range, indicating a significant improvement in mental health symptoms and quality of life. Preliminary clinical evidence indicates that new technologies can be used to provide humanitarian aid in the form of e-mental health services, even in areas that remain highly unstable.

Self-assessment of psychological stress in schizophrenia: Preliminary evidence of reliability and validity,"Heightened stress sensitivity is a common characteristic of schizophrenia and may be predictive of clinical and functional outcomes. However, systematic assessment is not part of routine clinical practice. This study investigated the reliability and predictive values of two versions of a new scale for the assessment of psychological stress in psychosis (Psychological Stress Index; PSI). Thirty-seven patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and 30 healthy controls completed a battery of self-report measures at baseline and 4–8 weeks for test–retest. Thirty-four patients were followed up at 12 months. Both of the 18-item and 9-item PSI demonstrated good levels of reliability and could significantly discriminate patients from healthy controls. Both versions showed moderate convergence with self-report and clinician ratings of depression and anxiety, and superior predictive validity of 12-month follow-up clinical and functional outcomes compared to an existing measure of stress (Perceived Stress Scale). The clinical usefulness of the PSI is supported by its predictive power on cross-sectional and longitudinal outcome. The PSI-9 performed as well as, if not better than, the PSI-18 in this study, but further evaluation is warranted for more conclusive comparison.

Gender differences in firesetting: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC),"This study presents gender differences in sociodemographics and in psychiatric correlates of firesetting in the United States. Data were derived from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a representative sample of U.S. adults. Face-to-face interviews of more than 43,000 adults were conducted in the 2001–2002 period. This study focused on the 407 subjects with a lifetime history of firesetting. The prevalence of lifetime firesetting in the U.S. was 1.7% in men and 0.4% in women. Firesetting was significantly associated with a wide range of antisocial behaviors that differed by gender. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated associations in both genders with psychiatric and addictive disorders. Men with a lifetime history of firesetting were significantly more likely than men without such history to have lifetime generalized anxiety disorder as well as a diagnosis of conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol or cannabis use disorder, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Women with a lifetime history of firesetting were significantly more likely than women without such history to have lifetime alcohol or cannabis use disorder, conduct disorder, and antisocial or obsessive compulsive personality disorder, as well as psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder or schizoid personality disorder. Women with a lifetime history of firesetting were significantly more likely than men with such history to have a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol abuse and antisocial personality disorder as well as a diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder. Our findings indicate that firesetting in women could represent a behavioral manifestation of a broader spectrum than firesetting in men.

Psychosocial and neurocognitive profiles in depressed patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder,"Previous studies have revealed psychosocial and cognitive impairments in patients during depression. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with major depression (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) differ in psychosocial and neurocognitive profiles. A second aim was to examine whether cognitive impairments are homogeneous among depressed patients. Patients with MDD ( n = 16) and BD ( n = 14) were enrolled during a major depressive episode. About half of them had comorbidities, including personality, substance use, and anxiety disorders. Information was collected about symptomatology and psychosocial functioning, whereas an exhaustive neuropsychological battery was administered to assess cognition. During a depressive episode, MDD and BD patients had global psychosocial dysfunction, characterized by occupational and relational impairments. A cognitive slowing was also observed, as well as deficits related to alertness, spontaneous flexibility, sustained and divided attention. Moreover, severity of depression and cognitive functions were significantly associated with psychosocial functioning. In the case of severe mood disorders, psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning seem similar among MDD and BD patients during a depressive episode. In addition to an altered daily functioning, the neurocognitive profile was heterogeneous with regard to the nature and extent of cognitive deficits. Executive functions, as well as verbal learning and memory, were preserved better than attentional processes.

Impulsivity and internalizing disorders in childhood,"Impulsivity has often been related to externalizing disorders, but little is known about how it is related to symptoms of internalizing disorders. This study aims to examine the relationship between impulsivity and depression and anxiety symptoms of depression and anxiety in childhood, and compare it with its relationship with a measure of aggressive behavior, which is present in many externalizing disorders. We administered the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 for children, the Children's Depression Inventory and the Screen for Children's Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders to a case–control sample of 562 children aged between 9 and 13 who were selected from an epidemiological study of anxiety and depression and whose teachers provided information about their proactive and reactive aggression. Impulsivity was related to measures of anxiety, depression and aggressive behavior, and showed higher relationships with measures of internalizing symptoms than with aggression. Motor impulsivity, a component of impulsivity related to inhibition deficits, was the component most related to anxiety and depression. Cognitive impulsivity, on the other hand, was negatively related to anxiety and depression. The relationships between impulsivity and symptoms of internalizing disorders seem to indicate that impulsivity should be taken into account not only in externalizing problems, but also in depression and anxiety in children and adolescents.

One-year severity of depressive symptoms: Results from the NESDA Study,"The aim of this study was to simultaneously examine a wide range of risk factors and clinical characteristics in their predictive value for the 1-year severity of depressive symptoms. Data from 789 participants in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), a large psychiatric cohort study, with a major depressive disorder (MDD) at baseline were used. Depression severity at 1-year follow-up was studied using linear and multinomial logistic regression models. Results of the analyses showed that high neuroticism, no partner and older age were found predictive of a poorer outcome independent of baseline clinical characteristics. Further, comorbid anxiety disorder, first episode, having a moderate subtype (vs. melancholic), and higher baseline depression severity predicted poorer outcome. To conclude, both risk factors and clinical characteristics independently predicted 1-year severity of depressive symptoms. The findings indicate that the prediction of prognosis and identification of persons at risk of a poor outcome should not only be based on clinical characteristics, but on risk factors as well.

Dysfunctional distracter inhibition and facilitation for sad faces in depressed individuals,"Depression is a commonly occurring mental disorder, which is characterized by dysfunctional inhibition and facilitation for emotional stimuli. The aim of the present study was to investigate distracter inhibition and facilitation for emotional faces in depressed individuals in a negative affective priming task. Control participants who had never suffered from depression (NC), sub-clinically depressed participants, and participants diagnosed with a current major depressive disorder (MDD), Anxiety Inventory, the Hamilton Depression Rating Score were recruited using the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck and DSM-IV as tools. Twenty-four participants in each group completed a negative affective priming task. The main finding was that there were no significant differences among the three groups in the positive and negative priming effects of happy faces. However, there were significant differences for positive and negative priming effects of sad faces between each pair of groups, with the effects being lowest for MDD and highest for NC participants. It can be concluded that depressed individuals are characterized by enhanced facilitation and deficient inhibition for negative materials, which is a stable cognitive vulnerability risk, possibly associated with the occurrence of depression. There are differences in the cognitive dysfunction for negative stimuli between clinically depressed and sub-clinically depressed individuals.

Cigarette smoking in outpatients with chronic schizophrenia in Taiwan: Relationships to socio-demographic and clinical characteristics,"In individuals with schizophrenia, the prevalence of cigarette smoking is significantly higher than that of the general population; this appears to be associated with specific psychosocial and clinical characteristics. Indeed, some evidence suggests an increased risk of suicide among smokers with schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of smokers with schizophrenia in Taiwan. In this cross-sectional study, 95 outpatients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia were recruited and independently interviewed for nicotine dependency with tobacco use. The effects of cigarette smoking on the various measures, especially suicidality, were investigated. The results revealed that smokers with schizophrenia had higher rates of hospitalization, lifetime suicide attempts, antipsychotic treatment side effects, psychopathology, impulsivity, depression, anxiety, and suicidal risk than non-smokers with schizophrenia. When separate analyses were conducted in male and female patients, depressive symptoms were significant predictors of suicidality among males, whereas heavy smoking, anxious symptoms, and hopelessness were significant predictors among females. From this study, we may gain insights into the role of cigarette smoking in patients of schizophrenia in Taiwan. Furthermore, cigarette smoking may influence aspects of suicidality in schizophrenia.

"History of suicide attempt in male substance-dependent inpatients and relationship to borderline personality features, anger, hostility and aggression","The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between severity of borderline personality features and history of suicide attempt (HSA) in male substance-dependent inpatients and the effect of anger, hostility and aggression on this relationship. Further, the effect of some variables that may be related to suicide and/or borderline personality, such as age at inception of regular substance use, substance of dependence (alcohol/drug), depression, and both state and trait anxiety, were controlled. Participants were 200 consecutively admitted male substance-dependent inpatients. Patients were investigated with the Borderline Personality Inventory (BPI), the Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Among substance-dependent inpatients, 33.0% ( n = 66) were identified as the group with HSA. Mean scores employment status,marital status and duration of education did not differ between groups, whereas current age and age at onset of regular substance use were lower in group with HSA. Mean scores of BPI, AQ and its subscales (anger, hostility and physical/verbal aggression), BDI and STAI were higher in the HSA group. In addition, the rates of drug dependency and borderline personality disorder were higher in this group. The severity of borderline personality symptoms was highly correlated with subscales of the AQ, depression and anxiety, whereas it was negatively correlated with age at onset of regular substance use. The severity of anger and borderline personality features predicted HSA in the logistic regression model. Results suggest that, to reduce the risk of suicide attempt among substance-dependent patients, the feeling of anger must be the target of evaluation and treatment among those with borderline personality features.

Assessment of empathy in first-episode psychosis and meta-analytic comparison with previous studies in schizophrenia,"Empathy is a multidimensional construct that relies on affective and cognitive component processes. A few studies have reported impairments of both cognitive and affective empathy components in patients with schizophrenia. It is, however, not known whether these difficulties are already present at psychosis onset. The affective and cognitive components of empathy were thus assessed in 31 patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and 31 matched healthy controls using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Our results were then compared to previous studies of empathy in patients with more chronic schizophrenia via a meta-analysis. In addition, we also assessed the relationship between empathy ratings, Mentalizing performance and clinical symptoms. Contrary to what has been reported in people with more chronic schizophrenia, the IRI ratings did not significantly differ between FEP and controls in our study, though a trend was observed for the Personal distress scale. For the Perspective taking scale, our meta-analysis revealed a significantly lower effect size in this study with FEP patients relative to previous schizophrenia studies. In the FEP group, the IRI ratings were not related to positive, negative or general psychopathology symptoms, but a significant relationship emerged between the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and Perspective taking (negative correlation). In addition, a significant positive correlation was observed between the Empathic concern subscale and our theory of mind task. This study supports the idea that the cognitive component of empathy is less affected in patients with first-episode psychosis relative to patients with more chronic schizophrenia, and the impairments reported in previous reports with more chronic populations should be interpreted in light of a possible deterioration of this cognitive skill. The findings also provide some insight into the relationship between empathy and clinical symptoms such as social anxiety.

Varenicline prevents affective and cognitive exacerbation during smoking abstinence in male patients with schizophrenia,"To explore the effects of varenicline on the psychopathology and cognition of chronic inpatients with schizophrenia, we conducted a non-randomized control group time series investigation between March 2009 and April 2010. In a mandatory smoking cessation intervention, 41 male inpatient smokers were scheduled to undergo either a 5-week varenicline treatment (varenicline group) or the use of no drugs (non-treatment group). Depression (HAM-D), anxiety (HAM-A), and psychosis (PANSS) were evaluated at baseline, and at the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 12th week after abstinence; four neuropsychological tests, including Digit Span Forward and Backward (DSF and DSB), and Trail Making Test-A and -B, were evaluated at baseline and at the 4th, 8th and 12th week. .Thirty patients completed the study. Among 15 patients in the non-treatment group, the HAM-D, HAM-A, DSF, and DSB scores were exacerbated during the 2–8 weeks of abstinence, but there were no changes in psychotic symptoms and the other two neuropsychological tests. Compared with the non-treatment group, varenicline users experienced less impairment in HAM-D and HAM-A scores at the 2nd and 4th weeks, and in DSF tasks at the 4th week after abstinence. In conclusions, varenicline can attenuate abstinence-induced adverse outcomes and appears to be well-tolerated in smokers with schizophrenia.

Correlates of perceptual distortions in clinical and non-clinical populations using the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale (CAPS): Associations with anxiety and depression and a re-validation using a representative population sample,"Although the literature on hallucinations in psychiatric patients shows clear links with anxiety and depression, associations of affect with a wider array of anomalous perceptual experiences have been much less studied. This study investigated patients with psychosis (N=29) and a non-clinical population (N=193) using the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale (CAPS), a measure of perceptual distortion and associated distress, intrusiveness and frequency; along with measures of depression, anxiety and worry. The study also allowed a re-validation of the CAPS in a more representative sample of the UK population. Moderate, reliable correlations with depression, anxiety and worry were found in the non-clinical population with the association being stronger in psychotic patients. The study re-confirmed that anomalous perceptual experiences are common in the general population and that a significant minority (11.9%) have higher levels than the mean of psychotic patients. Scale reliability and validity were also re-confirmed, and the CAPS score was found to be unrelated to age or gender in either sample. As in the original study, factor analysis produced a three-factor solution, although factor theme was not fully replicated: as before, a cluster of first-rank symptoms emerged, but with equivocal evidence for a temporal lobe factor and no replication of a ‘chemosensation’ component.

Healthy people with delusional ideation change their mind with conviction,"Emotional distress and reasoning biases are two factors known to contribute to delusions. As a step towards elucidating mechanisms underlying delusions, the main aim of this study was to evaluate a possible “jumping to new conclusions” reasoning bias in healthy people with delusional ideation and its association with emotions. We surveyed 80 healthy participants, measuring levels of depression, anxiety, cognitive error and delusional ideation. Participants completed two versions of the beads task to evaluate their reasoning style. Results showed that people with delusional ideation reached a conclusion after less information, as expected. Interestingly, they also tended to change their conclusions more often than people without delusional ideation and did so with greater conviction. Depression and cognitive errors were strong predictors of delusional ideation but not of reasoning style. We conclude that delusional ideation in non-psychotic individuals is independently predicted by depressive symptoms and by a high conviction in new conclusions.

The backward masking red light effect and schizotypy: The influence of sex,"Previous research has shown a unique effect of red light on visual processing related to both schizophrenia and positive schizotypy. The current study examined whether this effect is influenced by sex in a more broadly-defined schizotypy sample. A location backward masking (BM) task with red, green, and gray backgrounds was administered to 34 undergraduate students (59% female) with a high score on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) and 38 students (50% female) with a low score. Results revealed that the group by color interaction was significant for the male participants, while it did not approach significance in the females. The male schizotypy participants showed a significant decrease in BM accuracy to the red (vs. green) background, while the male control participants showed a non-significant mean increase in accuracy. A decrease in accuracy to the red background in the male schizotypy participants was related to a higher score on the Social Anxiety subscale of the SPQ. Findings suggest that the previously reported schizophrenia red light effect is limited to males when examining a SPQ-defined sample, and appears to be primarily related to negative schizotypy symptoms. The red light effect continues to show promise as a new endophenotype for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.

Micronutrients reduce stress and anxiety in adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder following a 7.1 earthquake,"The role of good nutrition for resilience in the face of stress is a topic of interest, but difficult to study. A 7.1 earthquake took place in the midst of research on a micronutrient treatment for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), providing a unique opportunity to examine whether individuals with ADHD taking micronutrients demonstrated more emotional resilience post-earthquake than individuals with ADHD not taking micronutrients. Thirty-three adults with ADHD were assessed twice following the earthquake using a measure of depression, anxiety and stress also completed at some point pre-earthquake (baseline). Seventeen were not taking micronutrients at the time of the earthquake (control group), 16 were (micronutrient group). While there were no between-group differences one week post-quake (Time 1), at two weeks post-quake (Time 2), the micronutrient group reported significantly less anxiety and stress than the controls (effect size 0.69). These between group differences could not be explained by other variables, such as pre-earthquake measures of emotions, demographics, psychiatric status, and personal loss or damage following the earthquake. The results suggest that micronutrients may increase resilience to ongoing stress and anxiety associated with a highly stressful event in individuals with ADHD and are consistent with controlled studies showing benefit of micronutrients for mental health.

The validity of DSM-IV-TR criteria B and C of hair-pulling disorder (trichotillomania): Evidence from a clinical study,"In both DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10, hair-pulling disorder (trichotillomania, or TTM) is described as hair-pulling, with a rising urge or tension prior to pulling or when attempting to resist, and pleasure, relief or gratification during or after pulling. However, it has been questioned whether all patients with hair-pulling experience these other phenomena, and whether they occur with all pulling episodes. The objective of this study was to examine the DSM-IV-TR requirement of criteria B and C for a diagnosis of TTM in a sample of people with hair-pulling. A multi-site sample of adults with hair-pulling who met both DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria B and C (n =82, 89.13%) were compared to those who failed to satisfy both B and C (n =10, 10.87%) on a number of clinical variables. There were no differences in hair-pulling severity, levels of comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms, number of comorbid body-focused repetitive behaviors, or impairment between those patients who did and did not meet criteria B and C. Our study does not provide convincing support for the inclusion of the current diagnostic criteria B and C for TTM in DSM-5.

Personality characteristics and psychological distress associated with primary exercise dependence: An exploratory study,"The aim of this study was to assess personality characteristics and psychological distress associated with primary exercise dependence (ExeDepI) in a mixed gender sample. A cross-sectional study was carried out with adult habitual physical exercisers. A total of 79 participants voluntarily completed a package of self-report questionnaires including the Exercise Dependence Questionnaire (EDQ), the Eating Disorder Inventory II (EDI-2), the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), the Attitude Toward Self scale (ATS), and the Symptom Questionnaire (SQ). Significant differences were found on the EDQ exercise for weight control subscale with regard to gender, as well as on the EDI-2 total score and five of its subscales, with higher scores for females compared to males. Participants reporting primary exercise dependence (N =32) were more likely to present with disordered eating patterns than controls (N =47). They also showed higher levels of harm avoidance and persistence on the TCI, but lower self-directness and less mature character. Furthermore, ExeDepI group scored higher on the ATS dysmorphophobia subscale, as well as on the anxiety and hostility subscales of the SQ compared to the control group. These findings provide support to the idea that primary exercise dependence can be considered as a clinical syndrome associated with certain personality characteristics and psychological symptoms that might be accurately assessed in clinical settings.

Carbon dioxide induction of panic anxiety in schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations,"Panic is commonly co-morbid with schizophrenia. Panic may emerge prodromally, contribute to specific psychotic symptoms, and predictmedication response. Panic is often missed due to agitation, impaired cognition, psychotic symptom overlap and limited clinician awareness. Carbon dioxide exposure has been used reliably to induce panic in non-psychotic panic subjects, but has not been systematically studied in schizophrenia. Eight inpatients with schizophrenia, recent auditory hallucinations, none preselected for panic, all on antipsychotic medication, received a structured Panic and Schizophrenia Interview (PaSI), assessing DSM-IV panic symptoms concurrent with paroxysmal auditory hallucinations. On that interview, all eight subjects reported panic concurrent with auditory hallucinations. At one sitting, subjects were exposed, in random order, to 35% carbon dioxide and to placebo roomair, blinded to condition. All subjects experienced panic to carbon dioxide, one with limited symptoms. Only one subject panicked to placebo. One subject (one of only two without antipanic medication) had paroxysmal voices concurrent with induced panic. With added adjunctive clonazepam, that patient had marked clinical improvement and no response to carbon dioxide re-challenge. This first systematic examination offers preliminary evidence that carbon dioxide safely induces panic symptoms in schizophrenia. Panic may be prevalent and pathophysiologically significant in schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations.

Gender differences in 12-week antidepressant treatment outcomes for a naturalistic secondary care cohort: The CRESCEND study,"This study aimed to determine whether men and women with depression differ in socio-demographic, treatment-related characteristics, and in their responses to treatment with antidepressants, as well as to explore differences in treatment outcomes by menopausal status. From a nationwide sample of 18 hospitals in South Korea, 723 depressive patients were recruited. After baseline evaluation, they received naturalistic clinician-determined antidepressant interventions. Assessment scales for evaluating depression (HAMD), anxiety (HAMA), global severity (CGI-s), and functioning (SOFAS) were administered at baseline and reevaluated at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks later. At baseline, women were older, less educated, less likely to be employed, had lower income, were more likely to be married, and had longer illness duration than men. There were no gender differences in the treatment-regime received. After adjustment for baseline status, women were more likely to achieve HAMD remission (OR = 1.51), HAMD response (OR = 1.64), and HAMA response (OR = 1.61). Women also experienced shorter times to HAMD response, HAMA response, and CGI-s remission. Postmenopausal women showed higher HAMA response with newer dual action antidepressants than premenopausal women.

Suicidal ideation in Huntington disease: The role of comorbidity,"Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by cognitive impairments, motor abnormalities, and psychiatric disturbance. An increased risk for suicide has been documented. The majority of HD research has focused on cognitive and motor features of HD; the implications of psychiatric manifestations have received less consideration. Recent studies have sought to identify the stages of HD in which patients are at increased risk to experience suicidal ideation, though no study has examined possible risk factors for suicidality. The current study examines the presence of psychiatric comorbidity and its involvement in suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation was examined in 1941 HD patients enrolled in the Huntington Study Group. Of those, 19% (N = 369) endorsed current suicidal ideation. Logistic regression analyses indicated that depression/anxiety and aggression/irritability are significant predictors of suicidal ideation. In a subsample with the greatest suicidal ideation, alcohol and drug abuse were also predictive. It is recommended that all individuals with HD (specifically those with features of depression, aggression, substance abuse) have routine suicide assessment; further research is needed to understand the high rate of suicide in HD.

Comorbid anxiety disorders and baseline medication regimens predict clinical outcomes in individuals with co-occurring bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence: Results of a randomized controlled trial,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 295[112904] of Psychiatry Research (see record 2021-01047-001). The authors regret that although the text (i.e., Section 3.2, “Associations between co-occurring diagnoses and outcomes”) correctly noted that antisocial personality disorder (aspd) was not uniquely significantly associated with any outcomes, Table 3 (“Results from path models with co-occurring diagnoses predicting outcomes”) incorrectly displays stars (**) below “OCDS” and “MADRS,” indicating statistically significant associations between aspd and these outcomes. Please note that the betas listed in the table are all correct, it is simply the stars for the associations of aspd with “OCDS” and “MADRS” that are misplaced. The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.] Despite the high prevalence and detrimental impact of alcoholism on bipolar patients, the diagnostic and treatment factors associated with better or worse clinical outcomes in alcohol-dependent patients with bipolar disorder are not well understood. The present study investigated the prospective impact of baseline psychiatric comorbidities and treatment regimens on clinical outcomes in bipolar alcoholics. Data were drawn from an 8-week randomized controlled clinical trial of acamprosate for individuals (n =30) with co-occurring bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence. Depressive and manic symptoms, and alcohol craving and consumption were monitored longitudinally using standardized instruments. Path analysis was used to estimate the prospective associations between patient characteristics and outcomes. More than 50% of patients were diagnosed with at least one anxiety (76.7%) or drug dependence disorder (60.0%). Comorbid anxiety disorders were prospectively associated with increased depressive symptoms and alcohol use. Participants were prescribed an average of 2.6 psychotropic medications at baseline. Antipsychotics and anticonvulsants were prospectively associated with increased alcohol use; anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines were associated with increased alcohol craving. Antidepressants were associated with increased depressive symptoms. Conversely, lithium was associated with decreased alcohol craving and depressive symptoms. The findings from the present study suggest areas for future research in this population.

GAD is good? Generalized anxiety disorder predicts a superior five-year outcome following an acute coronary syndrome,"While differing anxiety disorders have been reported to have quite variable impact on outcome following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a recent study quantified generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as having a distinctly negative impact. We examined anxiety disorder status at baseline for any differential five-year impact on cardiac outcome following initial hospitalization for an ACS in 489 subjects. Of those initially assessed, 89% were examined at a five-year review. There were non-significant trends for all non-GAD anxiety disorders to be associated with a worse cardiac outcome. Meeting GAD criteria (both at baseline assessment and over the subjects' lifetime) was associated with a superior five-year cardiac outcome, particularly in the sub-set of those experiencing GAD as their only anxiety disorder, and after controlling for depression and medical comorbidities. As our results are at distinct variance with two previous studies specifically examining the impact of GAD on outcome in cardiac patients, we consider methodological and other explanations. We conclude that, if our findings are valid, then they may more reflect GAD patients having a ‘constructive worrying’ capacity and therefore being more likely to seek help in response to less severe somatic symptoms and to also be more adherent with cardiac rehabilitation programs.

Distinctiveness and overlap of depersonalization with anxiety and depression in a community sample: Results from the gutenberg heart study,"Depersonalization disorder is considered to be a common clinical phenomenon and disorder with an enormous gap between prevalence and detection partly due to the common interpretation of depersonalization (DP) being a negligible variant of anxiety and depression. Therefore, we sought to analyze (1) the prevalence rate of DP in a large community sample ( n = 5000) according to a recently developed ultra brief two-item depersonalization screener; (2) the associations with depression, anxiety, physical and mental health status; and 93) whether DP contributes independently to the health status beyond anxiety and depression. The prevalence of clinically significant DP was 0.8% ( n = 41), and 8.5% ( n = 427) endorsed at least one symptom of DP. DP was independently associated with impairment of mental and physical health status as well as with a medical history of any depressive or anxiety disorder. Despite the consistent association of DP with anxiety and depression, the shared variances were small, and DP was clearly separated from symptoms of anxiety and depression in the principal component analysis. Therefore, we conclude that the implementation of depersonalization screening might be recommended.

"Associations among perceptual anomalies, social anxiety, and paranoia in a college student sample","Recent evidence suggests that normal-range paranoid ideation may be particularly likely to develop in individuals disposed to both social anxiety and perceptual anomalies. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that among college students in an unselected sample, social anxiety and experience of perceptual anomalies would not only each independently predict the experience of self-reported paranoid ideation, but would also interact to predict paranoid patterns of thought. A diverse sample of 644 students completed a large battery of self-report measures, as well as the five-factor Paranoia/Suspiciousness Questionnaire (PSQ). We conducted hierarchical multiple regression analyses predicting scores on each PSQ factor from responses on measures of social anxiety, perceptual aberration, and the interaction between the two constructs. Current general negative affect was covaried in all analyses. We found that both social anxiety and perceptual aberrations, along with negative affect, predicted multiple dimensions of paranoia as measured by the PSQ; the two constructs did not, however, interact significantly to predict any dimensions. Our findings suggest that perceptual aberration and anxiety may contribute to normal-range paranoid ideation in an additive rather than an interactive manner.

Reduced capacity in automatic processing of facial expression in restrictive anorexia nervosa and obesity,"There is growing evidence that disordered eating is associated with facial expression recognition and emotion processing problems. In this study, we investigated the question of whether anorexia and obesity occur on a continuum of attention bias towards negative facial expressions in comparison with healthy individuals of normal weight. Thirty-three patients with restrictive anorexia nervosa (AN-R), 30 patients with obesity (OB) and 63 healthy age and social–economic status matched controls were recruited. Our results indicated that AN-R patients were more attentive to angry faces and had difficulties in being attentive to positive expressions, whilst OB patients had problems in looking for or being attentive to negative expressions independently of self-reported depression and anxiety. Our findings did not support the idea that AN-R and OB occur on a continuum.We found that AN-R was associated with a reduced capacity in positive facial expression processing, whereas OB was associated with a reduced capacity in negative facial expressions processing. The social relevance of our findings and a possible explanation based upon neuroscience are discussed.

N4 component responses to pre-pulse startle stimuli in young adults: Relationship to alcohol dependence,"Both physiological and behavioral studies provide evidence to suggest that deficits in frontal cortical control circuits may contribute to the risk for developing alcohol dependence. Event-related potential (ERP) and eye blink responses to startle and short delay prepulse-plus-startle stimuli, and psychiatric diagnoses were investigated in young adult (age 18–30 years) men ( n = 135) and women ( n = 205) Mexican Americans. Women displayed a significant increase in the amplitude of the eye blink response to both the startle and prepulse- plus-startle stimuli. None of the psychiatric diagnoses were associated with differences in eye blink responses. ERP responses to the startle and prepulse-plus startle stimuli included a negative polarity wave at approximately 400 ms that was of the highest amplitude in the frontal leads (N4S). Women were found to have significantly higher amplitude N4S responses than men. Participants with alcohol dependence demonstrated significantly less inhibition and more facilitation of the N4S component by the pre-pulse stimuli. This finding was not associated with a diagnosis of: any other drug dependence disorder (including nicotine), anxiety or affective disorder, or conduct/antisocial personality disorder. The present study suggests that gender and a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol dependence may selectively contribute to this frontal late wave electrophysiological response to prepulse-plus-startle stimuli.

Low cholesterol is a risk factor for attentional impulsivity in patients with mood symptoms,"This study examined the relationship between cholesterol levels and impulsivity in a large sample of patients with mood symptoms. Three hundred and one patients with mood, anxiety, and personality disorders completed a battery of psychometric scales including the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Version 11 (BIS-11) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). On the same day of psychometric assessment, blood samples were analyzed for total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Statistical analysis controlling for the confounding effects of age, gender, diagnosis, and current mood symptoms showed that lower TC levels were associated with increased attentional impulsivity. There was a weak linear correlation between TC and attentional impulsivity across the entire range of TC levels (110–295 mg/dL) but a highly significant difference between participants with TC levels lower than 165 mg/dL and the rest of the sample. The current study adds to the growing body of evidence pointing to the association between serum cholesterol and mental health. Considering that attentional impulsivity is a demonstrated risk factor for suicide, patients presenting with low cholesterol and mood symptoms may warrant increased clinical attention and surveillance.

Clarification of the factor structure of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire among Japanese adolescents and associated sleep status,"If the factors affecting the mental health status of adolescents and their association with sleep status could be clarified, this information would be helpful for formulating lifestyle and healthcare guidance for the promotion of healthy growth and the prevention of mental problems in these individuals. The purpose of this study was to clarify (1) the factor structure of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and (2) the associations between the factors extracted from this questionnaire and lifestyle, in particular sleep status, by using a representative sample population of Japanese adolescents. One hundred three thousand sixty hundred fifty self-administered questionnaires were collected from students enrolled in junior high and high schools in Japan. Of these questionnaires, 99,668 were analyzed. Sleep duration, subjective sleep assessment, bedtime, and insomnia symptoms of these students over the past month were studied to investigate sleep status. The factor analyses yielded two factors: depression/anxiety and loss of positive emotion. Sleep duration of less than 7 h was found to be associated with both depression/anxiety and loss of positive emotion, whereas sleep duration of 8 h or more was associated only with loss of positive emotion. Subjective sleep assessment and insomnia symptoms were associated with both depression/anxiety and loss of positive emotion. It was demonstrated that two underlying factors of mental health status were associated with differences in sleep status. In order to improve the mental health status of adolescents, it is important to provide guidance about sleep and lifestyle habits according to the mental health status of the individual.

Validation of a classification system of obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorder symptoms in a non-clinical sample,"Controversy surrounds the classification of obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorder (OCSD) symptoms. In this study, we tested whether a broad OCSD symptoms model consisting of obsessive–compulsive, body dysmorphic, health anxiety, trichotillomania, pathological skin picking, impulsivity, and anxiety symptoms displayed sufficient data fit. Alternatively, we tested whether a reduced OCSD symptoms model consisting of obsessive–compulsive, body dysmorphic, health anxiety, trichotillomania, and pathological skin picking symptoms demonstrated superior fit. The reduced OCSD symptoms model demonstrated good data fit. However, the broader OCSD symptoms model only displayed marginal data fit. In context with other findings, results of this study support an OCSD symptoms dimension that includes obsessive–compulsive, body dysmorphic, health anxiety, trichotillomania, and pathological skin picking symptoms. Implications of these findings are discussed as they relate to proposed changes in the forthcoming edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.

"Quick and easy self-rating of Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Validity of the Dutch web-based GAD-7, GAD-2 and GAD-SI","Screening of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), which is often undetected and untreated, could be improved by quick and easy web-based data collection. This paper aims to validate the web-based self-rated 7-item GAD-7, its shortened 2-item GAD-2 and a single item from the GAD-7 scale (GAD-SI) to screen for GAD. Of a total of 502 subjects aged 18–80 who rated the web-based GAD-7, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CESD) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 157 (31%) subjects had a WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV-disorders by telephone. The GAD-7 had good reliability. Subjects with a GAD-diagnosis had significantly higher means on GAD-2, GAD-SI and GAD-7 than subjects without a GAD-diagnosis. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) of the GAD-SI and GAD-2was accurate and not significantly different to the GAD-7 AUC. The web-based GAD-SI, GAD-2 and GAD-7 are reliable, valid tools to quickly screen for GAD in busy mental health settings and clinical research. More research is needed to validate the GAD-SI ‘Do you have trouble relaxing’ to see if its screening properties approach those of the GAD-7.

An admixture analysis of the age at index episodes in bipolar disorder,"The interaction between polarity at onset (PAO) and age at onset (AAO) appears to be important for interpreting results of previous analyses of AAO in bipolar disorder (BD). Using an admixture analysis, we examined independently the distributions of age at first depressive and hypomanic/manic episodes in 379 BD I and II patients. Subsequently, we examined the association of PAO and AAO with specific clinical variables, using parametric and nonparametric analyses. Both depressive and manic onsets showed bimodal distributions. For depressive episodes, the means were: 18.5±4.1 (early onset) and 33.6±10.4 (late onset) years; and for manic episodes 18.9±3.3 (early onset) and 34.8±10.9 (late onset) years. For the overall AAO the best fit was for a mixture of three lognormal distributions (mean±S.D.): 15.5±2.0, 22.8±4.6, and 36.1±10.1 years. Overall, an early onset was significantly associated with a chronic course of the disorder, a stronger family history of affective disorder, higher rates of rapid cycling, suicidal behavior, psychotic symptoms, and co-morbid anxiety disorders. Early onset depressive episodes were associated with higher rates of suicidal behavior and anxiety disorders, whereas early onset manic episodes were associated with psychotic symptoms and rapid cycling. Our results suggest the presence of a bimodal distribution of age at onset in BD according to the polarity of the index episode, and denote that an early onset BD, irrespective of polarity, may be a more serious subtype of the disorder.

Mindfulness based cognitive therapy for psychiatric disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Mindfulness- based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a meditation program based on an integration of Cognitive behavioural therapy and Mindfulness-based stress reduction. The aim of the present work is to review and conduct a meta-analysis of the current findings about the efficacy of MBCT for psychiatric patients. A literature search was undertaken using five electronic databases and references of retrieved articles. Main findings included the following: 1) MBCT in adjunct to usual care was significantly better than usual care alone for reducing major depression (MD) relapses in patients with three or more prior depressive episodes (4 studies), 2) MBCT plus gradual discontinuation of maintenance ADs was associated to similar relapse rates at 1 year as compared with continuation of maintenance antidepressants (1 study), 3) the augmentation of MBCT could be useful for reducing residual depressive symptoms in patients with MD (2 studies) and for reducing anxiety symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder in remission (1 study) and in patients with some anxiety disorders (2 studies). However, several methodological shortcomings including small sample sizes, non-randomized design of some studies and the absence of studies comparing MBCT to control groups designed to distinguish specific from non-specific effects of such practice underscore the necessity for further research.

Is there a hypersensitive visual alarm system in panic disorder?,"Agoraphobia in panic disorder (PD) has been related to abnormal balance system function. Vision influences balance and behavioural adaptations; peripheral vision influences orienting and fast defensive reactions whereas central vision analyzes details of objects. We have hypothesized that the abnormal balance function in PD could be mainly related to peripheral vision as part of a defensive alarm system in the brain. In 25 patients with PD and agoraphobia and 31 healthy controls we assessed, by posturography, balance system reactivity to video-films projected in peripheral and central visual fields (randomized sequence). Length, velocity and surface of body sway were calculated. Patients increased their body sway during peripheral stimulation, whereas controls did not; the two groups showed a similar increase of body sway during central stimulation. Anxiety levels during peripheral stimulation significantly influenced the postural response in the group of patients. These preliminary results suggest that the higher visual sensitivity to peripheral stimulation in patients with PD and agoraphobia may be linked to a more active ""visual alarm system"" involving visual, vestibular and limbic areas that might influence the development of agoraphobia in situations where environmental stimuli are uncertain.

Defense style in panic disorder before and after pharmacological treatment,"Whether or not the use of maladaptive defense style is a trait, as opposed to a state dependent phenomenon, in panic disorder (PD) is a topic still very much up for debate. The aim of the study was to verify whether PD patients, both before and after treatment, used different defense style than the control group. Sixty-one PD patients (recruited from an original sample of 90 patients) and 64 healthy controls were evaluated against the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV disorders, the Symptoms Check List-90, the Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety and for Depression and finally the Defense Style Questionnaire-40 (DSQ). The patients were treated with paroxetine or citalopram and were evaluated monthly for one year to assess the remission. The DSQ was re-administered to the patients at the end of the study. Before treatment, PD patients used more neurotic and immature forms of defense than controls. After treatment, those in remission used the same defense styles as the control group, whereas non-remitters still used more immature defenses. However, all the aforementioned difference disappeared, after excluding the effect of symptom severity. Our data supports the hypothesis that the use of maladaptive defenses might be the consequence of PD: when subjects fall ill, their capacity to use mature adaptive defenses may diminish, but when they recover their defensive style returns to a greater maturity. The present results are however limited by the dropout rate (one third of patients did not complete the study) and the use of just one questionnaire to evaluate the complexity of defense styles.

Treatment-seeking for social anxiety disorder in a general outpatient psychiatry setting,"Many individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) seek treatment principally for another psychiatric disorder, but when directly asked, a majority of these individuals also desire treatment for SAD. Several reasons may exist for why individuals with SAD do not seek treatment for it, such as the severity or functional impairment related to SAD. The aim of the current study was to examine factors related to SAD severity, impairment, and comorbidity, to gain a better understanding of what factors may be related to treatment-seeking for SAD. In 819 psychiatric outpatients with SAD, initial results showed that age, duration of SAD illness, number of social fears endorsed, Clinical Global Impression score, Sheehan Disability Scale ratings for social life and distress, presence of major depressive disorder, and presence of depressive disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS) were associated with treatment-seeking for SAD status. However, a regression analysis found that DDNOS was the most robust predictor of treatment-seeking for SAD status, followed by the number of feared social situations. Other factors should be examined in the future, such as knowledge of SAD and available treatment options.

Obsessive beliefs and neurocognitive flexibility in obsessive–compulsive disorder,"A substantial proportion of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) do not endorse the dysfunctional beliefs proposed by cognitive models of OCD to be important in the onset and maintenance of symptoms. Previous research has attempted to characterize Low and High obsessive beliefs groups in terms of cognitive and symptom correlates to distil potential etiological differences in these subgroups of OCD patients. The current study sought to further examine potential neurocognitive differences between obsessive beliefs subgroups. Performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) was compared between a Low Beliefs OCD subgroup, a High Beliefs OCD subgroup, and two anxious control groups: Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia (PDA) and Social Phobia (SP). The High Beliefs OCD subgroup performed significantly poorer on WCST subscales compared to the other diagnostic groups. These findings were not accounted for by severity of OCD or depressive symptoms. The Low Beliefs OCD subgroup performed similar to the anxiety disorder control groups. The results suggest a potential interplay between heightened obsessive beliefs and neurocognitive inflexibility.

Suicidal ideation among individuals whose parents have divorced: Findings from a representative Canadian community survey,"This study used a large, nationally representative sample to examine the gender-specific association between parental divorce and the cumulative lifetime incidence of suicidal ideation. Known risk factors for suicidal ideation, such as childhood stressors, socioeconomic factors, adult health behaviors and stressors, marital status, and any history of mood and/or anxiety disorders were controlled. Gender-specific analyses revealed that for men, the parental divorce–suicidal ideation relationship remained statistically significant even when the above-listed cluster of risk factors were included in the analyses (odds ratio (OR) = 2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.56, 3.58). For women, the association between parental divorce and suicidal ideation was reduced to non-significance when other adverse childhood experiences were included in the analyses (full adjustment OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.72, 1.50). These findings indicate a need for screening of suicidal ideation among individuals, particularly men and those with mood and/or anxiety disorders, who have experienced parental divorce. Future research should focus on the mechanisms linking parental divorce and suicidal ideation.

Decreased aldosterone in the plasma of suicide attempters with major depressive disorder,"Hormones and neurobiological factors may be regulated differently in suicidal versus non-suicidal depressive patients. There is currently limited knowledge about the relation of substances in the Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone system to depression and suicidality. We therefore investigated whether plasma levels of renin and aldosterone differ between suicide attempters, non-suicidal depressive patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, we analyzed the relation of renin and aldosterone to psychiatric symptoms in the patients. Suicidal patients with MDD, adjustment disorder and dysthymia, as well as two control groups consisting of non-suicidal MDD patients and healthy subjects, were rated using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS), including the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Brief Scale for Anxiety (BSA). Plasma samples were frozen immediately after collection and stored at −80°C for 5–18 years. Aldosterone and renin levels were analyzed using radioactive- and chemiluminescent immunoassays. We found that suicide attempters with MDD had significantly lower plasma levels of aldosterone than the other patient groups, as well as than the healthy controls. Moreover, increasing severity of psychiatric symptoms was associated with lower aldosterone levels in the suicide attempters with MDD. Non-suicidal patients with MDD did not differ significantly compared to healthy controls with respect to aldosterone and renin levels. These findings may indicate that low aldosterone levels could be a marker of suicidality in patients with MDD.

Lack of association between SNPs in the NEUROD2 gene and alcohol dependence in a German patient sample,"Results of a human post mortem study performed by our own group have suggested that the transcription factor NEUROD2, which plays a role in neuronal development, as well as in the development of anxiety and risk behavior in mice, might be a susceptibility factor for addictive disorders. Therefore the aim of the present study was to analyze a possible relation between genetic variants in the NEUROD2 gene and alcohol dependence in a sample of the Munich Gene Bank of Alcoholism (MGBA). We performed single SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) and haplotype studies in 430 alcohol-dependent patients and 365 healthy controls with four SNPs covering the gene region of NEUROD2. Neither single SNP nor haplotype analysis could detect significant associations with alcohol dependence. Additionally we could not detect any relation of the analyzed genetic variants to Cloninger's Type 1/2 or Babor's Type A/B classification, to the age of onset or to the amount of alcohol intake. Our results do not provide evidence for an involvement of NEUROD2 polymorphisms in the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence. Further association studies are needed to confirm our findings.

Alcohol consumption and later risk of hospitalization with psychiatric disorders: Prospective cohort study,"The potential effects of alcohol intake upon the risk of psychiatric disorders have not often been investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate, in a population sample, the association between self-reported amount of alcohol intake and the later risk of being registered in a Danish hospital with a psychiatric disorder. The prospective cohort study, the Copenhagen City Heart Study ( n = 18,146), was used, containing three updated sets of alcohol intake and lifestyle covariates and up to 26 years follow-up. Alcohol intake was measured by self-report while psychiatric disorders were measured through registers. For women, the overall pattern showed that drinking above the sensible limits increased the risk of psychiatric disorders in general, especially for anxiety disorders where women drinking above the sensible drinking limits had a risk of 2.00 (confidence interval: 1.31–3.04) compared to women drinking below the sensible drinking limits. For men, the risk functions were slightly U-shaped; thus, a weekly low or moderate alcohol intake seemed to have a protective effect towards developing psychiatric disorders. The findings suggest sex differences in the association between alcohol consumption and risk of psychiatric disorders.

Feedback and reward processing in high-functioning autism,"Individuals with high-functioning autism often display deficits in social interactions and high-level cognitive functions. Such deficits may be influenced by poor ability to process feedback and rewards. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) is an event-related potential (ERP) that is more negative following losses than gains. We examined FRN amplitude in 25 individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 25 age- and IQ-matched typically developing control participants who completed a guessing task with monetary loss/gain feedback. Both groups demonstrated a robust FRN that was more negative to loss trials than gain trials; however, groups did not differ in FRN amplitude as a function of gain or loss trials. N1 and P300 amplitudes did not differentiate groups. FRN amplitude was positively correlated with age in individuals with ASD, but not measures of intelligence, anxiety, behavioral inhibition, or autism severity. Given previous findings of reduced-amplitude error-related negativity (ERN) in ASD, we propose that individuals with ASD may process external, concrete, feedback similar to typically developing individuals, but have difficulty with internal, more abstract, regulation of performance.

Poor response to antidepressant medication of patients with depression accompanied by somatic symptomatology in the STAR*D study,"Studies suggest that the gender difference in the prevalence of depression results because women exhibit higher prevalence than men of a depressive phenotype associated with somatic symptoms. Because this phenotype has been found to be based in psychosocial forces, it may not respond well to antidepressant medication. In this study, data from the STAR*D Study were analyzed to compare remission rates in response to an SSRI and to several other antidepressants of patients exhibiting depression accompanied by somatic symptomatology versus other patients. Scores on the Clinician Rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology were used to measure clinical remission in response to medication. Patients exhibiting depression accompanied by somatic symptomatology exhibited less remission to the SSRI Citalopram (31% versus 43%) and to the various medications administered in level 3 (14% versus 25%) than did other patients in STAR*D. The low rates of remission in response to medication of patients exhibiting somatic symptomatology were not due to the greater proportion of women, nor to the greater proportion of patients exhibiting anxiety disorders, among patients exhibiting somatic symptomatology. Remission rates were found to be related to exhibiting somatic symptomatology not to exhibiting nonsomatic symptoms.

Group versus individual cognitive treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Changes in non-OCD symptoms and cognitions at post-treatment and one-year follow-up,"Current cognitive approaches postulate that obsessions and compulsions are caused and/or maintained by misinterpretations about their meaning. This assumption has led to the development of cognitive therapeutic (CT) procedures designed to challenge the dysfunctional appraisals and beliefs patients have about their obsessions. Nonetheless, few studies have compared the efficacy of individual and group CT in changing the dysfunctional cognitions that hypothetically underlie Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). In this study, 44 OCD patients were assigned to individual ( n = 18) or group ( n = 24) CT. Sixteen completed the individual CT, and 22 completed the group CT. The effects of the two CT conditions on depression and worry tendencies were comparable. Individual treatment was more effective than group treatment in decreasing scores on dysfunctional beliefs (responsibility, overestimation of threat, and intolerance to uncertainty) and the use of suppression as a thought control strategy. The post-treatment changes were maintained one year later. The correlations between symptom improvement (OCD severity change) and belief changes were moderate: in the individual treatment the greatest associations were with beliefs about thoughts (importance and control), whereas in the group treatment the greatest associations were with beliefs related to anxiety in general (threat overestimation and intolerance to uncertainty).

Validity of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) in detecting depressive and anxiety disorders among high school students,"Despite the common use of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) with adolescents, there is limited data supporting its validity with this population. The aims of the study were to investigate the psychometric properties of the GHQ-12 among high school students, to validate the GHQ-12 against the gold standard of a diagnostic interview, and to suggest a threshold score for detecting depressive and anxiety disorders. Six hundred and fifty-four high school students from years 10 to 12 (ages 15–18) completed the GHQ-12 (Likert scored) and the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-Test Revision (DSM-IV-TR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted. The mean GHQ-12 score for the total sample was 9.9 (S.D. = 5.4). Results from the ROC curve indicated that the GHQ-12 performed better than chance at identifying depressive and anxiety disorders (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.781). A GHQ-12 threshold score of 9/10 for males and 10/11 for females was found to be optimal. Given the significant proportion of mental illness among high school students, there may be a need to introduce screening for mental illnesses as part of the school curriculum. This can assist with the early identification and enable low stigma preventive intervention within the school environment.

Effectiveness of guided self-help for depression and anxiety disorders in primary care: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of (guided) self-help in primary care for patients diagnosed with a minor or major mood and/or anxiety disorder. The study population consists of 120 (screened) primary care patients aged 18–65 years with at least one mood and/or anxiety disorder. The primary focus is the reduction of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The self-help courses (Problem Solving Treatment and exposure) took 6 weeks to complete. The self-help group reported slightly better outcomes than the care-as-usual group but these results were not significant: d =−0.18 (95% CI = −2.29 to 7.31) for symptoms of depression and d =−0.20 (95% CI=−0.74 to 2.29) for symptoms of anxiety. For patients with an anxiety disorder only, the anxiety symptoms decreased significantly compared to the care-as-usual group ( d =−0.68; 95% CI = 0.25 to 4.77). Self-help seems only slightly superior to care-as-usual and therefore might not be an effective tool in general practice. But the lack of results could also be due to our selection of patients or to our selection of GPs (with interest in psychiatric disorders). Nonetheless the promising signals with respect to anxiety disorders warrant further research.

Therapeutic relationships in vocational rehabilitation: Predicting good relationships for people with psychosis,"Therapeutic relationships between clients and vocational rehabilitation workers have been shown to predict entering competitive employment. We aimed to determine predictors of good relationships, using data from an international randomized controlled trial of supported employment ( n = 312). Baseline predictors of early therapeutic relationships with vocational workers were assessed, along with the impact of vocational status and changing clinical and social functioning variables on relationship ratings over time. Associations between client and professional relationship ratings were also explored. Better early client-rated therapeutic relationship was predicted by better baseline relationship with the clinical keyworker, being in the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) service, the absence of work history and a greater proportion of care needs being met, whereas over time it was predicted by being in the IPS service. Professional-rated early relationship was predicted by social disability and remission, while over time it was predicted by being the same sex as the client, duration of the relationship and the client's increasing anxiety. Client and professional ratings were positively associated but clients' ratings were higher than professionals', particularly in the IPS service. Relationships were better where clients may have been more motivated to engage, including by their prior experience of a good therapeutic relationship with the clinical keyworker.

An empirical investigation of the structure of anxiety and depressive symptoms in late adolescence: Cross-sectional study using the Greek version of the revised Clinical Interview Schedule,"Several studies in the past have examined whether the hierarchical structure of anxiety and depressive symptoms can explain the high comorbidity between them but more studies are needed from other settings and with different methods. The present study aimed to examine the structure of common anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents 16–18 years old attending secondary schools using the Greek version of the revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R), a fully structured psychiatric interview. A total of 2431 adolescents were interviewed with the computerized version of the CIS-R. The hierarchical structure of 12 depressive and anxiety symptoms was examined with confirmatory factor analytical methods. Four alternative models of increasing complexity were tested. The best-fitting model included three first-order factors, representing the dimensions of anxiety, depression and non-specific distress respectively. A model with a higher-order factor representing the broader internalizing dimension was less supported by the data. The findings of this and other studies should be taken into account in future classifications of psychiatric disorders and may have clinical practical implications.

"Prevalence, correlates, and comorbidities of adult ADHD symptoms in Korea: Results of the Korean epidemiologic catchment area study","We examined the prevalence, correlates, and comorbidities of adult attention-deficit hypersensitivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in a Korean community using data from the National Epidemiological Survey of Psychiatric Disorders in Korea conducted in 2006. A total of 6081 subjects aged 18 to 59 years participated in this study. Diagnostic assessments were based on the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale Screener and Composite International Diagnostic Interview administered by lay interviewers. The frequencies of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) disorders, sleep disturbances, and suicidal tendency were compared in the ADHD and non-ADHD groups. Odds ratios and significance levels were calculated. The 6 month prevalence of adult ADHD symptoms was 1.1%. Associations between ADHD symptoms and alcohol abuse/dependence, nicotine dependence, mood disorders, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, somatoform disorder, sleep disturbances, and suicidality were overwhelmingly positive and significant ( P &lt; 0.05), after controlling for gender and age. Adult ADHD symptoms are highly associated with substance abuse, mood and anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, sleep disturbances and suicidality, suggesting that clinicians should carefully evaluate and treat such psychiatric disorders in adults with ADHD symptoms.

Psychiatric comorbidity in methamphetamine dependence,"The primary aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in a large sample of methamphetamine (MA)-dependent subjects using a validated structured clinical interview, without limitation to sexual orientation or participation in a treatment program. The secondary aim was to assess whether the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities varied by gender. Structured clinical interviews (SCIDs) were administered to 189 MA-dependent subjects and lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV diagnoses was assessed. Across the sample, 28.6% had primary psychotic disorders, 23.8% of which were substance-induced; 13.2% had MA-induced delusional disorders and 11.1% had MA-induced hallucinations. A substantial number of lifetime mood disorders were identified that were not substance-induced (32.3%), whereas 14.8% had mood disorders induced by substances, and 10.6% had mood disorders induced by amphetamines. Of all participants, 26.5% had anxiety disorders and 3.7% had a substance-induced anxiety disorder, all of which were induced by MA. Male subjects reported a higher percentage of MA-induced delusions compared to female abusers. Given the impact of MA psychosis and other drug-induced symptoms on hospitals and mental health services, the description and characterization of comorbid psychiatric symptoms associated with MA use is of paramount importance.

"Relationships between stress, social adaptation, personality traits, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol plasma concentrations in employees at a publishing company in Japan","There is growing evidence that blood levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), a major metabolite of noradrenaline, are related to depression-associated personality traits as well as to depressive, suicidal and anxious states. Psychological job stress is well known to lead to symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicide. We have recently reported that psychological job stress among hospital employees altered blood levels of BDNF and MHPG (Mitoma et al., 2008). In the present study, we re-examined the effects of social adaptation and personality traits, as well as those of psychological job stress, on plasma levels of BDNF and MHPG in healthy employees ( n = 269, male/female = 210/59, age = 49 ± 10 years) working in a publishing company in Japan. The values (mean ± SD) of scores on the Stress and Arousal Check Lists (s-SACL and a-SACL), Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale (SASS), plasma MHPG levels and plasma BDNF levels were 6.0 ± 3.4, 5.7 ± 2.3, 33.7 ± 6.8, 5.8 ± 4.3 and 4.6 ± 3.1 ng ml –1 , respectively. A positive correlation was found between plasma MHPG levels and scores on the s-SACL, but not the a-SACL. A positive correlation was also found between SASS scores and plasma MHPG levels and between SASS scores and plasma BDNF levels. A negative correlation was found between plasma BDNF levels and s-SACL scores. Furthermore, a positive correlation between NEO-Five factor Inventory (Openness) scores and plasma MHPG levels was observed, as well as between NEO-Five factor Inventory (Extroversion) scores and plasma BDNF levels. These results suggest that levels of plasma BDNF and plasma MHPG might be associated with psychological job stress and certain personality traits among employees in the publishing industry in Japan.

The Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire predicts functioning styles of personality disorder: A trial in healthy subjects and personality-disorder patients,"Normal personality traits, as measured by the Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ), predicted some personality disorders in a sample of healthy volunteers. Whether these predictions could be more pronounced in patients with personality disorders remains unknown. We administered the ZKPQ and the Parker Personality Measure (PERM), which describes the functioning styles of personality disorder, in 134 patients with a range of personality disorders and in 268 age-, gender- and education level-matched healthy volunteers. Cluster A patients scored lowest on Sociability, cluster B highest on Impulsive Sensation Seeking and Aggression–Hostility, cluster C1 (Avoidant and Dependent types) highest on Neuroticism–Anxiety, and cluster C2 (Obsessive-Compulsive type) highest on Activity. Most of the predictors were consistent across both the healthy and patient groups. The variances that accounted for predicting most PERM styles by the ZKPQ traits in the patient group were higher than those in the healthy group. Our results showed that the ZKPQ traits could specifically predict the PERM styles in both healthy subjects and personality-disorder patients. This result was more pronounced in the latter group. The most powerful predictions were obtained for Antisocial, Dependent, Borderline and Avoidant styles, and the weakest for the Schizotypal and Schizoid styles in the patient group.

Are sedentary television watching and computer use behaviors associated with anxiety and depressive disorders?,"Sedentary behaviors may be more common among persons with mental disorders and thereby result in poorer health outcomes. This study examined whether independently of general physical activity level, mental disorders are linked to two important examples of sedentary behavior: computer use and watching television. We used cross-sectional data from The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Our study sample consisted of 2353 participants (age 18–65) of whom 1701 had a current anxiety and/or depressive diagnosis and 652 were healthy controls. Anxiety and depression diagnoses were conducted using the DSM-IV based Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Controlling for sociodemographics and physical activity level we found that persons with a major depressive disorder (MDD) spend significantly more leisure time using the computer. We found that persons with dysthymia, panic disorder and agoraphobia spend significantly more daily hours watching television compared to controls. This study illustrates that sedentary behaviors occur more frequently among persons with a mental disorder, independent of general physical activity level.

The evaluation of emotional facial expressions in early postpartum depression mood: A difference between adult and baby faces?,"Research suggests that depressive individuals exhibit disturbances in the evaluation of emotional facial expressions. Owing to the specific character of postnatal depressive mood, the purpose of the present study was to examine whether postpartum depressive mood intensity in the mothers would involve the same disturbances as depression or a specific distortion in the emotional evaluation of baby faces as compared to adult faces. Three days after birth, the participants ( N = 79) completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. They also evaluated the facial expressions of adults and babies displaying anger, happiness, sadness and neutrality in terms of the intensity of five emotions: Anger, disgust, sadness, happiness and neutrality. Our findings suggest that judgements of emotional facial expressions depend to a great extent on anxiety, which specifically increased negative perception of babies' emotions. Moreover, the only difference between mothers with and without postpartum depressive mood lays in their assessment of the babies' faces, neutral baby faces being judged to be less neutral, thus demonstrating the specificity of postpartum affective disorders.

Decreased hair cortisol concentrations in generalised anxiety disorder,"Previous research examining hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activity in generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) has suggested a general hypercortisolism. These studies have mostly relied on salivary, plasma or urinary assessments, reflecting cortisol secretion over short time periods. The current study utilised the novel method of cortisol assessment in hair to obtain a retrospective index of cortisol secretion over a prolonged period of time. Hair cortisol levels were determined in 15 GAD patients and in 15 age- and gender-matched controls. In addition, participants collected six saliva samples (on awakening, + 30 min, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 h and at bedtime) on two consecutive weekdays for the assessment of the diurnal cortisol profile. Results revealed significantly lower (50–60%) cortisol levels in the first and second 3-cm hair segments of GAD patients compared to those of controls. No significant between-group differences were seen in diurnal cortisol profiles. The hair cortisol findings tentatively suggest that under naturalistic conditions GAD is associated with hypocortisolism. If corroborated by future research, this demonstrates the important qualities of cortisol measurement in hair as an ecologically valid, retrospective index of long-term cortisol secretion and as a marker for psychiatric disorders associated with hypo- or hypercortisolism.

Epidemiological aspects of intermittent explosive disorder in Japan; Prevalence and psychosocial comorbidity: Findings from the World Mental Health Japan Survey 2002-2006,"The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder (IED) as well as its comorbidity with other mental disorders in a Japanese community sample. Subjects were 4,134 residents in selected sites in Japan. Diagnoses of mental disorders are based on the World Mental Health Survey Initiative Version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of IED were 2.1% and 0.7%, respectively, whereas those of narrow IED were 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Male gender and young age were positively associated with an increased prevalence of IED. Mood and anxiety disorders as well as suicidal ideation were shown to be associated with IED in both genders. The overall association between anxiety disorders and IED was stronger in women than in men. Positive association of substance use problems with IED was also observed. Similar findings were observed between those psychosocial factors and narrow IED. These results suggest that people having those mixed complications might have a high suicidal risk. Further research using psychological measures for anger suppression will lead to more thorough understanding of the effects of IED on psychosocial comorbidity and suicidal risk.

Self-mutilative behaviours in male alcohol-dependent inpatients and relationship with posttraumatic stress disorder,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between self-mutilation (SM) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in male alcohol-dependent inpatients, and to examine whether there is something unique about self-mutilaters with the PTSD/alcohol-dependence co-morbidity, compared with self-mutilaters without PTSD in this population. Participants were 156 consecutively admitted male alcohol-dependent inpatients. Patients were investigated with the Self-mutilative Behaviour Questionnaire (SMBQ), the Traumatic Experiences Checklist (TEC), the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R) and the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST). Among alcohol-dependent inpatients, 34.0% ( n = 53) were considered as group with SM. Rate of being unemployed, history of any trauma, history of suicide attempt and lifetime PTSD diagnosis were higher, whereas being married, current age, age at onset of regular alcohol use and duration of education were lower in the group with SM. Mean scores of SCL-90 subscales, TEC and MAST were higher in the SM group. Although SM might be related with PTSD among male alcohol-dependent inpatients, predictors of SM were age at onset of regular alcohol use, history of suicide attempt, anxiety, depression and hostility. Age at onset of regular alcohol use, history of suicide attempt, anxiety, depression and somatisation predicted SM in the subgroup of patients without PTSD, whereas hostility predicted SM alone in the subgroup of patients with PTSD. Results support the anti-suicide and the affect-regulation models of SM in the non-PTSD group, whereas they support the hostility model of SM in the subgroup with PTSD in alcohol-dependent inpatients. Thus, to reduce self-mutilative behaviour (SMB)among alcohol-dependent patients, clinicians must address different subjects in different subgroup patients; that is, focussing hostility in those with PTSD co-morbidity.

Validation of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale—Revised (CESD-R): Pragmatic depression assessment in the general population,"Depression has a huge societal impact, making accurate measurement paramount. While there are several available measures, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD) is a popular assessment tool that has wide applicability in the general population. In order to reflect modern diagnostic criteria and improve upon psychometric limitations of its predecessor, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised (CESD-R) was recently created, but has yet to be publicized. This study explored psychometric properties of the CESD-R across a large community sample ( N = 7389) and smaller student sample ( N = 245). A newly proposed algorithmic classification method yielded base-rates of depression consistent with epidemiological results. Factor analysis suggested a unidimensional factor structure, but important utility for two separate symptom clusters. The CESD-R exhibited good psychometric properties, including high internal consistency, strong factor loadings, and theoretically consistent convergent and divergent validity with anxiety, schizotypy, and positive and negative affect. Results suggest the CESD-R is an accurate and valid measure of depression in the general population with advantages such as free distribution and an atheoretical basis.

Earning and learning among Australian community residents with psychiatric disorders,"At a population level the extent that psychiatric disorders and other health conditions disrupt participation in education and employment is rarely considered simultaneously and remains largely unknown. This is an important issue because policy makers are as concerned with educational attainment, school to work transitions, and workforce skills, as they are with overall labour force participation. We investigated earning or learning, and educational attainment, among Australian community residents by age group and by category of psychiatric disorder. Data files were provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) from a population survey conducted in 2003 using a multi-stage probability sample ( N = 23,787). Adults with schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders were compared to (1) working age adults with other non-psychiatric health conditions and disabilities; and (2) healthy adults of working age. Participation in formal education and employment was extensively disrupted by all health conditions and by psychiatric disorders in particular. The extent of career-related disruption provides benchmarks for policy makers and service providers attempting to increase participation in formal education and in the labour force.

Platelet [³H] paroxetine binding in female patients with borderline personality disorder and their sisters,"Paroxetine binding could be a vulnerability marker for traits associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD). To study this relationship, we examined [³H] paroxetine binding in female patients with BPD and their sisters. The sample consisted of 54 sibling pairs in which a proband met criteria for BPD. All subjects were given the Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines, revised (DIB-R), the Diagnostic Assessment for Personality Pathology: Brief Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS), the Affective Lability Scale (ALS), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the Symptom Checklist-90, revised (SCL-90-R). All subjects had platelets assayed for [³H] paroxetine binding. There were no significant differences between probands and sisters, but both groups scored significantly lower than a previously studied control group on B max . There were no differences on Kd. Neither B max nor K d was related to most trait or symptomatic measures. Paroxetine binding could reflect endophenotypes common to BPD probands and their first-degree relatives.

The role of emotion regulation in auditory hallucinations,"Emotion regulation involves the use of strategies to influence the experience and expression of emotions. Anxiety and depression are strongly associated with the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as auditory hallucinations (AHs). Individuals usually try to down-regulate (decrease) such emotions, consequently abnormal or maladaptive use of one or more of these down-regulatory processes (e.g. increased use of expressive suppression or maladaptive attentional deployment, i.e. rumination/worry) may play an important role in AHs (e.g. increasing AH severity and distress). This study examined the self-reported use of a range of emotion regulation strategies in individuals with schizophrenia and current AHs (SZ AH; N = 34) and healthy controls ( N = 34). Two separable dimensions of hallucinatory experiences (severity and distress) were assessed together with measures of anxiety, depression and happiness. Within the SZ AH group, greater use of expressive suppression was associated with an increase in severity of AHs and greater disruption in daily life. In addition, rumination was significantly positively correlated with the distress (but not with the severity) associated with AHs. Within the control group, expressive suppression, rumination and worry were associated with more anxiety/depression and less happiness, as predicted. The implications of different emotion regulation strategies for the treatment of individuals with schizophrenia and AHs are discussed.

Psychiatric diagnoses in patients who screen positive on the Mood Disorder Questionnaire: Implications for using the scale as a case-finding instrument for bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder is prone to being overlooked because its diagnosis is more often based on retrospective report than cross-sectional assessment. Recommendations for improving the detection of bipolar disorder include the use of screening questionnaires. The Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) is the most widely studied self-report screening scale that has been developed to improve the detection of bipolar disorder. Although developed as a screening scale, the MDQ has also been used as a case-finding measure. However, studies of the MDQ in psychiatric patients have found high false positive rates, though no study has determined the psychiatric diagnoses associated with false positive results on the MDQ. The goal of the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project was to identify the psychiatric disorders associated with increased false positive rates on the MDQ. Four hundred eighty psychiatric outpatients were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and completed the MDQ. After excluding the 52 patients diagnosed with a lifetime history of bipolar disorder we compared diagnostic frequencies in patients who did and did not screen positive on the MDQ. Based on the Hirschfeld et al. scoring guidelines of the MDQ, 15.2% ( n = 65) of the 428 nonbipolar patients screened positive on MDQ. Compared to patients who screened negative, the patients who screened positive were significantly more likely have a current and lifetime diagnosis of specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug use disorders, any eating disorder, any impulse control disorder, and attention deficit disorder. Results were similar using a less restrictive threshold to identify MDQ cases. That is, MDQ caseness was associated with significantly elevated rates of anxiety, impulse control, substance use, and attention deficit disorders. Studies using the MDQ as a stand-alone proxy for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder should consider whether the presence of these other forms of psychopathology could be responsible for differences between individuals who screen positive and negative on the scale.

"Prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and burnout in Pakistani earthquake recovery workers","Past research has shown a substantial prevalence of emotional disorders in professionals involved in rescue and/or relief operations following natural disasters, including earthquakes. However, no published study to date has investigated whether disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction workers involved in later phases of the earthquake response are also affected by emotional problems. A nearly complete sample of earthquake rehabilitation and reconstruction workers ( N = 267) involved in the response to the 2005 earthquake in Northern Pakistan filled in a set of self-report questionnaires assessing emotional problems and predictor variables approximately 24 months after the earthquake. Most participants had experienced the disaster themselves and suffered from a number of stressors during and shortly after the acute earthquake phase. A substantial subgroup of participants reported clinically relevant levels of emotional disorders, especially earthquake-related posttraumatic stress disorder (42.6%), as well as depression and anxiety (approx. 20%). Levels of burnout were low. Symptom levels of posttraumatic stress disorder were associated with the severity of the earthquake experience, past traumas, work-related stressors, low social support, and female gender. The results document a high prevalence of emotional problems in earthquake rehabilitation and recovery workers.

A longitudinal study of child mental health and problem behaviours at 14 years of age following unplanned pregnancy,"A substantial minority of children are born as a consequence of an unplanned pregnancy. Yet little is known about the impact of unplanned/unwanted pregnancy (UP) on long-term health outcomes for children. This study aimed to examine the association between UP and child mental health and behavioural problems at 14 years, and whether this association is confounded or mediated by other variables. Data were from a pre-birth prospective study that included 4765 mothers and their children (48.4% female and 51.6% male) followed up from pregnancy to 14 years of the child's age in Brisbane, Australia. Child anxiety/depression, aggression, delinquency, attention problems, withdrawal problems, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, internalizing, externalizing and total problems were measured using the Achenbach's Youth Self Report at 14 years. Child smoking and alcohol consumption were self-reported at 14 years. UP was prospectively assessed at the first antenatal visit of pregnancy. UP as reported by mothers at first antenatal visit predicted elevated levels of problem behaviours and increased substance use in children at 14 years. The impact of UP on child mental health and problem behaviours is partly due to the confounding effect of other variables, such as maternal socio-demographic status, mental health and substance use during pregnancy. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanism of association between UP and child aggression and early alcohol consumption at 14 years.

Basal cortisol levels in relation to dimensions and DSM-IV categories of depression and anxiety,"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV classification may fail to adequately distinguish neuroendocrine factors involved in the etiology of depressive and anxiety disorders. Continuous phenotypic dimensions may correlate better with underlying neuroendocrine dysregulations. We compared the categorical DSM-IV diagnoses with a dimensional approach in the same group of outpatients with depressive ( n = 36), anxiety ( n = 18), and comorbid depressive and anxiety ( n = 19) disorders, who were free of psychotropic medication, and in 36 healthy controls. The Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ) was used to measure the three dimensions of the tripartite model, i.e., anhedonic depression, anxious arousal, and general distress. The salivary cortisol awakening response (CAR) (0, 30, 45, and 60min after awakening), and diurnal cortisol decline (11:00h, 15:00h, 19:00h, and 23:00h) were analyzed for linear and nonlinear associations. The CAR showed statistically significant nonlinear relationships with two MASQ dimensions, i.e., anhedonic depression and general distress, but no differences between DSM-IV categories. The diurnal cortisol decline was linearly related to the MASQ dimensions anhedonic depression and general distress and significantly higher AUC diurnal levels and a steeper slope were found in depressive patients compared to controls using DSM-IV categories. The present study shows that linear and nonlinear associations with salivary cortisol are detected when using phenotypic dimensions and may be complementary to phenotypic DSM-IV categories when doing neuroendocrine research.

The accuracy of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) to identify PTSD cases in victims of urban violence,"As a consequence of the increasing urban violence in Brazil, many cases of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are now seen in the community and clinical settings. The main aim of this article is to assess the psychometric properties of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) to study factors related to the etiology, prognosis, and efficacy of interventions of PTSD in civilian populations. PTSD outpatients from a program of victims of violence and subjects identified in an epidemiological survey conducted in the city of Sao Paulo completed a battery of validated instruments and the CAPS. Instrument reliability and validity were measured. The comparison between the CAPS scores and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID) interview resulted in the following validity coefficients: sensitivity = 90%, specificity = 95%, and misclassification rate = 7.1%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.97. There was a positive correlation between CAPS scores with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; 0.70) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; 0.76) scores. The Kappa coefficients were all higher than 0.63 for all CAPS items. The internal consistency for all CAPS items resulted in a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.97. The CAPS showed to be both an accurate and a reliable research instrument to identify PTSD cases in a civilian population.

Subclinical eating disorders and their comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders in adolescent girls,"The present study assesses the prevalence of subclinical eating disorders and examines their comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders in a sample of adolescent girls. A DSM-III-R computerized self-reported interview was administered to 833 adolescent girls (mean age = 15.7 ± 0.5 years) from a population sample to assess the prevalence of subclinical eating disorders, major depression, dysthymia, separation anxiety, and generalized anxiety disorders. The prevalence of subclinical anorexia nervosa (restricting subtype) was 3.5%, 13.3% for weight concerns (restricting subtype), 3.8% for subclinical bulimia nervosa, and 10.8% for subclinical binge eating disorder. Girls with subclinical anorexia nervosa had a higher prevalence of separation anxiety diagnosis, and they reported significantly more major depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms compared with girls reporting no eating disorders. Girls with weight concerns reported significantly more major depressive, separation, and generalized anxiety symptoms compared with girls reporting no eating disorders. Girls with subclinical bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder had a higher prevalence of mood disorders (major depression and dysthymia) compared with girls reporting no eating disorders. Furthermore, girls with subclinical bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder also reported significantly more anxiety symptoms (separation anxiety and generalized anxiety) compared with girls reporting no eating disorders. In summary, adolescent girls suffering from subclinical eating disorders should be investigated concomitantly for mood and anxiety disorders while those suffering from mood and anxiety disorders should be investigated simultaneously for subclinical eating disorders.
