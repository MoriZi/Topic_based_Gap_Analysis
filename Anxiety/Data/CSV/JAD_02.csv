ERP evidence for emotional sensitivity in social anxiety,"Background: Emotional sensitivity involves the ability to recognize and interpret facial expressions. This is very important for interpersonal communication. Previous studies found differences in emotional sensitivity between high social anxiety (HSA) individuals and low social anxiety (LSA) individuals. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are still unclear. The present study explored the effects of expression intensity and social anxiety on emotional sensitivity and their neural mechanisms. Methods: The HSA group (n = 20) and the LSA group (n = 20) were asked to recognize anger expressions with different intensities in an emotion recognition task. The hit rate, reaction time, early time window (P1, N170), and late time window (LPP) were recorded. Results: The results showed that individuals with HSA had a significantly higher hit rate and shorter reaction time than individuals with LSA (p &lt; 0.01). Event-related potential (ERP) results showed that, compared to the LSA group, the HSA group exhibited significantly enhanced N170 and LPP amplitude (p &lt; 0.01). However, the difference in P1 amplitude was not significant (p &gt; 0.05). Limitations: The participants in this study were a subclinical social anxiety sample, and the effects of other mood disorders were not excluded, partially limiting the generalizability of the results. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, compared to LSA individuals, HSA individuals are more sensitive to all presented faces. The ERP results indicated that HSA individuals’ high sensitivity to threatening expressions is related to stronger structural encoding and fine processing.

"Self-reported changes in anxiety, depression and suicidality during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece","Introduction: There are only a few published empirical data on COVID‐19′s effects on the mental health. Material and Methods: During lockdown, an online questionnaire registered demographic, health data, previous psychiatric history, current anxiety, depression and suicidality, believing in conspiracy theories and other domains. Data from 3399 persons were used (81.08% females; aged 34.02 ± 9.72 and 18.27% males; aged 36.38 ± 10.33). Distress and clinical depression were identified with the use of cut-off and a previously developed algorithm respectively. Statistical Analysis: A post-stratification method was used; descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables. Results: Clinical depression was present in 9.31% of the stratified sample, while 8.5% had severe distress; increased anxiety was present in more than 45%. Suicidal thoughts increased in 10.40% and decreased in 4.42%. Beliefs in conspiracy theories were widely prevalent; at least half of cases were following various misconceptions. A model for the development of depression was created with general health status, previous history of depression, self-harm and suicidal attempts, family responsibility, economic change, and age acting as risk factors, while keeping a daily routine, pursuing religiousness/spirituality, and believing in conspiracy theories acting as protective factors. Conclusions: The model developed here revealed multiple vulnerabilities and an interplay leading from simple anxiety to clinical depression and suicidality through distress. This could be of practical utility since most of these factors are modifiable. Future research, as well as interventions, should focus specifically on them.

The structure of executive dysfunction in depression and anxiety,"Background: Although research has demonstrated that depression and anxiety are associated with problematic executive function (EF), results are often inconsistent and underspecified. Delineating specific EF impairments in depression and anxiety has the potential to provide a mechanistic account of symptom presentation and course in these highly co-occurring disorders. The present study evaluated associations between components of EF and symptom dimensions of depression (depressed mood) and anxiety (anxious apprehension, anxious arousal) using factor analyses and structural equation modeling. Methods: Undergraduates ( N = 1,123) completed self-report measures of EF in everyday life and of psychopathology. Based on a three-factor model (Miyake et al., 2000), item-level exploratory ( n = 561) and confirmatory ( n = 562) factor analyses were conducted on inhibition, shifting, and working memory scales chosen from the EF measure. Structural equation modeling tested the relationship of EF factors to dimensions of psychopathology using the total sample. Results: A three-factor model of EF best fit the data and was replicated via confirmatory factor analysis. Depressed mood and anxious arousal evidenced broad deficits across all EF domains, whereas anxious apprehension evidenced shifting disruptions. Limitations: Perceived EF may not index the same constructs as performance-based EF tests. Further, the present study was restricted to college students, warranting replication in other samples. Conclusions: Findings suggest that depressed mood and anxious arousal are characterized by a general disruption in the ability to maintain task goals, whereas anxious apprehension is characterized by cognitive inflexibility. EF impairments are likely contributory factors in the maintenance of affective disorders.

Mental health and its correlates among children and adolescents during COVID-19 school closure: The importance of parent-child discussion,"Background: School closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak have affected 87% of the world's students physically, socially, and psychologically, yet rigorous investigation into their mental health during this period is still lacking. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 4-342 primary and secondary school students from Shanghai, China was conducted during March 13–23, 2020. Besides demographic information, psychological distress (including depression, anxiety, and stress), life satisfaction, perceived impact of home quarantine, and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were assessed. Results: The three most prevalent symptoms were: anxiety (24.9%), depression (19.7%), and stress (15.2%). Participants were generally satisfied with life and 21.4% became more satisfied with life during school closures. Senior grades were positively correlated with psychopathological symptoms and negatively associated with life satisfaction, whereas the perceived benefit from home quarantine and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were negatively correlated with psychopathological symptoms and positively correlated with life satisfaction. Among participants who perceived no benefit from home quarantine, those who had discussions with their parents about COVID-19 experienced less depression, anxiety, and stress. Limitations: Limitations included the inability to infer the casual relationship, no parental report for mental health of children aged 6 to 9, and the inadequate measurement of parent-child discussion. Conclusions: Mental health problems and resilience co-existed in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak. Given the important role of parent-child discussions, open communication between parents and children about the pandemic should be encouraged to help children and adolescents cope with mental health problems in public health crisis.

"""Elevated depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Elevated depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic"" by Catherine Lebel, Anna MacKinnon, Mercedes Bagshawe, Lianne Tomfohr-Madsen and Gerald Giesbrecht ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2020[Dec][1], Vol 277, 5-13). In the original article, there was an error in the syntax that caused systematically lowered scores for all individuals on the pregnancy-related anxiety questionnaire (PRAQ) and the interpersonal support evaluation list (ISEL). These scores have been updated in the tables and the text, and the corrections are present in this erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-75728-003). Background: Anxiety and depression symptoms in pregnancy typically affect between 10 and 25% of pregnant individuals. Elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of preterm birth, postpartum depression, and behavioural difficulties in children. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially wide-ranging consequences for pregnancy and beyond. Methods: We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the current COVID-19 pandemic and determined factors that were associated with psychological distress. 1987 pregnant participants in Canada were surveyed in April 2020. The assessment included questions about COVID-19-related stress and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, and social support. Results: We found substantially elevated anxiety and depression symptoms compared to similar pre-pandemic pregnancy cohorts, with 37% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression and 57% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with more concern about threats of COVID-19 to the life of the mother and baby, as well as concerns about not getting the necessary prenatal care, relationship strain, and social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of perceived social support and support effectiveness, as well as more physical activity, were associated with lower psychological symptoms. Conclusion: This study shows concerningly elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have long-term impacts on their children. Potential protective factors include increased social support and exercise, as these were associated with lower symptoms and thus may help mitigate long-term negative outcomes.

"Modelling the contribution of the Big Five personality traits, health anxiety, and COVID-19 psychological distress to generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","In the current study we sought to extend our understanding of vulnerability and protective factors (the Big Five personality traits, health anxiety, and COVID-19 psychological distress) in predicting generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants ( n = 502), who were United States residents, completed a variety of sociodemographic questions and the following questionnaires: Big Five Inventory‐10 (BFI-10), Whitley Index 7 (WI-7), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C19-ASS), and Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Results showed that extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness were negatively correlated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms and that neuroticism, health anxiety and both measures of COVID-19 psychological distress were positively correlated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms. We used path analysis to determine the pattern of relationships specified by the theoretical model we proposed. Results showed that health anxiety, COVID-19 anxiety, and the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome partially mediated the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms. Specifically, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were negatively associated with the three mediators, which, in turn, were positively associated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms, with COVID-19 anxiety showing the strongest effect. Conversely, neuroticism and openness were positively associated with COVID-19 anxiety and the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome, respectively. These relationships were independent of age, gender, employment status and risk status. The model accounted for a substantial variance of generalised anxiety and depression symptoms (R² = .75). The implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2021
"The role of expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal in cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder: A study of self-report, subjective, and electrocortical measures","Background: Contemporary models of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) emphasize emotion dysregulation as a core impairment whose reduction may play a causal role in psychotherapy. The current study examined changes in use of emotion regulation strategies as possible mechanisms of change in CBT for SAD. Specifically, we examined changes in expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal during CBT and whether these changes predict treatment outcome. Methods: Patients ( n = 34; 13 females; Mean age = 28.36 (6.97)) were allocated to 16-20 sessions of CBT. An electrocortical measure of emotion regulation and a clinician-rated measure of SAD were administered monthly. Self-report measures of emotion regulation and social anxiety were administered weekly. Multilevel models were used to examine changes in emotion regulation during treatment and cross-lagged associations between emotion regulation and anxiety. Results: CBT led to decreased suppression frequency, increased reappraisal self-efficacy, and decreased unpleasantness for SAD-related pictures ( p s &lt; .05). At post-treatment, patients were equivalent to healthy controls in terms of suppression frequency and subjective reactivity to SAD-related stimuli. Gains were maintained at 3-months follow-up. Decreases in suppression frequency and electrocortical reactivity to SAD-related pictures predicted lower subsequent anxiety but not the other way around (ps &lt; .05). Lower anxiety predicted greater subsequent increases in reappraisal self-efficacy. Limitations: The lack of a control group precludes conclusions regarding mechanisms specificity. Conclusions: Decreased frequency of suppression is a potential mechanism of change in CBT for SAD.

Prospective associations between peer functioning and social anxiety in adolescents: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: During adolescence, peer relationships take precedence and there is a normative increase in social anxiety. Although prospective studies have suggested peer functioning and social anxiety can influence each other, their findings have not been examined systematically. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to examine the bidirectional relationship between peer functioning and social anxiety in adolescence. Methods: EMBASE, PsycINFO, Medline, and PubMed were searched to identify relevant articles. Meta-analysis was conducted to examine the mean effect sizes of prospective associations between social anxiety and four dimensions of peer functioning. Moderator analysis was performed, with age, gender, time interval between baseline and follow-up assessment, and publication year as moderators. Results: Meta-analyses of 23 studies showed that friendship quality (r = -.11), peer rejection (r = -.06), and peer victimization (r =.23) were each associated with later social anxiety, but peer acceptance was not (r = -.11). Social anxiety at baseline was associated with prospective levels of friendship quality (r = -.11), peer rejection (r = .09), and peer victimization (r =.17), but not peer acceptance (r = -.14). Age moderated the association between friendship quality and prospective social anxiety. Other moderator effects were statistically non-significant. Limitations: Limitations include different classifications of peer functioning, the use of self-report measures, heterogeneity between studies, and underrepresentation of clinical samples. Conclusions: A significant bidirectional association was found with social anxiety across three dimensions of peer functioning. Psychological prevention and intervention targeting peer functioning and social anxiety are indicated.

Attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder symptoms and suicidal ideation among college students: A structural equation modeling approach,"Objective: Suicidal ideation (SI) among college students is frequently reported. However, the mediating roles of depressive and anxiety symptoms between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and SI has yet to be explored among college students. Method: A cross-sectional survey of college freshmen in China was conducted between October 2018 and December 2018. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect information on basic sociodemographic characteristics, including SI, ADHD symptoms, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. A structural equation model (SEM) was then constructed. Results: A total of 904 college freshmen were included in the analysis. The prevalence of ADHD symptoms and lifetime SI were 11.9% (95% CI: 9.9%–14.2%) and 29.2% (95% CI: 26.3%–32.2%), respectively. The SEM revealed that there were no direct paths from inattention, executive dysfunction, and hyperactivity to SI. Under the mediating role of anxiety and depressive symptoms, executive dysfunction (β = 0.011, p &lt; 0.05) and hyperactivity (β = 0.015, p &lt; 0.05) had indirect relationships with the risk of SI, and the role of inattention was not identified. Depressive and anxiety symptoms had direct influences on increasing SI. There also were indirect effects from anxiety symptoms to SI, which were mediated by depressive symptoms (β = 0.023, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The current study indicated the indirect relationships between ADHD symptoms and SI among college freshmen. The findings could provide useful clues for clinical treatment and school-based prevention that aims to improve college students’ mental well-being.

Effects of psychological and pharmacological interventions on anxiety symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder in full or partial remission: A systematic review,"Background: Anxiety symptoms are prevalent in bipolar disorder (BD) even during periods of remission and impede treatment efficacy, prognosis and functional capacity. This highlights a pressing clinical need to identify novel effective anxiety treatments. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence within the field. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search on PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE and Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) targeting anxiety in remitted BD patients. Results: We identified 10 RCTs investigating the effects of psychological or pharmacological treatments on anxiety in remitted BD patients. Two studies of transdiagnostic personalised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) found a treatment-related reduction in anxiety. This evidence was preliminary given small sample size and use of self-report measures in a single-blind trial design, respectively. The remaining six psychological intervention trials provided more preliminary evidence due to several methodological challenges. The two pharmacological studies found anxiolytic effects of add-on olanzapine or methylene blue to lithium treatment, respectively. Nevertheless, this evidence should be interpreted with caution given high drop-out rates and substantial side-effects that may have impeded blinding. Limitations: We did not conduct a quantitative meta-analysis. Conclusions: There is preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of modified CBT and add-on pharmacotherapy on residual anxiety in BD. Future trials should pre-screen participants for anxiety, define one clinician-rated anxiety measurement as a primary outcome, and employ intention-to-treat analysis to assess treatment effect. This will advance treatment development and enable personalised approaches to address residual anxiety in BD, which has great clinical relevance.

"Comparing discrimination among people with schizophrenia, affective and anxiety disorders. A multilevel study in five European countries","Background: Most research on mental illness stigma has involved people with psychosis; less information is available for people with affective and anxiety disorders. We aimed to compare experienced and anticipated discrimination among people with schizophrenia, and affective and anxiety disorders. Methods: People with schizophrenia (n = 773), affective (n = 1010) and anxiety disorders (n = 372) were recruited during psychiatric admission across 5 EU countries. The Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC-12) was used. Multivariate mixed effect logistic regression models with a random effect for hospital and country were performed to explore patient characteristics associated with experienced and anticipated discrimination. Results: With anxiety disorders, there were more reports of experiences of discrimination in social life (35%), intimate relationships (23.5%), and physical healthcare (19%); in schizophrenia, in relations with neighbours (23.6%) and mental health staff (21.7%); and in affective disorders, in parental role (22.8%). In multivariate analyses, anxiety was associated with increased likelihood of experiencing discrimination in police interactions (OR = 1.675; p = 0.038) and physical healthcare (OR = 1.816; p = 0.003), and reduced likelihood when starting a family (OR = 0.474; p = 0.01) as compared with schizophrenia. Affective (OR = 1.367; p = 0.004) and anxiety disorders (OR = 1.354; p = 0.034) were associated with increased likelihood of concealing a diagnosis compared with schizophrenia. Limitations: As patients with affective and anxiety disorders were recruited from hospital inpatient units, their experiences may not be representative of all people with these disorders. Conclusions: In a sample of people receiving inpatient treatment, experienced and anticipated discrimination are perceived, at least in some life domains, as more of a burden for people with affective and anxiety disorders than those with schizophrenia.

Personality difficulties and response to community-based psychological treatment for anxiety and depression,"Background: Previous research suggests that comorbid personality disorder may be associated with a less favourable treatment outcome for individuals with depression and anxiety disorder. However, little is known about whether personality difficulties are associated with treatment outcomes within Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services-the largest platform for treating depression and anxiety in England, UK. Secondary aims were to investigate i) whether individual personality difficulties are associated with treatment outcome and ii) whether findings are moderated by treatment type. Methods: The sample included 3,689 adults who accessed community-based psychological treatment (cognitive behavioural therapy, emotional skills training, or other psychological therapy) for depression and/or anxiety disorder. Associations between personality difficulties (assessed with the Standardised Assessment of Personality–Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS)) and treatment outcomes (recovery and reliable improvement in depression/anxiety symptom scores, assessed using questionnaire-based measures) were investigated using logistic/linear regression. Results: Personality difficulties were associated with a reduced likelihood of recovery (adjusted OR per unit increase on SAPAS: depression = 0.87, 95%CI 0.84, 0.91; anxiety = 0.86, 95%CI 0.82, 0.90) and reliable improvement (adjusted OR per unit increase on SAPAS: depression = 0.88, 95%CI 0.84, 0.92; anxiety = 0.85, 95%CI 0.82, 0.89). Those with three or more difficulties were over 30% less likely to recover/reliably improve. Limitations: Personality difficulties data were collected via self-report and were not available for all participants. Conclusion: Patients with personality difficulties have a less favourable response to psychological treatment for depression/anxiety disorder. If replicated, the findings highlight a major challenge to the way community-based psychological therapy services in England (IAPT services) are presently constituted.

Gender-specific effect of pregnancy-related anxiety on preschooler's emotional and behavioral development: A population-based cohort study,"Background: Pregnancy-related anxiety plays a major role in shaping offspring's neural development. However, its gender-specific effect on children's emotional and behavioral development is controversial and the knowledge of critical period is limited. This study aims to examine gender-specific effect of pregnancy-related anxiety on preschooler's emotional and behavioral development. Methods: This study was based on the China-Anhui Birth Cohort Study (C-ABCS). A total of 3443 mother-child pairs were included in final data analysis. Pregnancy-related anxiety was assessed by Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire respectively in the 1 st and 3 rd trimester of pregnancy. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ) were completed by parents to assess preschool emotional and behavioral development in boys and girls. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between pregnancy-related anxiety and preschoolers’ emotional and behavioral problems. Results: The overall prevalence of pregnancy-related anxiety was 31.6%. Compared with those whose mothers without pregnancy-related anxiety in either 1 st or 3 rd trimester, preschool boys born of mothers with pregnancy-related anxiety in the 1st trimester and in the 3rd trimester had an increased risk of conduct problems. Pregnancy-related anxiety in the 1 st , 3 rd trimester and in both trimesters all related with preschool boys’ hyperactivity and total difficult problems. Pregnancy-related anxiety in the 1st trimester and in both 1 st and 3 rd trimester increased the risk of preschool girls’ emotional problems and total difficult problems. Conclusion: Pregnancy-related anxiety may relate with preschool boys’ externalizing problems in early and late of pregnancy and increase the risk of internalizing problems in girls in early pregnancy. Limitations: There was no data on pregnancy-related anxiety in the second trimester.

Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for anxiety disorders among children and adolescents: A systematic review,"Background: Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for anxiety disorders have rarely been studied, even though they are highly prevalent in children and adolescents. It is important to identify the common risk factors, so that targeted preventive care and early interventions can be provided. Methods: A systematic review of the PubMed and PsycInfo databases was conducted to 25 October 2019, according to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. The protocol was registered on the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews and the quality assessment was carried out using the Joanna Briggs tools. Results: The review identified 31 studies from eight countries, including three register studies. Cohort sizes ranged from 69 to 89,404 and diagnoses cases ranged from 4 to 7867. Although various risk factors had been researched, only few of them had been repeatedly studied and the findings were highly inconsistent. The associations between the different risk factors and anxiety disorders seemed weak compared to many other psychiatric disorders, but preterm birth and maternal somatic illnesses may increase the risk for anxiety disorders in offspring. Limitations: The studies varied considerably by study design, risk factors and anxiety disorders studied, sample sizes and follow up periods. Conclusions: Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for anxiety disorders have been under-researched, compared to other psychiatric disorders. Our systematic review found weak links to prenatal events, but flagged up preterm birth and maternal somatic illnesses as possible avenues for future research.

Altered resting-state fMRI signals and network topological properties of bipolar depression patients with anxiety symptoms,"Background: This study aims to explore the changes in functional neuroimaging in bipolar depression patients with anxiety symptoms (BDP-A). Methods: Forty-five BDP-A patients, 22 bipolar depression patients without anxiety symptoms (BDP-NA), and 48 healthy controls (HC) were finally involved. The low-frequency oscillation characteristics, functional connectivity (FC), and network properties among the three groups of participants were analyzed. Results: Compared with the BDP-NA group, BDP-A patients exhibited significantly decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), superior occipital gyrus, and inferior parietal, but supramarginal and angular gyri (IPL). Enhanced FC from left IPL to middle temporal gyrus, from left precentral gyrus (PreCG) to bilateral angular gyri, medial superior frontal gyrus, and left superior frontal gyrus (SFG)/MFG were also revealed. Compared with HC, the BDP-A group showed remarkably increased ALFF in the left MFG/PreCG, right superior parietal gyrus, while decreased ALFF in the left inferior frontal gyrus, opercular part, and SFG. In addition, higher regional homogeneity in the left MFG/PreCG was found. Limitations: The limitations are as follows: (1) relatively small sample size; (2) not all the patients were drug-naive; (3) lack of pure anxiety disorder patients as a controlled group; (4) mental health conditions of HC were not systemic evaluated. Conclusions: BDP-A patients showed significant differences in resting-state fMRI properties when compared with BDP-NA or HC group. These results may infer the dysfunction of the dorsal attention network, the default network, and the fronto-limbic system as well as disrupted brain network efficiency in BDP-A patients.

Applying network analysis to investigate the links between dimensional schizotypy and cognitive and affective empathy,"Background: Although impairment in empathy has been reported in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, little is known about the relationship between empathy and schizotypal traits. This study examines this relationship by applying network analysis to a large sample collected at 18-months follow-up in a longitudinal dataset. Methods: One thousand four hundred and eighty-six college students were recruited and completed a set of self-reported questionnaires on empathy, schizotypy, depression, anxiety and stress. Networks were constructed by taking the subscale scores of these measures as nodes and partial correlations between each pair of nodes as edges. Network Comparison Tests were performed to investigate the differences between individuals with high and low schizotypy. Results: Cognitive and affective empathy were strongly connected with negative schizotypy in the network. Physical and social anhedonia showed high centrality measured by strength, closeness and betweenness while anxiety and stress showed high expected influence. Predictability ranged from 22.4% (personal distress) to 79.9% (anxiety) with an average of 54.4%. Compared with the low schizotypy group, the high schizotypy group showed higher global strength ( S = 0.813, p &lt; 0.05) and significant differences in network structure ( M = 0.531, p &lt; 0.001) and strength of edges connecting empathy with schizotypy (adjusted p s &lt; 0.05). Limitations: Only self-rating scales were used, and disorganized schizotypy was not included. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the cognitive and affective components of empathy and dimensions of schizotypy are closely related in the general population and their network interactions may play an important role in individuals with high schizotypy.

Temporal patterns of anxiety disorders and cortisol activity in older adults,"Introduction: Studies focusing on anxiety temporal patterns and cortisol activity in older adults are scarce. The objectives of this study were to examine in older adults the relationship between anxiety temporal patterns and cortisol activity and ascertain the presence of sex differences. Methods: Data were retrieved from the Étude sur la santé des ainés—Services study in Quebec and included N = 762 community living adults aged ≥ 65 years having participated in interviews at baseline (T1) and at 4 years follow-up (T₂). A standardized questionnaire, based on DSM-5 criteria, was used to ascertain in the past 6 months the presence of anxiety (absence, remission, incidence, persistence). Cortisol activity during the interview and cortisol concentration on a regular day (at T₂) were the dependent variables. Adjusted multivariable linear regression models, stratified by sex, were used. Results: Results showed higher cortisol activity during the interview in participants with anxiety in remission ( Beta : 2.59; 95% CI: 0.62 , 4.57), specifically in males, and lower activity in participants with persistent anxiety ( Beta : -3.97; 95% CI: -7.05, -0.88). Cortisol concentration on a regular day was higher in males reporting incident anxiety ( Beta : 8.07; 95% CI: 2.39 , 13.76). Limitations: The convenience sample with losses to follow-up may have led to a potential selection bias. Conclusion: Anxiety temporal patterns were associated with cortisol activity profiles in older adults with sex being a significant moderator. Future studies are recommended to ascertain the longitudinal changes in cortisol activity and anxiety temporal patterns, which may further inform personalized treatment of anxiety.

A tailored online intervention to improve parenting risk and protective factors for child anxiety and depression: Medium-term findings from a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Despite considerable evidence on parenting risk and protective factors for child anxiety and depressive disorders, the development of interventions based on this evidence is still lagging behind. To address this gap, the web-based Parenting Resilient Kids (PaRK) program was developed to target these risk and protective factors. This study evaluated the effects of the program at 12-month follow-up. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with a community sample of 355 parents and 342 children ( M child age = 9.79). Parents randomized into the web-based PaRK intervention condition received a personalized feedback report about their parenting and were recommended a tailored course of up to 12 interactive modules. Parents in the control condition received a standard set of web-based educational factsheets. Results: Parents in the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in self-reported parenting compared to control group parents from baseline to 12-month follow-up, d = 0.24, 95% CI [0.03, 0.45]. Both groups showed reductions in child anxiety and depressive symptoms, parental psychological control and unhealthy family functioning; and improvements in parental acceptance, child- and parent- health-related quality of life. Limitations: The PaRK intervention was tailored based on the parents’ own report of their parenting behaviors. There was an over-representation of highly-educated mothers and only one parent-child dyad was included per family. Conclusions: PaRK improved parenting for up to 12 months, but had no superior effect on children's mental health outcomes compared with an educational-factsheet intervention. Further follow-up is needed to assess longer-term effects.

Psychological distress related to COVID-19—the contribution of continuous traumatic stress,"Objective: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a substantial stressor that could eventuate in psychological distress. Evidence suggests that individuals previously exposed to traumatic events, and particularly to continuous traumatic stress (CTS), might be more vulnerable to distress when facing additional stressors. This study aimed to investigate these suppositions in the context of the ongoing shelling of Israel from the Israel-Gaza border, which continues even amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Method: An online survey was conducted among Israel's general population. The sample included 976 participants. Seven-hundred-and-ninety-three participants had been exposed to traumatic events, with 255 participants reporting CTS. Trauma exposure, COVID-19-related stressors, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 (anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms) were assessed. Results: Most participants reported experiencing at least one psychiatric symptom related to COVID-19. Being younger, female, not in a relationship, having a below-average income, being diagnosed with the disease, living alone during the outbreak, having a close other in a high-risk group, and negatively self-rating one's health status were associated with elevated distress. Individuals who had been exposed to trauma, and to CTS in particular, had elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms compared to individuals without such a history or to survivors of non-ongoing traumatic events. CTS moderated the relations between PTSD symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, with significantly stronger relations found among individuals exposed to CTS. Limitations: This study relied on convenience sampling. Conclusions: Trauma survivors, and particularly traumatized individuals exposed to CTS, seem at risk for psychological distress related to COVID-19.

Elevated depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 279 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2020-97726-048). In the original article, there was an error in the syntax that caused systematically lowered scores for all individuals on the pregnancy-related anxiety questionnaire (PRAQ) and the interpersonal support evaluation list (ISEL). These scores have been updated in the tables and the text, and the corrections are present in the erratum.] Background: Anxiety and depression symptoms in pregnancy typically affect between 10 and 25% of pregnant individuals. Elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of preterm birth, postpartum depression, and behavioural difficulties in children. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially wide-ranging consequences for pregnancy and beyond. Methods: We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the current COVID-19 pandemic and determined factors that were associated with psychological distress. 1987 pregnant participants in Canada were surveyed in April 2020. The assessment included questions about COVID-19-related stress and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, and social support. Results: We found substantially elevated anxiety and depression symptoms compared to similar pre-pandemic pregnancy cohorts, with 37% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression and 57% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with more concern about threats of COVID-19 to the life of the mother and baby, as well as concerns about not getting the necessary prenatal care, relationship strain, and social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of perceived social support and support effectiveness, as well as more physical activity, were associated with lower psychological symptoms. Conclusion: This study shows concerningly elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have long-term impacts on their children. Potential protective factors include increased social support and exercise, as these were associated with lower symptoms and thus may help mitigate long-term negative outcomes.

Physical activity partially mediates associations between “Big” personality traits and incident generalized anxiety disorder: Findings from the Irish longitudinal study on ageing,"Background: This study aimed to examine associations of personality with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and physical activity (PA), PA with GAD, and PA mediates associations between personality and incident GAD. Methods: Participants aged ≥ 50 years completed the 60-item NEO-Five Factor Inventory questionnaire to assess personality and short-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire at baseline, and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview—Short Form to clinically assess GAD at baseline and 2, 4, and 6 years later. Participants who had GAD at baseline or reported having ever been told by a doctor that they had anxiety were excluded from analyses. Binary logistic regression quantified associations of the ‘Big Five’ personality traits with PA and incident GAD, and associations of PA with incident GAD (i.e., GAD at any point during follow-up). The ‘counterfactual approach’ identified potential mediating effects of PA in the associations between personality traits and incident GAD. Results: Participants ( n = 4582; 53.7% female) were aged 64.38±8.88 years. Incidence of GAD was 2.95% ( n = 135). Extraversion (OR=1.160, 95%CI = 1.087–1.237), openness (1.113, 1.043–1.188), and conscientiousness (1.083, 1.015–1.155) were positively associated with physical activity. Neuroticism was positively (2.335, 1.945–2.803), and extraversion (0.700, 0.563–0.797), conscientiousness (0.826, 0.693–0.985), and PA (0.655, 0.451–0.952) were inversely, associated with the incident GAD. Approximately 8.7% of the effect of extraversion and 8.8% of the effect of conscientiousness on GAD was due to mediation by PA only. Limitations: PA was self-reported Conclusions: Personality screening may help to identify older adults at-risk of anxiety who would benefit from participation in physical activity interventions.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for persons living with HIV in China: A randomized pilot trial,"Background: Chinese persons living with HIV (PLWH) suffer from prevalent mental health issues. We aimed to develop a tailored cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), test its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects (depression, anxiety, and medication adherence) for Chinese PLWH. Methods: Twenty PLWH were assigned randomly. Intervention participants learned skills in CBT and relaxation training in a tailored group-based weekly 10-session project. Each session lasted for two hours and was delivered by nurses and volunteers. Control participants only received laboratory tests and free antiretroviral therapy (ART) medication. Feasibility and acceptability were descriptively summarized. Depression, anxiety, and ART medication adherence data were collected at the baseline (T0), after the intervention (T1) and after 6 months of follow-up (T2). Results: The average CBT attendance rate for all sessions was 60%. No participants in the intervention group dropped out of the study. All participants in the intervention group agreed that they could benefit from the CBT. Participants in the intervention group showed a greater improvement in anxiety and self-reported ART medication adherence than those in the control group at T1. However, no preliminary intervention effect was found at T2. Limitations: The small sample size leads to a lack of representativeness in the study sample. We excluded participants with severe comorbidities, which may lead to an underestimate of the intervention effect of CBT among Chinese PLWH. Conclusions: CBT is feasible and acceptable, demonstrating promising preliminary effects on anxiety and ART medication adherence among Chinese PLWH. Additional research is needed to test the effectiveness of this approach.

Differential effects of cranial electrotherapy stimulation on changes in anxiety and depression symptoms over time in patients with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is a safe and well-tolerated 6-12 week treatment that is clinically and cost effective on both anxiety and depression symptoms resulting in sustained remission of these symptoms at 12 and 24 weeks in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients. The aim of the current report was to explore whether the effectiveness of CES was related to its effects on depression or anxiety over time Methods: A consecutive sample of 161 eligible patients with GAD was recruited from two publicly funded services in England while they waited for individual cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) after failing to achieve remission on the GAD-7 with computerised CBT. They received 60 minutes per day Alpha-Stim CES for 6-12 weeks. Outcomes were changes in PHQ-9, GAD-7 score from baseline to 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 weeks. Latent variable cross-lagged panel analysis permitted an analysis of the differential effects of anxiety and depression with CES treatment over time. Results: Anxiety at baseline significantly predicted depression at week 4 (standardized regression weight = .40, p &lt; 0.001). Depression at week 12 significantly predicted anxiety at week 24 (standardized regression weight = .28, p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: Not a randomized controlled trial but further analysis of a prospective observational cohort. High rates of loss to follow up by 24 weeks. Conclusion: Sustained effectiveness required a CES response to anxiety symptoms in first 4 weeks and improvement in depression symptoms by 12 weeks.

Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines,"Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses a threat to societies’ mental health. This study examined the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identified the factors contributing to psychological impact in the Philippines. Methods: A total of 1879 completed online surveys were gathered from March 28-April 12, 2020. Collected data included socio-demographics, health status, contact history, COVID-19 knowledge and concerns, precautionary measures, information needs, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) ratings. Results: The IES-R mean score was 19.57 (SD=13.12) while the DASS-21 mean score was 25.94 (SD = 20.59). In total, 16.3% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate-to-severe; 16.9% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% had moderate-to-severe anxiety levels; and 13.4% had moderate-to-severe stress levels. Female gender; youth age; single status; students; specific symptoms; recent imposed quarantine; prolonged home-stay; and reports of poor health status, unnecessary worry, concerns for family members, and discrimination were significantly associated with greater psychological impact of the pandemic and higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression ( p &lt; 0.05). Adequate health information, having grown-up children, perception of good health status and confidence in doctors’ abilities were significantly associated with lesser psychological impact of the pandemic and lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression ( p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: An English online survey was used. Conclusion: During the early phase of the pandemic in the Philippines, one-fourth of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety and one-sixth reported moderate-to-severe depression and psychological impact. The factors identified can be used to devise effective psychological support strategies.

Is in vitro fertilization (ivf) associated with perinatal affective disorders?,"Background: Since mothers who undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) may experience more anxiety and depressive symptoms than mothers who conceive naturally, a review of the literature was conducted to investigate whether IVF may be considered a risk factor for the development of anxiety or depression during pregnancy and post-partum. Methods: A thorough search of articles in Pubmed, PsycINFO and Isi Web of Knowledge was performed in order to produce a comprehensive review regarding the potential association of in vitro fertilization and anxiety/depression. Results: The search resulted in a total of 10 articles. Contradictory results were reported in the articles about the possible association between IVF and the occurrence of anxiety and depressive symptoms both during pregnancy and postpartum period. Three studies found that women who resorted to IVF showed less anxiety and depressive symptoms than those who conceived naturally especially with the progression of pregnancy and in the postpartum. Limitations: Vulnerability to affective disorders of women affected by infertility may be independent from the outcome of IVF. Other limits are the limited research in this area, the small sample sizes, the heterogeneity of the tools used to assess affective symptoms. Conclusions: The available data indicate that IVF is not associated with perinatal affective symptoms. Women who resorted to IVF could have less perinatal depressive symptoms as the result of a positive outcome of the technique and the satisfaction of the desire to become mothers. Further studies are necessary in order to draw definitive conclusions about this topic.

"Depression and anxiety symptoms correlate with diurnal preference, sleep habits, and &lt;i&gt;Per3&lt;/i&gt; VNTR polymorphism (rs57875989) in a non-clinical sample","Background: Evidences suggest that alterations in circadian rhythms trigger the development of mental disorders. Eveningness, sleep behavior, and circadian genes polymorphisms have been associated with depression and anxiety symptomatology. However, the mechanism underlying these interactions is not well understood. We investigated the contribution of diurnal preference, sleep habits, and PER3 VNTR polymorphism (rs57875989) to depression and anxiety symptoms in a Northeast sample from the Brazilian population. Methods: Eight hundred and four young adults completed the Morningness-Eveningness (MEQ), Munich Chronotype (MCTQ), Center for Epidemiologic Studies—Depression (CES-D), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) questionnaires. All participants were genotyped and linear regression was performed to test the interactions between the genetic /behavioral variants and depression/anxiety symptoms. Results: Eveningness and sleep behaviors (bedtime, wake-up time, sleep duration, and midpoint of sleep) were correlated with depression symptomatology, specifically in somatic factors of the CES-D questionnaire. No correlation was found between diurnal preference/sleep habits with anxiety symptoms for both BAI total score and its factors. However, women with PER3 4/4 genotype showed less interpesonal affect in depression symptomatology and more anxiety symptoms in four factors of the BAI questionnaire. Limitations: Mainly because this study was based on self-report questionnaires and was limited to undergraduate students aging 18 to 30 years old. Conclusion: These results reinforce a role for sleep and diurnal preference in depression, and PER3 VNTR polymorphism in anxiety symptomatology, particularly in women.

Expressive suppression of emotion is a moderator of anxiety in a unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders: A secondary analysis,"Background: Expressive suppression (ES) of emotion is considered a moderator that reduces the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); however, whether and how ES moderates the efficacy of the unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders (UP), a version of CBT targeting aversive/avoidant responses to emotions, including ES, remain unclear. We investigated whether and how emotion regulation, especially ES, moderates UP efficacy for anxiety symptoms in patients with anxiety and depressive disorders. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a previous trial. Seventeen patients with anxiety and/or depressive disorders were included. Changes (slope estimates) in the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale from pre-treatment to post-treatment were measured using a latent growth curve model with empirical Bayesian estimation. Pre-treatment ES, cognitive reappraisal, and depressive symptoms were used as slope factor predictors. Results: Only pre-treatment ES significantly predicted the slope in the latent growth curve model (estimate value = 0.45; standard deviation = 0.21; 95% credible interval = 0.03–0.87, one-tailed p -value = 0.004), and an inverse correlation between pre-treatment ES levels and improvement magnitude of anxiety symptoms was demonstrated. Limitations: Because the data were obtained from a single-arm trial, this study did not have controls, and most participants received pharmacotherapy in addition to UP. Therefore, generalisability of the present findings might be compromised. Conclusions: Low ES before UP was an effective predictor of greater improvement in anxiety symptoms after UP. The findings suggest that interventions intended to improve ES may improve UP efficacy.

The prevalence and risk factors of psychological disturbances of frontline medical staff in China under the COVID-19 epidemic: Workload should be concerned,"Background: To our best knowledge, this was the first time to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of psychological disturbances, including depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms, insomnia and suicide, among frontline medical staff, who were working with the COVID-10 infected patients directly. Methods: Patient Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire scale (GAD-7), Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90) somatization, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the suicidal module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used for online survey. Results: A total of 606 frontline hospital staff and1099 general population were recruited. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms, insomnia, and suicide risk in frontline medical staffs were 57.6%, 45.4%, 12.0%, 32.0% and 13.0%, respectively. Except for suicide risk, the prevalence of other psychological disorders in frontline medical staff were higher than those in general population (all p &lt; 0.01). Among the frontline medical staff, the daily working hours were associated with all psychological disturbance (all p &lt; 0.01), women with anxiety ( p = 0.02), body mass index (BMI) with anxiety and insomnia ( p = 0.02, p = 0.03). Age was negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and insomnia (all p &lt; 0.01). Finally, years of working and family income were negatively associated with suicide risk ( p = 0.03, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that during the outbreak of COVID-19, the frontline medical staff are more likely to suffer from psychological disturbances than general population. It is noticeable that daily working hours are a risk factor for all measured psychological disturbances, and some other variables may be involved in certain psychological disturbances of frontline medical staff.

"Prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms, and association with epidemic-related factors during the epidemic period of COVID-19 among 123,768 workers in China: A large cross-sectional study","Background: COVID-19 has gained intense attention globally. However, little is known about the COVID-19-ralated mental health status among workers. Methods: The cross-sectional online survey with 123,768 workers was conducted from February 2, 2020 to February 7, 2020 on a mega-size labor-intensive factory in Shenzhen, China. Oral consent was obtained prior to the questionnaire survey. The information collected in the survey included demographic characteristics, psychological symptoms, COVID-19-related information, and demands for psychological education and interventions. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by the Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale. Logistic regression models were performed to determine the association between related factors and mental health status. Results: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms was 3.4% and 22.8%, respectively. The dominant epidemic-related factors were having confirmed cases in the community (odds ratio [OR], 2.75, 95% CI, 2.37–3.19) and having confirmed friends (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.69–3.52) for the increased risk of anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. Nevertheless, major traditional risk factors such as general or poor health status and always drinking alcohol were still the dominant factors associated with the increased risk of anxiety and depression symptoms. Overall, 67.3% and 26.8% workers reported desire for psychological education and interventions, respectively. Limitations: All assessments were self-reported, resulting in a risk of method bias. Conclusions: Our findings show a relatively low prevalence of anxiety symptoms, a relatively high prevalence of depression symptoms, and urgent demand for psychological education and interventions among workers during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Prevalence and factors for anxiety during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic among the teachers in China,"Objective: To assess the prevalence of anxiety and explore its factors during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic among the teachers in China. Methods: We involved 88611 teachers (response rate: 94.75%) from three cities of Henan Province, China, during February 4, 2020 and February 12, 2020. Anxiety was assessed by using Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool (GAD-7). Odds ratios (OR) with 95% Confidence intervals (CI) for potential factors of anxiety were estimated using multiple logistic regression models. Results: The overall prevalence of anxiety was 13.67%. The prevalence was higher for women than men (13.89% vs. 12.93%). The highest prevalence of anxiety was 14.06% (SE 2.51%) with age of 60 to 100 years in men, and 14.70% (SE 0.56%) with age of 50 to 60 years in women. Participants located in country-level city school had the lowest prevalence of anxiety across all age categories (12.01% for age of 18–30 years; 12.50% for age of 30–40 years; 12.13% for age of 40–50 years; 9.52% for age of 60–100 years). After adjusting for potential confounders, age, sex, education status, type of teachers, school location, information source, worried level, fear level, and behavior status were found to be associated with anxiety. Conclusions: This large-scale study assessed the prevalence of anxiety in teachers, as well as its potential influence of factors, which is useful for international and national decision-makers.

"Anhedonia is central for the association between quality of life, metacognition, sleep, and affective symptoms in generalized anxiety disorder: A complex network analysis","Background: Poor quality of life, sleep problems, anhedonia, and negative metacognitions are common in anxiety and depression. To examine the nature of the relationship between these features and the role of metacognitions, anhedonia, and quality of life in anxiety and depression, we conducted a complex network analysis with items of self-report measures assessing quality of life, sleep, negative thinking styles, anxiety, and depression. Methods: Participants were 226 treatment seeking individuals with a primary DSM-5 diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. Node centrality, strength, expected influence, community, and bridge estimation were calculated using partial correlation coefficients and glasso regularization. Results: Results revealed that anhedonia was the most central node followed by quality of life nodes. Moreover, anhedonia exhibited the highest strength and expected influence, which were both stable, reliable metrics within the network. Metacognitions were not central nodes in the network, but were strong bridge symptoms between communities. Limitations: The results are limited by the cross-sectional nature of the data and the administration of self-report scales at one time-point, despite different rating anchors. Conclusion: These findings suggest that anhedonia is a crucial element for the association between quality of life, sleep problems, and negative cognitions.

Alcohol use and mental health status during the first months of COVID-19 pandemic in Australia,"Background: We aimed to estimate the population prevalence of people with changes in their usual patterns of alcohol use during the early stages of the novel coronavirus pandemic of 2020 (COVID-19) pandemic in Australia; assess the association between mental health status and changes in alcohol use during the pandemic; and examine if the associations were modified by gender and age. Methods: This study was an anonymously-completed online self-report survey. Changes in alcohol use were assessed using a single fixed-choice study-specific question. Mental health was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale. Results: A total of 13,829 people contributed complete data and were included in the analysis. Overall, about one in five adults reported that they had been drinking more alcohol since the COVID-19 pandemic began than they used to. People were more likely to be drinking alcohol more than they used to if they had more severe symptoms of depression or anxiety. The associations between depressive and anxiety symptoms and increased alcohol use since the COVID-19 pandemic began were consistent between females and males. Limitations: Online surveys are less accessible to some groups of people. The data are self-report and not diagnostic. Cross-sectional data can identify associations, not causal relationships. The study was limited to participants from Australia. Conclusions: These data indicate that there is a need for public policies focused on alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic and the strategies should include specific consideration of the needs of people with mental health problems.

Young women are the most vulnerable to postpartum mental illness: A retrospective cohort study in UK primary care,"Background: Whilst childbirth is a leading cause of mental illness in women, how it affects women at different ages is unknown. Aims: We examine whether the effect of childbirth on mental illness varies at different ages. Methods: From 2,657,751 women identified from a UK population-based primary care database, 355,864 postpartum periods, with no history of mental illness, were matched on year of birth and general practice to 1,420,350 non-postpartum periods. Cox regression models were used to compare incident mental illness between postpartum and non-postpartum periods. These were measured using hazard ratios (HR) and hazard ratios adjusted for parity and prior pregnancy loss (aHR). Results: Strong evidence is presented that the effect of livebirth on mental illness was age-dependant for depression ( p &lt; 0·001), anxiety (p 0·048) and affective psychosis (p 0·031). In 15–19 year olds, depression was over seven times more likely to occur in postpartum periods than non-postpartum periods (aHR 7·09, 95%CI 6·65–7·56); twice the effect in women overall (aHR 3·24 95%CI 3·18–3·29). 15–19 year olds were 50% more likely to develop anxiety in postpartum periods than non-postpartum periods (aHR 1·52, 95%CI 1·38–1·67), with little effect in women overall (aHR 1·07 95%CI 1·04–1·10). Livebirth had over twice the effect on affective psychosis in women aged 15–24 (15–19 year olds: aHR 2·71 95%CI 1·23–5·97; 20–24 year olds: aHR 2·79 95%CI 1·68–4·63) compared to women overall (aHR 1·66, 95%CI 1·29–2·14). Conclusions: Younger women are far more vulnerable to the effect of childbirth on their mental health, particularly depression and anxiety.

"Anxiety and depression symptoms, and lack of emotional support among the general population before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A prospective national study on prevalence and risk factors","Background: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and emotional support among the general population are unclear. We therefore assessed if the prevalence of high Anxiety and Depression Symptoms (ADS) levels and lack of Emotional Support (ES) increased, and if risk factors of ADS and ES changed. Methods: Data was extracted from surveys conducted with the Dutch longitudinal population-based LISS panel ( N = 3,983). ADS and ES were assessed in March 2019 and 2020. Risk factors for ADS and ES were extracted from surveys in November 2018 and 2019. These were: ADS, gender, education, domestic situation, employment, age, ethnicity, lung and heart problems, and diabetes. Results: The prevalence of high ADS levels and lack of ES did not increase compared to the pre-outbreak prevalence. ADS, non-native ethnic background, (partial) work disabilities and lung problems were predictive of both ADS and lack of ES in March 2019 and 2020. Job seekers, students and those who take care of housekeeping were more at risk for ADS in March 2020, but not in 2019. While 35–49 years old respondents were less at risk for ADS in March 2019, they were more at risk in 2020. Parents with child(ren) at home and those who take care of housekeeping more often lacked ES in March 2020, but not in 2019. Limitations: No other mental health problems were assessed. Conclusions: No increase in the prevalence of ADS and lack of ES was found. Some risk factors remained significant after the outbreak, while others changed notably.

Longitudinal evaluation of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain,"Background: Strict confinement and social distancing measures have been imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries. The aim was to assess the temporal evolution of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown from two surveys, separated by one month, performed in Spain. Methods: Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and the psychological impact of the situation were longitudinally analyzed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) respectively. Results: There was a total of 4,724 responses from both surveys. Symptomatic scores of anxiety, depression and stress were exhibited by 37.22%, 46.42% and 49.66% of the second survey respondents, showing a significant increase compared to the first survey (32.45%, 44.11% and 37.01%, respectively). There was no significant longitudinal change of the IES scores, with 48.30% of the second survey participants showing moderate to severe impact of the confinement. Constant news consumption about COVID-19 was found to be positively associated with symptomatic scores in the different scales, and daily physical activity to be negatively associated with DASS-21 scores. Conclusions: Results indicated a temporal increase of anxiety, depression and stress scores during the COVID-19 lockdown. Factors such as age, consumption of information about COVID-19 and physical activity seem to have an important impact on the evolution of psychological symptoms.

Theta and gamma connectivity is linked with affective and cognitive symptoms in Parkinson's disease,"Background: The progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) can often exacerbate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and/or cognitive impairment. In this study, we explore the possibility that multiple brain network responses are associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment in PD. This association is likely to provide insights into a single multivariate relationship, where common affective symptoms occurring in PD cohorts are related with alterations to electrophysiological response. Methods: 70 PD patients and 21 healthy age-matched controls (HC) participated in a high-density electroencephalography (EEG) study. Functional connectivity differences between PD and HC groups of oscillatory activity at rest and during completion of an emotion-cognition task were examined to identify key brain oscillatory activities. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was applied to identify a putative multivariate relationship between connectivity patterns and affective symptoms in PD groups. Results: A CCA analysis identified a single mode of co-variation linking theta and gamma connectivity with affective symptoms in PD groups. Increases in frontotemporal gamma, frontal and parietal theta connectivity were related with increased anxiety and cognitive impairment. Decreases in temporal region theta and frontoparietal gamma connectivity were associated with higher depression ratings and PD patient age. Limitations: This study only reports on optimal dosage of dopaminergic treatment (‘on’ state) in PD and did not investigate at “off” medication”. Conclusions: Theta and gamma connectivity during rest and task-states are linked to affective and cognitive symptoms within fronto-temporo-parietal networks, suggesting a potential assessment avenue for understanding brain-behaviour associations in PD with electrophysiological task paradigms.

"Psychological distress associated with COVID-19 quarantine: Latent profile analysis, outcome prediction and mediation analysis","Background: Mental health of the population during COVID-19 quarantine could be at risk. Previous studies in short quarantines, found mood-related and anxiety symptomatology. Here we aimed to characterize the subtypes of psychological distress associated with quarantine, assess its prevalence, explore risk/protective factors, and possible mechanisms. Methods: Online cross-sectional data ( n = 4408) was collected during the Argentine quarantine, between 1st-17th April 2020 along a small replication study ( n = 644). Psychological distress clusters were determined using latent profile analysis on a wide-range of symptoms using the complete Brief-Symptom Inventory-53. Multinomial and Elastic-net regression were performed to identify risk/protective factors among trait-measures (Personality and Resilience) and state-measures (COVID-19 related fear and coping-skills). Results: Three latent-classes defined by symptom severity level were identified. The majority of individuals were classified in the mild (40.9%) and severe classes (41.0%). Participants reported elevated symptoms of Phobic-Anxiety (41.3%), Anxiety (31.8%), Depression (27.5%), General-Distress (27.1%), Obsession-Compulsion (25.1%) and Hostility (13.7%). Logistic-regressions analyses mainly revealed that women, young individuals, having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or trauma, having high levels of trait-neuroticism and COVID-related fear, were those at greater risk of psychological distress. In contrast, adults, being married, exercising, having upper-class income, having high levels of trait-resilience and coping-skills, were the most protected. Mediation analysis, showed that state-measures mediated the association between trait-measures and class-membership. Conclusions: Quarantine was associated intense psychological distress. Attention should be given to COVID-19-related fear and coping-skills as they act as potential mediators in emotional suffering during quarantine.

Comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms and frailty among older adults: Findings from the West China health and aging trend study,"Background: Depression and anxiety are two common mental disorders in older people. Studies have reported that depression is strongly associate with frailty, but few studies focus on anxiety disorder and comorbid two mental disorders. In this study, we aimed to identify associations between comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms with frailty in older adults. Methods: 4,103 community-dwellings adults aged 60 and older from the baseline of the West China Health and Aging Trend (WCHAT) study were included. Frailty was measured by the Fried frailty phenotype criteria. The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) assessed for depressive and anxiety symptoms with a cut-off value of 5. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore the association between different depressive and anxiety status and frailty. Results: 8.7% of old adults suffered comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms in the present study. The prevalence of pre-frailty and frailty was 47.0% and 6.7%, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, individuals with comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms had higher odds of being pre-frail (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.41, 2.45) and frail (OR = 7.03, 95% CI = 4.48, 11.05) compared to those without depressive and anxiety symptoms. In the comorbidity group, those with severe comorbid symptoms also had higher prevalence of pre-frailty and frailty. Limitations: Depressive and anxiety symptom assessments were based on screening tools. Conclusions: This study suggested comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms were associated with frailty among Chinese older adults. Further efforts to screen and target depression and anxiety comorbidity may be warranted.

Prevalence and correlates of somatization in anxious individuals in a Chinese online crisis intervention during COVID-19 epidemic,"Background: Somatization is a common comorbidity in anxious people. From January 31 to February 2, 2020, a high prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety was detected due to COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and correlates of somatization among Chinese participants with anxiety receiving online crisis interventions from Feb 14 to Mar 29 during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: A total of 1134 participants who participated in online crisis interventions completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and demographic questions online. Somatization was defined as the average score of each item ≥ 2 in SCL-90 somatization subscale. Moderate to severe anxiety was defined as a score ≥ 10 in the GAD-7 scale. Results: Among all participants, 8.0% reported moderate to severe anxiety and 7.4% reported somatization. After March 1, the prevalence of anxiety with or without somatization did not significantly change (both p &gt; 0.05), while the prevalence of somatization increased significantly ( p &lt; 0.01). Logistic regression analysis indicated that somatization was associated with chronic disease history (with an odds ratio of 4.80) and female gender (with an odds ratio of 0.33). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the history of chronic diseases is associated with somatization in individuals with anxiety, indicating some stress-related mechanisms. Chinese men in crisis intervention need more attention because they are more likely to report anxiety comorbid somatization.

Antenatal depression and anxiety across pregnancy in urban South Africa,"Background: Depression and anxiety in pregnancy have negative consequences for women and their offspring. High adversity places pregnant women at increased mental health risk, yet there is a dearth of longitudinal research in these settings. Little is known about the pathways by which these problems emerge or persist in pregnancy. Methods: Women were enrolled in a prospective pregnancy cohort in Soweto, South Africa (2014–2016) and assessed using validated measures (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale EPDS ≥ 13; State Trait Anxiety Index STAI ≥ 12) in early (T1) and later pregnancy (T2). Data was available for n = 649 women. Multinominal regression modelling was used to determine factors associated with transient versus persistent depression and anxiety across pregnancy. Cross-lagged panel modelling explored direction of effect between depression and anxiety, and stressors. Results: We found high rates of depression (T1: 27%; T2: 25%) and anxiety (T1: 15%; T2: 17%). Perceiving a partner made one's life harder increased risk of persistent depression (RR 5.92 95% CI [3.0–11.8] p &lt; 0.001); family stress increased risk for persistent anxiety (RR 1.71 95% CI [1.1–2.7] p = 0.027). We find evidence of a direct effect of early depression (T1) on later family stress (T2); and early family stress (T1) on later anxiety (T2). Limitations: We used screening measures of depression and anxiety rather than clinical interviews. Conclusions: Studies which focus only on late pregnancy may underestimate risk. Early identification, in the first trimester, is critical for prevention and treatment. Partner and family stressors are a key intervention target.

The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health &amp;amp; wellbeing among home-quarantined Bangladeshi students: A cross-sectional pilot study,"Background: COVID-19 is imposing threat both on physical and mental health since its outbreak. Bangladesh adopted lockdown strategy with potential consequences on day to day life, mental and physical health and this study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing among Bangladeshi students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between 9th and 23rd April 2020 among 505 college and university students. Data was collected by using online questionnaire including DASS 21 and IES. Descriptive analysis and bivariate linear regression were performed to examine the association of variables. Results: 28.5 % of the respondents had stress, 33.3% anxiety, 46.92% depression from mild to extremely severe, according to DASS 21 and 69.31% had event-specific distress from mild to severe in terms of severity according to IES. Perceiving physical symptoms as COVID-19 was significantly associated with DASS stress subscale (B = 3.71, 95% CI: 1.01 to 6.40), DASS anxiety subscale (B = 3.95, 95% CI: 1.95 to 5.96), DASS depression subscale (B = 3.82, 95% CI: 0.97 to 6.67) and IES scale (B = 7.52, 95% CI: 3.58 to 11.45). Additionally, fear of infection, financial uncertainty, inadequate food supply, absence of physical exercise and limited or no recreational activity had significant association with stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic symptoms. Conclusion: This COVID-19 outbreak imposes psychological consequences on people to a great extent which requires attention from the concerned authorities to cope with this situation mentally. The perception about the outbreak can also play a big role in psychological impact.

Sleep conditions associate with anxiety and depression symptoms among pregnant women during the epidemic of covid-19 in shenzhen,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women often encounter psychiatric symptoms and declined sleep quality as pregnancy proceeds. The associations between sleep conditions and anxious and depressive symptoms among pregnant women remained to be investigated, particularly during the epidemic of COVID-19. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey on pregnant women was conducted at the time period of fast increasing cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were applied to detect anxious and depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regressions models were established to explore the associations of sleep conditions with psychological symptoms. RESULTS: In total, 751 pregnant women were enrolled, with a mean age of 30.51 years (Standard deviation: 4.28). Overall, 82.7% of the respondents considered low risk of being infected by COVID-19. The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 among pregnant women were 13.4% and 35.4%, respectively, but most of which were mild. Variables referred to poor sleep conditions were strongly associated with anxious and depressive symptoms, including random or late time of going to bed, difficulty in falling sleep, short sleep duration, and ordinary or poor subjective sleep quality. LIMITATIONS: Non-random sample restricted generalization of our findings to the whole population of pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Our research revealed a notable proportion of the pregnant women who exhibited mild anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. Targeted interventions in improving sleep conditions might help alleviate gestational anxious and depressive symptoms.

Effects of mask wearing on anxiety of teachers affected by covid-19: A large cross-sectional study in china,"OBJECTIVE: There is a limited information on mask wearing in relation to anxiety. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between mask wearing practice and the risk of anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic among teachers in Henan province, China. METHODS: We enrolled 88,611 teachers in an online cross-sectional survey across three cities of Henan Province in China. A total of 94.75% of study participants completed an online questionnaire between February 4, 2020 and February 12, 2020. Mask wearing practice was defined according to its type, how it is worn, and the behavior exhibited in relation to wearing a mask. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool (GAD-7) to assess anxiety levels among study participants. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate the association between mask wearing practice and anxiety by using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 67,357 registered teachers (25.91% men) were included in this study. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants who knew the wrong type of mask had 17% increased odds of having anxiety compared to those who knew the proper type (Aor = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.11–1.24). Odds for anxiety were higher for teachers who did not know the proper way of wearing mask compared to those who knew it properly (aOR = 1.18; 95%CI: 1.07–1.30). Not adhering to proper behavior of mask wearing was associated with 39% increased odds for anxiety (aOR = 1.39; 95%CI: 1.18–1.64). The odds for anxiety for teachers who did not adhere to all the three parameters of proper mask wearing was about 2.55 times as much compared to those who reported full compliance to the parameters (aOR = 2.55; 95%CI: 1.22–5.35). We observed similar ORs on stratified analyses across gender and age groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that improper mask wearing is another important attribute that play a significant role in increasing the risk of anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic situation. However, these results should be considered as exploratory and hence interpreted with caution.

Mental health among college students during the covid-19 pandemic in china: A 2-wave longitudinal survey,"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence supports a clear association between COVID-19 pandemic and mental health. However, little is known about the longitudinal course of psychopathology in young adults at different stages of the pandemic. METHODS: This large-scale, longitudinal, population-based survey was conducted among college students in China. The rates of three mental health problems (acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms), and their change patterns at two phases of the pandemic (early vs under-control) were measured. Predictors of changes in mental health symptoms were examined utilizing multivariate regression. RESULTS: Among the 164,101 college students who participated in the first wave survey (T1=during onset of outbreak), 68,685 (41.9%) completed a follow-up survey (T2=during remission). In the follow-up survey, the prevalence of probable acute stress (T1: 34.6%; T2: 16.4%) decreased, while the rates of depressive (T1: 21.6%; T2: 26.3%) and anxiety symptoms (T1: 11.4%; T2: 14.7%) increased. Senior students, with suspected or conformed cases in their community and COVID-19 related worries (all AORs &gt; 1.20, ps &lt; 0.001) were found to have a higher risk of developing mental health problems in at least one wave. Less physical exercise, low perceived social support, and a dysfunctional family were found to negatively impact psychological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms have been prevalent among college students during the COVID-19 epidemic, and showed a significant increase after the initial stage of the outbreak. Some college students, especially those with the risk factors noted above, exhibited persistent or delayed symptoms.

A transdiagnostic examination of anxiety and stress on executive function outcomes in disorders with social impairment,"BACKGROUND: Executive function (EF) difficulties characterise a number of psychiatric conditions and EF impairment may be a predisposing factor and/or consequence of anxiety and stress. The aim of the study was to examine EF factors in a mixed clinical cohort (Autism Spectrum Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder) characterised by social impairment and investigate the influence of trait anxiety and state-based depression, anxiety and stress. METHODS: In Study 1, a factor analysis identified EF and non-EF latent factor structures (N=205). In Study 2, (N=137) multiple regression analyses investigated the association between trait anxiety and state based depression, anxiety and stress, on EF and non-EF cognitive domains and on the two composite indices of the Behavioural Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). RESULTS: Trait anxiety was associated with better performance on neuropsychological measures of EF while state-based stress was associated with lower EF performance. A dissociation was observed between trait anxiety and state stress on the two behavioural indices of the BRIEF. Depression, anxiety and stress did not predict performance on non-EF cognitive domains. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional design precludes cause-effect conclusions, further only self-report measures of affect were utilised and our performance measures of EF did not include a working memory test. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that trait anxiety and state-based stress influence EF processes across disorders with social impairment. The transdiagnostic efficacy of this finding can facilitate remediation strategies, it may also contribute to individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder gaining better access to mental health services.

"A comparison of two measures to screen for mental health symptoms in pregnancy and early postpartum: The matthey generic mood questionnaire and the depression, anxiety, stress scales short-form","BACKGROUND: The Matthey Generic Mood Questionnaire (MGMQ) provides a rapid screen of clinically significant emotional difficulties in adults. This study aimed to investigate associations between the MGMQ and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales short-form (DASS-21) and how well the MGMQ detects women scoring high on the DASS-21 in pregnancy and 1 and 2 years postpartum. METHODS: Pregnant Australian, English-speaking women were recruited from 10 maternity hospitals across two states (for the “right@home” trial, N=729). Prioritized for their experience of social adversity (2 or more of 10 risk factors), they completed the 2-item MGMQ and 21-item DASS-21 in pregnancy and at 1 and 2 years postpartum. DASS-21 Total and subscale scores were classified “high” based on (a) normed percentiles for top 15% and (b) clinical cut-points. RESULTS: The MGMQ and DASS-21 were completed within 7 days of each other by 296 (41%) women in pregnancy, 625 (86%) at 1 year and 573 (79%) at 2 years. Associations between the measures were weak-to-moderate in pregnancy and moderate-to-strong in the postpartum years. Most women scoring “high” on the DASS-21 could be identified with various thresholds of the MGMQ. LIMITATIONS: Pregnant women with 0 or 1 risk factor were excluded; the DASS-21 is not a perinatal specific measure nor a gold standard diagnostic tool. CONCLUSIONS: The MGMQ and DASS-21 appeared to assess overlapping but distinct constructs of mental health. These findings can help clinicians and researchers decide whether to use the MGMQ, and which balance of sensitivity, specificity and correct classification will suit their needs.

Social anxiety and depression stigma among adolescents,"BACKGROUND: The stigma associated with mental disorders in adolescence has a range of detrimental consequences, negatively impacting help-seeking behaviours and quality of life. Social anxiety typically has its onset during adolescence, but the associated stigma is not well understood. This study was designed to improve understanding of social anxiety and depression stigma in adolescence by examining demographic and personal variables that predict them both. METHODS: Three hundred and fifteen adolescents (150 males, 165 females), from 2nd and 4th year of secondary school (mean ages 13.92 and 15.92 years respectively), completed the Peer Mental Health Stigmatization Scale to measure both personal and perceived stigma towards vignettes depicting social anxiety and depression. They also answered demographic questions and completed the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents. RESULTS: Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that gender predicted both personal and perceived stigma towards depression and personal stigma towards social anxiety. Males scored higher on measures of personal stigma whereas females had higher scores on perceived stigma. Ability to accurately identify symptoms described in a vignette, predicted lower personal stigma towards social anxiety and higher perceived stigma towards depression. Depression was more stigmatized than social anxiety. LIMITATIONS: The study used vignettes to represent individuals with depression and social anxiety so participant responses may not reflect their behaviour towards real peers. CONCLUSIONS: Findings emphasise the importance of separately considering personal and perceived stigma for each condition and highlight gender differences in stigma responses that need to be considered in intervention design.

Distinct grey matter volume alterations in adult patients with panic disorder and social anxiety disorder: A systematic review and voxel-based morphometry meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The paradox of similar diagnostic criteria but potentially different neuropathologies in panic disorder (PD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) needs to be clarified. METHODS: We performed a qualitative systematic review and a quantitative whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) meta-analysis with an anisotropic effect-size version of seed-based D mapping (AES-SDM) to explore whether the alterations of grey matter volume (GMV) in PD are similar to or different from those in SAD, together with potential confounding factors. RESULTS: A total of thirty-one studies were eligible for inclusion, eighteen of which were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to the respective healthy controls (HC), qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed smaller cortical-subcortical GMVs in PD patients in brain areas including the prefrontal and temporal-parietal cortices, striatum, thalamus and brainstem, predominantly right-lateralized regions, and larger GMVs in the prefrontal and temporal-parietal-occipital cortices, and smaller striatum and thalamus in SAD patients. Quantitatively, the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) deficit was specifically implicated in PD patients, whereas left striatum-thalamus deficits were specific to SAD patients, without shared GMV alterations in both disorders. Sex, the severity of clinical symptoms, psychiatric comorbidity, and concomitant medication use were negatively correlated with smaller regional GMV alterations in PD patients. CONCLUSION: PD and SAD may represent different anxiety sub-entities at the neuroanatomical phenotypes level, with different specific neurostructural deficits in the right IFG of PD patients, and the left striatum and thalamus of SAD patients. This combination of differences and specificities can potentially be used to guide the development of diagnostic biomarkers for these disorders.

The role of post-loss anxiety in the development of depressive symptoms and complicated grief symptoms: A longitudinal sem study,"BACKGROUND: Though grief, anxiety, and depression often co-occur, existing evidence mostly focus on any two of them at a time. Our study examined the relationships among the three clusters of symptoms. METHODS: A Chinese community sample of 101 bereaved individuals participated at T1. We utilized Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling (BSEM) to conduct cross-lagged analyses on three-wave panel data (T1 at one-month post-loss, T2 at four-months, and T3 at seven-months). RESULTS: BSEM findings confirmed the presence of distinctive developmental paths for complicated grief (CG), anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Three simplex models showed that anxiety, CG symptoms, and depressive symptoms maintained high consistency. In cross-lagged models, anxiety at T1 was a significant predictor of depressive symptoms (standardized estimate B=0.386*) and CG symptoms (standardized estimate B=0.300*) at T2. The remaining positive directions (0.338*, 0.256*) in the final model suggest the important role of anxiety at early bereavement, while at a later stage, T2 CG contributed to depressive symptoms at T3 (0.356*). LIMITATIONS: In addition to attrition, the overall sample size was limited. Data were based on self-report. Future research with repeated measures and Bayesian informative priors would be more useful to establish relational patterns of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In our models, the reduction in anxiety symptoms contributed to the development of depressive and CG symptoms, and these results should be replicated. Theories of mechanisms underlying post-loss anxiety can be explored as a potential means of reducing later symptoms.

Familial aggregation of anxiety disorder subtypes and anxious temperament in the nimh family study of affective spectrum disorders,"BACKGROUND: Evidence from family and twin studies suggests that mood and anxiety disorders, and related temperamental factors may share common etiologic factors. We examine the familial aggregation and coaggregation of anxiety disorder subtypes and anxiety-related temperamental traits, and their association with mood disorders. METHODS: A total of 477 probands and 549 first-degree adult relatives from a large community based family study of affective spectrum disorders completed semi-structured diagnostic interviews and self-reported assessments of temperamental traits including: negative affectivity on the ‘Positive and Negative Affect Schedule’ (PANAS), neuroticism anxiety on the ‘Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire’ (ZKPQ), and anxiety sensitivity on the ‘Anxiety Sensitivity Index’ (ASI). RESULTS: The anxiety-related temperamental traits of negative affectivity, neuroticism anxiety and anxiety sensitivity had significant familial specificity, even after controlling for comorbid mood and anxiety disorders in probands and relatives. Yet, these traits in probands did not predict anxiety disorders in relatives. Although some anxiety subtypes were familial, there were no longer familial links between anxiety disorder subtypes (generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety or panic disorder) after controlling for mood disorder subtypes in probands and relatives. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional interviews were used to estimate disorders, and self-report measures were used for temperamental traits. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm previous research regarding familial overlap between anxiety subtypes and mood disorders, however their shared liability cannot be fully explained by anxiety-related temperamental traits. These findings suggest that anxiety-related temperamental traits may indicate a vulnerability for mood and anxiety disorders or a potential consequence of these conditions.

Expressive flexibility and anxiety,"BACKGROUND: The ability to flexibly enhance and suppress emotional expressions plays an important role in emotion regulation and the fostering of social connections. Deficits in expressive flexibility have been linked with posttraumatic stress disorder and prolonged grief reactions. Previous studies have suggested that the ability to respond flexibly in the context of an immediate threat (a nonconscious prime) may be important. In this study we sought to extend this work by examining the impact of individual differences in anxiety on expressive flexibility. METHODS: Eighty four participants with high and low trait anxiety viewed blocks of negative images with instructions to enhance or suppress emotional expressions. Across blocks one of three nonconscious primes (threat, safety, neutral) appeared before each image. Observers blind to the study's design rated participants’ emotional expressiveness. RESULTS: Repeated Measures Anova's showed that high trait anxiety was associated with lower levels in enhancement ability. Further, low trait anxiety was associated with less emotion in response to the threat prime irrespective of expressive instruction. LIMITATIONS: This study was cross-sectional which precludes causal relationships. Participants were drawn from a student population and the generalizability to other populations will need to be established CONCLUSIONS: This study identified trait anxiety as factor that may contribute to expressive flexibility deficits. High trait anxiety is a feature of many clinical conditions. Strategies to target expressive flexibility may relevant to a range of anxiety related clinical conditions.

Do people with elevated social anxiety respond differently to digital and face-to-face communications? Two daily diary studies with null effects,"Background: Retrospective studies have found that people with elevated social anxiety (SA) show a preference for digital/online communication, which may be due to perceptions of enhanced emotional safety. Whether these individuals prefer digital compared to face-to-face communication and experience emotional benefits naturalistically remains unclear. Methods: We recruited college students ( N = 125) and community adults ( N = 303) with varying levels of SA and sampled their emotions during digital and face-to-face communication using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) (Study 1) and a day reconstruction method (DRM) (Study 2). We preregistered our hypotheses (https://osf.io/e4y7x/). Results: Results from both studies showed that SA did not predict the likelihood of engaging in digital compared to face-to-face communication, and SA was associated with less positive and more negative emotions regardless of the communication medium. Study 2 showed that whether digital communication was synchronous (e.g., in real time via phone/video chat) or asynchronous (e.g., texting/instant messaging) did not impact the association between SA and emotions. Limitations: EMA and DRM methods, despite their many advantages, may be suboptimal for assessing the occurrence of digital communication behaviors relative to more objective methods (e.g., passively collecting smartphone communication data). Using event-contingent responding may have also yielded more reports of digital communication, thus strengthening our power to detect small, cross-level interaction effects. Conclusions: These results challenge beliefs that digital/online communication provides a source of emotional safety for people with elevated SA and suggests a greater need to address SA-related emotional impairments across digital communication platforms.

"Role of autobiographical memory in the impact of MBCT on dysfunctional attitudes, depressive symptoms and anxiety in bipolar I patients","Background: The literature suggests that cognitive reactivity in bipolar patients can increase relapse vulnerability, is enhanced by depressive mood and dysfunctional attitudes, and could be improved with MBCT. Autobiographical memory (AM) could be involved in cognitive reactivity, and improved with MBCT training. This study aims to investigate the effect of MBCT for bipolar patients on depressive and anxious symptoms, dysfunctional attitudes and AM, and the predictive versus mediating role of AM in the impact of MBCT on clinical symptoms. Methods: Sixty-two outpatients diagnosed with bipolar I disorder were assigned to MBCT and were compared to 37 bipolar patients on a waiting list. Affective symptoms and dysfunctional attitudes were explored using self-report inventories (BDI, BAI, DAS) and AM was assessed using the Autobiographical Memory Test. Results: Patients receiving MBCT demonstrated significantly decreased depressive symptoms, dysfunctional attitudes, overgeneral memories and omissions, and increased specific memories. General AM and omissions at baseline respectively predicted lower anxiety and dysfunctional attitudes improvement following therapy, but the improvement of AM did not explain the impact of MBCT on depression and dysfunctional attitudes improvement. Limits: Further studies should consider patients’ therapeutic adherence and mechanisms involved in MBCT in order to better apprehend how MBCT may reduce dysfunctional attitudes and improve AM in bipolar patients. Conclusion: Results are consistent with the hypothesis that MBCT reduces cognitive reactivity and AM impairment in bipolar disorders. Findings suggest that AM training prior to MBCT may influence MBCT efficacy, but that MBCT efficacy on AM and clinical symptoms are non-related phenomena.

Convergent evidence suggests that ketamine may be effective in targeting measures of anhedonia in adults with treatment resistant depression (TRD). Methods: This retrospective, post-hoc analysis included 203 (x̄ = 45 ± 14.6 years of age) patients receiving four infusions of intravenous (IV) ketamine at a community-based clinic. The primary outcome measure was change in anhedonia severity, as measured by the Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS). Secondary measures sought to determine if improvement on the SHAPS mediated the effect of repeated IV ketamine infusions on symptoms of depression and suicidal ideations, as measured by the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report 16-Item (QIDS-SR16) and anxiety, as measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Results: After adjusting for age, sex, primary diagnosis, concomitant medication, body mass index, and baseline depression severity, there was a statistically significant reduction in symptoms of anhedonia with IV ketamine treatment ( F (2, 235.6) = 31.6, p &lt; 0.001). Improvements in depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and anxiety symptoms with repeated-dose IV ketamine were significantly partially mediated by reduction in anhedonic severity. Moreover, the combination of number of infusions received and change in anhedonic severity accounted for 26% of the variance in depressive score improvements. Limitations: This is a post-hoc analysis of retrospective data and lacks a control group. Conclusion: Ketamine was effective in improving measures of anhedonia in this large, well-characterized community-based sample of adults with TRD. Improvements in anhedonia also partially mediated the significant improvement in depressive symptoms, suicidality, and anxiety.

Interpretation bias in social anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Interpretation bias, which involves interpreting ambiguous social events negatively and catastrophising even mildly negative social events, has been suggested as a key maintenance factor of Social Anxiety Disorder. Although some individual studies and narrative reviews have demonstrated a role for negative interpretation bias in social anxiety (disorder), findings have been mixed. Given the lack of a quantitative synthesis of the evidence, the current systematic review and meta-analysis examined the strength of the relationship between interpretation bias and social anxiety. It also investigated potential moderators of this relationship (i.e., types of measures and stimuli, samples, and study designs). Methods: Five databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and CINAHL) were searched. Of 46 studies identified, 44 were suitable for meta-analysis ( N = 3859). Results: There was a large effect for the relationship between social anxiety and interpretation bias ( g = 0.83). Types of measures (subjective versus objective) and stimuli (verbal versus visual) were identified as significant moderators, with subjective measures and verbal stimuli particularly adept at capturing interpretation bias in socially anxious individuals. Limitations:: The effect sizes displayed significant heterogeneity between studies, which likely reflects some publication bias, and thus, the overall effect size may be inflated. Conclusion: Findings may help to refine clinical models and interventions for Social Anxiety Disorder, which in turn may maximise evidence-based interventions that target negative interpretation bias in this disorder.

Is there an association between anxiety and depression prior to and during pregnancy and gestational diabetes? An analysis of the Born in Bradford cohort,"Background: Anxiety and depression are common in women with gestational diabetes but it is not clear whether they are more likely to precede the onset of gestational diabetes or to co-occur with it. Our aims were to compare the strength of association between common mental disorders of anxiety and depression (i) before pregnancy and (ii) during pregnancy in women with and without gestational diabetes. Methods: the sample comprised 12,239 women with 13,539 pregnancies from the UK's Born in Bradford cohort. Gestational diabetes was diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Indicators of common mental disorders were obtained from linked primary care records. Multivariable robust Poisson and logistic regression were employed. Multiple imputation by chained equations was implemented to handle missing data. Models were adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity, education and obstetric complications. Analyses of common mental disorders during pregnancy were additionally adjusted for maternal smoking, pre-pregnancy BMI, multiple pregnancy and common mental disorders prior to pregnancy. Results: there was no evidence for an association between common mental disorders prior to pregnancy and gestational diabetes (adjusted RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.80,1.15) or between gestational diabetes and common mental disorders during pregnancy (adjusted OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.73,1.12). Limitations: high levels of deprivation and multi-ethnic composition of the cohort may limit generalisability of these findings to other populations. Conclusions: routine primary care records did not identify an increased risk of gestational diabetes in women with common mental disorders prior to pregnancy or of gestational diabetes in women with common mental disorders during pregnancy.

COVID-19 infection outbreak increases anxiety level of general public in China: Involved mechanisms and influencing factors,"Background: COVID-19 outbreak happened last December in China and is still continuing. Here, we reported effects of COVID-19 outbreak on the mood of general public and ascertained impacts of psychosocial factors on the plague-related emotional measures. Methods: During Feb. 4-6, 2020, a self-reported questionnaire Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was disseminated to general public via Wechat, along with a sociodemographic information sheet. BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety in subgroups of respondents were compared. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were done for correlation analysis and to identify factors predictive of anxiety. Results: Averaged BAI score of all respondents is higher than those of general public in two previous studies. The people quarantined for probable COVID-19 infection presented higher BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety relative to non-quarantined respondents. People in high epidemic area showed higher BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety compared to those in low epidemic area. Significant associations existed between anxiety level of the respondents and each of the investigated factors, except for gender. Quarantine was the predictor with a highest OR, followed by divorced/widow. The other factors showed smaller but significant effects on the anxiety level of respondents. Limitations: This cross-sectional study was unable to track the emotional changes in the respondents over time. It had a relatively small sample and involved some of emotional measures only. Conclusion: These data are of help in planning psychological interventions for the different subpopulations in general public during and after COVID-19 outbreak.

Predictors of heart-focused anxiety in patients with stable heart failure,"Background: It has been shown that heart-focused anxiety raises the risk of adverse outcomes in patients with heart disease. Yet, there is a lack of studies investigating this association. We aim at identifying predictors of heart-focused anxiety in patients with stable heart failure to facilitate the identification of individuals with increased risk for adverse outcomes. Methods: We assessed heart-focused anxiety and a set of psychological, demographic/lifestyle, and medical/laboratory variables in a sample of 107 patients with stable chronic heart failure to identify predictors of heart-focused anxiety. Results: Heart-focused anxiety was best predicted by self-reported anxiety and quality of life. Moreover, the personality dimension conscientiousness as well as physical activity, and the laboratory value of renal function, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), had predictive validity for heart-focused anxiety. Limitations: The present findings should be replicated in a longitudinal design with a less selective sample including more women and participants with more divers ethnical backgrounds. Conclusion: Heart-focused anxiety is predictable by psychological and lifestyle variables. eGFR, as a laboratory marker for renal function, showed also predictive validity. The awareness of such predictors may help detecting comorbid underlying heart-focused anxiety and thus identify patients with an increased need for psychological care.

"Financial threat, hardship and distress predict depression, anxiety and stress among the unemployed youths: A Bangladeshi multi-city study","Introduction: Unemployment has a contributory role in the development of mental health problems and in Bangladesh there is increasing unemployment, particularly among youth. Consequently, the present study investigated depression, anxiety, and stress among recent graduates in a multi-city study across the country. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 988 Bangladeshi graduate jobseekers in six major cities of the country between August to November 2019. The measures included socio-demographics and life-style factors, study and job-related information, Economic Hardship Questionnaire, Financial Threat Scale, Financial Well-Being Scale, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Results: Depression, anxiety and stress rates among the present sample were 81.1% ( n = 801), 61.5% ( n = 608) and 64.8% ( n = 640) respectively. Factors related to gender, age, socioeconomic conditions, educational background, lack of extra-curricular activities, and high screen activity were significant risk factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. Structural equation modeling indicated that (while controlling for age, daily time spent on sleep study, and social media use), financial threat was moderately positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress. Financial hardship was weakly positively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress, whereas financial wellbeing was weakly negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Limitations: Due to the nature of the present study (i.e., cross-sectional study) and sampling method (i.e., convenience sampling), determining causality between the variables is not possible. Conclusions: The present results emphasized the important detrimental role of financial troubles on young people's mental health by showing that financial problems among unemployed youth predict elevated psychiatric distress in both men and women.

"Role of anxiety, depression and neurocognition for cognitive behavioural therapy pre-therapy skills in people living with dementia, older and younger adults","Background: Anxiety and depression are common in people living with dementia (PLWD) and Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) seems to be one of the few efficacious interventions. However, PLWD's ability to engage with CBT has been questioned due to the presumed impact of neurocognitive impairment on core skills necessary to engage with CBT (pre-therapy skills). Here, we (i) compare CBT pre-therapy skills in PLWD to older and younger adults (OA, YA), (ii) examine potential confounders and mediators and (iii) explore associations of neurocognition, anxiety and depression with pre-therapy skills in PLWD. Methods: Pre-therapy skills were compared between PLWD ( n = 102), OA ( n = 77) and YA ( n = 56). Structural equation modelling was used to assess mediators and confounders of differences in pre-therapy skills between groups. Spearman's rank correlations were used to examine the relationship of pre-therapy skills with neurocognition and mood in PLWD. Results: Group differences in pre-therapy skills were found, following the pattern YA &gt; OA &gt; PLWD. Neurocognition mediated the difference between OA and PLWD. In PLWD, language was associated with performance on all skills. There was little evidence that anxiety or depression contributed to variability in skill performance within PLWD. Limitations: Cross-sectional design limited ability to ascertain cause and effect. Pre-therapy skill measures have not been used in the context of actual CBT; consequently, their relationship with CBT outcomes needs to be established. Conclusions: PLWD may have a relative difficulty in CBT pre-therapy skills. Yet, there seems to be substantial variability of skill level, independent of mood. Therefore, mild dementia does not necessarily preclude CBT readiness.

"Depression, anxiety and health status across different BMI classes: A representative study in Germany","Background: Changes in body mass index (BMI) over the course of one's lifetime are related to the development of mental disorders. In the current study we compared symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety as well as general health status in the four BMI-classes: underweight, normal weight, overweight and obesity. Furthermore, mediator role of general health status on the relationship between BMI and depression and generalized anxiety was analyzed. Methods: A representative sample (random-route sampling) of the German population ( N = 2350) was investigated in a cross-sectional survey by measuring the three questionnaires PHQ-9, GAD-7 and EQ-5D-5L. Results: The results showed significant differences between the four BMI-classes in all three questionnaires. Individuals with obesity demonstrated higher values in depression, anxiety and general health compared to the three other BMI-classes. However, there was no U-shaped association between BMI and depression, anxiety and health-related quality of life. Regarding to the mediation analysis, general health status fully mediated the association between BMI, depressive symptoms as well as generalized anxiety symptoms. Limitations: The assessment of the three factors depression, anxiety and general health status were measured by questionnaires, but no clinical diagnoses can be provided. Conclusions: Evidence supports that individuals with obesity have an increased risk for depression and anxiety as well as lower general health. Further research on potential intervention and strategies in public health policies is needed to be able to target the developing of mental disorders in individuals with obesity. Taking their general health status into account is also of great importance.

Maternal psychological distress &amp;amp; mental health service use during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: Mental health problems are increasingly recognized as a significant and concerning secondary effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research on previous epidemics/pandemics suggest that families, particularly mothers, may be at increased risk, but this population has yet to be examined. The current study (1) described prevalence rates of maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms from an online convenience sample during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) identified risk and protective factors for elevated symptoms, and (3) described current mental health service use and barriers. Methods: Participants ( N = 641) were mothers of children age 0–8 years, including expectant mothers. Mothers completed an online survey assessing mental health, sociodemographic information, and COVID-19-related variables. Results: Clinically-relevant depression was indicated in 33.16%, 42.55%, and 43.37% of mothers of children age 0–18 months, 18 months to 4 years, and 5 to 8 years, respectively. Prevalence of anxiety was 36.27%, 32.62%, and 29.59% for mothers across age groups, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated significant associations between risk factors and depression/anxiety across child age groups. Limitations: Cross-sectional data was used to describe maternal mental health problems during COVID-19 limiting the ability to make inferences about the long-term impact of maternal depression and anxiety on family well-being. Conclusions: Maternal depression and anxiety appear to be elevated in the context of COVID-19 compared to previously reported population norms. Identified risk factors for depression and anxiety across different child age ranges can inform targeted early intervention strategies to prevent long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family well-being and child development.

Development of the Macquarie Anxiety Behavioural Scale (MABS): A parent measure to assess anxiety in children and adolescents including young people with autism spectrum disorder,"Objective: This study examined measurement variance for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale - Parent Form (SCAS-P; Spence, 1999). In addition, we developed and evaluated a new parent report measure for anxiety (Macquarie Anxiety Behavioural Scale; MABS). Method: The sample consisted of 734 parents of children aged 3–19 years (i) who were seeking help for their child's anxiety, (ii) who had received a diagnosis of ASD, or (iii) from the community. Results: Evidence for measurement variance of the SCAS-P and MABS was found, revealing different factor structures between the ASD and non-ASD groups. MIMIC modelling showed that the scales performed significantly different across ASD and non-ASD groups. Differential item functioning on a number of the SCAS-P and MABS items was also found. Limitations: This study relied on parent report of symptoms and of community acquired diagnoses of ASD. Conclusion: The MABS is a new parent measure to assess anxiety in children and adolescents and the proposed factor structure produced a reasonably good fit for the data. Similar to the SCAS-P, ASD was found to impact on some of the MABS items indicating that ASD influences parental responding. Eighteen MABS items showed measurement invariance across the anxious and ASD groups and can be considered suitable items for the assessment of anxiety in ASD.

Panic and generalized anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi people: An online pilot survey early in the outbreak,"Background: Precisely how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health worldwide is currently poorly understood. The study aimed to assess panic and anxiety among individuals in the general Bangladesh population early in the COVID-19 outbreak. Methodology: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 29 to April 06, 2020, involving 1311 community-dwelling individuals aged between 13 and 63 years and residing in Bangladesh. After providing informed consent, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables and using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) to assess panic and anxiety symptomatology, respectively. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: Estimates of panic and generalized anxiety were 79.6%, and 37.3%, respectively. Factors statistically predicting panic were being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, and living with a joint family. Factors statistically predicting generalized anxiety were being female, being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, being a non-governmental employee. Limitations: As this study employs the cross-sectional and self-reported measures, causal inferences cannot be indicated. Sampling biases may have influenced estimates of panic and generalized anxiety. Conclusion: Sizable proportions of respondents reported panic and generalized anxiety in the setting of COVID-19. The findings suggest the need for additional surveillance of panic and generalized anxiety through longitudinal assessments. Evidence-based intervention programs and supportive services to address panic and generalized anxiety appear important for Bangladeshi individuals during this stage (and likely later stages) of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pregnancy-related anxiety among Chinese pregnant women in mid-late pregnancy under the two-child policy and its significant correlates,"Background: Pregnancy-related anxiety (PRA) is a global public health concern. This study aims to understand the PRA among Chinese pregnant women at mid-late pregnancy and to explore the significant correlates. Methods: The Chinese PRA scale was used to measure PRA among 342 pregnant women from Zhejiang Province in China at their mid- and late- pregnancy respectively. Results: The participants aged from 21 to 42 years old, and their mean age was 30. 1 (SD = 4. 0). The average scores of the Chinese PRA scale at mid- and late- pregnancy were 1. 60 (SD = 0. 33) and 1. 58 (SD=0. 33) respectively. Unplanned pregnancy (mid-pregnancy: β = 0. 18, p &lt; 0. 001; late-pregnancy: β = 0. 11, p = 0. 024) and gender of the first child being male (mid-pregnancy:β = -0. 20, p = 0. 001; late-pregnancy: β = -0. 14, p = 0. 016) were significantly correlated with PRA among pregnant women at mid- and late- pregnancy. Living with parents-in-law was not associated with the PRA overall and domain scores. Limitations: This study was done among pregnant women at their mid-late pregnancy, and no follow-up was conducted at postpartum. The sample size of this study was relatively small which might affect the generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: The current study found that the correlates of PRA at mid- and late-pregnancy were generally similar. For future studies, special attention should be paid to pregnant women who are in the condition of unplanned pregnancy and those who already have a female child to relieve their anxiety levels.

In the original article, there were errors in the authors and affiliations lists. The correct authors and affiliations lists are given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-56963-030). Background: Although studies have suggested experiencing the epidemic of severe infectious diseases increased the prevalence of mental health problems, the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom in college students in China was unclear. Methods: A large cross-sectional online survey with 44,447 college students was conducted in Guangzhou, China. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) were used to define the anxiety and depression symptom, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom. Results: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR = 4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; P = 0.003), and suspected (OR = 2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; P = 0.023) cases in family members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of psychological knowledge and interventions than those without ( P &lt; 0.001). Limitations: All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire, and we did not evaluate the reliability and validity. Conclusions: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was relatively low in college students, but the COVID-19 epidemic-related factors might be associated with higher depression symptom risk.

"Comparative efficacy of add-on rTMS in treating the somatic and psychic anxiety symptoms of depression comorbid with anxiety in adolescents, adults, and elderly patients—A real-world clinical application","Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective adjuvant treatment for depression. Many patients with depression have comorbid anxiety symptoms. However, previous rTMS studies have focused on patients with depression, and often excluded comorbid anxiety. This real-world study aimed to investigate the comparative efficacy of add-on rTMS in treating the somatic and psychic anxiety symptoms of depression comorbid with anxiety in adolescents, adults and elderly patients. Methods: This study included 147 depression patients with anxiety symptoms who were treated with at least 10 sessions of rTMS. The symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. This was done to compare the improvement degree of add-on rTMS on somatic and psychic anxiety symptoms in adolescents, adults and elderly patients respectively. Results: Both somatic and psychic anxiety symptoms were significantly improved after the add-on rTMS in adolescents, adults and elderly patients. The improvement of somatic anxiety was better than that of psychic anxiety after rTMS treatment in elderly patients ( t 2w = 3.895, P &lt; 0.001; t 4w = 2.823, P = 0.008). Limitation: The overall sample was mostly composed of elderly patients, while adolescents and adult patients were fewer. Conclusions: The add-on rTMS treatment can improve somatic anxiety better than psychic anxiety in depression with anxiety symptoms, especially in elderly patients.

Properties of common anxiety scales among patients with bipolar disorder,"OBJECTIVES: Almost half of the patients with a bipolar disorder (BD) have anxiety disorder(s) (AD) during their lifetime, but feasible measures for all AD are few. Furthermore, cognitive impairments can compromise reliability of existing scales, since many are needed for full coverage. Thus, we investigated how reliably patients responded to anxiety scales and any symptom overlap to propose future improvements to anxiety assessments. METHODS: We collected 152 observations in patients with BD with the Clinically Useful Anxiety Outcome Scale, Social Phobia Inventory, Panic Disorder Severity Measurement, and Trauma Screening Questionnaire (in total, 57 items). The scales were analyzed as a set in a Rasch model. RESULTS: During our analyses, we found indication that BD outpatients had difficulty differentiating response options to 70% (40/57) of items which were rescored or deleted. Only one case was misfitting (-2.65±.41). In total, 22 items were locally dependent and one indicated misfit. The final model included 25-items and fit the Rasch model (χ2=35.92, DF=50, p=.93). The model was unidimensional, without losing appropriate associations with depression (r = 0.62), suicidality (r = 0.37), and hypomania (r= -0.01). LIMITATIONS: Bolstering the size of less frequent subgroups should be accomplished in future work. CONCLUSION: A unidimensional rather than categorical approach to severity of anxiety might be both useful and feasible in this population. Further development of screens is necessary to enable systematic screening and measurement of anxiety in BD.

Trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms from early pregnancy to six weeks postpartum and their risk factors—A longitudinal study,"Background: Few studies explored trajectories of depressive symptoms from early pregnancy and covered the whole perinatal period. This study aimed to explore the trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms, their heterogeneity of onsets and peaks, and relations to demographic and psychological factors. Method: A longitudinal study was conducted at two hospitals in China amongst 1,126 participants. Perinatal depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Demographic and psychological factors were collected by self-developed questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Women completing at least three depression screens (n = 879) were included. Latent Growth Curve Model and Growth Mixture Model were performed to identify the depression trajectories and logistic regression was used to analyse factors of trajectories. Results: Three trajectories were identified: 90.0% of women never presented with depressive symptoms (“Low-throughout”); 5.1% presented with depressive symptoms mainly during the antenatal period (“Antenatal-high”); 4.9% presented with depressive symptoms mainly during the postpartum period (“Postpartum-high”). 52.4% of women experienced their first depressive symptoms during early pregnancy. Suffering from anxiety and being unsatisfied with their marriage were associated with the “Antenatal-high” and “Postpartum-high” trajectories, respectively. Limitations: Response rate was not high. We also do not have information on clinical diagnoses or changes in some variables over time. Conclusions: We identified three trajectories and heterogeneity existed concerning the timing of their peaks. Women should be considered for depression screening and intervention in early pregnancy. Factors associated with each trajectory were different, raising the potential of individualized intervention to reduce the occurrence of depression.

"Prevalence, risk factors and clinical correlates of depression in quarantined population during the COVID-19 outbreak","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has brought tremendous psychological pressure to the general population, which may lead to depression. Therefore, this study aim to evaluate the prevalence and clinical correlates of depressive symptoms in the general population quarantined during the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen. Methods: 2237 quarantined general individuals participated in this cross-sectional study from February 14 to March 4, 2020, during their 14 days quarantine. They completed the Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) for depression, Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) for post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Results: The prevalence of depressive symptom was 6.21% in quarantined individuals. The depressed group were younger, less married and educated, and had higher SAS, PSQI, IES-R total scores (all p &lt; 0.05), as well as more avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms than the non-depressed group. Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between SDS score and the following parameters: age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total and its three subscale scores (Bonferroni corrected all p &lt; 0.05). Further multiple regression indicated that age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total score, Avoidance and Hyperarousal factor were independent predictors of depressive symptom. Limitations: This study adopted a cross-sectional design and used self-report questionnaires. Conclusions: Our results suggest an elevated prevalence of depressive symptom in quarantined general individuals in Shenzhen. Some demographic and clinical variables were associated with depressive symptoms.

Coping behaviors associated with decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown might increase anxiety and depressive symptoms, but some behaviors may protect against them. Method: To provide a preliminary evidence of the behaviors associated with decreased symptoms in the current COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we conducted a survey of 5545 adult individuals from the Spanish general population, two weeks after an official lockdown was established across the country. Results: Sixty-five percent of the sample reported anxiety or depressive symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet and not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often were the best predictors of lower levels of anxiety symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet, following a routine, not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often, taking the opportunity to pursue hobbies, and staying outdoors or looking outside were the best predictors of lower levels of depressive symptoms. Limitations: Cross-sectional nature and use of sample of convenience. Conclusions: This study suggests that “simple” coping behaviors may protect against anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown.

Psychological status and fatigue of frontline staff two months after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in China: A cross-sectional study,"Presents a study which aims to examine the psychological status and fatigue of frontline staff two months after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in China. The authors adopted a cross-sectional survey design to assess the anxiety, depression, and fatigue status of frontline staff during the COVID-19 epidemic in China with an anonymous online questionnaire. The authors e received responses from 2,614 participants, including community workers, health care workers, volunteers, market administrators and others, the last including commanders, police, and journalists. This is the first study to investigate the mental health and fatigue of frontline staff fighting COVID-19. Most participants experienced depression and anxiety, and indeed more than 55.6% of frontline staff felt tired. The psychological response of frontline staff to the epidemic of infectious diseases is complex. The authors found the level of depression, anxiety, and fatigue of community workers to be much higher than that of other occupations, while the level of health care workers was slightly lower in this survey. On the one hand, compared with medical staff, community workers lack professional medical knowledge and access to medical materials in epidemic emergencies. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the higher the level of family support, the greater the satisfaction of patients, and the better their sleep, the lower the depression, anxiety, and fatigue in front-line staff, which is consistent with research results in other fields. This study also revealed a positive correlation between fatigue, depression, and anxiety in frontline workers during the epidemic.

Posttraumatic growth as a buffer and a vulnerability for psychological distress in mothers who are breast cancer survivors,"Background: This study investigated the role of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in moderating the associations between parenting efficacy and psychological distress, and between fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) and psychological distress, in mothers who are breast cancer survivors. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, mothers who were breast cancer survivors ( N = 91) completed the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Cancer-Related Parenting Self-Efficacy (CaPSE), Concerns About Cancer Recurrence (CARS) and Posttraumatic Growth Inventory Short Form (PTGI-SF). Hierarchical multiple linear regressions and simple-slope tests were used to examine the main effects of the predictors (CaPSE and CARS) and moderator (PTGI-SF), and interaction effects of CaPSExPTGI-SF and CARSxPTGI-SF. The analyses were repeated for each outcome variable: Depression, Anxiety and Stress. Results: Higher CARS significantly predicted higher Depression, Anxiety and Stress, and lower CaPSE significantly predicted higher Depression and Stress. Significant CaPSExPTGI-SF and CARSxPTGI-SF interactions predicted Depression. Simple-slopes tests indicated a significant positive association between CARS and Depression for mothers with high levels of PTG, but not with low levels of PTG. A negative association was indicated between CaPSE and Depression for mothers with low levels of PTGI-SF, though neither slope was significant. Limitations: Our results are only generalisable to mothers with similar socio-demographic backgrounds. Conclusions: PTG may serve as both a protective and a risk factor for depression in mothers who are breast cancer survivors. Debate remains whether PTG is best conceptualised as a perceived positive outcome or an ongoing coping mechanism in the face of parenting challenges and cancer-related threats such as FCR.

An investigation of mental health status of children and adolescents in China during the outbreak of COVID-19,"Objective: : The sudden outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a dramatic effect on the mental health of the public. In the present study, we demonstrated the psychological effects on children and adolescents associated with the epidemic . Methods: : By using convenience sampling method, questionnaires, such as Spence Child Anxiety Scale, Child Depression Inventory and Coping style Scale, were distributed to participating 359 children and 3254 adolescents online. Results: : The anxiety levels of children and adolescents were (23.87 ± 15.79) and (29.27 ± 19.79), respectively. 22.28% respondents were suffering from depressive symptoms. Seven significant factors associated with increased levels of anxiety, including female, resident in urban regions, emotion-focused coping style. Nine factors associated with increased levels of depression, such as smartphone addiction (OR 1.411, 95% CI 1.099–1.180), Internet addiction (OR 1.844, 95% CI 1.209–2.811), and resident in Hubei province (OR 3.107, 95% CI 1.252–7.708). Two additional factors associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms: hours spend on Internet per day before the epidemic (OR 0.652, 95% CI 0.609–0.697) and tendency to apply problem-focused coping style (OR 0.937, 95% CI 0.923–0.951). Conclusion: : Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on children and adolescents. Findings of current levels of anxiety and depression not only highlight the need to address emotional distress for children and adolescents during the epidemic but also provide researchers with scientific fundamentals to formulate targeted interventions based on the significant influencing factors.

The association of changes in repetitive negative thinking with changes in depression and anxiety,"Background: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a common feature of different mental disorders in the affective spectrum. Most measures of RNT are disorder-specific and measure e.g. rumination in depression or worry in anxiety. Methods: In the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), 1820 adults completed the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire to assess content-independent RNT over a 3-year follow-up period. We investigated the relative stability of content-independent RNT (Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire), over time as well as the association between changes in RNT and changes in affective disorder status (Composite International Diagnostic Interview) and depressive and anxiety severity (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Fear Questionnaire). Results: In the total group, baseline RNT was strongly related to RNT three years later, while the difference between the scores at baseline and three years later was negligible. Increases and decreases in RNT were associated with the occurrence and recovery of affective disorders, respectively. Furthermore, changes in RNT between baseline and three years later were associated with corresponding changes in depression, anxiety, and avoidance symptom severity. These associations were small or negligible. Limitations: Our findings may not be representative of all affective disorders as individuals with an obsessive-compulsive disorder or bipolar disorder were excluded from our sample. Conclusions: The findings suggest that RNT is not primarily an index of disorder status or epiphenomenon of symptom severity and may constitute a relatively stable transdiagnostic person characteristic.

"The loneliness pandemic: Loneliness and other concomitants of depression, anxiety and their comorbidity during the COVID-19 outbreak","Presents a study which aims to evaluate COVID-19 related psychiatric symptoms of depression and anxiety, and their comorbidity in a Western society, where restrictive social-distancing has been employed. Using the Qualtrics web-based public platform, the authors collected data across Israel using a snowball design, via social media platforms. On the last day of data collection, 6902 people in Israel tested positive for COVID-19, 241 recovered and twenty-five had died. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that after entering demographics, health-related factors, exposure to COVID19 related events, behavioral change and loneliness; loneliness was the most prominent risk factor for depression and anxiety. Moreover, the results showed that relative to those with low loneliness, those with high loneliness were 82% more susceptible to suffer from depression-anxiety comorbidity due to the coronavirus outbreak. The first main finding of the study is somewhat counterintuitive, indicating that old age as an actual risk for COVID-19 complications was negatively related with depression and anxiety. Moreover, neither the suffering from chronic medical conditions nor exposure to COVID-19 related risk situations were link to higher risk for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Critically, for age, this was even reversed, namely, adults above 60 who are at higher risk for COVID-19 complications, actually displayed greater resilience to psychiatric disorders associated with the COVID-19 crisis.

"Heterogeneity in fear processing across and within anxiety, eating, and compulsive disorders","Background: To assess within and across diagnosis variability we examined fear processing in healthy controls (HC) and three diagnostic groups that share symptoms of pathological anxiety: obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD); social anxiety disorder (SAD), and anorexia nervosa (AN). Methods: Unmedicated adults (N=166) participated in a paradigm assessing associative fear acquisition, extinction, extinction recall, and fear renewal. Data were analyzed from two perspectives: comparison of each disorder to HC and exploratory latent class analysis (LCA) of the combined data. Results: The diagnosis-based analyses indicated significantly increased fear renewal in OCD and trends toward decreased extinction recall in OCD and increased renewal in SAD. The LCA indicated four Response Types, none of which were congruent with the diagnostic categories. Most participants had a normative response (50%) or a moderate extinction recall deficit (30%). The two remaining groups (8% each) had more extreme responses: one showed complete failure of extinction recall; the other persistent arousal in expectation of, but prior to, actual conditioning (threat sensitivity). Limitations: Due to small sample size (N = 20) results for AN are regarded as preliminary. Conclusions: Our diagnosis-based findings are consistent with previous data suggesting an association between pathological anxiety and difficulties maintaining fear extinction. The LCA reveal substantial within-diagnosis heterogeneity in fear processing and support inclusion of empirically driven approaches as a complement to standard analyses. This heterogeneity may also have implications for treatment, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy, which relies on strengthening extinction recall and requires patients to tolerate anxious expectation in order to engage with feared situations.

"Prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom, and the demands for psychological knowledge and interventions in college students during COVID-19 epidemic: A large cross-sectional study","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 276 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2020-64969-141). In the original article, there were errors in the authors and affiliations lists. The correct authors and affiliations lists are given in the erratum.] Background: Although studies have suggested experiencing the epidemic of severe infectious diseases increased the prevalence of mental health problems, the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom in college students in China was unclear. Methods: A large cross-sectional online survey with 44,447 college students was conducted in Guangzhou, China. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) were used to define the anxiety and depression symptom, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom. Results: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR = 4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; P = 0.003), and suspected (OR = 2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; P = 0.023) cases in family members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of psychological knowledge and interventions than those without ( P &lt; 0.001). Limitations: All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire, and we did not evaluate the reliability and validity. Conclusions: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was relatively low in college students, but the COVID-19 epidemic-related factors might be associated with higher depression symptom risk.

"Connectomic signatures of working memory deficits in depression, mania, and euthymic states of bipolar disorder","Background: Working memory (WM) deficit is a feature persistently reported across mania, depression, and euthymic periods of bipolar disorder (BD). WM capacity relates to distributed brain regions that are systemically organized at the connectome level. It is not clear whether the same disruption of this network-level organization underlies the WM impairment seen in different phases of BD. Methods: We used graph theory to examine the topology of the functional connectome in different granularity in 143 subjects (72 with BD [32 depression; 15 mania; 25 euthymic] and 71 healthy controls) during a n-back task. Linear regression analysis was used to test associations of altered graph properties, clinical symptoms, and WM accuracy in patients. Results: Altered topological properties characterised by an increase in small-worldness of the whole-brain connectome, were specific for bipolar depressed, but not in manic and euthymic states. Depressed subjects showed a shift in the distribution of the number of connections per brain region (degree) within the connectome during WM task. Increased small-worldness related to worse WM accuracy in patients with more severe depression, anxiety and illness burden. Limitations: We used only 2-back load, limiting our ability to study the parametric effects of task demand. Conclusions: We demonstrate a putative state-dependent mechanistic link between connectome topology, hub re-distribution and impaired n-back performance in bipolar disorder. The aberrant task-dependent modulation of the connectome relates to worse WM performance especially when anxiety and depression are prominent in BD.

Effects of aromatherapy on anxiety: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Scope: The effects of aromatherapy on relieving anxiety were controversial. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of aromatherapy on anxiety in patients. Methods and results: We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about aromatherapy on decreasing anxiety on PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE (January 1990 to October 2019), COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE (updated to October 2019), and the Chinese databases CNKI, WanFang and CBMD. Twenty-five articles (Thirty-two trials) were included in this meta-analysis. The data of scale scores of Spielberger State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were extracted. The pooled results demonstrated that inhalation and massage aromatherapy significantly decreased anxiety levels in different conditions. The weighted mean difference was -5.16 for State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) (95%CI: -5.78, -4.55, p &lt; 0.001) and -2.85 for Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI) (95%CI: -3.95, -1.75, p &lt; 0.001). No side effects were mentioned in all of studies. Conclusion: The meta-analysis suggested that aromatherapy with different essential oils could alleviate anxiety significantly no matter the reason of anxiety. However, the proper dosage of essential oils needs further research.

Big Five personality facets explaining variance in anxiety and depressive symptoms in a community sample,"Background: Personality traits are risk and protective factors in affective disorders. However, few studies have investigated the role of narrow personality facets, with existing research yielding contradictory results. Previous research has mostly focused on simple correlations. Several studies have performed separate multiple regressions within each trait, and have used non-standard measures of personality, making it difficult to determine how individual facets make unique contributions. Method: This study performed secondary analysis of the NewMood data set (collected 2004–2009), comprising 264 participants from Greater Manchester. Participants provided self-reports of all NEO-PI-R personality facets, and semi-structured questionnaires of clinical depression and anxiety. All personality facets were entered into multiple regressions to explain variance in depression and anxiety. Results: Variance in both anxiety and depression were explained by a small number of personality facets, namely facet depression (referring to demotivation), facets positive emotion and assertiveness in extroversion, and facet competence in conscientiousness. Limitations: This study relies on cross-sectional data and cannot determine causation. This study uses a mostly female sample, and the results were not stratified by sex due to the small sample. Conclusion: Previous studies suggest that broad trait neuroticism positively associates with affective disorders; this study adds that the effect of neuroticism is limited to facet depression (related to demotivation). Contrary to previous studies, no facet of agreeableness or openness explained variance in affective disorders, and facet assertiveness positively associated with affective disorder scores. These findings may help to improve treatment matching and explain the mechanisms through which affective disorders develop.

Emotional reactivity and eating disorder related attitudes in response to the Trier Social Stress Test: An experimental study in people with anorexia nervosa and with bulimia nervosa,"Background: In order to experimentally asses the role of socio-emotional problems in Eating Disorder (ED) psychopathology, we have measured affective states and ED-related attitudes in response to an acute psychosocial stress and their relationships with interpersonal sensitivity in people with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and Bulimia Nervosa (BN). Methods: Twenty-one women with AN, 21 with BN and 27 healthy women underwent an acute psycho-social challenge, the Trier Social Stress Test. Anxiety feelings, hunger perception, amount of desired food and body dissatisfaction were measured throughout the experimental procedure. The relationships between these variables and with interpersonal sensitivity measures were explored through Pearson's correlation and mediation analyses. Results: Stress-induced anxiety was increased in people with EDs. People with AN showed reduced hunger perception, decreased desire for food and a negative association between anxiety feelings and desire for food. In people with EDs, baseline ineffectiveness predicted post-stress body dissatisfaction through the mediation of post-stress anxiety levels. Limitations: The relatively low sample size and the lack of an experimental control condition are the main limitations of the study. Conclusions: The present findings show, for the first time, the relationships between socio-emotional distress and ED-related attitudes in people with EDs, providing experimental support to the interpersonal model of EDs. This gives empirical evidence to treatments targeting interpersonal problems in EDs.

"Risk of psychological burden in polycystic ovary syndrome: A case control study in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Background: While increased risk of psychiatric burden in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is reported in the literature, there is dearth of reports from Saudi Arabia on occurrence of psychological burden in women with PCOS. This study aimed to compare the sociodemographic and clinical features of PCOS cases with non-PCOS control and explore the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress in PCOS and non-PCOS women. Materials and Methods: This is a case–control study carried out in PSMMC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from March 2019 to June 2019. Samples were recruited by convenience sampling and simple random method in PCOS cases (82) and control group (85), respectively. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to measure the presence of psychological burden. Results: High percentage of participants were in an age group of 26–35 years (51%) and university educated (64%). Significantly ( P = 0.001) high proportion of PCOS cases found with irregular menses, hirsutism, infertility and presence of acne ( P = 0.001) when compared to control group. The odds of developing depression ( P = 0.006), anxiety ( P = 0.028) and stress ( P = 0.000) was significantly higher in PCOS cases compared to control participants. Further, among the three parameters, the occurrence of stress (odds ratio, OR = 10.45) in women with PCOS was more common than depression (OR = 2.675) and anxiety (OR = 2.056). Limitations: Recall bias and inclusion of only one hospital. Conclusion: In conclusion, most of the PCOS cases had stress, depression and anxiety compared to control group. Meeting the psychological need of the PCOS women will help in improving their quality of life.

Psychological impact of healthcare workers in China during COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic: A multi-center cross-sectional survey investigation,"Background: Since the outbreak of 2019 new coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, healthcare workers (HCW) have suffered psychological stress. The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed. Results: We received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for depression. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic has induced stress levels for HCW, and high percentages of HCW have anxiety and depression. The situation of HCW is worrying and intervention service is urgent.

"Depression, anxiety and stress in different subgroups of first-year university students from 4-year cohort data","Background: Limited studies have been conducted to investigate the mental health status of subgroups of university students. This study hypothesized that there would be differences among student subgroups in the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress; and association of age, gender, academic performance and mental health status. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey study. Since 2014, first-year university students in a university in Hong Kong were invited to complete the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) before the commencement of their study. These DASS data were then merged with objectively measured data from university records. 9,479 students completed the DASS survey, this being 56.5% of the total student population in the records. Kruskal-Wallis Tests were applied to compare the differences among student subgroups. Results: Community college transfer (CCT) students were the highest-risk group for depression, anxiety and stress, and their study load was the highest as well. Unexpectedly, mainstream students ranked after the CCT students in the prevalence and levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Student athletes had the highest prevalence of depression. Although there were declining trends for depression, anxiety and stress, it was only a slight drop. Overall, age, gender, study load and academic performance were associated with the mental health profile (p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: After admission, students’ mental health conditions could have changed. Further studies are needed to measure mental health during their study. Conclusions: Mental health problems were not distributed evenly across different student subgroups, psychological support should be designed according to the needs of each student subgroup.

The heterogeneity of social anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents: Results of latent profile analysis,"Background: The main objective of the current study was to investigate the symptoms of social anxiety in Chinese adolescents by conducting latent profile analysis (LPA), a person-centered statistical approach, with items from the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A). Method: In total, a sample of 2,755 adolescents aged 11-19 years were recruited from six urban public schools in the Beijing District and Sichuan Province, China. Latent profile analysis, regression mixture modelling, and multinomial logistical regression were adopted to investigate the latent profiles and profiles validity. Results: A four-profile model was suggested as the optimum: low group with diffuse social anxiety, moderate group with difficulties in new situations, moderate group with cognitive disturbance, and high group with diffuse social anxiety. With regression mixture modelling, results showed a greater possibility for older adolescents and girls fall into the high group with diffuse social anxiety. Finally, to examine the validity and interpretability of the social anxiety profiles, two cognitive factors—post-event rumination and self-focused attention—were adopted for their potential to significantly predict the moderate and high group social anxiety profiles. Conclusions: The current study, which was the first effort to investigate the features of social anxiety among Chinese adolescents with LPA, supports an innovative model of social anxiety symptoms in a large, non-Western sample.

Abnormal fear circuits activities correlated to physical symptoms in somatic anxiety patients,"Background: Somatic anxiety patients complain of physical symptoms and exhibit repeated checking behavior. Overgeneralization of fear is a characteristic of anxiety disorders. However, the role of fear in the somatic anxiety patients remains unclear. We hypothesized that somatic anxiety patients have abnormal fear circuits, including the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, which can aggravate physical symptoms. Methods: 33 anxiety patients and 25 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. The severity of the anxiety and somatic symptoms was assessed with the Hamilton anxiety scale and the 15-item somatic symptom severity scale from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15). The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess abnormalities in the fear circuit. We compared the ALFF between patients and HCs with respect to the fear circuit and conducted correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between somatic symptoms and the ALFF in abnormal cerebral regions. Results: The ALFF of the left thalamus and left hippocampus was significantly higher in the patient group than the HC group, and was positively correlated with the PHQ-15 values. Limitations: We did not divide the patient group into drug treated or drug free in our subgroup analysis. There was a lack of the paradigm to test the generalization of fear for patients in this study. Furthermore, the small sample size may have affected the results. Conclusion: Somatic symptoms in patients with anxiety are related to abnormal fear circuits, whose degree of abnormality is associated with symptom severity.

Sex differences in the associations between blood pressure and anxiety and depression scores in a middle-aged and elderly population: The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA),"Background: Anxiety and depression are considered risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), but their relationship to blood pressure (BP) is still uncertain. Lifestyle factors and age-related comorbidities may confound these relationships. Our study aimed to evaluate the associations between BP and anxiety and depression scores in a population aged ≥ 49 years. Methods: Data on 8504 participants from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) were analyzed for associations between BP and anxiety and depression questionnaire scores, accounting for relevant confounding factors. Results: Multivariable analyses showed negative associations between systolic BP and anxiety and depression scores, independent of age, body mass index (BMI), marital status, education level, smoking status, alcohol consumption, level of physical activity, self-reported CVDs (≥ 2) and antihypertensive medication use in men (coefficient = −0.112, P = 0.013; coefficient = −0.051, P = 0.026) but not in women (coefficient = -0.001, P = 0.855; coefficient = -0.005, P = 0.556). Diastolic BP was not associated with anxiety or depression scores in either men (coefficient = −0.018, P = 0.223; coefficient = −0.001, P = 0.924) or women (coefficient = −0.007, P = 0.338; coefficient = −0.015, P = 0.293) after adjusting for these same confounding factors. After a follow-up of 4 years, lower BP in subjects not using antihypertensive medications was significantly associated with more anxiety and depression events. Limitation: Time-varying confounding factors may have interfered with our results. Conclusion: Our results show that systolic BP in a middle-aged and elderly population is negatively associated with anxiety and depression scores in men but not women after adjustment for a range of lifestyle factors. These results contrast with the predisposition of anxious or depressed participants to CVDs in later life when decades of unhealthy lifestyles have persisted.

Short and long-term effects of cannabis on symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder,"Background: Many individuals use cannabis to manage symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and evidence indicates that the endocannabinoid system represents a viable target for treating these symptoms. Method: Data from 404 medical cannabis users who self-identified as having PTSD were obtained from Strainprint®, a medical cannabis app that patients use to track changes in symptoms as a function of different strains and doses of cannabis across time. This sample collectively used the app 11,797 times over 31 months to track PTSD-related symptoms (intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, irritability, and/or anxiety) immediately before and after inhaling cannabis. Latent change score models were used to examine changes in symptom severity and predictors of these changes (gender, dose, cannabis constituents, time). Multilevel models were used to explore long-term consequences of repeatedly using cannabis to manage these symptoms. Results: All symptoms were reduced by more than 50% immediately after cannabis use. Time predicted larger decreases in intrusions and irritability, with later cannabis use sessions predicting greater symptom relief than earlier sessions. Higher doses of cannabis predicted larger reductions in intrusions and anxiety, and dose used to treat anxiety increased over time. Baseline severity of all symptoms remained constant across time. Limitations: The sample was self-selected, self-identified as having PTSD, and there was no placebo control group. Conclusions: Cannabis provides temporary relief from PTSD-related symptoms. However, it may not be an effective long-term remedy as baseline symptoms were maintained over time and dose used for anxiety increased over time, which is indicative of development of tolerance.

Exposure to food in anorexia nervosa and brain correlates of food-related anxiety: Findings from a pilot study,"Background: Although the primary target of treatment for anorexia nervosa (AN) is weight gain, established psychological interventions focus on maintaining factors of AN, and do not specifically address eating behaviours. We have previously reported results of a case series investigating in-vivo food exposure in AN, demonstrating the feasibility and acceptability of this treatment together with evidence of significant clinical change (Cardi, Leppanen, Mataix‐Cols, Campbell, &amp; Treasure, 2019). The current study examined the neural circuitry of food-related anxiety. Methods: We examined neural reactivity (fMRI) to food images pre- and post-food exposure therapy (n = 16), and compared it to a group of healthy control participants (HC n = 21) who were scanned on two occasions. Results: Prior to treatment, the AN group (compared to HC) showed less reactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Following exposure treatment, patients (compared to HC), show increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, decreased activity in the superior parietal lobe and no differences in the ACC. The level of activation of the insula (pre-treatment) predicted the degree of post-treatment reduction in self-reported food anxiety in AN. Changes in food-related anxiety were also associated with changes in neural activation in a cluster located in the middle temporal gyrus/lateral parietal cortex. Limitations: The primary limitations of this work are the small sample size and lack of patient comparison group. Conclusions: Exposure to food in AN may be associated with changes in neural circuitries implicated in emotion regulation and attentional processes. However, these findings need replication in larger and controlled studies.

“Resilience is associated with post-stoke depression in Chinese stroke survivors: A longitudinal study”: Corrigendum,"Reports an error in ""Resilience is associated with post-stoke depression in Chinese stroke survivors: A longitudinal study"" by Xuan Zhou, Zhihui Liu, Wei Zhang and Lanshu Zhou ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2020[Aug][1], Vol 273, 402-409). In the original article, there was an error in the order of affiliations. The correction order is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-43903-051). Background: Optimal strategies for prevention and treatment for post-stroke depression (PSD) remain unclear and a greater understanding of effect of resilience on PSD is promising. The aim was to examine the association between baseline resilience and depression at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, which contributes to early detection and management of PSD. Methods: A total of 217 ischemic stroke survivors were recruited in two tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China from February 2017 to January 2018. The Chinese version of Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) was used to assess resilience at acute hospitalization. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was employed to ascertain baseline anxiety, baseline depression, and post-discharge depression. Social-demographic and disease-related information were obtained from participants’ self-report and medical records. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine which factors were independently associated with PSD. Results: The prevalence of depression at baseline was 21.2% and at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge was 34.4%, 33.2%, and 29.2%, respectively. Logistics regression analyses indicated that resilience may independently predict PSD at 1 month (OR: 0.22, 95%CI: 0.097, 0.518), 3 months (OR:0.302, 95%CI: 0.151, 0.607), and 6 months (OR: 0.03, 95%CI: 0.006, 0.153) after controlling for social-demographics, disease-related characteristics, baseline anxiety, and baseline depression. Limitations: Non-multicenter survey and mild stroke severity may affect the generalization of these findings. Moreover, response bias should be acknowledged because some participants were read questionnaires out aloud. Conclusion: Resilience is independently associated with PSD at different timepoints. Our findings reveal the important role of resilience as a protective factor against PSD.

COVID-19 anxiety symptoms associated with problematic smartphone use severity in Chinese adults,"Background: COVID-19 is fast-spreading and potentially fatal, introducing home quarantine, social distancing, and increased internet usage globally. We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity Methods: Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. Results: COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. Limitations: Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country. Conclusions: Results are discussed in context of the I-PACE model of excessive internet use. While COVID-19 anxiety is likely a global anxiety-provoking event, other everyday worries and anxiety are additionally clinically important in driving excessive internet use.

Childhood determinants of past-year anxiety and depression in recently transitioned military personnel,"Background: Anxiety and depression may hamper a smooth transition from military to civilian life and may be important predictors of longer-term health and functioning. However, it is as yet unclear to what extent they are determined by childhood factors in a recently transitioned population. Methods: We utilised logistic regression and Generalised Structural Equation Modelling to analyse associations of ICD-10 past-year anxiety and depression with childhood trauma and disorder in a recently transitioned population using detailed interview data from the ADF (Australian Defence Force) Transition and Wellbeing Research Programme. Results: Past-year anxiety (including PTSD) was prevalent (36.4%, 95% CI, 31.9-41.1) and associated with childhood anxiety (but not other types of childhood disorder), childhood interpersonal trauma (but not other childhood trauma) and adult-onset trauma. Childhood anxiety had a direct and significant association with past-year anxiety. The pathway between childhood interpersonal trauma and past-year anxiety was fully mediated by childhood anxiety. Past-year depression was less prevalent (11.3%, 95% CI, 8.7-14.5) and had no association with childhood disorder or trauma variables. Limitations: The main predictor variables utilized in this analysis were childhood experiences recalled from adulthood, thus rendering the responses vulnerable to autobiographical bias. Conclusions: Past-year anxiety was highly prevalent in the period of transition and had strong associations with childhood and military factors, suggesting predictability and potentially preventability.

"Risk of dementia in persons who have previously experienced clinically-significant depression, anxiety, or PTSD: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Depression, anxiety and PTSD appear to be linked to dementia, but it is unclear whether they are risk factors (causal or prodromal) for, comorbid with, or sequelae to (secondary effect of) dementia. Existing meta-analyses have examined depression or anxiety in all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD), but have not considered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The current meta-analysis examined the risk of developing dementia (AD, VaD, DLB, FTD, all-cause) in people with and without a history of clinically-significant depression, anxiety or PTSD in order to better understand the link between mental illness and dementia (PROSPERO number: CRD42018099872). Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL searches identified 36 eligible studies. Results: There is a higher risk of developing all-cause dementia and AD in people with previous depression, and a higher risk of all-cause dementia in people with prior anxiety, than in persons without this history. Prior PTSD was not associated with a higher risk of later being diagnosed with dementia. Limitations: The data for anxiety, PTSD, DLB and FTD were limited. Conclusions: Depression and anxiety appear to be risk factors for dementia, but longitudinal studies across adulthood (young adult/mid-life/older adult) are needed to evaluate the likely causal or prodromal nature of this risk. The link between PTSD and dementia remains unclear. Regular screening for new onset mental illness and for cognitive changes in older adults with a history of mental illness may assist with earlier identification of dementia.

"How sex differences in schooling and income contribute to sex differences in depression, anxiety and common mental disorders: The mental health sex-gap in a birth cohort from Brazil","Background: Reasons for the higher rates of depression, anxiety and common mental disorders among women are unclear. We investigated the mediating effect of schooling and personal income and the effect modification of maternal schooling and family income at baseline. Methods: In 1982, the maternity hospitals of Pelotas (Southern Brazil) were daily visits and those livebirths whose family lived in the urban area of the city were examined and their mothers interviewed. At 30 years, the presence of major depression (MD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was assessed using the Mini-International Psychiatric Interview, and common mental disorders (CMD) with the self-rated questionnaire. We used Mantel-Haenszel test to assess effect modification and a counterfactual framework using inverse probability weights (IPW) and G-computation to analyze mediation. Results: Income at 30 years captured part of the association of sex with MD (16.5%), GAD (14.2%), and CMD (18.0%). Schooling at 30 years was higher in women (p &lt; 0.001), and therefore inversely mediated the association with MD (-5.4%), GAD (-4.8%), and CMD (-6.7%). If we fixed the mediator to earning more than 3 minimum salaries, the effect of sex, was reduced in 64.9%, 56.7% and 31.4%, for MD, GAD and CMD, respectively, and 62.4%, 13.6% and 23.8%, if fixed to 12 or more years of schooling. Limitations: We were not able to evaluate mental health and socioeconomic changes, or assess a bidirectional effect Conclusion: Personal income and schooling at 30 years, are important mediators and effect modifiers of the association between sex and MD, GAD, and CMD.

"Prevalence and associated factors of postpartum anxiety and depression symptoms among women in Shanghai, China","Background: Postpartum anxiety (PPA) and postpartum depression (PPD) are associated with immediate and long-term health risks for both mothers and babies. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate relationships between sociodemographic, perinatal variables, and PPA and PPD symptoms of parturients 6 weeks postpartum. Methods: A cross-sectional survey with 1204 women who had a healthy and term birth in a baby-friendly hospital, Shanghai, China. PPA and PPD symptoms were measured by using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: The mean score of SAS and EPDS was 40.79 ± 8.48 and 8.18 ± 5.80, respectively. The estimated prevalence of PPA and PPD symptoms was 15.2% and 23.2%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of fatigue and PPD symptoms were risk factors for PPA symptoms, whereas having support from family and being satisfied with labor experience were protective factors. In terms of PPD symptoms, its risk factors included smoking before pregnancy, maternal separation from baby, fatigue, encountering difficulties in breastfeeding, and the presence of PPA symptoms. In contrast, the protective factors for PPD symptoms were having support from family and having support from colleagues or friends. Limitations: Convenience sampling and voluntary participation may have led to a selection bias. Conclusion: PPA and PPD symptoms occur commonly among parturients in Shanghai, China. The findings from this research provide a better understanding of factors associated with PPA and PPD symptoms and will help guide personalized approaches to the management of postpartum anxiety and depression.

"Increased prevalence of depression, anxiety, and adjustment and somatoform disorders in transsexual individuals","Background: The aim of this study was to explore rates of depression, anxiety, and adjustment and somatoform disorders in a large sample of transsexual individuals (TSI), compared with matched non-TSI cohorts from general practices in Germany. Methods: Individuals initially documented as transsexual (index date) between January 2010 and December 2018 were identified in 468 general practices (GP) from the IMS Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA). Non-transsexual women (NTSW) and men (NTSM) were matched (1:1) with transsexual individuals by age, index year, and physician. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and adjustment and somatoform disorders among TSI compared to NTSW and NTSM. Results: A total of 535 TSI, 535 NTSW, and 535 NTSM were analyzed (mean age in each group was 35 years). Depression was documented in 20% of TSI versus 7.7% of NTSW and 5.5% of NTSM ( p &lt; 0.001), reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders in 10% of TSI versus 4.3% of NTSW and 2.9% of NTSM ( p &lt; 0.001), somatoform disorders in 9.7% of TSI versus 5.8% of NTSW and 5.8% of NTSM (p 0.016), and anxiety disorders in 5.8% of TSI versus 1.9% of NTSW and 1.6% of NTSM, ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings indicate a need to promote TSI mental health. Furthermore, primary care physicians and psychiatrists should be aware of the importance of detecting and treating mental disorders in TSI and thereby improve their quality of life.

Evidence for inhibited temperament as a transdiagnostic factor across mood and psychotic disorders,"Background: The conceptualization of risk for psychiatric illness is moving from risk factors for specific psychiatric disorders to factors that confer risk for multiple disorders. One potential transdiagnostic risk factor is inhibited temperament, a trait characterized by a fearful or avoidant response to novelty. Inhibited temperament is an established risk factor for anxiety disorders, and evidence suggests inhibited temperament is elevated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. Methods: In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that inhibited temperament is a transdiagnostic factor in 490 participants including individuals with schizophrenia (n = 184), psychotic bipolar disorder (n = 61), major depression disorder (n = 53), or no disorders (n = 192). Participants completed assessments of temperament, personality, clinical symptoms, cognition, and functioning. An ANOVA was used to test for group differences in inhibited temperament scores. Regressions were used to test whether inhibited temperament scores were associated with the current measures and whether the associations were similar across disorders. Results: Inhibited temperament was similarly elevated in all patient groups compared to controls. Inhibited temperament was similarly associated with anxiety, depression, negative affect, and quality of life across patient groups. Inhibited temperament was not associated with cognition or functional impairment. Limitation: Although the inhibited temperament measure is commonly used, it is a retrospective self-report which may be susceptible to biases. Conclusions: The current study provides evidence that inhibited temperament is a transdiagnostic factor impacting affective systems across mood and psychotic disorders. Inhibited patients may especially benefit from treatments that specifically target anxiety and depression.

Sexual-orientation based discrimination is associated with anxiety and depression in young physicians. A national study,"Introduction: The professional risk factors for depression and anxiety are underexplored in young physicians. While there has been increasing research on the mental health and well-being of lesbian, gay and bisexual patients, few studies have examined the mental health and well-being of lesbian, gay and bisexual young physicians. Objective: The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Sexual Orientation-Based Discrimination (SOBD) in French young physicians and if SOBD was associated with increased anxiety and depression in this population. Method: This national study is a cross-sectional observational epidemiological national study. The participants were recruited between April 1st 2019 and June 31st 2019. One question with binary answer was asked on SOBD. Mental health was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety &amp; Depression scales. Results: On the 2003 participants, 148 (7%) reported SOBD exposure, 647 (32%) current anxiety disorders and 174 (9%) a current major depressive disorder according to their HAD score. SOBD was almost twice more frequently reported in participants with anxiety disorder and major depression (respectively 10%,vs 6% and 12% vs. 7%, p&lt;0.05). In the first model of multivariate analyses, current anxiety disorder was significantly associated with being woman (adjusted odds ratio aOR=1.688, 95%CI 1.350-2.110, p&lt;0.001) and SOBD (aOR=1.729, 95%CI 1.226-2.440, p=0.002). In the second model of multivariate analyses, current major depression was significantly associated with only SOBD (aOR=1.748, 95%CI 1.057-2.888, p=0.029). Conclusion: SOBD has been associated with increased rates of anxiety disorder and major depression in young physicians and should be targeted in mental health prevention programs.

Social criticism moderates the relationship between anxiety and depression 10 years later,"Background: Research has consistently documented anxiety and depression as bidirectional risk factors for one another. However, little research investigates the sequential comorbidity of anxiety and depression over lengthy durations, and the influence of contextual variables on this relationship have not been fully empirically investigated. Method: The current study examined perceived social criticism as a moderator of the relationship between a history of anxiety and a past 12-month depressive episode at least 10 years later (and vice versa) utilizing the National Comorbidity Survey Baseline ( N = 8,098) and Re-interview data ( N = 5,001). History of anxiety and depressive diagnoses were assigned at Wave 1, past year diagnosis at Wave 2, and perceived social criticism was assessed at Wave 1. Results: Structural equation modeling indicated that when controlling for a Wave 1 latent depression factor, a positive relationship between Wave 1 latent anxiety and a Wave 2 latent depression emerged for those endorsing higher perceived social criticism from friends and relatives, respectively. Unexpectedly, when controlling for Wave 1 latent anxiety, a negative relationship between Wave 1 latent depression and Wave 2 latent anxiety emerged for those endorsing higher perceived social criticism from friends, but no relationship when moderated by perceived social criticism from relatives. Limitations: Perceived social criticism was self-reported, which may introduce self-perception bias. Conclusions: Results identified perceived social criticism as an important moderator in the sequential comorbidity of anxiety and depression over a long period of time.

“Effects of smoking on perinatal depression and anxiety in mothers and fathers: A prospective cohort study”: Corrigendum,"Reports an error in ""Effects of smoking on perinatal depression and anxiety in mothers and fathers: A prospective cohort study"" by Raushan Alibekova, Jian-Pei Huang, Tony Szu-Hsien Lee, Heng-Kien Au and Yi-Hua Chen ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2016[Mar][15], Vol 193, 18-26). In the original article, additional affiliation for co-author Heng-Kien Au was missing. The correction is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-06001-004). Introduction: Considerable concern persists on tobacco use during perinatal periods. No study has simultaneously investigated the longitudinal association of paternal smoking with maternal and paternal depressive and anxiety symptoms during perinatal periods. Methods: In this prospective study, 533 couples (pregnant women and their husbands) completed 5 self-report instruments from early pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. Generalized estimating equations were used for the analyses. Results: We found that fathers who smoked in the mother’s presence had higher depressive (regression coefficient = 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3–1.8) and anxiety symptoms (3.0, 95% CI = 1.2–4.7) during perinatal periods compared with nonsmoking fathers. Paternal smoking in the mother’s presence also increased maternal disturbances, especially for depression during pregnancy (1.2, 95% CI = 0.1–2.3) and anxiety during the postpartum period (3.4, 95% CI = 0.6–6.3). No significant association was found between paternal smoking but not in the mother’s presence and maternal emotional disturbances. Paternal smoking but not in the mother’s presence affected only paternal anxiety, especially in the postpartum period (regression coefficient 2.7, 95% CI 0.7–4.7) compared with nonsmokers. Limitations: Self-report measures were used. The effects of maternal smoking could not be estimated because of the small sample of pregnant women who disclosed their smoking status. Conclusions: These findings imply a necessity to combine strategies for smoking cessation with interventions for affective disturbances in fathers. We also stress the importance of at least restricting the father’s smoking in the presence of the pregnant wife during perinatal periods if smoking cessation is tentatively unattainable.

Do adolescents with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME) and co-morbid anxiety and/or depressive symptoms think differently to those who do not have co-morbid psychopathology?,"Background: Co-morbid anxiety and/or depression is common in adolescents with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS/ME). Adolescents with psychopathology typically endorse more negative cognitive errors. We do not know whether they make negative cognitive errors in response to fatigue. We examined the thinking patterns of adolescents with CFS/ME and co-morbid psychopathology compared to those without this co-morbidity. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 205 adolescents (age 11–18) with CFS/ME, who completed measures of anxiety and depression, information processing biases and responses to fatigue. We grouped participants as having co-morbid psychopathology (or not) by applying a threshold score. We compared groups’ thinking pattern subscale scores using independent samples T tests. We examined the association between psychopathology and general negative thinking and specific responses to fatigue symptoms. Results: Adolescents with CFS/ME with co-morbid psychopathology more strongly endorsed general negative cognitive errors ( d = 0.61–1.31). They also more strongly endorsed damage beliefs ( d = 0.49), embarrassment avoidance ( d = 1.05), catastrophising ( d = 0.97) and symptom focusing ( d = 0.75) in response to fatigue but did not differ significantly on fear avoidance from those without co-morbid psychopathology. Both negative cognitive errors and unhelpful responses to symptoms explained 43% of the variance in psychopathology. Conclusions: Adolescents with CFS/ME with co-morbid psychopathology tend to be negatively biased in their thinking, both generally and about their symptoms of fatigue specifically. This may have implications for the sequencing of cognitive and behavioural strategies to address both fatigue and psychopathology.

Parental corporal punishment and child anxiety in China: The moderating role of HPA-axis Activity,"Background: Although negative associations between parental corporal punishment and child anxiety are well-documented, the potential moderators of these associations are not well characterized. Contemporary developmental perspectives suggest that biological vulnerability may influence the degree to which the environment affects child development. Thus, this study investigated the moderating role of one potential physiological marker, HPA-axis activity, in the relations between both maternal and paternal corporal punishment and child anxiety in China. Methods: Participants were 158 elementary school-age children and both their parents in China. Parental corporal punishment was measured based on children's self-report, maternal report, and paternal report. Children self-reported their anxiety and undertook saliva sampling during 3 consecutive school days at 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. in their classroom. Hierarchical regressions were calculated to examine the moderating role of HPA-axis activity in the link between corporal punishment and child anxiety. Results: Both maternal and paternal corporal punishment were positively associated with child anxiety. Low morning and afternoon basal cortisol exacerbated the relations between paternal corporal punishment and child anxiety, and flatter diurnal rhythm exacerbated the relations between both paternal and maternal corporal punishment and child anxiety. Limitations: Causal conclusions cannot be drawn based on cross-sectional research design. Conclusions: The findings provide partial support for the diathesis-stress model and highlight the importance of considering how the biological vulnerability may interact with parenting to influence child adjustment.

"Women with premature ovarian failure using hormone therapy do not experience increased levels of depression, anxiety and stress compared to controls","Objective: To evaluate anxiety, depression and stress of POI women using hormone therapy. Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional study included 61 women diagnosed with POI receiving HT, and 61 women with preserved ovarian function, matched 1:1 for age (control group). Instruments used to evaluate depression, anxiety and stress were Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Lipp's Stress Symptom Inventory (LSSI). The chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, Mann-Whitney test, Spearman's correlation coefficient or logistic regression analysis with stepwise criteria were used for analysis. Results: The mean age of POI women and control group was 35.03 ± 7.68 and 34.49 ± 7.55 years old ( p = 0.63). POI group and control group had a mean of 0.44 ± 0.92 and 1.28 ± 1.38 children ( p = 0,001); the total BDI, BAI and LSSI scores were 15.72 ± 11.68 and 13.66 ± 8.44 ( p = 0.64); 17.54 ± 13.16 and 17.25 ± 11.05 ( p = 0.90), 19.39 ± 12.08 and 18.93 ± 11.21 ( p = 0.945). The majority of women did not have depression or presented mild depression, but approximately one-third had moderate-severe undiagnosed depressive or anxiety symptoms. In POI group, depression was positively correlated with the number of children and anxiety. Anxiety and stress were also positively correlated. It was observed that for each point in the BDI, the risk of stress above 20 increased 19.6%, while for each point in the BAI, the risk of greater stress increased 32.4%. Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study, which made it impossible to draw cause and effect conclusions Conclusion: Women with POI receiving HT have indexes of depression, anxiety and stress similar to the population of women with preserved ovarian function.

There is a non-evidence-based app for that: A systematic review and mixed methods analysis of depression- and anxiety-related apps that incorporate unrecognized techniques,"Background: Recent studies have utilized available online data to examine the impact of depression- and anxiety-related apps that incorporate evidence-based techniques; however, the impact of apps incorporating non-evidence-based techniques is unknown. Understanding this impact is important in order to assess the potential benefits or harm from their use. Methods: We systematically reviewed apps incorporating relevant techniques aimed at depression- and anxiety-related conditions, found through Google Play search. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses of user reviews, and analyzed app usage utilizing an independent user panel. Results: Compared to apps incorporating evidence-based techniques ( n = 14), user ratings of apps classified as non-evidence-based ( n = 27) were lower (4.0 versus 4.5, p = .001, η² = 0.24) and a smaller percentage of users found these apps to be beneficial for mental health (76.2% versus 100%, p = .003, η² = 0.23). Users found apps incorporating non-evidence-based techniques to be mostly helpful in providing in-the-moment relief; however, some users described these apps as containing content that could be harmful for a person in such a mental state. Limitations: The data do not enable the differentiation of user experiences based on user groups (e.g. according to the severity of symptoms), which should be examined in future studies. Conclusions: This study indicates that depression and anxiety apps incorporating non-evidence-based techniques are viewed less favorably and have more potential to cause harm. However, many users found them helpful mostly in providing in-the-moment relief. Examining user experiences with these apps is an important way to learn about unmet user needs and potential benefits or harm.

Symptoms of depersonalization/derealization are independent risk factors for the development or persistence of psychological distress in the general population: Results from the Gutenberg health study,"Background: Symptoms of depersonalization (DP) and derealization (DR) have a high prevalence in patient and community samples. Previous studies suggested that DP/DR symptoms might represent a marker of disease severity and poor prognosis. However, population-based studies investigating the impact of DP/DR symptoms on the course of depression and anxiety are sparse. Therefore, we aimed to analyze whether symptoms of DP/DR are longitudinally associated with the persistence or incidence of elevated symptoms of depression/anxiety. Methods: We analyzed observational data from a sample of 13.182 participants of the Gutenberg Health Study. The outcomes were elevated symptoms of depression/anxiety at the 2.5 years follow-up as determined by the 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2), the 2-item anxiety scale (GAD-2), and the compound measure PHQ-4 respectively. The predictor was the 2-item Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS-2). Results: 8.7% of the sample were bothered by symptoms of DP/DR at baseline. They had an increased risk for elevated symptoms of depression/anxiety at the 2.5-year follow-up beyond baseline depression/anxiety and other factors. Each point increment in the CDS-2 scale, ranging from 0-6, was associated with a 21% increase of risk for PHQ-4 ≥ 3 at the follow-up (odds ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.32). Limitations: The study was mostly questionnaire-based. Conclusion: Symptoms of DP/DR are independent risk factors for the persistence or incidence of elevated symptoms of depression/anxiety. Symptoms of DP/DR represent an easily assessable risk factor for the course of mental disorders. Treatment and prevention of mental disorders might benefit from the broader recognition of these phenomena.

"Impact of earthquake exposure, family adversity and peer problems on anxiety-related emotional disorders in adolescent survivors three years after the Ya'an earthquake","Background: Traumatic experiences often give rise to an increased risk of anxiety problems in adolescents. This study investigated the anxiety prevalence in adolescent earthquake survivors and the effect of secondary stressors such as bullying, poverty, or being “left behind” by parents working in the cities. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted three years after the 2013 Ya'an (China) earthquake on 6,132 adolescents aged 9 to 18 years from 11 public schools in three severely earthquake affected counties. The participants completed self-report questionnaires that assessed anxiety, earthquake exposure, poverty level, left-behind duration and bullying. Results: Separation anxiety (38.7%) and panic symptoms (32.2%) were found to be the primary contributors to anxiety in this adolescent sample. The regression and structural equation modeling indicated that adolescents who had suffered from high earthquake exposure, peer bullying, being left-behind, or poverty were more likely to report problems in all anxiety subcategories, with females reporting more anxiety symptoms than males. The likelihood of all anxiety disorders except separation anxiety was found to increase with age. Conclusions: This study highlighted the need for post-disaster interventions aimed at minimizing post-earthquake adversity such as peer bullying and specialized psychological services that target subgroups that might be more susceptible to anxiety-related emotional problems. The results could be used to identify possible markers for anxiety problems in children who had not experienced any major traumas.

Attachment and social support mediate the association between childhood maltreatment and depressive symptoms,"Objective: To examine attachment insecurity and low social support as potential mediators of the association between childhood maltreatment (CM) types and depression severity in patients with a lifetime history of major depressive disorders (MDD). Method: Participants with an acute or remitted MDD ( N = 580) completed questionnaires about CM (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), attachment (Relationship Scales Questionnaire), social support (Social Support Questionnaire), and depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory). Mediation and path models with CM types as independent variables, attachment avoidance and anxiety as mediators and depression severity as dependent variable were calculated. In addition, a sequential mediation model with attachment insecurity and social support as mediators of the association between CM and depression was tested. Results: Attachment avoidance and anxiety partially mediated the effect of CM on depression. In the path model including the different CM types, there were significant indirect effects of emotional abuse on depression via attachment anxiety and of emotional neglect on depression via attachment avoidance. Results also supported the hypothesized sequential mediation via attachment insecurity and social support. Limitations: A cross-sectional design with a retrospective self-report measure of CM was used and the developmental timing of exposure to CM was not considered. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the effect of emotional abuse and emotional neglect on depression is partially mediated by attachment avoidance and anxiety. Further, the results support the hypothesis of a sequential mediation via attachment insecurity and social support. Accordingly, attachment insecurity is discussed as a target of psychotherapy for patients with MDD and CM.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome associated with increased anxiety risk: A population-based cohort study in Taiwan,"Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been associated with developing mental disorders in Western populations, but this association is poorly studied in Asians. Hence, using insurance claims data, this study evaluated the anxiety risk in women with PCOS. Methods: Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 7026 women aged 15–49 years with newly diagnosed PCOS without anxiety in 1998–2013 as the PCOS cohort. We also randomly selected 28,104 women without PCOS and anxiety as the comparison cohort, which was frequency-matched to cases by age and index year. Determined by incidence and Cox method, the hazard ratio (HR) of anxiety and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association with PCOS were estimated after a 16-year follow-up. Results: The incidence of anxiety was 19.5% higher in the PCOS cohort than in the comparison cohort (15.3 vs. 12.8 per 1000 person-years), with an adjusted HR of 1.18 (95% CI = 1.07–1.30). For women with both PCOS and comorbid depression, it was 32.1 per 1000 person-years, with an adjusted HR of 2.24 (95% CI = 1.24–4.06), compared with those without PCOS or depression. Moreover, it was 48.0 per 1000 person-years for women with depression alone (adjusted HR = 3.46; 95% CI = 2.58–4.64). Limitations: We used a diagnostic code to identify PCOS cases without reference to pathology records. Miscoding might have occurred in the database. Conclusions: PCOS is associated with an increased risk of developing anxiety independently. Comorbid depression could increase the risk further. Our findings provide vital information for Asian women to cope with anxiety.

"Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and other mental health problems following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: The 2010 earthquake in Haiti caused significant human and material damages, thousands of deaths and injuries, and 1.5 million homeless. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to synthesize research on the prevalence and factors associated with PTSD, depression, anxiety symptoms, and other mental health problems among survivors. Methods: We searched six databases and retained 50 articles for the systematic review, 28 of which were included in three random effects meta-analyses on the prevalence of PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms in survivors. Results: Following the earthquake, more than one out of four individuals (28.44%,CI 95%,17.68%−42.37%; k = 24) reported severe symptoms of PTSD, one out of three reported severe symptoms of depression (32.16%,CI 95%,23.60%−42.11%; K = 14), and one out of five reported severe symptoms of anxiety (20.49%,CI 95%,15.74%−26.24%;k = 5). Studies revealed important rates of other mental health problems (including psychological distress and disturbance, suicidal ideations, and increased alcohol consumption) in survivors. Females were 41.38% more likely than males to experience severe symptoms of PTSD (OR = 1.41,CI 95%,1.22−1.64). Time was a moderator for depression and anxiety but not for PTSD, while the average age of participants only moderated depression. Limitations: The studies included are observational and most used self-reported measures. Conclusions: In a global context where natural disasters tripled since 1980, this first systematic review showed that human and material damages associated with the earthquake were sufficiently traumatic to induce severe symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems. Clinical and research implications are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2020
Latent profile analysis of exercise addiction symptoms in Brazilian adolescents: Association with health-related variables,"Background: The purpose of the present study is to identify profiles of adolescent exercisers based on exercise addiction symptoms (EA), and to examine differences in several health-related variables potentially related to EA across these profiles. Methods: A sample consisting of 618 adolescents, aged from 13 to 17 years, completed a questionnaire assessing EA, exercise characteristics (i.e., frequency and intensity of exercise), depression, body image (i.e., body appreciation and social physique anxiety), and disordered eating (i.e., concerns about eating and body weight gain as well as restrictive and compensatory practices). Results: The profile analysis identified three EA profiles, which were labelled: low-risk, high-risk with conflict and high-risk without conflict. Based on their scores for the health-related variables considered, the low-risk profile emerged as the least problematic; this increasing in the high-risk without conflict and even more so in the high-risk with conflict profiles. Nevertheless, individuals belonging to the high-risk without conflict profile showed similar body appreciation scores but lower social physique anxiety scores than those belonging to the low-risk profile. Limitations: The study is limited by both its cross-sectional design and the self-reported nature of the collected data. Conclusions: Conflict symptom may be relevant in explaining the differences in certain health-related variables between adolescents showing similarly high levels of EA.

Anxiety predicts dyadic sleep characteristics in couples experiencing insomnia but not in couples without sleep disorders,"Background: Anxiety and depression are commonly comorbid with sleep problems. Despite growing acknowledgement that bedpartners are important determinants of sleep quality, few studies have explored mental health as a risk factor for disrupted sleep of the bedpartner. We examined whether anxiety or depression symptoms predicted an individual's sleep or their bedpartner's sleep, in couples where one partner experienced insomnia and in couples without sleep disorders. Methods: Fifty-two bed-sharing couples where one individual had insomnia (“Patient”), and 55 non-sleep-disordered couples completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Sleep was monitored for seven nights. Actor-Partner Interdependence Models assessed whether anxiety or depression symptoms predicted individual or dyadic sleep (wake transmission). Results: Greater anxiety symptoms predicted increased vulnerability to being woken by their bedpartner, as well as increased frequency of waking their bedpartner up during the night in Patients with insomnia, but not in non-sleep-disordered couples. Neither anxiety nor depression symptoms predicted an individual's or their bedpartner's sleep efficiency in either subsample. However, ISI was positively predicted by own anxiety and depression symptoms for Patients with insomnia and in non-sleep-disordered couples. Limitations: The non-sleep-disordered subsample experienced only mild symptoms of anxiety and depression, potentially reducing predictive power. Conclusions: Anxiety may help reveal social determinants of sleep in couples experiencing insomnia. These data underscore the importance of considering sleep, the bedpartner, and affective symptoms in mental health and sleep assessments.

Resilience is associated with post-stoke depression in Chinese stroke survivors: A longitudinal study,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 274 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2020-50418-169). In the original article, there was an error in the order of affiliations. The correction order is given in the erratum.] Background: Optimal strategies for prevention and treatment for post-stroke depression (PSD) remain unclear and a greater understanding of effect of resilience on PSD is promising. The aim was to examine the association between baseline resilience and depression at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, which contributes to early detection and management of PSD. Methods: A total of 217 ischemic stroke survivors were recruited in two tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China from February 2017 to January 2018. The Chinese version of Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) was used to assess resilience at acute hospitalization. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was employed to ascertain baseline anxiety, baseline depression, and post-discharge depression. Social-demographic and disease-related information were obtained from participants’ self-report and medical records. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine which factors were independently associated with PSD. Results: The prevalence of depression at baseline was 21.2% and at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge was 34.4%, 33.2%, and 29.2%, respectively. Logistics regression analyses indicated that resilience may independently predict PSD at 1 month (OR: 0.22, 95%CI: 0.097, 0.518), 3 months (OR:0.302, 95%CI: 0.151, 0.607), and 6 months (OR: 0.03, 95%CI: 0.006, 0.153) after controlling for social-demographics, disease-related characteristics, baseline anxiety, and baseline depression. Limitations: Non-multicenter survey and mild stroke severity may affect the generalization of these findings. Moreover, response bias should be acknowledged because some participants were read questionnaires out aloud. Conclusion: Resilience is independently associated with PSD at different timepoints. Our findings reveal the important role of resilience as a protective factor against PSD.

Relationship of anxiety and depression symptoms with the different domains of physical activity in breast cancer survivors,"Background Physical activity (PA) has shown benefits in the mental health of breast cancer (BC) survivors. However, it is unclear if different domains of PA are related to the emotional well-being of this population. The objective of this study was to verify the relationship between different domains of PA [occupational, exercise/sport participation and leisure time/commuting] with symptoms of anxiety and depression in BC survivors. Methods It is a cross-sectional study, composed of 128 women breast cancer survivor, in which the socioeconomic class was evaluated through the questionnaire of the Brazilian Association of Research Companies (ABEP), PA level was evaluated through the Baecke questionnaire, and, symptoms of anxiety and depression were evaluated through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results It was verified that occupational PA related to anxiety ( B = 1.44 [95% CI: 0.11; 2.76]) and leisure time/commuting PA was negatively related to depression ( B = -0.99 [95% CI: -1.64;-0.34]), even after adjustment of analysis by age, marital status, and socioeconomic status. There was no correlation between exercise/sport participation with scores of anxiety and depression in BC survivors. Physical activity at leisure time/commuting was negatively related with depression in BC survivors with mastectomy ( B = -1.20 [95% CI:-1.92; -0.47). Limitations The difficulty of recruiting the studied population and the absence of subsidy for participation in the study are factors to be considerate. Conclusions Occupational PA may not to be indicated in the management of emotional disorders in BC survivors; however, leisure time/commuting may be recommended to contribute to the mental well-being of this population.

"Women with major depressive disorder, irrespective of comorbid anxiety disorders, show blunted bilateral frontal responses during win and loss anticipation","Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) studies suggest that major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with lower left than right frontal brain activity (asymmetry), a pattern appearing stronger in women than men, and when elicited during emotionally-relevant paradigms versus an uncontrolled resting state. However, it is unclear whether this asymmetry pattern generalizes to the common presentation of MDD with co-occurring anxiety. Moreover, asymmetry may differ for anxiety subtypes, wherein anxious apprehension (AnxApp: worry characteristic of generalized anxiety disorder) appears left-lateralized, but anxious arousal (AnxAro: panic characteristic of social anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and panic disorders) may be right-lateralized. Methods: This analysis attempted to replicate frontal EEG asymmetry patterns using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants completed clinical interviews and a monetary incentive delay (MID) task during fMRI recording. We compared five groups of right-handed women from the Tulsa 1000 study, MDD ( n = 40), MDD-AnxApp ( n = 26), MDD-AnxAro ( n = 34), MDD-Both (with AnxApp and AnxAro; n = 26), and healthy controls (CTL; n = 24), as a function of MID anticipation condition (no win/loss, win, loss) and hemisphere on frontal blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Results: CTL exhibited higher bilateral superior, middle, and inferior middle frontal gyrus BOLD signal than the four MDD groups for high arousal (win and loss) conditions. However, frontal attenuations were unrelated to current depression/anxiety symptoms, suggestive of a trait as opposed to a state marker. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional analysis restricted to women. Conclusions: Reduced prefrontal cortex recruitment during processing of both positively and negatively valenced stimuli is consistent with the emotion context insensitivity theory of MDD.

Afraid of injustice? Justice sensitivity is linked to general anxiety and social phobia symptoms,"Background: Justice sensitivity (JS), the tendency to perceive and adversely respond to injustice, is related to externalizing problem behavior. Less is known about relations with internalizing problems including affective disorders, such as social phobia or general anxiety. Methods: We had N = 904 participants rate their JS, general anxiety and social phobia symptoms, and control variables. Results: All JS subscales were positively correlated with general anxiety and social phobia symptoms. Victim JS predicted both anxiety measures beyond the control variables, beneficiary JS predicted social phobia symptoms. These links were fully mediated by negative affect and fear of rejection and criticism. Limitations: The present study used cross-sectional data and requires replication with longitudinal data. Influences from anxiety symptoms on JS are also possible. Conclusions: The present findings indicate that JS is linked to anxiety symptoms in the general population, irrespective of the perspective from which individuals are justice sensitive and beyond other well-established risk factors. JS may be a vulnerability and a stress factor that may add to developing and maintaining anxiety and phobia symptoms. Therefore, JS may deserve consideration in anxiety research and treatment.

"Cannabis use during adolescence and the occurrence of depression, suicidality and anxiety disorder across adulthood: Findings from a longitudinal cohort study over 30 years","Objective: To examine the association between cannabis use in adolescence and the occurrence of depression, suicidality and anxiety disorders during adulthood. Methods: A stratified population-based cohort of young adults (n = 591) from Zurich, Switzerland, was retrospectively assessed at age 19/20 for cannabis use in adolescence. The occurrence of depression, suicidality and anxiety disorders was repeatedly assessed via semi-structured clinical interviews at the ages of 20/21, 22/23, 27/28, 29/30, 34/35, 40/41, and 49/50. Associations were controlled for various covariates, including socio-economic deprivation in adolescence as well as repeated time-varying measures of substance abuse during adulthood. Results: About a quarter (24%) reported cannabis use during adolescence; 11% started at age 15/16 or younger and 13% between the ages of 16/17 and 19/20. In the adjusted multivariable model, cannabis use during adolescence was associated with adult depression (aOR = 1.70, 95%-CI = 1.24–2.32) and suicidality (aOR = 1.65, 95%-CI = 1.11–2.47), but not anxiety disorders (aOR = 1.10, 95%-CI = 0.82–1.48). First use at age 15/16 and younger (as against first use between age 16/17 and 19/20 and no use) and frequent use in adolescence (as against less frequent use and no use) were associated with a higher risk of depression in adult life. Conclusions: In this longitudinal cohort study over 30-years, cannabis use during adolescence was associated with depression and suicidality in adult life. Young age at first use and high frequency of use in adolescence may particularly increase the risk of depression in adulthood. All associations were independent of cannabis abuse and other substance abuse during adulthood.

Adolescent and young adult mental health problems and infant offspring behavior: Findings from a prospective intergenerational cohort study,"Background: Parental depression and anxiety have been consistently linked to offspring behavior problems across childhood. However, many of the risks for these common mental health problems are established well before pregnancy. This study takes advantage of rare, prospective data to examine relations between parental mental health histories (from adolescence onwards) and next generation offspring behavior problems. Methods: Data were drawn from a multi-generational cohort study that has followed Australians from infancy to adulthood since 1983, and 1171 of their offspring assessed prospectively from pregnancy. Generalized estimating equation models were used to estimate associations between parents’ depression/anxiety symptoms in adolescence and young adulthood and offspring behavior problems at 1 year. Results: In analyses of 648 mother-infant and 423 father-infant dyads, after adjustment for confounders and concurrent mental health problems, mean behavior problem scores in infants of mothers with a history of mental health problems in both adolescence and young adulthood were over half a standard deviation higher than those of mothers without problems during these periods, B = 2.19, 95% CI 1.21 – 3.17, β = 0.52. No association was observed for fathers. Limitations: We only included infants born to participants aged 29–35 years and we assessed behavior problems via parent-report. Conclusions: A mother's history of persistent depression and anxiety from adolescence to young adulthood can predict higher levels of behavior problems in her infant. Findings support calls for greater policy and prevention focus on preconception and postnatal mental health, particularly a mother's early emotional health history, prior to parenthood.

Suicidal ideation and affect lability in single and multiple suicidal attempters with Major Depressive Disorder: An exploratory network analysis,"Introduction: A better understanding of the specific contribution of risk factors to suicidal behavior could arise from analyzing suicidal ideation (SI) in clinical samples, and comparing single versus multiple suicide attempters through contemporary methods allowing complex and dynamical analyses of multiple and simultaneously interacting suicide risk factors. Method: We explored associations among suicidal ideation (SI), affect lability and other suicide risk factors in 323 suicidal attempters diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). We analyzed the network structure and centrality of the total sample, and compared single versus multiple attempters and subjects with low and high suicidal ideation. Results: SI was connected with anxiety (trait) and hopelessness. Central nodes for global and specific groups were affect lability (from anxiety to depression), anxiety as a trait, and harm avoidance. We observed some specific differences between clinical profiles of repeaters and non-repeaters and significant network density between high and low SI. Limitations: Because our cross-sectional design, we cannot establish casual relationships among variables. We only examined associations at group level but not at single subject level. Conclusions: Affect lability (mainly the shifts from anxiety to depression) and trait anxiety were central in each estimated network. These symptoms might be suitable targets for early detecting and treating suicidal patients.

The associations of interpersonal sensitivity with mental distress and trait aggression in early adulthood: A prospective cohort study,"Background: To explore the longitudinal associations of interpersonal sensitivity (IS) with mental distress and trait aggression among participants passing through adolescence into adulthood. Methods: A total of 306 participants were recruited at baseline and received a 24-month follow-up. Questionnaires investigating sociodemographics; IS; depression, anxiety, and stress; and trait aggression were used. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression and cross-lagged analyses were also performed. Results: At base, 22.5%, 18.3%, 24.2%, and 9.2% of the participants reported higher levels of IS, depressive, anxious, and stressful symptoms. IS at baseline was a partial risk factor for new problems, including anxiety, stress, and anger at follow-up. Newly developed or persistent IS was significantly associated with ongoing symptoms. Discontinued IS, however, only resolved the association with stress and anxiety symptoms. Similarly, newly developed or persistent IS was significantly associated with increased persistence of some problems (anxiety symptoms and physical aggression), while the discontinuation of IS was associated with a lessening of these outcomes. Cross-lagged analyses revealed bidirectional associations of IS with anxiety symptom and stress symptom. Limitations: All subjects were recruited from one medical college, which could limit applicability. This study had a relatively small sample size. Self-reported questionnaires can lead to recall bias. Further research is needed to test causality. Conclusions: IS can predict adolescents’ newly developed partial mental distress and aggression. Our findings highlight the crucial role of early recognition of both higher levels of interpersonal sensitivity and associated behavioral problems.

"Perceptions, clinical characteristics, and other factors associated with prolonged and high daily dose of benzodiazepine use among patients with anxiety or depressive disorders","Background: Benzodiazepines (BZDs) have been widely used to treat anxiety; however, the risk of adverse health effects caused by their long-term use is high. This study examined the factors associated with the duration and higher daily dose of BZDs use among a population with anxiety or depressive disorders. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used. Patients from a psychiatric outpatient department who had been prescribed BZDs were recruited. Data were collected from 250 patients. Results: Nearly 94% of patients were long-term BZDs users. The mean duration of BZDs use was 5.5 years; and mean defined daily dose (DDD) of BZDs use, converted to diazepam milligram equivalent (DDD), was 1.53 DME-DDD. Patients who knew more about alternative treatments were less prone to use BZD longer. Patients aged 65 years or older and those with difficulty falling asleep were more prone to use BZDs longer. Patients who were currently taking BZDs at higher daily dose were those who felt more depressed, prescribed second generation antipsychotics, suffered from disrupted sleep, less aware of alternative treatments, had comorbid chronic physical illness, and were current smokers. Limitations: The cross-sectional study design limited its ability to confirm causal relationships. Conclusions: Long-term and excessive daily dose of BZDs use in patients with depressive or anxiety disorders needs to be noted. Providing information or program of non-pharmacological treatment in reducing anxiety and improving specific sleep disturbance is suggested. Elderly, suffering from depressive mood, had comorbid chronic physical illness need to be targeted for further intervention.

Spanish Adaptation of the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS-II) and a study of its psychometric properties,"Background: The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS-II) is composed of 99 items organized into 18 specific scales that provides dimensional assessment of depression, anxiety and bipolar symptoms. To date, IDAS-II is only available in the English and Turkish population. The main purpose of this study is to adapt the IDAS-II to the Spanish population and to assess the psychometric properties. Methods: Participants included community adults (n = 620) and college students (n = 378). All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Hypomania Check List-32, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version and Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised, in addition to the Spanish version of the IDAS-II. Results: The results indicate good internal consistency and high temporal stability of the Spanish version of the IDAS-II. Confirmatory factor analyses show for the first time that the three-factor structure of the IDAS-II (Distress, Obsessions/Fear, and Positive Mood) loads on a second order factor, labeled “Internalizing” according to the Hierarchical Taxonomy Of Psychopathology (HiTOP). Limitations: Study was conducted exclusively on student and community samples and some of the measures used as gold-standard have presented limitations Conclusions: According to previous studies, the results supported the convergent and discriminant validity of the majority of IDAS-II scales. IDAS-II is useful in assessing the severity of depression, anxiety and bipolar symptoms in research contexts in a Spanish population according to the HiTOP model. However, more evidence is required to prove the adequate functioning of the IDAS-II in clinical samples.

Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and their links to depression and anxiety in clinic- and community-based pediatric samples: A network analysis,"Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common in children with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and associated with more severe OCD, greater impairment, and worse treatment outcome. Beyond twin studies showing that genetic factors contribute to the high co-occurrence, few studies have examined how OCD, depression, and anxiety are linked in youth, and current studies often fail to account for OCD and anxiety heterogeneity. Methods: Network analysis was used to investigate how OCD were linked to depression and anxiety in multinational youth diagnosed with OCD (total n = 419) and in school-recruited, community-based samples of youth (total n = 2 991). Results: Initial results aligned with earlier work showing that severity of obsession-related symptoms are important in linking OCD to depression in youth with OCD. However, when symptom content of OCD (e.g., washing, ordering) was fully taken into account and when measures of anxiety were included, specific OCD symptom dimensions (primarily obsessing and doubting/checking) were linked to specific anxiety dimensions (primarily panic and generalized anxiety) which in turn were linked to depression. These results were replicated in three separate community-based samples from Chile, Italy, and Spain using different measures of anxiety and depression. Limitations: Cross-sectional data were analyzed which precludes causal inference. Self-report measures were used. Conclusions: Youth with OCD with symptoms related to doubting/checking and obsessing should be carefully assessed for symptoms of panic and generalized anxiety. Non-responders to standard OCD treatment may benefit from interventions targeting panic and generalized anxiety, but more research is needed to test this hypothesis.

Change in neural response during emotion regulation is associated with symptom reduction in cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders,"Background: Anxiety disorders are debilitating conditions that can be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Increased understanding of the neurobiological correlates of CBT may inform treatment improvements and personalization. Prior neuroimaging studies point to treatment-related changes in anterior cingulate, insula, and other prefrontal regions during emotional processing, yet to date the impact of CBT on neural substrates of “top down” emotion regulation remains understudied. We examined the relationship between symptom changes assessed over the course of CBT treatment sessions and pre- to post-treatment neural change during an emotion regulation task. Method: In the current study, a sample of 30 participants with panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder completed a reappraisal-based emotion regulation task while undergoing fMRI before and after completing CBT. Results: Reduced activation in the parahippocampal gyrus was observed from pre- to post-treatment during periods of reducing versus maintaining emotion. Parahippocampal activation was associated with change in symptoms over the course of treatment and post-treatment responder status. Results suggest that, from pre- to post-CBT, participants demonstrated downregulation of neural responses during effortful cognitive emotion regulation. Limitations: Effects were not observed in frontoparietal systems as would be hypothesized based on prior literature, suggesting that treatment-related change could occur outside of fronto-parietal and limbic regions that are central to most models of neural functioning in anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Continued work is needed to better understand how CBT affects cognitive control and memory processes that are hypothesized to support reappraisal as a strategy for emotion regulation.

Structural abnormalities in nucleus accumbens in patients with panic disorder,"Background: Although the pathogenesis of panic attacks has been well studied in patients with panic disorder (PD), the neurobiological basis of the long-term fear memories and avoidance behavior that are often observed in PD have not been well investigated. Recent animal studies have suggested that nucleus accumbens (NAcc) plays an important role in neurobiological basis of long-term fear memories and avoidance behavior. Methods: Thirty-eight patients with PD and 38 matched healthy control subjects (HC) participated in this study. Differences in relative volumes and shape deformations of NAcc were evaluated between groups. Correlation analyses were conducted to quantify the association between structural abnormalities in the NAcc and trait, state anxiety measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: Significant volume reductions were observed in the bilateral NAcc in the patients with PD, relative to the HC. In terms of shape differences, the PD patients demonstrated significant inward deformation of the NAcc bilaterally, compared to the HC. Degree of shape deformation in the right NAcc was associated with higher scores of the STAI-Trait, and STAI-State measures in the PD patients. Limitations: All the patients received medication such as Psychotropic drug. Conclusion: Patients with PD showed reduced volumes in the NAcc, especially in lateral regions, compared with HC. Furthermore, shape deformation in the right NAcc was associated with trait anxiety and state anxiety, which has been associated with avoidance behavior.

The influence of pre and postnatal adversity on depression and anxiety over two decades,"Introduction: Perinatal and later postnatal adversity (e.g., child sexual abuse) are predictors of psychopathology across the lifespan. However, little is known about the impact of the joint effects of perinatal and postnatal adversity on the longitudinal trajectories of mental health problems from adolescence through adulthood. Method: We utilized data from a prospective, longitudinal birth cohort of extremely low birth weight (ELBW; &lt; 1000 g) survivors and normal birth weight (NBW; &gt; 2500 g) control participants. Self-report data on internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (antisocial) problems were collected at 12–16, 22–26, and 30–35 years of age. Results: A birth weight by child sexual abuse (CSA) interaction was observed such that ELBW survivors exposed to CSA had higher levels of internalizing problems from adolescence through adulthood than NBW participants exposed to CSA. Differences remained significant after adjustment for covariates. Likewise, ELBW survivors exposed to CSA had higher levels of internalizing problems from adolescence through adulthood than ELBW participants who were not exposed to CSA. Limitations: Findings are limited by sample attrition due to the longitudinal nature of the study spanning over 30 years as well as the retrospective nature of child sexual abuse reporting. Conclusions: Exposure to both perinatal and later postnatal adversity leads to persistently higher internalizing problems than exposure to either adversity alone over more than two decades. These findings suggest that individuals exposed to perinatal adversity may be especially vulnerable to, and persistently affected by, childhood adversity, particularly in the form of depression and anxiety.

The centrality of depression and anxiety symptoms in major depressive disorder determined using a network analysis,"Background: Comorbid anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent and closely linked with poorer treatment outcomes, chronicity, and hospitalization in major depressive disorder (MDD). Our study aimed to estimate the network of depression and anxiety symptoms that was developed based on a sample of MDD patients. Methods: We constructed a network of the 21 Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) symptoms and 21 Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) symptoms in 223 patients with MDD who were beginning psychiatric treatment. In addition, each of the depression and anxiety symptoms was considered to be an ordered categorical variable ranging in value from 0 to 3. Results: The three depression symptoms including loss of energy, loss of interest, and worthlessness and the seven anxiety symptoms including faintness or lightheadedness, feeling of choking, feeling scared, fear of the worst happening, nervousness, inability to relax, and feeling shaky were identified as the ten most central nodes within a network of depression and anxiety symptoms. The inter-connection between irritability and nervousness was a strong trans-diagnostic edge within the network of depression and anxiety symptoms. Limitations: Because our study was designed in a cross-sectional manner, the networks were estimated undirectionally. Conclusions: Our findings show that depression symptoms are not more central than anxiety symptoms within an estimated network structure of symptoms in patients with MDD. Moreover, the inter-connection between irritability and nervousness may suggests a probable trans-diagnostic association in MDD symptomatology.

"Depression, anxiety, and stress as a function of psychological strains: Towards an etiological theory of mood disorders and psychopathologies","Background: The etiological factors of mood disorders and psychopathologies are understudied. In this paper, we explored whether social psychological strains are related to depression, anxiety, and stress in non-clinical populations. Methods: 6,305 college students (39.3% men; 60.7% women) from six Chinese provincial-level jurisdictions completed a paper-and-pencil survey with Psychological Strain Scales (PSS-40) and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21), both validated in Chinese populations. Results: Both PSS-40 and DASS-21 have high internal consistency reliabilities, and are highly correlated with each other. Hence, Chinese college students with greater psychological strains (value, aspiration, deprivation, or coping) have greater depression, anxiety, and stress. These results still held after controlling for relevant socio-demographic variables in the multiple regression models. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study, and the sample only included several provinces in mainland China, not a representative sample of all of them. Conclusions: Mood disorders and psychopathologies are linked to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The results of this study extend the Strain Theory of Suicide from explaining the risk factors of suicidality to mood disorders and psychopathologies. Hence, these findings can inform prevention measures among college students, and possibly the general population.

Common mental disorders among young refugees in Sweden: The role of education and duration of residency,"Background: Studies investigating risks of common mental disorders (CMDs) in refugee youth are sparse. The current study examined health care use due to CMDs in unaccompanied and accompanied refugee youth and Swedish-born, and the role of education and residency duration. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study included 743,671 individuals (whereof 33,501 refugees) between 19 and 25 years, residing in Sweden in 2009. Refugees were classified as unaccompanied/accompanied. Risk estimates of CMDs, measured as health care use and antidepressant treatment, between 2010 and 2016 were calculated as adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Highest attained education in 2009, and residency duration were examined as potential modifiers. Results: Compared to Swedish-born youth, refugees had a lower risk of treated major depressive and anxiety disorders (aHR): 0.73 (95% CI 0.68–0.78) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.70–0.79) respectively), but a higher risk for posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD). Compared to Swedish-born, unaccompanied had an 8-fold elevated risk for PTSD (aHR: 8.40, 95% CI 6.16–11.47) and accompanied refugees had a nearly 3-fold risk of PTSD (aHR: 2.78, 95% CI 2.29–3.37). Rates of PTSD decreased with years spent in Sweden. The risk of CMDs decreased with increasing education. Limitations: The study lacked information on pre-migration factors. There may further be a potential misclassification of untreated CMDs. Conclusion: Refugees had a lower risk of treated depressive and anxiety disorders but a higher risk for PTSD. In refugees, the rates of anxiety disorders increased slightly over time whereas the rates of PTSD decreased. Last, low education was an important predictor for CMDs.

Age-dependent association of polymorphisms in the promoter and 5′-untranslated region of the norepinephrine transporter gene with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Norepinephrine transporter (NET), which regulates synaptic norepinephrine for noradrenergic signaling, is involved in the pathogenesis of anxiety, while expression of the NET gene differs at different ages. Here, we examine whether genetic variants in the NET gene are associated, in an age-specific manner, with increased risk of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), one of the most disabling anxiety disorders. Methods: Three common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter (rs168924: A/G; rs2242446: T/C) and 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) (rs2397771: G/C) of the NET gene were genotyped in 2,317 Han-Chinese participants (791 GAD patients and 1,526 controls; age: 20–65). Potential confounding factors, such as gender, stress levels and psychiatric comorbidities, were included as covariates. Results: An interaction between age and NET genotypes and haplotypes was found for the risk of GAD. In the younger participants, rs168924 minor allele G homozygotes had the lowest incidence of GAD; however, older subjects displayed an inverse pattern, with homozygous G/G carriers presenting the highest prevalence of GAD. Additionally, younger individuals carrying 2 copies of the GGT haplotype composed of rs2397771-rs168924-rs2242446 had the lowest rate of GAD. However, those with 2 copies of the same haplotype exhibited the highest risk of GAD in the older groups. Limitations: Only 3 common SNPs in the promoter and 5′-UTR of the NET gene were analyzed. Conclusions: Our findings are the first to demonstrate that potentially functional SNPs in the NET promoter and 5′-UTR are associated with an increased risk of GAD, and that such associations are determined in an age-specific way.

Comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) at early stages of the pregnancy. A multicultural cross-sectional study,"Introduction: When anxiety and depression are comorbid (CAD), symptoms are more severe and the response to treatments is worse. Given the links between mood disorders and poor perinatal outcomes, CAD and its correlates deserve special clinical attention during pregnancy. The main objective of this study was to learn about the prevalence of comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) in early stages of the pregnancy analyzing the relationship between CAD and cultural and sociodemographic factors. Methods: We have studied a multicultural sample of 514 Turkish and Spanish pregnant women (264 in Málaga, 102 in Istambul and 148 in Antalya) recruited at the moment of their first pregnancy medical check-up between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. These women completed a questionnaire that included the Turkish or Spanish validated versions of the Edinburg postnatal depression scale (EDS), the state and trait anxiety scale (STAI) and a series of questions related to health status, general mood, and sociodemographic variables. Results: We found a CAD prevalence rate of 26.9% and a significant higher prevalence rate among Turkish women (47.6%) when compared to Spanish participants (9.5%) ( p &lt; 0.001). The multivariate analysis showed that the lack of someone who provided emotional support was the variable that best predicted CAD symptoms. Conclusion: The CAD prevalence rate was high and significant differences were found depending on the geographic and cultural context.

High-frequency cardiopulmonary coupling during sleep correlates with memory in depressed patients: A pilot study,"Background: It has been demonstrated that a reduction in the amount of high-frequency cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC) is indicative of unstable sleep in unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Considering the close relationship between sleep quality and memory consolidation, this study sought to investigate the potential of high-frequency CPC as a novel biomarker for objective evaluation of memory impairment in MDD. Methods: A total of 64 depressed patients and 35 healthy controls were included in this cross-sectional study. High-frequency coupling (HFC) was assessed by electrocardiogram-based CPC analysis using a portable sleep-respiration monitor during sleep for one night. The next day, subjects completed the cognition assessment with the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). The 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD₁₇) and the Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety (HAMA) were used to evaluate the severity of depression and anxiety in each patient, respectively. Results: There was no significant difference in the proportion of HFC between depressed patients and healthy controls. In patients with low HFC proportion (&lt; 35%), severe anxiety could significantly decrease HFC proportion. The HFC proportion positively correlated with immediate and delayed memory in depressed patients. Further analysis showed that patients with low HFC proportion may have worse delayed memory. Limitations: The lack of prior exposure to the monitoring equipment and procedure could have generated artefacts that would have disappeared after habituation. Conclusions: These results support a positive correlation between the HFC proportion and memory in depressed patients. Further research is required to explore the clinical implications of these findings.

Generalized anxiety disorder is prospectively associated with decreased levels of interleukin-6 and adiponectin among individuals from the community,"Background: Anxiety disorders have been related to cardiovascular diseases via low-grade inflammation, but longitudinal studies on the association between generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and inflammatory biomarkers are sparse. Furthermore, no studies have examined the association between GAD and the “cardio-protective” adipocytokine adiponectin in this context so far. Methods: In a Swiss population-based sample of 2,415 adults participating in baseline and follow-up exams (mean follow-up duration = 5.5 years), we diagnosed a total of 55 persons (2.3%) with GAD using a validated semi-structured psychiatric interview. We prospectively examined the relation between GAD and circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and adiponectin), in linear regression models, statistically controlled for the baseline inflammatory marker, socioeconomic status, cardiovascular risk factors, health behaviors, and psychiatric disorders. Results: Compared to those without GAD, individuals with GAD had lower IL-6 (β = -0.249, 95%-CI -0.493-(-0.004), p = 0.046), and adiponectin (β = -0.264, 95%-CI -0.482-(-0.045), p = 0.018) levels at follow-up after adjustment for all covariates. Moreover, GAD was unrelated to several other inflammatory measures. Conclusion: Individuals with GAD do not seem to exhibit chronic low-grade inflammation, suggesting different underlying biobehavioral mechanisms to those from other anxiety disorders. Low adiponectin levels may be linked to symptoms of GAD through brain areas directly involved in the processing of fear and anxiety.

Adult separation anxiety disorder: The human-animal bond,"Background: The introduction of an adult onset Separation Anxiety Disorder in the DSM-V recognises that separation anxiety can occur at any stage across the lifespan. In this paper, we examine whether adult separation anxiety, which is known to occur when people are apart from other people close to them, can also develop when people are separated from animal companions. The social and individual psychological correlates of this reported phenomenon are examined. Methods: Participants ( N = 313, aged 18–76, M = 41.89 years), completed demographic information and questionnaires measuring separation anxiety from companion animals and humans, attachment towards companion animals and humans, and social support. Results: Significant positive relationships were observed between separation anxiety from humans, people substitution and separation anxiety from animals. Participants with greater separation anxiety from animals also reported less social support and greater attachment anxiety involving humans. People substitution was also positively related to greater animal-related separation anxiety. Associations were generally weaker when cats were identified as the principal companion animal. Participants without children reported significantly less attachment-related avoidance (human); less perceived social support; greater people substitution; and, greater separation anxiety towards companion animals. Separation anxiety from humans, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety accounted for 41% of variance in separation anxiety from animals. Limitations: The correlational design does not allow the investigation of causal associations. Conclusions: A strong, positive relationship was observed between human-related separation anxiety and animal-related separation anxiety, which was significantly stronger for people with lower levels of social support.

Response to the commentary: Adolescent social anxiety and clock disruption. A commentary,"Reply by the current authors to the comments made by Yvan Touitoua et al.

However, the authors disagree with the commentators claim that we have ignored the very important, if not major, role of the regular exposure of adolescents to artificial light at night and its deleterious impact on health. We invite the authors to consider the possible causal chain order among social anxiety, screen time before sleep, sleep quality and depressive symptoms. Importantly, one of the ultimate goals of an epidemiological observational study is to provide relevant insights for designing effective interventions improving the participants’ health. In this case, we would still recommend interventions to target social anxiety, which would impact sleep quality, depressive symptoms and adiposity in adolescents according to our study. It is also likely that adolescents who decrease their social anxiety levels would decrease their screen time before going to sleep.

Adolescent social anxiety and clock disruption. A commentary,"Comments on an article by Rodrigo Antunes Lima et al.(see record 2019-64167-029). In the article, Antunes Lima et al evaluated the cross sectional synergic relationship between social anxiety, poor sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and body fatness in a cohort of Brazilian adolescents. The authors reported that social anxiety was positively associated with depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality, and body fatness and that poor sleep quality was associated with depressive symptoms. They concluded that social anxiety plays a major role in the health of adolescents. The article by Antunes Lima et al. examined the relationship between social anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor sleep, and being overweight in adolescents. All up, the exposure of children and adolescents to artificial light in the evening has a number of negative health consequences that correspond to social desynchronization or chronodisruption of the circadian system. This should be considered in studies of adolescent social anxiety. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Comment/Reply",2020
Type 3 adenylyl cyclase in the main olfactory epithelium participates in depression-like and anxiety-like behaviours,"Background: Deficiency of olfaction is thought to be associated with depression, and type 3 adenylyl cyclase (AC₃) genetic knockout and forebrain knockout mice show depression-like behaviours. AC₃ is expressed in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and hippocampus, which plays an important role in olfactory signal transduction. However, it is unclear whether AC₃ in the MOE also plays a role in the pathogenesis of depression. Thus, we aimed to study the relationship between AC₃ in the MOE and the pathogenesis of depression. Methods: We obtained anosmic mice by intranasal perfusion of zinc sulphate (ZnSO₄) (ZnSO₄ mice), and distinctively knocked down AC₃ in the MOE (AC 3KD/MOE mice) by CRISPR/cas9 technology. Behavioural tests related to depression and anxiety were employed to evaluate the depression- and anxiety-like behaviours of mice. The mRNA and protein expressions of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine receptors (Drds), and N-Methyl D-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (GluN2B) in the hippocampus of mice were investigated by qPCR and western blotting to explore the mechanism of depression and anxiety caused by AC₃ in the MOE, preliminarily. Results: Compared with NaCl mice, ZnSO₄ mice exhibited depression-like behaviours in tail suspension tests (TST), forced swimming tests, and social (FST) interaction tests (SIT), but showed no anxiety-like behaviours in anxiety-related behavioural tests. The mRNA and protein expressions of Drd₃ and GluN2B in the hippocampus of ZnSO₄ mice were significantly downregulated. Compared with the negative control mice (NC mice), AC 3KD/MOE mice showed depression-like behaviours in TST, FST, and SIT tests, anxiety-like behaviours in light/dark transition test, elevated-plus maze test, and novelty-suppressed feeding test. The protein expressions of Drd₃, TH, and GluN2B were significantly downregulated in the hippocampus. Limitations: We did not further demonstrate that AC₃ in the MOE causes depression through the dopaminergic nervous system with dopamine or dopamine receptor agonists. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that intranasal infusion of ZnSO₄ can cause depression-like behaviours and has no effect on anxiety-like behaviours. Specific knockdown of AC₃ in the MOE can cause depression-like and anxiety-like behaviours. The behavioural changes caused by intranasal ZnSO₄ and specific knockdown of AC₃ in the MOE can be related to the significant downregulation of dopaminergic system and GluN2B expressions in the hippocampus of mice.

Prefrontal-amygdala connectivity in trait anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder: Testing the boundaries between healthy and pathological worries,"Background: Current brain-based theoretical models of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) suggest a dysfunction of amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex emotional regulatory mechanisms. These alterations might be reflected by an altered resting state functional connectivity between both areas and could extend to vulnerable non-clinical samples such as high worriers without a GAD diagnosis. However, there is a lack of information in this regard. Methods: We investigated differences in resting state functional connectivity between the basolateral amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (amygdala-vmPFC) in 28 unmedicated participants with GAD, 28 high-worriers and 28 low-worriers. We additionally explored selected clinical variables as predictors of amygdala-vmPFC connectivity, including anxiety sensitivity. Results: GAD participants presented higher left amygdala-vmPFC connectivity compared to both groups of non-GAD participants, and there were no differences between the latter two groups. In our exploratory analyses, concerns about the cognitive consequences of anxiety (the cognitive dimension of anxiety sensitivity) were found to be a significant predictor of the left amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of our study preclude us from assessing if functional connectivity measures and anxiety sensitivity scores entail an increased risk of GAD. Conclusions: These results suggest a neurobiological qualitative distinction at the level of the amygdala-vmPFC emotional-regulatory system in GAD compared to non-GAD participants, either high- or low-worriers. At this neural level, they question previous hypotheses of continuity between high worries and GAD development. Instead, other anxiety traits such as anxiety sensitivity might confer a greater proneness to the amygdala-vmPFC connectivity alterations observed in GAD.

Prevalence and factors associated with anxiety and depression in older adults: Gender differences in psychosocial indicators,"Background: With increasing numbers of people living into old age, health functioning and good quality of life are central to public health policy in aging. However, quality of life for many elders is undermined by anxiety and depression. Understanding gender differences in the determinants of anxiety and depression symptoms is crucial to policy and practice. Objective: To examine gender-specific symptom subtypes of later-life anxiety and depression, in relation to their socio-demographic, social and health context. Method: Cross-sectional study using data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA, 2009–2011). Latent class analysis defined gender-specific symptom profiles for anxiety and depression. Correlates of latent classes were analysed using logistic regression, assessing associations between socio-demographic factors; social indicators and health indicators. Results: Four classes of self-reported anxiety and depression were derived: ‘low’, ‘comorbidity’, ‘anxiety and subthreshold depression’ and ‘anxiety’ only. With males 8% were comorbid, 26% subthreshold and 26% with anxiety only. With female 12% were comorbid, 27% subthreshold and 29% with anxiety only. While symptom expression may relate to stress from common ageing, our findings show clear gradations of symptoms associated with a range of social and health indicators. Conclusion: Our findings support the actuality of comorbid depression and anxiety with further evidence for anxiety and subthreshold depression . A sizeable subgroup confirms that many older people experience anxiety only. Our study indicates the need for a more sensitive recognition of needs and a more nuanced policy agenda for older people towards improving the quality of their social life.

Body dissatisfaction and Fat Talk during pregnancy: Predictors of distress,"Background: During pregnancy, women are vulnerable to mood and anxiety disorders due to the significant physical and emotional changes that occur during this period. For some women, pregnancy can also present as a period of immense body dissatisfaction due to the substantial changes in body shape and size. Objectives: This study examined the mediating role of Fat Talk (i.e., engaging in disparaging comments about one's body shape and size with others) in the relationship between (a) body dissatisfaction and distress in pregnant women (i.e., pregnancy-related anxiety, depression and eating disorder symptomatology), and (b) sociocultural pressure to meet the thin ideal and distress. Method: A nonclinical sample of 408 pregnant women (M age = 28.24 years, SD age = 5.04, range 18–44 years) completed measures of body dissatisfaction, sociocultural pressure, pregnancy-related anxiety, depression and eating disorder symptomatology. Findings: Analyses confirmed the partial mediating role of Fat Talk between body dissatisfaction and all three measures of distress, when examined individually. Fat Talk also mediated the relationship between sociocultural pressure (i.e., peers/family and media) and the three measures of distress. Age also partially mediated the relationship between body dissatisfaction and a composite measure of pregnancy distress. Conclusions: The results suggest that women face sociocultural pressures for thinness and body dissatisfaction even when pregnant, and that engaging in Fat Talk contribute to greater levels of pregnancy-related anxiety, depression and eating disorder symptomatology. The role of Fat Talk in regard to pregnancy distress may be more pertinent to younger women.

Anxiety sensitivity and emotion regulation as mechanisms of successful CBT outcome for anxiety-related disorders in a naturalistic treatment setting,"Background: Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing anxiety symptoms. However, relatively fewer studies have examined the effectiveness of CBT in naturalistic treatment settings. There is even less known about the mechanisms underlying successful outcomes in naturalistic samples receiving CBT. This study aimed to examine the absolute and relative mediation of emotion regulation (ER) difficulties and anxiety sensitivity (AS) on anxiety symptom reduction. Methods: Participants were treatment-seeking patients ( N = 247) at an outpatient anxiety clinic. Measures of difficulties in ER, AS, and disorder specific symptoms were administered at baseline, mid, and post-treatment. A composite anxiety score was calculated to measure anxiety disorder symptom severity across anxiety-related diagnoses. Results: Individual mediation models revealed that both AS and ER significantly mediated the reduction in anxiety-related symptoms over the course of treatment. A multiple mediation model found that ER was the strongest mediator (indirect effect = −1.030, 95% CI = −2.172 to −0.153). Further analyses revealed that the ER subscale of impulse control difficulties (e.g., the tendency to avoid when confronted with a feared stimulus) was the strongest mediator (indirect effect = −0.849, 95% CI = −1.913 to −0.081). Limitations: This study relied solely on self-report measures of ER, AS, and anxiety pathology, and did not have a control group. Conclusions: These results suggest that improvement in the ability to control impulses may act as a mechanism of anxiety symptom reduction and may be important to target in CBT with naturalistic samples.

Influence of physical exercise on social anxiety of left-behind children in rural areas in China: The mediator and moderator role of perceived social support,"Objective: to explore the influence of physical exercise on social anxiety of left-behind children in rural areas, and to verify the mediator and moderator role of perceived social support. Methods: 797 rural left-behind children were studied with physical exercise rating scale, social anxiety scale and perceived social support assessment scale. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between physical exercise and social anxiety, and regression and structural equation models were used to check whether perceived social support played a mediator and moderator role or not. Results: the effect of physical exercise on social anxiety of left-behind children in rural areas is significant ( P &lt; 0.01); exercise time, exercise intensity and exercise frequency have significant effects on social anxiety; perceived social support has significant effects on social anxiety ( P &lt; 0.01); family support, friend support and other support have significant negative effects on social anxiety. Regression analysis shows that the dimensions of perceived social support (family support, friend support and other support) have some mediator effects in explaining social anxiety in sports. Perceived social support plays a moderator role in the relationship between physical exercise and social anxiety. Conclusions: The results suggests the impact of perceived social support on left-behind children in rural areas. Specifically, perceived social support has a positive impact on the level of social anxiety and a positive impact on physical exercise. It is suggested that attention should be paid to social support of rural left-behind children in the process of mental health education and school physical education.

Threat-sensitivity in affective disorders: A case-control study,"Background: Anxiety disorders are highly comorbid with major depression but differ in their symptom profiles and pharmacological responses. Threat-sensitivity may explain such differences, yet research on its relationship to specific disorders is lacking. Methods: One-hundred patients (71 women) and 35 healthy controls (23 women) were recruited. Thirty-five had Panic Disorder (PD), 32 had Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and 33 Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Threat-sensitivity was measured via behavior (Joystick Operated Runway Task; JORT) and self-report (Fear Survey Schedule; FSS). Results: Behavioral sensitivity to simple threat was higher in females compared to males ( p = .03). Self-reported sensitivity to simple threat (FSS Tissue Damage Fear) was higher in PD patients compared to other groups ( p ≤ .007) and in GAD patients compared to controls ( p = .02). Behavioral sensitivity to complex threat was higher in females than males ( p = .03) and a group by sex interaction ( p = .01) indicated that this difference was largest in PD patients. Self-reported sensitivity to complex threat (FSS Social Fear) was higher in all patients compared to controls ( p ≤ .001). Females scored higher than males on FSS Tissue Damage Fear and FSS Social Fear). Conclusions: Our findings oppose the simple/complex threat dichotomy, instead suggesting elevated sensitivity to physical threat differentiates anxiety disorders from MDD, whereas elevated sensitivity to social threat is associated with both anxiety disorders and MDD.

Where perception meets belief updating: Computational evidence for slower updating of visual expectations in anxious individuals,"Background: Surprising events are important sources of internal model updating which adjusts expectations for both decision-making and perceptual processing circuits. Anxious individuals display relatively intact updating of internal models used to make decisions, however how these individuals update their perceptual expectations remains poorly understood. Based on previous work, we hypothesized that anxious individuals experienced exaggerated surprise to predictable events, which imbues them with undue salience. Methods: To model the rate of updating of internal models for both decision-making and perceptual processing, we applied a hybrid Rescorla Wagner (RW)/Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) to a change point detection task in a transdiagnostic group of individuals with mood and anxiety disorders and examined the relationship between learning rates and anxiety and negative affect. Results: Model comparison provided evidence that decision-making and perceptual processing rely on separate internal models with different learning rates. Anxiety and older age were associated with slower updating of models used in perceptual processing, but not those used in decision-making. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study and lacked neural data to examine the role of specific brain circuits in updating of perceptual predictions. Conclusions: Anxious individuals display slower updating of internal models used in perceptual processing, but not those used in decision-making. This deficit could contribute to exaggerated salience of harmless stimuli in anxiety. The results have implications for the assessment and treatment of basic processing dysfunctions in anxiety.

A tale of two systems: Testing a positive and negative valence systems framework to understand social disconnection across anxiety and depressive disorders,"Background: Social disconnection is a common and pernicious feature of anxiety and depressive disorders, yet is insufficiently addressed by our best available treatments. To better understand why people with anxiety and depression feel socially disconnected, we tested a positive and negative valence systems framework informed by research on how normative social connections develop and flourish. Method: Individuals seeking treatment for anxiety or depression (N = 150) completed measures of perceived social connectedness, positive and negative valence temperament, social goals, affect, symptoms, and life satisfaction. Results: Feeling less socially connected was associated with diminished life satisfaction, beyond clinical symptom severity. Regression analyses revealed that both diminished positive valence and heightened negative valence temperament, and their corresponding motivational and affective outputs, were significantly and uniquely (with no significant interaction between them) associated with lower perceived connectedness. Limitations: Data was cross-sectional and based on self-report—limiting conclusions about causality and social disconnection processes at different units of analysis. Conclusions: Understanding social disconnection through the lens of a positive and negative valence systems framework may inform transdiagnostic models and treatment approaches.

However, as the directions of these associations are still unclear, we examined them prospectively using community-based data. Methods: Data on 5066 adults aged ≥ 50 years from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) were analyzed. Loneliness was assessed through the UCLA loneliness scale. Social integration was measured using the Berkman–Syme Social Network Index. MDD and GAD were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Logistic regression models were conducted. Results: The longitudinal association between experiencing loneliness and higher likelihood of suffering from MDD or GAD two years later is bidirectional but stronger with loneliness as origin, whereas the association between social isolation and higher likelihood of subsequent MDD or GAD as well as those between loneliness and subsequent deterioration of social integration are unidirectional. Conclusion: Objective and perceived social isolation independently affect the probability of suffering from MDD or GAD whereas loneliness is a risk factor for the deterioration of social life, which highlights the need to address the subjective factors (such as loneliness) and objective factors (such as social network size) of social isolation in a complementary way in order to improve the mental health of the older adult population.

Joint association of ultra-processed food and sedentary behavior with anxiety-induced sleep disturbance among Brazilian adolescents,"Aims: We analyzed the joint association of high ultra-processed food ingestion and sedentary behavior (SB) with anxiety-induced sleep disturbance among Brazilian adolescents. Methods: Data from the Brazilian Scholar Health Survey, a nationally representative survey of 9th grade adolescents [mean: 14.28 years (range: 11–18 years)] conducted in 2015 ( n = 100,648) were used. Self-reported anxiety-induced sleep disturbance, SB (TV viewing and total sitting time), and frequency of ingestion of different ultra-processed foods were collected. Age, ethnicity, type of city (capital or interior), region of the country, and habitual physical activity (global scholar survey questionnaire) were covariates. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the associations. Results: High ultra-processed food ingestion plus low SB [boys:OR:1.44(99%CI:1.16–1.79), girls:OR:1.41(99%CI:1.22–1.63)] were risk factors for anxiety-induced sleep disturbance. The highest risk of anxiety-induced sleep disturbance was observed among those who joint high ultra-processed food ingestion with high SB [boys:OR:1.85(99%CI:1.46–2.35), girls:OR:1.62(99%CI:1.39–1.89)]. In addition, the interaction of high ultra-processed food ingestion with TV-viewing substantially increased the odds of anxiety-induced sleep disturbance [boys:OR:2.03(99%CI:1.61–2.56), girls:OR:2.04(99%CI:1.76–2.36)]. Conclusions: Both the high consumption of ultra-processed foods and SB (especially TV-viewing) appear to be independently associated with anxiety-induced sleep disturbance in both sexes. However, the co-occurrence of both negative lifestyle behaviors is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of anxiety-induced sleep disturbance. Future longitudinal research is required to confirm/refute our findings and explore potential mechanisms.

Reduced anti-inflammatory gut microbiota are associated with depression and anhedonia,"Introduction: Characterize gut microbiota distributions of participants with co-occurring depression and anxiety, in those with only depression or with anxiety, and determine if gut bacteria differentially correlates with distinct clinical presentations. Methods: Participants (10 healthy controls [mean age: 33, 60% female] and 60 psychiatric subjects; major depressive disorder (comorbid with anxiety), n = 38 [mean age: 39.2, 82% female], anxiety only, n = 8 [mean age: 40.0, 100% female], depression only without anxiety, n = 14 [mean age: 41.9, 79% female]) were characterized by psychiatric assessments. Quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing were used to characterize the gut microbiota in stool samples. Results: Altered microbiota correlated with pre-defined clinical presentation, with Bacteroides ( p = 0.011) and the Clostridium leptum subgroup ( p = 0.023) significantly different between clinical categories. Cluster analysis of the total sample using weighted UniFrac β-diversity of the gut microbiota identified two different clusters defined by differences in bacterial distribution. Cluster 2 had higher Bacteroides ( p = 0.006), and much reduced presence of Clostridales ( p &lt; 0.001) compared to Cluster 1. Bifidobacterium ( p = 0.0173) was also reduced in Cluster 2 compared to Cluster 1. When evaluated for clinical characteristics, anhedonia scores in Cluster 2 were higher than in Cluster 1. Limitations: The sample is smaller and predominately female. Conclusions: Reduced or absent Clostridia was consistently seen in those with depression, independent of the presence of anxiety. Conversely, reduced Bacteroides may be more associated with the presence of anxiety, independent of the presence of depression. These differences suggest that gut microbiota distribution could help clarify the underlying pathology of comorbid clinical presentation.

Trajectories of maternal symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder predict long-term mental health of children following the Wenchuan earthquake in China: A 10-year follow-up study,"Background: Maternal psychopathology can be an important factor associated with psychological adjustment of children. However, there is limited research on long-term impacts of maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on children's mental health. This study examined how PTSD trajectories of women exposed to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China predicted their children's mental health symptoms 10 years after the earthquake. Methods: 410 dyads of mothers and their adolescent children who exposed to the Wenchuan earthquake were investigated at 12 and 18 months post-earthquake. While the mothers completed measures of earthquake exposure and PTSD symptoms, the children completed measures of earthquake exposure, PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms. In the 10-year follow up, 257 out of the 410 children completed measures of PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms. Data were analyzed using linear regression. Results: Four trajectories of maternal PTSD symptoms were identified: (a) chronic (9.5%); (b) resilient (66.3%); (c) delayed (7.6%); and (d) recovery (16.6%); More importantly, the findings demonstrated that children whose mothers experienced chronic PTSD reported higher level of PTSD and anxiety symptoms 10 years after the earthquake. Limitations: Only two waves of maternal PTSD were collected, self-reported tools other than clinical reviews were used to collect data, and a significant proportion of participants did not respond at the 10-year follow-up. Conclusions: This study identified maternal PTSD trajectories following the Wenchuan earthquake. Chronic PTSD symptoms in mothers were associated with increased risk of children's PTSD and anxiety 10 years after the earthquake.

Emotionally valenced stimuli impact response inhibition in those with substance use disorder and co-occurring anxiety and depression symptoms,"Background: Substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with impaired response inhibition. Given the deficits in emotion regulation associated with SUD, it is unclear if this impairment is exacerbated by emotionally valenced stimuli. Co-occurring conditions may further exacerbate these impairments as many co-occurring conditions further impact emotion regulation. It was hypothesized that negative stimuli may further impact response inhibition for this population. Methods: The current study used the stop-signal task to examine response inhibition to negative, neutral and positive stimuli in a sample of those with a history of SUD and co-occurring depression and anxiety symptoms. Results: Response inhibition was poorer for negative stimuli relative to neutral stimuli. There was no difference between negative and positive stimuli. Depression severity moderated the difference between response inhibition for negative and neutral stimuli. At elevated depression, response inhibition was worse and there was no difference across emotional stimuli. At low depression, there was a significant difference between negative and neutral stimuli. This effect was not found for anxiety symptoms. Limitations: Study participants presented with polysubstance use of varying duration and amount. It is unclear whether findings are attributed to specific substances, or substance use broadly. Additionally, happy, angry, and calm facial emotions were used to represent positive, negative, and neutral valences respectively. It is unclear whether these findings are generalizable to other emotional expressions. Conclusion: Results suggested that emotionally valenced stimuli affected response inhibition among those with low symptom severity. At elevated symptom severity, response inhibition to all stimuli were impaired.

Autism spectrum disorder traits are associated with empathic abilities in adults with anorexia nervosa,"Background: Social and emotional difficulties have been identified as key factors in the development and maintenance of anorexia nervosa (AN). However, few studies have investigated the influence of comorbid psychopathology on social cognition. The aim of the current study was to examine perception of nonverbal communication and empathy in AN using ecologically valid, performance-based measures, and to explore associations with comorbid psychopathology (anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) traits, alexithymia, and social anxiety). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET) and the Mini Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity (MiniPONS) were administered to 51 adults with AN, 51 recovered AN (REC), and 51 healthy controls (HCs). Comorbid psychopathological traits were assessed using self-report questionnaires and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule—2nd edition (ADOS-2). Results: Individuals with AN showed reduced affective empathy to positive stimuli compared to HCs, and a trend towards lower vocal prosody recognition scores relative to REC. Around a quarter of AN and REC scored above the clinical cut-off for ASD on the ADOS-2, and high ASD symptoms predicted lower cognitive and affective empathy scores. Limitations: The study is cross-sectional, future research would benefit from examining social-cognition performance and comorbid psychopathology longitudinally. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of ASD symptoms in empathy dysfunction in those with a lifetime history of AN. Future research should explore whether treatment adaptations to accommodate for differences in social-cognitive abilities may be helpful in the treatment of AN.

Perceived burdensomeness uniquely accounts for suicidal ideation severity in social anxiety disorder,"Background: High rates of suicidal ideation in those with social anxiety disorder (SAD) have been attributed to feelings of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, but most work has been in non-clinical samples. We assessed the contributions of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness to suicidal ideation severity, over clinical covariates, in individuals diagnosed with SAD. Methods: Participants were 58 adult outpatients (mean age 25.62 years, 69% female) with SAD. Hierarchical linear regression assessed contributions of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness to suicidal ideation, before and after covarying other potential explanatory variables (depression, agitation, brooding rumination). Results: Perceived burdensomeness was significantly positively related to suicidal ideation severity ( p &lt; .001) above thwarted belongingness, which was not incremental ( p = .791). The same pattern was found after inclusion of additional covariates (perceived burdensomeness p = .006; thwarted belongingness p = .757). Greater agitation also uniquely accounted for more severe suicidal ideation ( p = .001). Limitations: This study was cross-sectional, did not assess all potential confounding variables, and utilized a treatment-seeking sample. Conclusions: Results suggest perceived burdensomeness is independently related to suicidal ideation severity in SAD, over thwarted belongingness and other clinical features. Future work should seek to replicate these findings and evaluate causal, longitudinal relationships among perceived burdensomeness, agitation, and severity of suicidal ideation in those with SAD in order to determine whether these may be clinically-relevant mechanisms.

Adolescent internalizing symptoms: The importance of multi-informant assessments in childhood,"Background: Childhood internalizing symptoms can be associated with adolescent internalizing symptoms, but only a small proportion of symptomatic children are at long-term risk. Our objectives were to (1) distinguish between typical and atypical levels of internalizing symptoms using mother- and teacher-assessments and (2) test the association between childhood internalizing symptoms and adolescent generalized anxiety, depression, and social phobia symptoms in boys and girls. Methods: Multi-trajectory models were used to estimate the evolution of mother- and teacher-reported internalizing symptoms across childhood (1.5 to 12 years) in a large population-based cohort ( n = 1431). Multiple linear regression models were implemented to estimate the association between childhood group membership of internalizing symptoms and self-reported specific internalizing symptoms at 15 years by sex. Results: Five groups of childhood internalizing symptoms were identified: Mother &amp; teacher low (22.6%), Mother moderate/teacher low (37.9%), Mother moderate/teacher high (18.3%), Mother high/teacher low (11.8%) and Mother &amp; teacher high (9.5%). Multiple linear regression models showed that compared to the low group, (1) boys in the high group reported higher social phobia symptoms ( p = 0.04), (2) girls in the high group reported higher depression ( p = 0.01) and generalized anxiety ( p &lt; 0.01) symptoms, and (3) girls in the moderate/high group reported higher generalized anxiety symptoms ( p = 0.02) in adolescence. Limitations: The main limitation is that mothers’ and teachers’ assessments mostly covered different developmental periods. Conclusions: A multi-informant assessment of childhood internalizing symptoms improves adolescent specific internalizing symptoms identification in a general population sample over reliance on a single informant.

Common mental disorders among young refugees in Sweden: The role of education and duration of residency,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 270 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2020-30279-030). In the original article, there were a number of errors. The correct and final version is included in the present issue (see record 2020-30279-031).] Background: Studies investigating risks of common mental disorders (CMDs) in refugee youth are sparse. The current study examined health care use due to CMDs in unaccompanied and accompanied refugee youth and Swedish-born, and the role of education and residency duration. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study included 746,517 individuals (whereof 36,347 refugees) between 19 and 25 years, residing in Sweden in 2009. Refugees were classified as unaccompanied/accompanied. Risk estimates of CMDs, measured as health care use and antidepressant treatment, between 2010–2016 were calculated as adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Highest attained education in 2009, and residency duration were examined as potential modifiers. Results: Compared to Swedish-born youth, refugees had a lower risk of treated major depressive and anxiety disorders (aHR): 0.67 (95% CI 0.63–0.72) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.63–0.71) respectively), but a higher risk for posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD). Compared to Swedish-born, unaccompanied had a nearly 6-fold elevated risk for PTSD (aHR: 5.82, 95% CI 4.60–7.34) and accompanied refugees had a 3-fold risk of PTSD (aHR: 3.08, 95% CI 2.54–3.74). Rates of PTSD decreased with years spent in Sweden. The risk of CMDs decreased with increasing education. Limitations: The study lacked information on pre-migration factors. There may further be a potential misclassification of untreated CMDs. Conclusion: Refugees had a lower risk of treated depressive and anxiety disorders but a higher risk for PTSD. In refugees, the rates of anxiety disorders increased slightly over time whereas the rates of PTSD decreased. Last, low education was an important predictor for CMDs.

The relationship between sleep efficiency and clinical symptoms is mediated by brain function in major depressive disorder,"Background: Sleep disturbance is a common and key symptom that affects most of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, neural substrates underlying sleep disturbance and their clinical relevance in depression remain unclear. Methods: Ninety-six MDD patients underwent resting-state functional MRI. Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) were used to measure brain function. Overnight polysomnography was performed to objectively measure sleep efficiency (SE), which was used to classify patients into normal sleep efficiency (NSE) and low sleep efficiency (LSE) groups. Between-group differences in fALFF and rsFC were examined using two-sample t -tests. Moreover, correlation and mediation analyses were conducted to test for potential associations between SE, brain functional changes, and clinical variables. Results: LSE group showed decreased fALFF in right cuneus, thalamus, and middle temporal gyrus compared to NSE group. MDD patients with low SE also exhibited lower rsFC of right cuneus to right lateral temporal cortex, which was associated with more severe depression and anxiety symptoms. More importantly, mediation analyses revealed that the relationships between SE and severity of depression and anxiety symptoms were significantly mediated by the altered rsFC. In addition, these low SE-related brain functional alterations were not affected by antidepressant medication and were independent of structural changes. Limitations: The lack of healthy controls because of “first-night effect”. Conclusion: These findings not only may expand existing knowledge about neuropathology of sleep disturbance in depression, but also may inform real-world clinical practice by improving depression and anxiety symptoms through sleep regulation.

Affective temperaments and eating psychopathology in anorexia nervosa: Which role for anxious and depressive traits?,"Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe mental illness. Personality traits and comorbidity with affective and anxiety disorders are key-aspects of its pathogenesis but little attention has been paid so far to affective temperaments in AN. Also, childhood anxiety is proposed to impact on AN clinical severity. Therefore, we aimed to investigate if affective temperaments could be related to AN eating psychopathology also clarifying if those with low versus high scores on depressive and anxious temperaments could differ in AN clinical current and lifetime severity. Methods: One-hundred and forty-seven inpatients with AN were consecutively recruited. All participants completed: Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire, Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory. Clinical data were collected upon admission. Results: Regression models showed that all affective temperaments were associated with eating psychopathology (eating restraint and eating, shape, and weight concerns); however, when controlling for confounders, only the anxious temperament remained significant. Also, those patients with higher scores on depressive and anxious temperaments reported higher current and lowest lifetime body mass index (BMI). Limitations: Only inpatients were recruited; self-report assessments were used and follow-up data are lacking. Conclusions: Results from this study support the association between affective (anxious in particular) temperament traits and the presence of altered eating psychopathology in AN. Also, higher traits of depressive and anxious temperaments reported higher current and lowest lifetime BMI. Should these findings be confirmed, the assessment of the anxious temperament could fruitfully inform prevention and treatment interventions for AN.

Feeling down? A systematic review of the gut microbiota in anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome,"Background: Anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are highly prevalent and burdensome conditions, whose co-occurrence is estimated between 44 and 84%. Shared gut microbiota alterations have been identified in these separate disorders relative to controls; however, studies have not adequately considered their comorbidity. This review set out to identify case-control studies comparing the gut microbiota in anxiety/depression, IBS, and both conditions comorbidly relative to each other and to controls, as well as gut microbiota investigations including measures of both IBS and anxiety/depression. Methods: Four databases were systematically searched using comprehensive search terms (OVID Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed), following PRISMA guidelines. Results: Systematic review identified 17 studies (10 human, 7 animal). Most studies investigated the gut microbiota and anxiety/depression symptoms in IBS cohorts. Participants with IBS and high anxiety/depression symptoms had lower alpha diversity compared to controls and IBS-only cohorts. Machine learning and beta diversity distinguished between IBS participants with and without anxiety/depression by their gut microbiota. Comorbid IBS and anxiety/depression also had higher abundance of Proteobacteria, Prevotella/Prevotellaceae, Bacteroides and lower Lachnospiraceae relative to controls. Limitations: A large number of gut microbiota estimation methods and statistical techniques were utilized; therefore, meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusions: Well-designed case-control and longitudinal studies are required to disentangle whether the gut microbiota is predicted as a continuum of gastrointestinal and anxiety/depression symptom severity, or whether reported dysbiosis is unique to IBS and anxiety/depression comorbidity. These findings may inform the development of targeted treatment through the gut microbiota for individuals with both anxiety/depression and IBS.

Mid-pregnancy insomnia is associated with concurrent and postpartum maternal anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: A prospective cohort study,"Background: Although many perinatal women are affected by anxiety, few studies have focused on perinatal anxiety and its potential triggers. The primary aim of this study was to examine concurrent and prospective associations between mid-pregnancy insomnia and perinatal anxiety. Furthermore, we compared psychosocial and reproductive characteristics between participants with and without mid-pregnancy insomnia and explored changes in the prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms from mid-pregnancy to 8 weeks postpartum. Methods: This study was part of the Norwegian Depression and Anxiety in the Perinatal Period (DAPP) prospective, population-based, cohort study. We analyzed hospital birth records and questionnaire responses from pregnancy week 17 and postpartum week 8 ( n = 530). The Bergen Insomnia Scale was used to measure insomnia and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist to measure anxiety. OCD symptoms were measured based on questions from the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Results: Mid-pregnancy insomnia was significantly associated with both concurrent and postpartum anxiety in a linear mixed model adjusted for several potential confounders. Participants with mid-pregnancy insomnia had significantly higher levels of perinatal anxiety and postpartum OCD symptoms than participants with normal mid-pregnancy sleep. OCD symptoms affected more women after delivery than before (6.4% vs. 3.8% p = 0.034). Limitations: Immigrants were underrepresented in our sample. Conclusion: Our results suggest that mid-pregnancy insomnia is a marker for concurrent anxiety and predictor of postpartum anxiety. Future research should examine whether insomnia treatment starting in mid-pregnancy reduces both perinatal insomnia and anxiety. Health providers should also be aware that postpartum women have an increased risk of developing OCD symptoms.

Worry as a mediator between psychosocial stressors and emotional sequelae: Moderation by contrast avoidance,"Background: Worry is the core feature of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which is prevalent among emerging adults. The contrast avoidance model proposes that individuals with GAD use worry to avoid negative emotional contrasts by maintaining a state of negative affect. Research suggests worry in response to stressors increases anxiety, but more research is needed to examine depression as an outcome and the predictions of contrast avoidance in the context of multiple stressor subtypes. The current study examined whether worry may be associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression, regardless of stressors, due to the use of worry as an avoidance strategy, moderating these associations. Methods: 367 undergraduate college students from a medium-sized, public university completed self-report questionnaires online. Results: Worry significantly mediated the associations from academic stressors and social stressors to symptoms of anxiety and depression. Contrast avoidance significantly moderated associations between academic stressors and worry as well as worry and anxiety. For those high in contrast avoidance, worry was relatively high regardless of academic stressors; for those low in contrast avoidance, students with fewer academic stressors reported less worry. Limitations: The present study relied on self-report. In addition, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to draw conclusions about temporal relations. Conclusions: Contrast avoidance elevated worry regardless of academic stressors, and strengthened the association between worry and anxiety but not worry and depression. Individuals who experience high levels of contrast avoidance may benefit from cognitive interventions focusing on reducing beliefs about the perceived benefits of worry.

"Severity profiles of posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms in treatment seeking traumatized refugees","Background: Western countries are facing many challenges hosting refugees from several regions in the world. Many of them are severely traumatized and suffer from a variety of mental health symptoms, which complicates the identification and treatment of refugees at risk. This study examined subgroups based on a broad range of psychopathology, and several predictors, including trauma characteristics and gender. Methods: Participants were 1147 treatment-seeking, traumatized refugees. Latent profile analysis was conducted to identify different subgroups based on levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify predictors of subgroup membership. Results: Three distinct subgroups were identified, reflecting Moderate (10.2%), Severe (43.0%), and Highly Severe (45.9%) symptom severity levels, respectively. Symptom severity of all psychopathology dimensions was distributed equally between the subgroups. Participants in the Severe and Highly Severe Symptoms subgroups reported more types of traumatic events compared to the Moderate subgroup. In particular, traumatic events associated with human right abuses, lack of human needs and separation from others predicted subgroup membership, as did gender. Limitations: The results are confined to treatment-seeking, traumatized refugee populations. Conclusions: Distinguishable symptom severity profiles of PTSD, depression, anxiety and somatic complaints could be identified in this large treatment-seeking refugee population, without qualitative differences in symptom distribution. Instead of focusing on specific mental disorders, classification based on overall symptom severity is of interest in severely traumatized patients. This knowledge will help to identify individuals at risk and to enhance existing treatment programs for specific patient groups.

"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and suicidality in children: The mediating role of depression, irritability and anxiety symptoms","Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with increased suicidality risk. Yet, potential mechanisms transmitting the effect of ADHD to suicidality remain unclear. We investigated whether depression, irritability and anxiety symptoms mediate between ADHD symptoms and suicidality. Methods: ADHD, depression, irritability and anxiety symptoms as well as suicidality (composited of suicidal ideation, attempts or self-harm) were measured in an outpatient clinic for ADHD ( N = 1,516, 6–17 years old, 61.1% diagnosed with ADHD) using parent and teacher questionnaires. Multiple mediator models adjusted for age, sex and psychosocial adversities were constructed separately for parent- and teacher-report. Results: Parents reported higher rates of suicidality than did teachers (12.1% and 3.8%, p &lt; .001). Suicidality was associated with parent (OR = 1.10, 95%CI: 1.07–1.14) and teacher (OR = 1.08, 95%CI: 1.03–1.15) reported ADHD symptoms. The association between ADHD symptoms and suicidality was mediated by both parent- and teacher-reported depression (39.1% and 45.3% of total effect, respectively) and irritability symptoms (36.8% and 38.4% of total effect, respectively). Anxiety symptoms mediated between ADHD and suicidality for parent- but not teacher-report (19.0% of total effect). No direct effect of ADHD symptoms was found once depression, irritability and anxiety were controlled. Limitations: The cross-sectional design limits the ability to determine causal order between mediators and outcome. Conclusions: Our results confirmed the association between ADHD symptoms and suicidality. However, this association was indirect and fully mediated by symptoms of depression, irritability and anxiety. Assessing these symptoms may enable an estimate of suicidality and help managing suicidal risk in ADHD.

"Achieving complete mental health despite a history of generalized anxiety disorders: Findings from a large, nationally representative Canadian survey","Ideally, the clinical goal for individuals with a history of anxiety disorder is not only to remit from the disorder, but also to reach optimal well-being. This broader concept of recovery aligns with Keyes' concept of complete mental health (CMH), including presence of happiness or life satisfaction, and social and psychological well-being, and absence of any past year mental illness including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance dependence and suicidal ideation. This study's aim was to identify factors associated with CMH in a population-based sample of Canadians with a previous diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) ( n = =2128), of whom 40% are currently in CMH. Data were from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (response rate=68.9%). The World Health Organization version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHOCIDI) scales were used to define lifetime and past-year GAD. Factors associated with complete mental health include female gender, older age, being married, reporting good to excellent physical health, being free of chronic insomnia, being able to manage household activities without difficulties, using religion or spirituality to cope, having a confidant, and never having had a major depressive disorder nor substance dependence. Results of this study suggest many with a history of anxiety disorders can achieve CMH and point to factors that appear to facilitate this process.

"The association of physical activity and sleep duration with incident anxiety symptoms: A cohort study of 134,957 Korean adults","Background: Maintaining adequate levels of sleep and physical activity (PA) as self-help for the prevention of new-onset anxiety symptoms is becoming more important. Methods: A cohort study was performed with 134,957 adults, free of anxiety symptoms at baseline who underwent at least two comprehensive health screening examinations between 2012 and 2017. At baseline, the amount of PA was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form and sleep duration per day was assessed using a self-report questionnaire. The study's end point was new-onset anxiety symptoms, defined as a Beck Anxiety Inventory score of ≥19. Results: During 361,969 person-years of follow-up, 5086 participants developed case-level anxiety. Compared with a reference (0–600 METs-min/wk), a U-shaped relationship was observed between PA and case-level anxiety. The most beneficial levels of PA for reducing incident anxiety symptoms were higher in men than women (men: 1800–3000 METs-min/wk HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78–0.81], 3000–6000 METs-min/wk HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.70–0.93]; women: 600–1,200 METs-min/wk HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.76–0.98]). In comparison with a reference (&lt;6 h), the relationship between sleep duration and case-level anxiety also had a U-shaped pattern. The optimal sleep duration for decreasing the onset of case-level anxiety was 7–8 h, regardless of sex (men: HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.63–0.90]; women; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.54–0.70]). Limitations: PA, sleep duration, and anxiety symptoms were measured using self-report questionnaires. Conclusions: The results of this study revealed the appropriate levels of PA and total sleep time for reducing incident anxiety symptoms.

Methods: This study included all participants from a multisite trial of chronic depression. Baseline and follow-up (12 and 48 weeks) data were used to assess treatment response. Effect sizes (ES) and standardized response means (SRM) of pre- and post-GAD-7 mean changes were calculated for subgroups of patients, who did or did not improve according to ratings in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24). Results: N = 261 patients were included in the analyses. In the subgroup of patients who improved according to HRSD-24, GAD-7 scores were significantly lower after 12 weeks ( t = −6.31, df = 120, p &lt; .001; ES = −0.51, SRM = −0.57), and 48 weeks of treatment ( t = −12.68, df = 141, p &lt; .001; ES = −1.0, SRM = −1.7), when compared to admission. In the group who worsened, GAD-7 scores were significantly higher after 12 weeks ( t = 2.96, df = 41, p = .005; ES = 0.30, SRM = 0.46), and increased after 48 weeks ( t = 1.99, df = 21, p = .059; ES = 0.37, SRM = 0.43), when compared to baseline. The unchanged group showed no significant difference between baseline and follow-up. MCID was estimated 4 points on the GAD-7 total score. Limitations: Confirmation of these findings and further investigation of the GAD-7 in populations and trials focusing on anxiety-specific treatment is highly recommended. Conclusions: Results show that the GAD-7 is sensitive to detect change in psychopathology over the course of treatment.

Depression and trait-anxiety mediate the influence of clinical pain on health-related quality of life in fibromyalgia,"Background: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain condition associated with a substantial decrease in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study investigated the relationships of HRQoL with clinical parameters of FMS (pain, insomnia and fatigue) and affective variables (depression and anxiety). Methods: Women with FMS (n = 145) and healthy women (n = 94) completed the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) to evaluate HRQoL, and self-report questionnaires pertaining to clinical pain, symptoms of anxiety and depression, fatigue and insomnia. Patterns of associations were assessed by correlation, multiple linear regression, and mediation analyses. Results: FMS patients showed lower scores on all SF-36 scales than healthy individuals. Clinical and emotional factors were inversely associated with SF-36 scores. Although depression was the strongest predictor of global HRQoL (explaining 36% of its variance), clinical pain and fatigue were the main predictors of physical components of HRQoL; depression and trait-anxiety were the main predictors of mental HRQoL components. Results of mediation analysis showed that depression, trait-anxiety and fatigue mediated the effect of clinical pain on HRQoL. Additionally, depression, trait-anxiety and fatigue mutually influenced each other, increasing their negative effects on the different areas of HRQoL. Limitations: Among all emotional factors, only anxiety and depression were considered. Conclusions: Our results suggest that FMS pain and related functional disability may increase depression and anxiety, in turn aggravating the primary symptoms of FMS and indirectly increasing the negative influence of pain on HRQoL. These results showed the need to evaluate and treat negative affective states in FMS.

Fear of positive evaluation and social anxiety: A systematic review of trait-based findings,"Background: Although fear of negative evaluation (FNE) has long been recognized as a core cognitive bias in social anxiety, fear of positive evaluation (FPE) has received considerable attention over the past several years. The literature would benefit from a synthesis of the current state of the research in order to contribute to our understanding of FPE. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to address several questions: (a) Is self-reported FPE distinct from self-reported FNE? (b) Is self-reported FPE related to social anxiety symptomatology? and (c) Is self-reported FPE uniquely related to social anxiety symptomatology when accounting for self-reported FNE? Inclusion criteria included studies published in English, testing FPE and FNE with trait-based measures, and testing social anxiety with either self-report or diagnostic interviews. Results: There were 33 studies identified in this review that provided convincing empirical support for each of these questions across community and clinical samples of adolescents, undergraduates, and adults. Limitations: The systematic review did not have access to null results, present meta-analytic results, or include studies that evaluated FPE or social anxiety with experimental designs. Conclusions: The findings from the systematic review support updated theoritical models of social anxiety and highlight the importance of assessing and treating FPE in clinical interventions.

How might childhood adversity predict adult psychological distress? Applying the Identity Disruption Model to understanding depression and anxiety disorders,"Background: Experiencing adversity in childhood is associated with increased risk of a range of psychopathologies, including depression and anxiety disorders. However, there is limited understanding of psychological mechanisms that may help to explain these relationships. The Identity Disruption Model proposes that early adversity can disrupt typical identity development, which may then increase one's vulnerability to psychopathology. The present study aims to apply the Identity Disruption Model to understanding symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and social anxiety. Methods: A non-clinical sample of adults from the United States ( n = 382) completed an online survey assessing early adversity, self-concept clarity, intolerance of uncertainty, and depression, generalized anxiety, OCD, and social anxiety symptoms. Structural equation models: (1) tested whether early adversity predicts psychopathology via a disrupted sense of self, and (2) explored the role of intolerance of uncertainty in the relationship between early adversity and psychopathology. Results: Early adversity predicted more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety via lower self-concept clarity. Furthermore, a parallel mediation model showed that self-concept clarity and intolerance of uncertainty simultaneously mediated the relationship between early adversity and psychopathology. Limitations: The data are cross-sectional in nature and longitudinal research is needed to more conclusively test the causal pathways. Conclusions: Disrupted identity may be one mechanism through which childhood adversity predicts depression and anxiety disorder symptoms later in life. The Identity Disruption Model provides new avenues for future research and suggests potential points of early intervention for the prevention of depression and anxiety disorders.

Assessing treatment efficacy by examining relationships between age groups of children with autism spectrum disorder and clinical anxiety symptoms: Prediction by correspondence analysis,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental in nature and are frequently accompanied by anxiety. To fully assess treatment efficacy, we examined rates of anxiety symptom change by age groups following either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). Methods: One hundred sixty-three children with ASD and ASD-related anxiety symptoms were randomly assigned to either CBT or TAU. Utilizing prediction by correspondence analysis (CA), we evaluated the age effect (defined in three groups; ages 6–9, 10–12, and 13–16) and the changes in correlations between age and anxiety severity levels over the course of treatment. Results: Significantly greater anxiety symptom reduction was associated with CBT compared with TAU across the three age groups. Of particular note, the children ages 10–12 who received CBT showed the greatest improvement compared to all other groups. Late childhood, prior to adolescence, showed the best response to CBT for anxiety in ASD. Discussion: These findings suggest that treatment programs need to more closely address developmental factors within narrower bands of age groups. The present results are limited in their generalization to the CBT efficacy for a specific age band (ages 10–12). Longitudinal investigations are recommended to confirm whether the similar age group children who receive CBT experience the greatest benefit in reducing their ASD-related anxiety symptoms.

Vagus nerve stimulation produces immediate dose-dependent anxiolytic effect in rats,"Background: Chronic vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) attenuates anxiety in rats and humans. However, it is unclear whether VNS can promote acute anxiolytic effects. Here we examined short-term anxiolytic effects of VNS using single or multiple trains in rats submitted to a battery of tests. Methods: Three groups of rats were implanted with VNS cuffs and tested for anxiety using the elevated plus maze (EPM), novelty suppressed feeding (NSF), and acoustic startle response (ASR), after receiving either one or five VNS trains (0.4 mA/30 Hz/30‑sec), or sham stimulation. Results: Both single and multiple VNS trains reduced state anxiety as measured using the EPM, but only multiple trains reduced anxiety in the EPM and NSF. VNS did not decrease arousal as measured using the ASR. Limitations: The anxiolytic effects of VNS may be differently influenced by test order or prior-exposure to stress. VNS did not affect startle responses in naïve rats but the present findings do not determine whether VNS would affect startle responses that are potentiated by fear or anxiety. Conclusion: A single VNS train can produce an anxiolytic-like effect in the EPM minutes later, an effect that is not observed in the NSF. Delivering 5 VNS trains restores the immediate effects across tests of anxiety, indicating that more trains produce a more robust anxiolytic effect. The lack of effects on ASR suggests that VNS affects state anxiety but not baseline arousal in naïve rats. We suggest that the anxiolytic effect of VNS can increase tolerability and reduce dropout in exposure-based therapies.

The relation of gender role attitudes with depression and generalised anxiety disorder in two russian cities,"Background: Reported traditional gender role attitudes (GRAs) have been related to worse mental health in western countries. This study examined the link of GRAs with symptoms of depression and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in two Russian cities. Methods: We used interview data from the cross-sectional Know Your Heart Study conducted among 5099 adults aged 35-69 in the Russian cities of Arkhangelsk and Novosibirsk between 2015 and 2017. Attitudes about gender inequality and division of labour between women and men at home or in the public sphere were measured by single items. Binary variables indicating presence of symptoms of depression and GAD were defined by a cut-off of ≥ 5 of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine crude and adjusted associations. Results: There was evidence that all types of GRAs were associated with symptoms of depression and GAD consistent with a U-shape after controlling for confounding with stronger evidence for all relationships for depression than for GAD. Odds of depressive symptoms were elevated among participants strongly agreeing to gender inequality and gender division of labour. There was good evidence for effect measure modification by age. Limitations: The possibilities of measurement error of the exposure and outcomes, residual confounding and reverse causality are important limitations of this study. Conclusions: Agreeing to gender inequality and gender division of labour was associated with reporting symptoms of common mental disorders in Russia. This study adds evidence for a link of GRAs with mental health from a non-western context.

Mental health outcomes among Chinese prenatal and postpartum women after the implementation of universal two-child policy,"Background: Poor mental health status among both pregnant and postpartum women is commonly reported worldwide. The associations between mental health outcomes and giving birth to the second child since the implementation of China's universal two-child policy have not been identified. Methods: A large-scale based mental health survey was conducted between March 2017 and December 2018 in Suzhou, China. The survey evaluated the symptoms of anxiety, hypomania, depression and poor sleep quality among both pregnant and postpartum women. Results: A total of 3113 questionnaires were collected, the prevalence of anxiety, hypomanic and depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality in our sample were 3.2% (95%CI: 2.6%–3.9%), 51.7% (95%CI: 49.9%–53.4%), 12.4% (95%CI: 11.3%–13.6%) and 37.8% (95%CI: 36.0%–39.5%), respectively. Logistic regression showed that giving birth to the second child was positively associated with women's age, and was negatively correlated with higher educational level and living in rented housing. Women with the second pregnancy or child were positively associated with anxiety symptoms in the whole sample (OR = 1.75, 95%CI: 1.11–2.75) and among prenatal women (OR = 2.11, 95%CI: 1.16–3.83), while it was inversely correlated with depressive symptoms among postpartum women (OR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.41–0.99). Conclusions: Women giving birth a second time were more prone to have anxiety symptoms among the prenatal women and the whole sample, and less likely to have depressive symptoms among the postpartum women. Efficacious measures and interventions are essential to improve maternal mental health.

Sex and age differences in the association between anxiety disorders and narcolepsy: A nationwide population-based case control study,"Background: To examine the association between narcolepsy and anxiety disorders. Methods: This population-based, retrospective case-control study analyzed Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2013. We included narcoleptic patients aged at least 12 years, diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code 347. The cases and the propensity score-matched controls were selected in a 1:4 ratio. Each subject with anxiety disorders (ICD-9-CM code 300) was required to visit the outpatient clinic at least three times within a year. Multivariate logistic regression and interaction analyses were used to calculate the association between anxiety disorders and narcolepsy. Results: This study enrolled 478 and 1912 subjects with and without narcolepsy, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, patients with anxiety disorders had an approximately 2.7 odds ratio of developing narcolepsy when compared to the control subjects (adjusted odds ratio [aOR)] = 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.699–4.344). Interaction analysis and subgroup analysis showed a higher incidence of previously diagnosed anxiety disorders in narcoleptic patients aged 12 to 17 years and female patients (aOR = 25.9; 95% CI = 15.194–42.896; aOR = 3.6; 95% CI = 1.818–7.062, respectively). Limitations: The narcolepsy and anxiety disorders were not distinguished by validated structural diagnostic instruments. Conclusions: The results of this study revealed higher comorbidity rates of anxiety disorders in narcoleptic patients. The incidence of previously diagnosed anxiety disorders was higher in narcoleptic patients aged 12 to 17 years and female patients.

"Influencing factors and correlation of anxiety, psychological stress sources, and psychological capital among women pregnant with a second child in guangdong and shandong province","Background: After the one-child policy has been effective for over 30 years, China implemented the universal two-child policy in 2015. The number of high-risk pregnant women had increased dramatically ever since, increasing negative health outcomes for both mothers and children. Our study aims to investigate the status of anxiety, psychological stress sources, and psychological capital among women pregnant with a second child, and to assess influencing factors and correlations, providing scientific basis for promoting women's health during pregnancy. Methods: We recruited 513 participants from maternity hospitals in Guangdong and Shandong Province. All participants completed the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Pregnant women psychological stress sources questionnaire and the psychological capital questionnaire (PCQ-24). Results: The prevalence of anxiety of women pregnant with a second child was 27.5%. The score of psychological stress sources was 74.93 ± 16.07. The risk factors for the anxiety of the women pregnant with a second child included low education level of the husband, gender expectation and the sources of psychological stress of the pregnant woman. The risk factors for psychological stress were dissatisfaction of residence and unplanned pregnancy. The main factors influencing psychological capital were the participants’ education level, whether they have learned antenatal care knowledge and satisfaction with the residence. Limitations: All participants were recruited only from tertiary hospitals in Guangdong and Shandong province. Conclusions: Anxiety and psychological stress is prevalent during pregnancy among women pregnant with a second child in Guangdong and Shandong. Psychological capital was a protective factor for anxiety.

Effects of a transdiagnostic cognitive behaviour therapy-based programme on the natural course of anxiety symptoms in adolescence,"Background: Anxiety disorders frequently have an onset during adolescence, which when left untreated could lead to a chronic course and outcome. This study aimed to examine the way in which a cognitive behaviour therapy-based programme (Super Skills for Life—adolescent version; SSL-A) could change the course of anxiety symptoms through adolescent's behavioural performance and cardiac function. Method: Sixty-one adolescents at risk of developing an anxiety disorder (45.30% boys; M = 13.76 years, SD = 0.32) were randomly assigned to either an intervention (IG), placebo (PG), or a waitlist group (WG). Adolescents in the IG participated in SSL-A over an 8-week period. Adolescents in the PG participated in an 8-session school-work programme. Adolescents in the WG did not receive any intervention. Anxiety symptoms were assessed every six months, twice before the intervention, as well as at the post-intervention and six months after the intervention. Participants in the IG additionally underwent a stressful task to assess behavioural performance and cardiac adjustment. Results: Adolescents in the IG significantly reported lower levels of social phobia and generalised anxiety symptoms at the follow-up assessment compared to the adolescents in the PG and the WG. They also showed a significant improvement in vocal quality and lower discomfort during a stressful task at post-intervention, and showed attenuated cardiac recovery indexes, in terms of sample entropy. Limitations: The study has a small sample size. Conclusion: SSL-A changed the natural course of anxiety symptoms, as shown by a significant reduction in social phobia and generalised anxiety symptoms, and a significant improvement in behaviour and physiological (cardiac) function during a stressful situation.

"A systematic review of treatments targeting cognitive biases in socially anxious adolescents: Special section on “translational and neuroscience studies in affective disorders” section editor, Maria Nobile MD, PhD","Background: Adolescence is a period of brain plasticity that is affected by social and affective stimuli. Adaptive neurodevelopmental changes in the context of complex social situations may precipitate or exacerbate cognitive biases (i.e., attention and/or interpretation biases) and predispose at-risk individuals to symptoms of social anxiety. Methods: This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Nine adolescent studies were examined including 3 studies using Cognitive Bias Modification Training (CBMT) to target attention biases (CBMT-A), 3 studies using CBMT to target interpretation biases (CBMT-I), and 3 aimed at reducing both attention and interpretation biases. Results: The studies of CBMT-A alone did not find significant effects on cognitive and clinical outcomes. However, studies of CBMT-I alone showed some improvement in interpretation bias. The combination of CBMT-A and CBMT-I appeared promising in reducing both attentionl and interpretation biases. Limitations: The paucity of studies and the heterogeneity across studies (e.g., format of CBMT, assessment measures) limit the calculation of overall effect sizes and the examination of predictors, moderators, and mediators of outcome. Conclusions: Technology-driven interventions such as CBMT have the potential to extend treatments outside the clinic setting and to augment current therapies for social anxiety. Further research is needed to develop CBMT procedures that optimize learning in group and real-world settings and to identify predictors of treatment response. Understanding the neural correlates of response to CBMT may help identify future targets for intervention.

The role of serum oxytocin levels in the second trimester in regulating prenatal anxiety and depression: A sample from Shanghai maternal-child Pairs cohort study,"Background: Recent research suggested that oxytocin might be associated with prenatal anxiety or depression. Also, our previous study indicated that resilience could buffer the effect of stress on prenatal anxiety and depression, which is a kind of psychological adjustment ability to stress in life. The effects of oxytocin and resilience are supposed to be similar but no study was carried out to find the association between them. Current evidence on the effect of oxytocin on prenatal mental health were with small sample size and equivocal results, especially with a lack of studies in Chinese pregnant women. Aims: To investigate the relationship between oxytocin and resilience, and its role in regulating prenatal anxiety and depression among Chinese women. Methods: The study was based on a sub-sample of the Shanghai Maternal-Child Pairs Cohort (Shanghai MCPC) by stratified random sampling. A total of 632 participants completed blood collection for serum oxytocin measurement and questionnaires pertaining to early pregnancy stress and resilience in the second trimester, which were assessed by the Life Event Scale for Pregnancy Women (LESPW) and the revised Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), respectively. Prenatal anxiety and depression were assessed by Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiological Survey, Depression Scale (CES-D), respectively, at the third trimester. Correlation analysis and stratified linear regression analyses were conducted to understand the role of oxytocin in regulating prenatal anxiety and depression. Results: The concentration of serum oxytocin in the second trimester ranged from 98.14 pg⋅ml −1 to 197.28 pg⋅ml −1 , and there was no significant difference between different gestational age ( r = 0.024, P = 0.579). The association between stress and prenatal anxiety was stronger in high oxytocin group than that in low oxytocin group, with B value of 3.338 and 2.638, respectively, after adjusting for residence, educational level, family income and parity. The same effect was found in the association between stress and prenatal depression, with B value of 2.360 and 2.060, respectively. However, it was not significantly associated with early pregnancy stress ( Z = 1.933, P = 0.630), prenatal anxiety ( Z = 1.387, P = 0.165), prenatal depression ( Z = −0.027, P = 0.978), nor resilience ( F = 1.282, P = 0.280). Limitations: The existence of recall bias and restricted residential areas of the participants may limit the extrapolation of the study. Also, unsynchronized sampling timing of the oxytocin and psychological resilience measures is another limitation. Conclusions: Serum oxytocin levels in the second trimester had an effect of modification between early pregnancy stress and prenatal anxiety and depression. Pregnant women with high oxytocin in the second trimester should receive more attention and further study is needed on the mechanism of oxytocin for the mental health of pregnant women.

The gut microbiota is associated with psychiatric symptom severity and treatment outcome among individuals with serious mental illness,"Background: Emerging evidence implicates the gut microbiota in central nervous system functioning via its effects on inflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and/or neurotransmission. Our understanding of the cellular underpinnings of the brain-gut relationship is based almost exclusively on animal models with some small-scale human studies. This study examined the relationship between the gut microbiota and psychiatric symptom severity and treatment response among inpatients with serious mental illness. Method: We collected data from adult inpatients ( N = 111). Measures of diagnoses, suicide severity, trauma, depression, and anxiety were collected shortly after admission, while self-collected fecal swabs were collected early in the course of hospitalization and processed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole genome shotgun sequencing methods. Results: Results indicate that depression and anxiety severity shortly after admission were negatively associated with bacterial richness and alpha diversity. Additional analyses revealed a number of bacterial taxa associated with depression and anxiety severity. Gut microbiota richness and alpha diversity early in the course of hospitalization was a significant predictor of depression remission at discharge. Conclusions: This study is among the first to demonstrate a gut microbiota relationship with symptom severity among psychiatric inpatients as well as a relationship to remission of depression post-treatment. These findings are consistent with animal models and limited human studies as well as with the broader literature implicating inflammation in the pathophysiology of depression. These findings offer the foundation for further studies of novel therapeutic approaches to the treatment, prevention of, or recurrence of serious mental illness.

Prenatal symptoms of anxiety and depression associated with sex differences in both maternal perceptions of one year old infant temperament and researcher observed infant characteristics,"Background: Sex differences in the behaviour of children exposed to prenatal maternal depression and anxiety have been reported. This study compared depression and anxiety symptoms reported by mothers at term with maternal perceptions of one year old male and female infant temperament and with researcher observed infant characteristics, identifying differences for males and females with both approaches. Methods: Infant behaviour and temperament was assessed via maternally completed questionnaires including Infant Behavioural Questionnaire Revised—Short form and by researcher administered subcomponents of Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery and Bayley Scales of Infant Development III. Results: For female infants, higher prenatal scores for depression and anxiety were associated with maternal perceptions of lower bonding, higher aggression and negativity, and lower soothability ( n = 67 mother-infant dyads). In the laboratory assessment, intensity of escape was the only female infant factor significantly associated with maternal mood ( n = 41). For male infants, there was minimal association between prenatal mood scores and maternal perceptions ( n = 46) whereas in the laboratory assessment ( n = 35) depression scores were associated with expressive language, facial interest and facial fear while anxiety scores were associated with expressive and receptive language, parent behaviour and facial fear. Limitations: Findings may be restricted to a single ethnicity or mode of delivery. Fewer infants attended the infant assessment. A laboratory setting may mask symptomatology in females. Conclusions: Atypical maternal perceptions may present a barrier to the early identification of male infants impacted by maternal depression and anxiety.

Treating depressive disorders with the unified protocol: A preliminary randomized evaluation,"Objectives: This study aims to examine the efficacy of the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) for individuals diagnosed with a depressive disorder. Method: Participants included 44 adults who met criteria for major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, or another specified depressive disorder according to the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule (ADIS). These individuals represent a subset of patients from a larger clinical trial comparing the UP to single-disorder protocols (SDPs) for discrete anxiety disorders and a waitlist control (WLC) condition (Barlow et al., 2017); inclusion criteria for the parent study required participants to have a principal anxiety disorder. Results: Significant reductions in depressive symptoms were observed within the UP condition across clinician-rated and self-report measures of depression from baseline to post-treatment, as well as to the 12-month follow-up assessment. Compared to the WLC group, individuals in the UP condition demonstrated significantly lower levels on our continuous, clinician-rated measure of depressive symptoms at post-treatment. There were no differences between the UP and SDP conditions on depressive symptoms at post-treatment or at the 12-month follow-up timepoint. Conclusions: In this exploratory set of analyses, the UP evidenced efficacy for reduction of depressive symptoms, adding to the growing support for its utility in treating depression.

Physical activity and blood pressure during pregnancy: Mediation by anxiety symptoms,"Background: During pregnancy, physiological systems and psychological perceptions vary across individuals. Prenatal physical activity has been linked to reduced anxiety symptoms and lower blood pressure values. However, whether anxiety symptoms can mediate the relationship between physical activity and blood pressure during pregnancy remains unclear. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 1275 pregnant women enrolled in Nanjing, China. Life behaviours and anxiety symptoms were investigated during the first trimester. Anxiety symptoms were measured by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale. Blood pressure values were taken during the third trimester. Multivariate linear regression models were used to estimate the associations of physical activity with anxiety symptoms and blood pressure, and mediating effect models were used to detect the regulating effect by anxiety. Results: The participants were assigned to 3 groups based on their frequency and intensity of physical activity, and those who engaged in regular physical activity had lower blood pressure values. Anxiety symptoms were milder in the regular group than in the insufficient group. Partial mediating effect of anxiety on the association between regular physical activity and systolic blood pressure was significant after accounting for some confounders. Limitations: The participants' physical activity and anxiety symptoms were self-reported, as well as the lack of details of physical activity during pregnancy may restrict the power of our findings. Conclusions: Regular physical activity might be beneficial for anxiety and blood pressure. Physical activity likely stabilises systolic blood pressure by alleviating anxiety symptoms. Our research could provide a positive theoretical reference for guiding prenatal care.

The effectiveness of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for health anxiety in routine care,"Introduction: Randomised controlled trials have shown that internet-delivered cognitive behavioural treatment (iCBT) is an effective treatment for health anxiety, but the effectiveness of these programs in routine care has not been investigated. This study examined the effectiveness of iCBT for health anxiety symptoms in routine care settings in the community. Methods: Using an open-trial design, we investigated adherence to, and effectiveness of a 6-lesson iCBT program for health anxiety symptoms amongst individuals ( n = 391, mean age 41 years, 64% female) who enrolled in the program either self-guided ( n = 312) or under the supervision of community clinicians (general practitioners, psychologists and other allied health professionals) ( n = 79). Primary outcome was health anxiety severity on the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI), and secondary outcomes were depression severity on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) (depression) and distress (Kessler-10: K-10). Results: Adherence to the iCBT program was modest (45.6% in the clinician-supervised group, 33.0% in the unguided group), but within-subjects effect sizes were large (SHAI: g = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.45–1.88; PHQ-9: g = 1.12, 95%CI: 0.92–1.32; K-10: g = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.15–1.56). Limitations: No control group, lack of follow-up data. Conclusions: iCBT is an effective treatment for health anxiety symptoms in routine care, but methods to increase adherence are needed to optimise benefits to participants. Randomised controlled effectiveness trials with long-term follow-up are needed.

Panic attack provocation in panic disorder patients with a computer simulation,"Background: Computer simulations (CS) and virtual reality exposure are promising techniques for research and treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA). The objective of this study was to ascertain whether a given CS was a stimulus capable of producing panic attacks (PAs), anxiety and psychophysiological changes in patients with PDA. Methods: Thirty PDA patients and 30 healthy subjects were recruited for this study. Subjects were exposed to a 3-min CS of a situation relevant to agoraphobic patients. Anxiety, panic symptoms, PAs, heart rate, skin conductance and respiration were recorded before, during and after the CS exposure. Results: The CS effectively induced anxiety, hyperventilation and electrodermal responses in PDA patients but not in healthy subjects. Forty percent of PDA patients had a PA while none of the control subjects had a PA. A subgroup of patients who were less sensitive to the CS than the other subgroup of PDA patients and did not present full-blown PAs still had more panic symptoms, higher anxiety levels and more respiratory irregularities than the controls. Limitations: Low immersion and low sense of presence, lack of interaction with the environment. Conclusions: Exposure to the CS produced effects similar to in vivo exposure, respiratory and caffeine challenges.

Prevalence and clinical correlates of psychotic depression in first-episode and drug-naïve outpatients with major depressive disorder in a Chinese Han population,"Background: Few systemic studies of psychotic depression (PD) have been conducted in first-episode and drug-naïve (FEDN) patients. This study was to examine the prevalence of PD and its clinical correlates in a large sample of FEDN outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in a Chinese Han population, which to our best knowledge has not been studied. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 1718 FEDN MDD outpatients were recruited. All patients were rated on the positive symptom subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for psychotic symptoms, the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) for depression and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) for anxiety. Results: The prevalence of PD was 10.0% (171/1718) in MDD patients. Compared to the non-PD patients, PD patients had significantly older age, lower educational levels, higher anxiety symptom score and were more likely to attempt suicide. Further logistic regression analysis indicated that PD was associated with older age, suicide attempt and comorbid anxiety (all p &lt; 0.05). Multiple regression analyses showed that both HAMD and HAMA total scores were significantly associated with PANSS positive symptom subscale score. Limitations: Our cross-sectional study design does not show a direct causal relationship between psychiatric symptoms and related factors in patients with MDD. Conclusions: Our results suggest a high prevalence of PD in MDD patients in the acute early stage in a Chinese Han population, which is associated with demographic variables and clinical symptoms.

Prevalence and clinical correlates of subclinical hypothyroidism in first-episode drug-naive patients with major depressive disorder in a large sample of Chinese,"Background: The coexistence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and depression has been intensively examined in the patients receiving thyroxine or antidepressant treatment. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical correlates of severe SCH in Chinese first-episode drug naïve patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, we recruited a total of 1706 MDD patients. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Severity of anxiety and psychiatric symptoms were evaluated by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), respectively. Serum thyroid function parameters were measured by a chemiluminescence immunoassay. Based on the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level, SCH was further divided into mild (TSH &lt; 10 mIU/L) and severe SCH (TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L). Results: More patients with severe SCH had severe anxiety, psychotic symptoms, suicide attempts (all p &lt; 0.001), compared with those without severe SCH. Logistic regression showed that suicide attempts and psychiatric symptoms were associated with severe SCH (both p &lt; 0.001). Multiple linear regression showed that age ( p &lt; 0.05), BMI ( p &lt; 0.001), HAMD score ( p &lt; 0.001), HAMA score ( p &lt; 0.001), PANSS positive subscore ( p = 0.001) and CGI score ( p = 0.001) were associated with TSH levels. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that suicide attempts and psychiatric symptoms may be associated with severe SCH. Moreover, severe anxiety, depressive and psychotic symptoms, as well as older age and higher BMI are possibly related to elevated TSH levels.

Comorbidity in post-traumatic stress disorder: A population-based study from the two largest cities in Brazil,"Background: This study investigated the patterns of comorbidity between PTSD and depression, other anxiety disorders, alcohol-related disorders using the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. The temporal sequence of the comorbid diagnoses was also investigated. Methods: We used data from a large population-based survey carried out between 2007 and 2008 in the two largest cities in Brazil: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Results: Diagnoses of depression, other anxiety disorders, and alcohol-related disorder were more prevalent in the people with PTSD than in those without PTSD. Using the DSM-IV criteria, approximately 67% of cases presenting PTSD were also diagnosed with another mental disorder. The diagnosis category of other anxiety disorders presented the highest proportion of comorbidity (53%). Depression was found in 34% person with PTSD whilst alcohol-related disorders were observed in 7%. Considering the temporal relationship, the onset of comorbid depression was uniformly distributed through the periods before, within the same year and after PTSD's onset. When other anxiety disorders were comorbid with PTSD, in almost 90% of the cases the other anxiety disorders preceded PTSD. For comorbidity between of alcohol-related disorders and PTSD, in 50% of the cases alcohol-related disorders preceded the diagnosis of PTSD. Limitations: The cross-sectional design imposes limitations on establishing a temporal relationship between the onset of psychiatric disorders due to memory bias. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that among individuals presenting comorbid PTSD and other anxiety disorders, this diagnosis tend to precede PTSD. Comorbid cases are more frequent and more severe, and this should be taken into account in therapeutic research and clinical practice.

Changes in psychopathological symptoms during pregnancy and after delivery: A prospective-longitudinal study in women with and without anxiety and depressive disorders prior to pregnancy,"Background: The role of anxiety and depressive disorders prior to pregnancy for changes in peripartum psychopathological symptoms has not been resolved yet. Methods: A regional-epidemiological sample of 306 women was prospectively followed in seven waves from early pregnancy until 16 months postpartum. Lifetime DSM-IV anxiety and depressive disorders were assessed at baseline with the CIDI-V. Psychopathological symptoms (somatization, obsession–compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism) were measured with the BSI three times during pregnancy and three times after delivery. Results: Multilevel analyses revealed that women with versus without lifetime anxiety (β = 0.22 to β = 0.32) and depressive (β = 0.24 to β = 0.34) disorders prior to pregnancy experienced higher peripartum psychopathological symptoms. All symptoms linearly decreased during pregnancy (β = -0.02 to β = -0.07 per month). Somatization (β = -0.46) was lower, whereas paranoid ideation (β = 0.26) and obsession-compulsion (β = 0.21) were higher after delivery than during pregnancy. Though, obsession-compulsion linearly decreased after delivery (β = - 0.02). Lifetime anxiety disorders prior to pregnancy interacted with linear changes in anxiety (β = -0.04) and phobic anxiety (β = -0.05) during pregnancy. That is, only women with, but not without anxiety disorders prior to pregnancy experienced a linear decline in anxiety and phobic anxiety during pregnancy. Limitations: Lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders were assessed in early pregnancy and might be biased. Conclusions: Peripartum psychopathological symptoms are higher in women with versus without lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders prior to pregnancy, but symptom changes only slightly vary by lifetime diagnostic status.

"Social anxiety disorder among children and adolescents: A nationwide survey of prevalence, socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors and comorbidities","Background: Social anxiety disorder is a frequent psychiatric disorder. We aimed to estimate the life-time prevalence, socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors and co-morbidities of this condition among children and adolescents. Methods: This was a cross sectional national survey conducted in Iranian individuals aged 6 to 18 years. Face-to-face household interviews were performed by trained clinical psychologists. The Farsi version of the kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia for school-age children/present and lifetime version (K-SADSPL) was administered to estimate the SAD prevalence. Parental personality traits and their psychopathologies were also obtained using Millon clinical multiaxial inventory, third edition (MCMI-III) to find the possible risk factors. Results: From 29,878 participants, 585 individuals were diagnosed with SAD and weighted lifetime prevalence of 1.8% was observed. The odds of this condition was significantly higher among older adolescents (odds ratio (OR):1.47; 95% confidence interval(CI): 1.11-1.95) and individuals with paternal history of psychiatric hospitalization (OR: 2.96; 95%CI: 1.29-6.79). Higher means of persistent depression disorder (OR: 1.009; 95%CI: 1.000-1.018) and melancholic personality trait (OR: 1.007; 95%CI: 1.001-1.014) in mothers as well as schizophrenia spectrum (OR: 1.014; 95%CI: 1.001-1.027) and anxiety (OR: 1.010; 95%CI: 1.010-1.021) in fathers were statistically associated with higher odds of SAD in their children. Other anxiety disorders and behavioral disorders were the most prevalent co-morbidities. Limitations: The cross-sectional analysis does not enable analyses of possible causal associations. Lacking control group and follow-up periods were other major limitations that should be resolved in future studies. Conclusion: Clinicians and researchers need to continue studying this condition at all levels and in all developmental periods.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in group format for anxiety and depression. A systematic review,"Background: : Emotional disorders, such as anxiety and depression, are one of the main causes of disability worldwide. Recent reviews suggest that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is effective in treating emotional disorders. However, they appraise mainly individual approaches. This review aimed to analyze published studies regarding the usefulness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, applied on a group basis, in the treatment of anxiety and depression. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the Web of Science, from 2008 to 2019. Fifteen articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Results: Those patients who received interventions based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy showed a better emotional state and greater psychological flexibility than patients in control groups without treatment. No differences are found with Cognitive Therapy and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. Limitations: : the studies reviewed show limitations, principally regarding sample characteristics, study design and manner in which mechanisms responsible for changes are evaluated. Conclusion: Group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy proved to be useful in the psychological treatment of emotional disorders. However, the heterogeneity and limitations of the studies, make it impossible to determine the exact therapeutic elements, and if they are specific to the approach and procedure of this therapy. More research would be necessary to ascertain what patient and/or intervention characteristics might improve results and what the active and specific ingredients of the therapy are. This has clinical relevance because group-based interventions could be more cost-efficient, and it would help facilitate health-care decisions aimed at giving the public access to useful treatments.

Associations of body dissatisfaction with anxiety and depression in the pregnancy and postpartum periods: A longitudinal study,"Background: Pregnancy is a time of increasing vulnerability to the development of body dissatisfaction, anxiety, and depression. The present study aims to examine associations of body dissatisfaction with anxiety and depression at the following points: 6 months before pregnancy (retrospective report); in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy; and up to 6 weeks postpartum. Methods: A prospective longitudinal design with a quantitative approach was adopted. A consecutive sample of 1,371 Chinese pregnant women in Hong Kong was assessed using standardized instruments at four time points. Results: A mixed-effects model with repeated measures revealed that body dissatisfaction and depression symptoms changed across different stages of pregnancy. Hierarchical multiple regressions showed that, after adjusting for the identified risk factors, body dissatisfaction before and during pregnancy were positively associated with antenatal anxiety and depression symptoms. Concurrent body dissatisfaction was positively associated with postpartum depression symptoms. Limitations: There was a high attrition rate in the follow-up assessments. Antenatal anxiety symptoms were assessed using the scale for general anxiety, which may not adequately capture the experience of anxiety among pregnant women. Conclusions: Primary healthcare practitioners should be made aware of body dissatisfaction among pregnant women in order to facilitate early intervention for anxiety and depression, because untreated psychological disturbance during pregnancy may persist into the postpartum period.Body dissatisfaction Antenatal anxiety Antenatal depression Postpartum anxiety Postpartum depression (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2020
Self-perception of physical health conditions and its association with depression and anxiety among Bangladeshi university students,"Background: Self-perception of physical health conditions is associated with depression and anxiety. Although some recent studies revealed a high prevalence of depression and anxiety among Bangladeshi university students, no study has yet investigated the link between self-perception of physical health and these common psychological disorders. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the association of self-perception of physical health conditions with depression and anxiety among university students in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between August and November 2017 among 897 undergraduate students of Jahangirnagar University, Dhaka through face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. Chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis were used to examine the association between the variables. Results: 13.9% of the respondents had poor self-rated health (SRH) and 49.9% had self-rated body image (SRBI) dissatisfaction. 25.6% of the students reported to be overweight/obese whereas 18.7% to be underweight. Poor and moderate SRH was found to be significantly associated with students’ depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 6.700; 95% CI: 3.821–11.749 and AOR: 2.155; 95% CI: 1.582–2.934) and anxiety (AOR: 4.365; 95% CI: 2.599–7.332 and AOR: 1.776; 95% CI: 1.270–2.484). Furthermore, SRBI dissatisfaction, underweight SRBI, overweight/obese SRBI, low blood pressure and hypertension were also significantly linked with students’ depression and anxiety. Conclusion: Students dissatisfied with their physical health status had higher chances to suffer from depression and anxiety. The findings of this study would create room for further research and could be used to design a comprehensive health program for young students.

Responses to academic stress mediate the association between sleep difficulties and depressive/anxiety symptoms in Chinese adolescents,"Objective: Sleep difficulties are pervasive in Chinese adolescents, which exert aversive influence on their emotional health. However, the underlying mechanisms of this effect remain unclear. This study addressed whether stress responses mediate the concurrent and prospective relationship between sleep difficulties and depressive/anxiety symptoms in Chinese adolescents. Method: 17,946 adolescents (14–18 years-old) were administrated the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale and the Responses to Stress Questionnaire. Further, 710 of them finished the one-year follow-up assessments. Structural equation models were conducted to determine the concurrent and prospective mediation effects of stress responses and the moderated effect of gender and age. Results: Involuntary engagement and disengagement responses, as well as engagement coping, significantly mediated the cross-sectional relationship between sleep difficulties and depressive/anxiety symptoms. Moreover, sleep difficulties at baseline predicted enhanced involuntary engagement responses but reduced the use of engagement coping strategies one year later, resulting in an elevated level of depressive/anxiety symptoms. Finally, females and younger adolescents with greater sleep difficulties were more likely to generate maladaptive stress responses. Limitations: First, sleep difficulties were only measured using self-reported approaches. Second, potential confounding variables (e.g., socioeconomic status) were not adjusted for. Third, our study only focused on typically-developing youth samples rather than clinical samples. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the important role of stress responses in the relationship between sleep difficulties and depressive/anxiety symptoms. The findings might also shed some light on the psychological intervention of sleep difficulties and mood disorder in adolescent populations.

"Gender differences in depression, anxiety, and stress among college students: A longitudinal study from China","Background: The objective of this longitudinal study was to examine the gender differences in college students' depression, anxiety, and stress over the four academic years, and to explore possible anxiety-related factors among first year students. Methods: The study analyzed 1892 undergraduate students from 15 universities in China, with 898 females and 994 males. The students have been followed for four years and completed a survey containing the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 questionnaire, students’ socio-demographic information, and their educational background, etc. Results: (1) On average, both female and male college students suffered from mild anxiety in the first three years. Female students scored significantly higher in anxiety than males in the first and second years, and there was no significant gender difference in students’ average depression and stress levels. (2) A significantly larger proportion of female students experienced anxiety above the normal threshold, whereas a higher percentage of male students endured different degrees of depression; no significant gender differences were found in stress problems. (3) Anxiety had a significant positive correlation with introversion. Female freshmen's anxiety levels were also associated with their body image, drinking habits, and academic performance. Limitations: Response bias may exist considering that self-reported data was used. Due to data unavailability, we only explored the anxiety-related factors in freshman year, which cannot sufficiently reflect the consistency of correlations over time. Conclusions: Anxiety turned out to be the most prevalent and serious issue for college students, especially for female students; while a growing prevalence of depression was found among male students during college. It is of great significance to adopt collegiate policies reflecting the gender differentials.

Is cognitive performance associated with anxiety and depression in first-episode psychosis?,"Background: In first-episode psychosis (FEP), symptoms of anxiety and depression are common. We examined whether cognitive performance is associated with these clinical measures in FEP during a one-year follow-up. Methods: Young adults with non-affective FEP ( n = 52) were assessed two months after their first psychiatric contact for psychosis. Matched controls ( n = 62) were administered a baseline assessment. 32 FEP subjects and 44 controls were assessed again at a one-year follow-up. In both assessments, a broad neuropsychological test battery was administered. Clinical evaluation was done with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Cross-sectional correlations were calculated at both time points. Cognitive test scores were used as independent variables in regression models, predicting both baseline and follow-up symptom levels. Results: At baseline, better performance especially in verbal memory and executive functioning was associated with elevated anxiety symptoms in FEP. In addition, better performance especially in verbal working memory was associated with depression. A year later, better cognitive performance was no longer associated with affective symptoms. Limitations: Small sample sizes are a limitation. Conclusions: In the FEP group, higher cognitive performance associated with affective symptoms. Right after getting severely ill, anxiety and depression may be a part of normal adaptive reactions to the situation and markers of an intact cognitive performance. This association seems to cease during the year following the FEP.

Strategies for engaging patients and families in collaborative care programs for depression and anxiety disorders: A systematic review,"Background: Patients and families are often referred to as important partners in collaborative mental health care (CMHC). However, how to meaningfully engage them as partners remains unclear. We aimed to identify strategies for engaging patients and families in CMHC programs for depression and anxiety disorders. Methods: We updated a Cochrane review of CMHC programs for depression and anxiety disorders. Searches were conducted in Cochrane CCDAN and CINAHL, complemented by additional database searches, trial registry searches, and cluster searches for ‘sibling’ articles. Coding and data extraction of engagement strategies was an iterative process guided by a conceptual framework. We used narrative synthesis and descriptive statistics to report on findings. Findings: We found 148 unique CMCH programs, described in 578 articles. Most programs (96%) featured at least one strategy for engaging patients or families. Programs adopted 15 different strategies overall, with a median of two strategies per program (range 0–9 strategies). The most common strategies were patient education (87% of programs) and self-management supports (47% of programs). Personalized care planning, shared decision making, and family or peer supports were identified in fewer than one third of programs. Limitations: Our search strategy was designed to capture programs evaluated in clinical trials and so other innovative programs not studied in trials were likely missed. Conclusion: Most CMHC programs for depression and anxiety disorders adopted a limited number of strategies to engage patients and families in their care. However, this review identifies numerous strategies that can be used to strengthen the patient- and family-centeredness of collaborative care.

Relationship between maternal pregnancy-related anxiety and infant brain responses to emotional speech—A pilot study,"Background: Maternal pregnancy-related anxiety (PRA) is reportedly related to neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants. However, the relationship between maternal PRA and the processing of emotions in the infant brain has not been extensively studied with neuroimaging. The objective of the present pilot study is to investigate the relationship between maternal PRA and infant hemodynamic responses to emotional speech at two months of age. Methods: The study sample included 19 mother-infant dyads from a general sample of a population of Caucasian mothers. Self-reported Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire (PRAQ-R2) data was collected from mothers during pregnancy at gestational weeks (gwks) 24 ( N = 19) and 34 ( N = 18). When their infants were two months old, the infants’ brains functional responses to emotional speech in the left fronto-temporoparietal cortex were recorded using diffuse optical tomography (DOT). Results: Maternal PRAQ-R2 scores at gwk 24 correlated negatively with the total hemoglobin (HbT) responses to sad speech on both sides of the temporoparietal junction (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ρ = -0.87). The correlation was significantly greater at gwk 24 than gwk 34 (ρ = -0.42). Limitations: The field of view of the measurement did not include the right hemisphere or parts of the frontal cortex. The sample size is moderate and the mothers were relatively highly educated, thus there may be some differences between the study sample and the general population. Conclusions: Maternal pregnancy-related anxiety may affect child brain emotion processing development. Further research is needed to understand the functional and developmental significance of the findings.

Psychological distress profiles in expectant mothers: What is the association with pregnancy-related and relational variables?,"Introduction: Research has progressively focused on antenatal psychological disease of expectant mothers, showing that anxiety and depression as well as fear of childbirth occur frequently during pregnancy. Some studies have investigated the connection between anxiety, depression, and fear of childbirth with contrasting results. Several authors have analyzed the association between psychological disease of pregnant women and numerous medical-obstetric and relational variables, still reporting inconclusive findings. The present study had three aims: 1) to investigate the psychological well-being of pregnant women based on their levels of anxiety, depression, and fear of childbirth, by identifying psychological profiles; (2) to analyze the association between the emergent psychological profiles and some medical-obstetric variables related to pregnancy; and (3) to examine the association between these profiles and couple's adjustment and social support. Methods: 410 Italian primiparous pregnant women in the 7th-8th month of pregnancy completed a questionnaire packet on site that included the following scales: Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Results: Findings revealed the presence of three different clusters: “psychologically healthy women” (34.9%), comprised of women characterized by low levels of symptoms on all the scales; “women experiencing pregnancy- and childbirth-related anxiety” (47.3%), which groups women with an average state anxiety over the clinical value; and “psychologically distressed women” (17.8%), comprised of women who reported high levels of symptoms on all the scales, some above the clinical cut-offs. These profiles were not related to the medical-obstetric variables. On the other hand, findings revealed a significant association between marital adjustment as well as social support and cluster membership. Discussion: These results support the importance of early and multilevel psychological screening in order to understand the experience of pregnant women and to develop targeted and increasingly personalized interventions.

Examining the boundaries between ICD-11 PTSD/CPTSD and depression and anxiety symptoms: A network analysis perspective,"Background: Two newly identified sibling disorders – ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD – have been well validated in the last few years. Although these trauma-related disorders are suggested to be neatly separated from depression and anxiety, no study has used a network analysis to examine those definitions’ construct validity when they also interplay with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Additionally, no research has focused upon the specific boundaries between these four disorders’ symptoms, the bridges between them, and the ways they influence each other among clinical populations. Methods: A sample of 234 men drawn randomly from a national sample of 1,600 Jewish men receiving treatment for domestic violence in Israel completed the ICD-11 International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Results: The ICD-11 CPTSD, depression and anxiety clustering network results revealed, within the EGA, a four-cluster solution in which PTSD and CPTSD symptoms are differentiated from two other distinct clusters of anxiety and depression symptoms. Feelings of worthlessness and avoiding internal reminders of the experience were the most central symptoms. Limitations: Due to the use of a cross-sectional design, causal interpretation of the network correlation between symptoms should be made cautiously. Conclusions: These findings strengthen the approach that ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD have a distinct construct; however, they also reflect a strong positive connection to anxiety and depression symptoms and no clear boundaries between disorders. Specifically, dysphoria/avoidance-related symptoms act as a bridge between the disorders, which may be important targets for specific assessments and related interventions.

The effects of aerobic physical exercises on body image among women with polycystic ovary syndrome,"Background: Both physical and mental health care for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) require a multidisciplinary approach. We evaluated the effects of continuous (CAT) and intermittent (IAT) aerobic training in different protocols that measure body image, anxiety, depression and sexual dysfunction in women with PCOS. Methods: In this controlled clinical trial, women with PCOS were randomly allocated for 16 weeks to 1 out of 3 groups: CAT ( n = 28), IAT ( n = 29), or control group (CG, n = 30). For data collection, we used the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), Figure Rating Scale (FRS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Measurement Scales (HADS). Results: No effects of CAT, IAT or CG groups were identified in the perceptual dimension of body image. The dis(satisfaction) grade improved after exercise in the CAT group ( p ≤ 0.01) compared to the CG, as well as improved within CAT and IAT groups. Total FSFI, and HADS-A and HADS-D scores improved after exercise in the both groups. At baseline and after the study period, there were positive correlations between scores for dis(satisfaction), HADS-A and HADS-D scores. HADS-A and HADS-D scores had a negative correlation with FSFI total in the IAT ( p = =0.02) group compared to the CG, as well as within CAT and IAT groups. Limitations: The participants were not matched for body mass index (normal, overweight and obese) which may interfere on body image dimensions. Conclusion: Aerobic exercise improves sexual function and indices related to anxiety and depression. Likewise, it interferes in cognitive-affective dimension of the body image.

Updating the evidence for an association between anxiety and risk of Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies,"Objectives: Anxiety is postulated to be a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our primary aim was to conduct a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies investigating the association between anxiety and AD risk. Design: We searched multiple scientific databases to identify relevant papers published up to March 2019. Inclusion criteria were: prospective cohort studies with a minimum follow-up period of 1 year, baseline anxiety assessment, absence of dementia at baseline, investigated the association between anxiety and AD incidence, and reporting Relative Risks (RRs), or equivalents (HRs and SHRs), for the association between anxiety and AD risk. We excluded studies that: focused on subjective memory or mild cognitive impairment samples, review and meta-analyses, not reporting original, published peer-reviewed results. We used a random-effects model that accommodated the differences in association statistics. Results: 7 prospective cohorts (reported in 6 studies), with a total of 24,528 participants, were included in our meta-analysis. A marginally significant association between anxiety and AD risk was found, with a pooled RR of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.00–2.12), and a population attributable fraction for AD of 2.8% (95% CI: 1.2%–4.3%). Limitations: There was a high level of heterogeneity across the studies, which may be associated with differences in the covariates adjusted for. Studies also differed considerably in how they measured anxiety. Conclusion: Anxiety is marginally associated with an increased risk of AD in this meta-analysis. Future research is needed to determine the extent to which anxiety might be a cause of AD rather than a prodrome or marker.

Augmenting the unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders with transcranial direct current stimulation in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder and comorbid depression: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: The aim of the current study was to compare the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) with and without transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in individuals suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and comorbid depression. Methods: A total of 43 individuals diagnosed with GAD and comorbid depression enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (IRCT20140929019334N1). Participants were randomly assigned to three groups including UP with tDCS (UP+tDCS; n = 15), UP alone (UP; n = 13) or wait-list control ( n = 15). GAD and depression symptoms, worry severity, anxiety sensitivity, and intolerance of uncertainty were assessed at baseline, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Results: Treatment with both UP+tDCS and UP alone resulted in significant lower ratings across all measures relative to wait-list controls at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up (all p -values &lt; 0.001). UP+tDCS showed significantly greater reductions in anxiety ( p = 0.001 post-treatment; p = 0.003 follow-up), worry ( p = 0.001 post-treatment; p = 0.002 follow-up), and anxiety sensitivity ( p = 0.003 post-treatment; p = 0.002 follow-up) relative to UP alone. Limitations: The present study had some limitations. First, the sample size was low. Another limitation was the use of a short-term follow-up. Conclusions: These results suggest augmenting UP treatment with tDCS may be an efficacious strategy to improve treatment outcomes in GAD with comorbid depression.

"Measurement invariance of assessments of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) across sex, strata and linguistic backgrounds in a European-wide sample of patients after Traumatic Brain Injury","Background: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) are two widely used instruments to screen patients for depression and anxiety. Comparable psychometric properties across different demographic and linguistic groups are necessary for multiple group comparison and international research on depression and anxiety. Objectives and Method: We examine measurement invariance for the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 by: (a) the sex of the participants, (b) recruitment stratum, and (c) linguistic background. This study is based on non-randomized observational data six months after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) that were collected in 18 countries. We used multiple methods to detect Differential Item Functioning (DIF) including Item Response Theory, logistic regression, and the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: At the 6-month post-injury, 2137 (738 [34.5%] women) participants completed the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaires: 885 [41.4%] patients were primarily admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 805 [37.7%] were admitted to hospital ward, and 447 [20.9%] were evaluated in the Emergency Room and discharged. Results supported the invariance of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 across sex, patient strata and linguistic background. For different strata three PHQ-9 items and one GAD-7 item and for different linguistic groups only two GAD-7 items were flagged as showing differences in two out of four DIF tests. However, the magnitude of the DIF effect was negligible. Limitation: Despite high number of participants from ICU, patients have mostly mild TBI. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate adequate psychometric properties for PHQ-9 and GAD-7, allowing direct multigroup comparison across sex, strata, and linguistic background.

"Association of antepartum depression, generalized anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder with infant birth weight and gestational age at delivery","Background: Low- and middle-income countries bear a disproportionate burden of preterm birth (PTB) and low infant birth weight (LBW) complications where affective and anxiety disorders are more common in the antepartum period than in industrialized countries. Objective: To evaluate the extent to which early pregnancy antepartum depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are associated with infant birth weight and gestational age at delivery among a cohort of pregnant women in Peru. Methods: Our prospective cohort study consisted of 4408 pregnant women. Antepartum depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD were assessed in early pregnancy using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 and PTSD Checklist – Civilian Version, respectively. Pregnancy outcome data were obtained from medical records. Multivariable linear and logistic regression procedures were used to estimate adjusted measures of association (β coefficients and odds ratios) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: After adjusting for confounders, women with antepartum generalized anxiety (32.6% prevalence) had higher odds of LBW (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.47; 95%CI: 1.10–1.95) and were more likely to deliver small for gestational age (OR = 1.39; 95%CI: 1.01–1.92) infants compared to those without anxiety. Compared to those without PTSD, women with PTSD (34.5%) had higher odds of delivering preterm (OR = 1.28; 95%CI: 1.00–1.65) yet PTSD was not associated with LBW nor gestational age at delivery. Women with antepartum depression (26.2%) were at no increased risk of delivering a preterm, low-birth-weight or small-for-gestational-age infant. Limitations: Our ability to make casual inferences from this observational study is limited; however, these findings are consistent with prior studies. Conclusion: Generalized anxiety disorder during pregnancy appeared to increase odds of delivering a low-birth-weight or small-for-gestational-age infant, while PTSD was associated with increased odds of delivering preterm. Our findings, and those of others, suggest antenatal care should be tailored to screen for and provide additional mental health services to patients.

Antidepressant resistance in adolescents with major depressive disorder: A nationwide longitudinal study,"Background: Studies have suggested that psychiatric comorbidities have major effects on antidepressant resistance in adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the association between psychiatric comorbidities and antidepressant resistance remains unclear in adolescents with MDD. Methods: A total of 10,624 adolescents with MDD were selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 2001 and 2010 and followed for one year. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) was defined as unresponsiveness to at least two antidepressants, and treatment resistant tendency was defined as unresponsiveness to the first antidepressant. Psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), were assessed as confounding factors. Results: In our study, only 1.7% (n = 184) of adolescents with MDD met the TRD criteria but 23.3% (n = 2480) were classified as exhibiting treatment resistant tendency. Anxiety disorders (OR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.73–3.16) and substance use disorders (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.28–4.54) exhibited a correlation with TRD, and ADHD (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08–1.66) was associated with treatment resistant tendency. Conclusions: Approximately one-fourth of adolescents with MDD respond poorly to the first antidepressant treatment. The psychiatric comorbidities of anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and ADHD may increase the risk of treatment resistance in adolescents with MDD.

One-Year follow-up effects of a cognitive behavior therapy-based transdiagnostic program for emotional problems in young children: A school-based cluster-randomized controlled trial,"Background: The present study examined the long-term efficacy of a transdiagnostic prevention program, Super Skills for Life (SSL), among young children with emotional problems. SSL is based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral activation, and social skills training. Methods: One-hundred and twenty-three Spanish-speaking children, aged 6 to 8 years, and their parents participated in the study. They were recruited from ten schools. Schools were randomly allocated to either the intervention (IG) or waiting-list control (WLC) groups. The children's parent completed a set of questionnaires to measure their child's anxiety and depressive symptoms, general difficulties and positive attributes, and psychosocial impairment. Parent's assessment at baseline and at a 12-month follow-up was assessed using an intent-to-treat approach. Results: The IG, compared to WLC group, showed significant baseline-to-follow-up reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as in behavioral difficulties and psychosocial impairment in various life domains. Limitations: The small sample size and the reliance on parental reports were the major limitations of this study. Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence of the long-term effects of SSL, suggesting that it is a promising indicated preventive intervention for young children with emotional problems.

Fear of missing out predicts repeated measurements of greater negative affect using experience sampling methodology,"Background: Fear of missing out (FOMO) has been increasingly researched recently, especially in relation to negative affectivity constructs. Our aim was to examine relations between FOMO and repeated measurements of negative affect over one week. Method: We investigated associations between FOMO and prospectively-measured negative affect over one week in an experience sampling study of 93 undergraduate students. Participants completed an initial web survey assessing depression, anxiety and FOMO. Over the week, participants responded to daily text messages, assessing negative affect from earlier in the day. Results: On a bivariate basis, FOMO, depression and anxiety severity were related to daily negative affect assessments. Using multivariate growth modeling, higher initial negative affect was related to decreasing negative affect over the week. Female sex and higher anxiety related to higher initial negative affect ratings. Higher FOMO levels related to increasing negative affect over the week. Limitations: Findings were based on self-report methodology, using university students and only one week of measurement. Conclusions: Results suggest that women and more anxious individuals had higher initial negative affect, while FOMO predicted increasing negative affect over the week. Results advance understanding of FOMO in relation to psychopathology, and are discussed in the context of Self-Determination Theory.

Gender-specific predictors of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms in older adults: Results of a large population-based study,"Background: Anxiety in older age is common. In comparison with men, older women experience higher levels of anxiety and show different patterns of co-occurring mental disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate gender-specific biopsychosocial predictors associated with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) symptoms after a period of three years in the elderly population. Methods: Data were derived from the third (2008–2010) and the fourth follow-up (2011–2014) of the large population-based German ESTHER study. 2254 participants ages 55–85 were included in the study (52.3% female; 47.7% male). Generalized Anxiety Disorder Symptoms were measured using the GAD-7 questionnaire at both follow-ups. Linear regression analyses were performed to predict GAD severity after three years; the analyses were separated by gender and adjusted for demographic variables, biopsychosocial health, cognitive impairment, loneliness, and psychosocial resources. Results: In women, GAD severity after three years (t1) was positively associated with younger age, depression symptoms, loneliness, and GAD severity at t0. In men, GAD severity was positively associated with somatic symptoms as well as with GAD severity at t0. In both genders GAD severity at baseline was the strongest predictor of elevated future anxiety symptoms. Limitations: GAD was examined by the use of questionnaires rather than by personal assessment; underreporting of GAD symptoms is therefore possible. Conclusions: Our study shows that an increase as well as a decrease of GAD severity in older women and men can be predicted by several biopsychosocial variables.

"Neuroimaging, genetic, clinical, and demographic predictors of treatment response in patients with social anxiety disorder","Background: Correct prediction of treatment response is a central goal of precision psychiatry. Here, we tested the predictive accuracy of a variety of pre-treatment patient characteristics, including clinical, demographic, molecular genetic, and neuroimaging markers, for treatment response in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Methods: Forty-seven SAD patients (mean ± SD age 33.9 ± 9.4 years, 24 women) were randomized and commenced 9 weeks’ Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) combined either with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram (20 mg daily [10 mg first week], SSRI + CBT, n = 24) or placebo (placebo +CBT, n = 23). Treatment responders were defined from the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I ≤ 2). Before treatment, patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and the Multi-Source Interference Task taxing cognitive interference. Support vector machines (SVMs) were trained to separate responders from nonresponders based on pre-treatment neural reactivity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), amygdala, and occipital cortex, as well as molecular genetic, demographic, and clinical data. SVM models were tested using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Results: The best model separated treatment responders ( n = 24) from nonresponders based on pre-treatment dACC reactivity (83% accuracy, P = 0.001). Responders had greater pre-treatment dACC reactivity than nonresponders especially in the SSRI+CBT group. No other variable was associated with clinical response or added predictive accuracy to the dACC SVM model. Limitations: Small sample size, especially for genetic analyses. No replication or validation samples were available. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that treatment outcome predictions based on neural cingulate activity, at the individual level, outperform genetic, demographic, and clinical variables for medication-assisted Internet-delivered CBT, supporting the use of neuroimaging in precision psychiatry.

Fruit and vegetable intake in relation to depressive and anxiety symptoms among adolescents in 25 low- and middle-income countries,"Background: Fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) has been inversely associated with the risk of depression. However, there is a gap in evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and among adolescents. Further, little is known about FVI in relation to the risk of anxiety. Therefore, we examined these associations among adolescents in 25 LMICs. Methods: Data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey were analyzed in 65267 adolescents aged 12–15 years (mostly nationally representative). Depressive and anxiety symptoms during the past 12 months were self-reported. Frequencies of FVI during the past 30 days were collected. Multivariable logistic regression and meta-analyses of country-wise estimates were undertaken. Results: The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms were 30.3% and 9.8%, respectively. A meta-analysis indicated that FVI of &lt; 5 times/d (vs. higher) was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.02–1.18). The pooled estimate for anxiety symptoms was insignificant. When examined separately, fruit intake was significantly associated with both lower risks of depressive and anxiety symptoms; vegetable intake was significantly associated with a lower risk of depressive symptoms, but not with anxiety. Limitations: Only adolescents attending school were included; the cross-sectional design cannot reveal causality; outcomes were not measured against the gold-standard diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: Our study provides multi-national evidence of the protective effect of FVI against depressive and anxiety symptoms among adolescents in LMICs, enabling key stakeholders to address mental health issues among adolescents globally.

Contributions of fixed mindsets and hopelessness to anxiety and depressive symptoms: A commonality analysis approach,"Background: Fixed mindsets (beliefs that personal traits are unchangeable) show consistent associations with internalizing symptoms. However, the mindset-internalizing symptom link has previously been studied in isolation of other maladaptive cognitions that relate to internalizing symptoms. Thus, the unique contributions of mindsets to internalizing symptoms remains unclear. Method: We used commonality analysis (CA), which yields unique and shared effects of independent variables on an outcome, to assess unique contributions of emotion and anxiety mindsets to anxiety and depression symptoms, relative to the contributions of hopelessness. Participants in two online studies ( N s = 200, 430) self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms, hopelessness, and emotion and anxiety mindsets. Results: In Study 1, neither mindset type contributed unique variance to depression or anxiety beyond the contribution of hopelessness. In Study 2, emotion mindsets again explained no unique symptom variance. Anxiety mindsets uniquely contributed 2.0% and 6.5% of depression and anxiety variance, respectively—but far larger proportions of symptom variance (20.0%-60.9%) were contributed by hopelessness alone, variance shared by hopelessness and anxiety mindsets, and variance shared among hopelessness, anxiety mindsets, and emotion mindsets. Limitations: The cross-sectional design precludes causal conclusions, and the non-referred adult samples may limit generalizability. Discussion: Mindsets contributed little unique variance to internalizing symptoms beyond hopelessness. Interventions teaching growth mindsets have been shown to reduce internalizing problem in past studies. However, these interventions might not necessarily operate by shaping mindsets; rather, they may affect symptom change by shaping closely-linked maladaptive cognitions—like hopelessness—with stronger ties to internalizing distress.

Abnormal dynamic functional connectivity density in patients with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Numerous studies have revealed the abnormal static functional connectivity (FC) among different brain regions in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, little is known about the dynamic changes of FC in patients with GAD. Methods: This study investigated the whole-brain dynamic changes of FC in patients with GAD by combining global FC density (FCD) and sliding window correlation analyses. The standard deviation of dynamic FCD (dFCD) was calculated to evaluate its temporal variability along time. Support vector regression was then employed to predict the symptom severity of patients based on abnormal dynamic connectivity patterns. Results: The abnormal dFCD variability between 81 GAD patients and 80 healthy controls showed that the patients had higher dFCD variability in the bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and left hippocampus while lower dFCD variability in the right postcentral gyrus. The abnormal dFCD variability of the left dmPFC is an important feature for anxiety prediction. Limitations: The selection of sliding window length remains controversial, and most of our patients have been treated with medications. Future studies are expected to rule out the potential confounding effects from applying different parameters of the sliding window and recruiting large samples of medication-free patients. Conclusion: The altered patterns of time-varying brain connectivity in the frontolimbic and sensorimotor areas may reflect abnormal dynamic neural communication between these regions and other regions of the brain, which may deepen our understanding of the disease.

Postnatal depressive symptoms display marked similarities across continents,"Background: Postnatal depressive symptoms measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) are reported to display measurement variance regarding factor structure and the frequency of specific depressive symptoms. However, postnatal depressive symptoms measured by EPDS have not been compared between women representing three continents. Methods: A cross-sectional study including birth cohort samples from Denmark, Vietnam and Tanzania. Women were included during pregnancy at routine care sites. Depressive symptoms were self-reported 40–90 days postpartum using the EPDS. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and generalized additive regression models were performed. Results: A total of N = 4,516 participated in the study (Denmark N = 2,069, Vietnam N = 1,278, Tanzania N = 1,169). Factor analyses identified three factors (anhedonia, anxiety and depression) that were almost identical in the three study populations. The only variation between countries was that the item ‘self-harm’ loaded differently. Women from Tanzania and Denmark were more likely to have an EPDS total score above cut-off 12 (12.6% and 6.4%), compared to women from Vietnam (1.9%) ( p &lt; 0.001). A low level of education was associated with significantly more depressive symptoms after adjusting for country ( p &lt; 0.001). Limitations: EPDS data was collected at a later time point in the Danish sample. Conclusions: Postnatal depressive symptoms constitute a three-factor model across cultures including the factors anhedonia, anxiety and depression. The frequency of postnatal depressive symptoms differs between high-, medium-, and low-income countries. However, clinicians should bear in mind that low-educated women worldwide are more likely to experience postnatal depressive symptoms.

The effect of emotional working memory training on emotional and cognitive outcomes in individuals with elevated social anxiety,"Background: Although cognitive-behavioural therapy is the gold standard psychological treatment for individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD), it does not benefit everyone. Emotional working memory training (eWMT) is a promising alternative intervention. This study examined the effects of eWMT versus control training (CT) on emotional and cognitive outcomes in individuals with elevated social anxiety. Methods: Forty participants with elevated social anxiety were randomly allocated to eWMT ( n = 21) or CT ( n = 19), each consisting of six training sessions. At pre- and post-training, participants completed: a working memory task, an impromptu speech, and self-reported measures of emotional and cognitive outcomes (anticipatory processing, peak anxiety and attentional focus during the speech, post-event processing). Results: Participants in both training conditions exhibited performance improvements on their respective training tasks. As expected, there was a Time x Condition interaction for peak anxiety, reflecting a decrease in peak anxiety for the eWMT condition but not the CT condition. Exploratory analyses also indicated a Time x Condition interaction for an aspect of post-event processing, reflecting a decrease in thinking about the past for the eWMT condition but not the CT condition. Limitations: Although the level of social anxiety of the current sample is comparable to that of samples of individuals diagnosed with SAD in the literature, participant diagnoses were not assessed in this study. Conclusions: The findings suggest that eWMT has potential as an alternative intervention for individuals with elevated social anxiety.

Assessment of anxiety in children and adolescents: A comparative study on the validity and reliability of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale in children and adolescents with anxiety and Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Objective: The present study assessed the utility of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale - Parent Form (SCAS-P) across parents of children with (i) anxiety and (ii) Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Method: Parents of children aged 7–18 years with anxiety or ASD completed the SCAS-P. Multiple indicator multiple cause (MIMIC) structural equation modelling was utilized to analyse the data. Results: Analysis revealed different factor structures between the Anxious and ASD groups and evidence for measurement variance across groups in some parts of the SCAS-P. Conclusion: Results on the SCAS-P in children with ASD need to be interpreted with caution. Some SCAS-P items cannot be interpreted in the same way in an ASD population compared to neurotypical children with anxiety.

"The synergic relationship between social anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality and body fatness in adolescents","Background: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the cross-sectional synergic relationship among social anxiety, poor sleep quality, depressive symptoms and body fatness. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed with 1,242 adolescents from a north-eastern district in Brazil. It was used the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents for symptoms of social anxiety, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality and the Depression Scale of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies for depressive symptoms. Body fatness was the sum of triceps and subscapular skinfolds. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate associations among these comorbidities. Results: Social anxiety was directly and positively associated with depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality and body fatness (β = 0.316 standard deviations [SD]; β = 0.299 SD; β = 0.072 SD, respectively). Moreover, social anxiety was indirectly associated with depressive symptoms via poor sleep quality (β = 0.113 SD). Poor sleep quality was directly associated with depressive symptoms (β = 0.377 SD). We did not observe a significant relationship of poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms with body fatness. Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study; therefore, we cannot infer causality in the interpretation of the findings. Conclusions: Social anxiety seemed to play pivotal role in adolescents’ health, since it was associated with poor sleep quality, depressive symptoms and body fatness.

"Cyclothymic temperament: Associations with ADHD, other psychopathology, and medical morbidity in the general population","Background: Cyclothymic temperament (CT) is an affective disposition often preceding bipolar disorder (BD), and is the most common affective temperament in patients with BD. In depressed patients, CT is a predictor for developing a bipolar course. In a clinical sample of adults with BD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), CT was associated with higher loads of psychiatric symptoms, somatic comorbidity, impairment, and higher morbidity among first-degree relatives. We aimed to investigate the morbidity and occupational functioning of persons with CT in the general population. Methods: Randomly recruited Norwegian adults ( n = 721) were assessed with a 21-item cyclothymic subscale from the TEMPS Autoquestionnaire. Self-reported data were collected on psychiatric symptoms, comorbidity, educational and occupational level, and known family morbidity. Results: Thirteen percent had CT associated with an increased prevalence of ADHD, BD, high scores on the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), and childhood and adulthood ADHD symptoms. CT was found in 75% ( p &lt; .001) of the bipolar participants, and in 68% ( p &lt; .001) of those with a positive MDQ score. CT was associated with more anxiety/depression, substance and alcohol problems, lower educational and occupational levels, and having a first-degree relative with anxiety/depression, alcohol problems, ADHD, and BD. Limitations: The CT subscale alone might include overlapping features with cyclothymic, anxious, irritable, and depressed temperaments, thus increasing the prevalence estimate of CT. Conclusions: CT is a strong predictor of occupational failure and associated with more psychiatric impairment in the participants and their families. CT should be assessed in both mood disorder and ADHD patients.

Prospective relationships between mobile phone dependence and mental health status among Chinese undergraduate students with college adjustment as a mediator,"Background: This 3-year longitudinal study investigated the prospective relationships between mobile phone dependence and mental health status (i.e., subjective well-being, anxiety and depression) and the mediating role of college adjustment among Chinese undergraduate students. Methods: The study recruited 265 first-year undergraduate students from a university (mean age = 18.95 years, SD = 0.72) in Wenzhou, China. A baseline survey and two follow-up surveys were conducted between November 2013 and December 2015 (the response rate was 76.4%). The validated Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS), Chinese College Student Adjustment Scale (CCSAS), Index of Well-being, Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used for assessments. Results: The prevalence of anxiety and depression at Year 3 was 7.5% and 9.4%, respectively. Correlation analyses showed that mobile phone dependence at Year 1, college adjustment at Year 2, and mental health status at Year 3 were significantly correlated with each other. Structural equation modeling analyses showed that mobile phone dependence at Year 1 significantly predicted poor mental health status at Year 3. College adjustment at Year 2 significantly mediated the effect of mobile phone dependence at Year 1 on mental health status at Year 3. Conclusions: Interventions both on reduction of mobile phone dependency and improvement of college adjustment (especially among those with mobile phone dependence) are possible and needed among new college students to prevent their future depression and anxiety. Such interventions should be incorporated into regular education programs in universities.

"Clarifying stress-internalizing associations: Stress frequency and appraisals of severity and controllability are differentially related to depression-specific, anxiety-specific, and transdiagnostic internalizing factors","Background: Dependent (self-generated) stress is a strong risk factor for depression and anxiety, but perceptions of stress can alter its impact. Appraisals of dependent stress controllability and severity additionally relate to depression and anxiety over and above stress exposure. Due to the high comorbidity of depression and anxiety, it is unclear whether dependent stress frequency and appraisals relate specifically to depression or anxiety or are transdiagnostically associated shared aspects of internalizing disorders. Consistent with the tripartite model, the current study represented internalizing symptoms with three latent factors—depression-specific, anxiety-specific, and common internalizing—and tested how dependent stress frequency and appraisals of controllability and severity were associated with these factors. Methods: Bifactor modeling was used to create the latent internalizing factors in a treatment-seeking sample of emerging adults ( n = 356). Structural equation models tested dependent stress frequency and appraisals of controllability and severity as predictors of these latent factors. Results: Dependent stress frequency was associated with common internalizing while perceived controllability was associated uniquely with depression-specific variance. Continuous stress severity was not associated with latent factors, but high-severity stressors were associated with anxiety-specific variance. Limitations: Without longitudinal data conclusions regarding temporal directionality cannot be made. Participants’ appraisals of stressors could not be compared to expert ratings. Conclusions: Dependent stress frequency, controllability appraisals, and high-severity stressful events have distinct links with different dimensions of internalizing psychopathology. This suggests there may be several distinct mediating mechanisms between stress constructs and psychopathology, which have potential to serve as targets for intervention.

Sleep spindle density is associated with worry in children with generalized anxiety disorder and healthy controls,"Background: Childhood generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), characterized by uncontrollable worry, is associated with long-term psychopathology risk, yet understanding of developmental trajectories is limited. Despite common complaints about sleep, ‘macro’ sleep abnormalities have not been identified. Emerging findings suggest micro-architectural features of sleep, including sleep spindles, differentiate various psychiatric populations. The current study investigated sleep spindle density during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep among youth with GAD and healthy controls, including relationships with anxiety, worry, global functioning, and subjective sleep quality. Methods: 58 pre-pubertal children, n = 26 with GAD and n = 32 matched healthy controls, aged 7–11 years ( M = 8.86, SD = 1.47), completed diagnostic assessments and a week of actigraphy monitoring prior to a night of polysomnography (PSG) either at home or in a sleep laboratory. NREM spindle activity was detected in frontal and central regions. Results: Sleep spindle activity did not differ based on diagnostic group or sex. Sleep spindles were unassociated with anxiety and sleep quality but showed a significant positive association with worry in all youth. Among youth with GAD, global functioning was negatively associated with spindle density in frontal regions during NREM stage 3. Spindle density was significantly greater during in-lab compared to at-home PSG. Limitations: The small sample size and reliance on only one night of PSG necessitate additional studies. Conclusions: The identified link between spindle activity and worry in pre-pubertal children highlights a need for investigations on transdiagnostic features of child psychopathology rather than specific disorders. Longitudinal studies are needed to explore spindle characteristics and affective risk across development.

The longitudinal course of pregnancy-related anxiety in parous and nulliparous women and its association with symptoms of social and generalized anxiety,"Background: There is evidence that pregnancy-related anxiety (PrA) has a negative impact on birth outcomes and infant development. However, little is known about worrisome levels and individual trajectories of PrA dimensions across pregnancy and their predictive factors, particularly the association of PrA with symptoms of social phobia (SP) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Methods: A sample of 180 pregnant women was assessed three times during pregnancy with the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire-Revised 2 (PRAQ-R2). Linear mixed model analyses were used to investigate the course of different PrA dimensions across pregnancy, and to relate PrA to symptoms of social and generalized anxiety. Additionally, distinct developmental patterns of PrA were explored by latent class growth analyses. Results: While the PrA total score remained stable, the different dimensions of PrA varied significantly over time. After controlling for obstetric and sociodemographic factors as well as depression, perceived social support and self-efficacy, symptoms of SP significantly predicted higher levels of fear of childbirth, child-related worries and concerns about mother´s appearance. Symptoms of GAD predicted higher child-related worries. Moreover, two distinct groups of women with either consistently higher or lower PrA scores were identified. Limitations: Our results are limited due to the use of self-report questionnaires and would benefit from a larger sample size and replication in high-risk samples. Conclusion: Our study suggests that a longitudinal and differentiated investigation of specific forms of prenatal anxiety may improve our understanding of women at high risk for PrA and promote the development of individualized forms of interventions initiated during pregnancy.

"Peripheral adiponectin levels in anxiety, mood, trauma- and stressor-related disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Anxiety, mood, trauma- and stressor-related disorders confer increased risk for metabolic disease. Adiponectin, a cytokine released by adipose tissue is associated with these disorders and obesity via inflammatory processes. Available data describing associations with mental disorders remain limited and conflicted. Methods: A systematic search was conducted for English, peer-reviewed articles from inception until February 2019 that assessed for serum or plasma adiponectin levels in adults with an anxiety, mood or trauma-related disorder. Diagnoses were determined by psychiatric interview, based on DSM-IV, DSM-5 or ICD-10 criteria. Analyses were performed using STATA 15 and Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval was applied to pool the effect size of meta-analysis studies. Results: In total 65 eligible studies were included in the systematic review and 30 studies in this meta-analysis. 19,178 participants (11,262 females and 7916 males), comprising healthy adults and adults with anxiety, mood and trauma-related disorders, were included. Overall results indicated an inverse association between adiponectin levels and examined mental disorders. Specifically, patients with an anxiety disorder (SMD = −1.18 µg/mL, 95% CI, −2.34; −0.01, p = 0.047); trauma or stressor-related disorder (SMD = −0.34 µg/mL, 95% CI, −0.52; −0.17, p = 0.0000) or bipolar disorder (SMD = −0.638 µg/mL, 95% CI, −1.16, −0.12, p = 0.017) had significant lower adiponectin levels compared to healthy adults. Limitations: Heterogeneity, potential publication bias, and lack of control for important potential confounders were significant limitations. Conclusion: Peripheral adiponectin levels appear to be inversely associated with anxiety, mood, trauma- and stressor related disorders and may be a promising biomarker for diagnosis and disease monitoring.

Changes in the mental health status of adolescents following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident and related factors: Fukushima Health Management Survey,"Background: The present study examined the data from the Fukushima Health Management Survey conducted after the Great East Japan Earthquake to identify disaster-related factors affecting the mental health status of adolescents following the disaster and obtained basic data necessary in providing mental healthcare. Methods: The study included 2808 adolescents aged 15–19 years (male: 1327; female: 1481) who completed the 2011 edition of the registered questionnaire. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale scores, age, sex, health status, sleep satisfaction level, Great East Japan Earthquake experience, experience of losing a loved one, change in employment status, change in residence, and awareness of the impact of radiation on health were examined. Results: Psychological distress was significantly correlated with sex, health status, sleep satisfaction of, experience of losing a loved one, change in employment status, extreme anxiety regarding the acute health impact of radiation, and extreme anxiety regarding the impact of radiation on health in adolescents and the next generation. Limitations: The present study is limited because of its cross-sectional design, due to which, the causal relationship between each factor and psychological distress could not be clarified. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that appropriate mental healthcare should be administered immediately following an earthquake to adolescents who have lost a loved one and experienced anxiety regarding the health impact of radiation following a nuclear accident.

Verbal memory predicts treatment outcome in syndromal anxious depression: An iSPOT-D report,"Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and high levels of anxious symptoms are associated with impaired cognitive functioning. However, little is known of how cognitive functioning is impaired in people with anxious depression. Here, we compared cognitive functioning between people with anxious depression, non-anxious depression, and healthy controls. We also tested whether anxious depression moderated the relationship between cognitive functioning and treatment outcome. Methods: 1008 adults with MDD and 336 healthy controls completed IntegNeuro: a computerized cognitive functioning test battery. Participants were then randomised to one of three antidepressants and reassessed at 8 weeks using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD₁₇) and the 16-Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Rated for remission and response. Syndromal anxious depression was defined as MDD with a comorbid anxiety disorder. HRSD anxious depression was defined as MDD with a comorbid HRSD₁₇ anxiety/somatisation factor score ≥ 7. Results: Syndromal anxious depression was associated with better psychomotor functioning and poorer working memory, cognitive flexibility and information processing speed compared to their non-anxious counterparts. HRSD anxious depression was associated with better psychomotor functioning compared to their non-anxious counterparts. Syndromal anxious depression moderated the relationship between verbal memory and treatment outcome. In people with syndromal anxious depression, poorer baseline verbal memory predicted poorer treatment outcome. Limitations: As DSM-IV criteria was used, the DSM-5 anxious distress specifier characterisation of anxious depression could not be assessed Conclusions: Syndromal anxious depression is characterised by impaired executive functions and moderates the relationship between verbal memory functioning and treatment outcome.

Influence of comorbid anxiety symptoms on cognitive deficits in patients with major depressive disorder,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with comorbid anxiety symptoms showed obvious cognitive deficits. However, it remains unclear whether comorbid anxiety symptoms will make a specific contribution to cognitive deficits in MDD. Methods: Executive function, processing speed, attention and memory were assessed in 162 MDD patients, and 142 healthy controls (HCs) by a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) was used for anxiety symptoms and MDD patients with HAM-A total score &gt; 14 were classified into MDD with comorbid anxiety (MDDA) group. A multivariate analysis of covariance and regression models was conducted to evaluate the effects of anxiety symptoms on cognitive deficits. Results: There were no significantly differences in all 4 cognitive domains between MDD alone and MDDA patients (all p &lt; 0.05). In MDDA subgroup, HAM-A total score contributed to executive function and memory (both p &lt; 0.05), while HAM-A psychic symptoms contributed to all 4 domains (all p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, after controlling for the severity of depression, either anxiety symptoms shown as HAMA total score or psychic anxiety symptoms only contributed significantly to the executive function performance. Limitations: The cross-sectional design made it hard to acquire a cognitive performance trajectory accompanied by the fluctuations in anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that there is no significant difference in cognitive performance between MDD alone and MDDA patients. However, comorbid anxiety, especially psychic anxiety may contribute to extensive cognitive deficits in MDDA patients. Notably, anxiety symptoms only independently triggered executive dysfunction when eliminating effect of the severity of depression.

Comorbidity with more anxiety disorders associated with a poorer prognosis persisting at the 10-year follow-up among patients with major depressive disorder,"Objective: No study has investigated the association between number of anxiety disorders (NADs) and long-term outcome over 10 years among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study investigated this issue. Methods: At baseline, 290 outpatients with MDD were enrolled, 149 with at least one anxiety disorder (AD). Subjects were followed-up at six-month, two-year, and 10-year points. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR was used to confirm psychiatric diagnoses. NADs at baseline was recorded. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A), and the somatic subscale (SS) of the Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale were employed. Generalized Estimating Equation models were used for statistical analysis. Results: MDD patients with ADs had greater depression, anxiety, and somatic severities at the three follow-up points than those without. NADs was significantly and positively correlated with the three dimensions and total duration of pharmacotherapy at follow-up. NADs was independently associated with symptom severity after controlling for depression and anxiety at baseline and pharmacotherapy. When the DSM-5 criteria for ADs were applied, the results were unchanged. Specific phobia, panic disorder and social phobia, and panic disorder and specific phobia were independently associated with depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms, respectively. Limitation: Pharmacotherapy at follow-up was not controlled. The three follow-up intervals were unequal. Conclusions: Comorbidity with more ADs was associated with a poorer prognosis. The negative impacts of ADs on MDD persisted at the ten-year follow-up point. NADs was associated with the long-term prognosis of MDD.

Single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human &lt;i&gt;TIA1&lt;/i&gt; gene interacts with stressful life events to predict the development of pathological anxiety symptoms in a Swedish population,"Background: The TIA1 gene encodes a prion-related RNA-binding protein that regulates stress-dependent synaptic plasticity and fear memory in mice. It is unknown whether genetic variation in human TIA1 is associated with differences in stress- and fear-related behavior in people. Methods: A longitudinal, population-based survey was conducted in Sweden to collect information on demographics, socioeconomic status, exposure to stressful life events and psychiatric symptoms. DNA samples were obtained from study participants to allow genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human TIA1 locus. Results: We identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human TIA1 gene that interacts with exposure to previous-year stressful life events to predict the development of pathological anxiety symptoms in a non-clinical cohort. Limitations: Sample population is limited in both size and scope, and we did not perform functional analysis of allelic variants of TIA1. Conclusions: TI A1 may represent a susceptibility locus for stress-dependent psychopathology. These studies support an evolutionarily conserved role of TIA1 in the mammalian brain, and may provide molecular and genetic insight into the development of stress-related psychiatric conditions such as PTSD and anxiety.

Is prenatal maternal distress context-dependent? Comparing United States and the Netherlands,"Background: Maternal anxiety and depression symptoms during pregnancy can compromise a woman's well-being and affect offspring development. The present study represents a comparison of maternal late-pregnancy internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression and anxiety) between the United States of America (US) and the Netherlands. We hypothesized that women in the US would report higher levels of anxiety and depression during pregnancy compared to their Dutch counterparts, both on individual symptom indicators and overall latent distress, due to more favorable policies/accessible services relevant to perinatal health in the Netherlands. Methods: Pregnant women were recruited at two comparable sites in the Netherlands ( n = 327) and the US ( n = 228). Measures included self-reports of internalizing distress and key covariates (i.e., parity, gestational, and maternal age). Results: Expectant mothers in the US reported higher depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to their Dutch counterparts. Results were consistent across individual internalizing symptom indicators and the overall latent prenatal distress means computed for US and Dutch samples, with an estimated large effect size for the latter after controlling for covariates. Limitations: Despite their relatively large sizes, our samples were limited in their representativeness of the two cultures and mechanisms contributing to observed differences were not examined. Conclusions: Pregnant women in the US reported higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms than women in the Netherlands. Implications concern perinatal policy and clinical services (e.g., emotional health support provided to mothers).

"""Association between fecal microbiota and generalized anxiety disorder: Severity and early treatment response"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Association between fecal microbiota and generalized anxiety disorder: Severity and early treatment response"" by Yi-huan Chen, Jie Bai, Di Wu, Shou-fen Yu, Xiao-ling Qiang, Hua Bai, Hua-ning Wang and Zheng-wu Peng ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2019[Dec][1], Vol 259, 56-66). In the original article, there is a numerical error in Figure 1 (page 58). The “Finally included (HCs: n=36)” in the lower left corner should be corrected to “Finally included (HCs: n=24)”. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-62700-011). Background: Associations between abnormal gut microbiome compositions and anxiety-like behaviors are well established. However, it is unknown whether the gut microbiome composition is associated with the severity of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and relief from clinical symptoms in patients. Methods: Stool samples from 36 patients with active GAD (A-GAD group) and 24 matched healthy control subjects (HC group) were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Anxiety was assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and global assessments of functioning were performed at baseline and 1 month after drug treatment. Results: Gut microbiome compositions were altered in A-GAD patients, with fewer operational taxonomic units and lower fecal bacterial α-diversity. Specifically, Firmicutes and Tenericutes abundances were lower in A-GAD patients, and several genera were differentially represented in the A-GAD and HC groups. The abundances of Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes _group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, and Prevotella_9 correlated negatively with the anxiety severity and positively with anxiety reduction, whereas the abundances of Bacteroides and Escherichia-Shigella were positively associated with anxiety severity. Sex, smoking, and alcohol intake influenced the gut microbiome composition. Limitations: The sample sizes were small and the stool samples were collected only at baseline; therefore, a causal association between changes in intestinal flora and disease remission was not established. Moreover, the effects of different drugs on gut microbiome composition were not investigated. Conclusions: Altered gut microbiome composition may contribute to GAD pathogenesis and remission.

Association of thyroid dysfunction with suicide attempts in first-episode and drug naïve patients with major depressive disorder,"Backgrounds: Thyroid dysfunction was reported to be associated with depression; however, its role in suicide risk in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) remains unclear. The objective of this study was to compare thyroid function between suicide attempters and non-suicide attempters in a large sample of first episode drug naïve (FEDN) MDD patients, which received little systemic investigation. Methods: A total of 1718 outpatients with diagnosis of MDD at their first episode were recruited. Their socio-demographic, clinical data and thyroid function parameters were collected. The positive subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) were measured for psychotic, anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Results: Our results showed that compared with non-suicide attempters, suicide attempters had greater scores on HAMD, HAMA and PANSS psychotic symptoms and higher serum levels in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-thyroglobulin (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidases antibody (TPOAb) (all p &lt; 0.001). Further logistic regression analysis indicated that suicide attempts were associated with severe anxiety with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.704 and TPOAb with an adjusted OR of 2.188. Limitations: No causal relationship could be drawn due to the cross-sectional design. Conclusions: Our results indicate TSH, TgAb and TPOAb may be promising biomarkers of suicide risk in MDD, suggesting the importance of regular assessment of thyroid function parameters for suicide prevention, and possible treatment for impaired thyroid function for intervention of suicide in MDD patients.

"Depression, anxiety, and guilt in mothers with burnout of preschool and school-aged children: Insight from a cluster analysis","Introduction: The primary objective of this study is to identify the typology of exhausted mothers based on, depressive, anxiety, and guilt symptoms. And, secondarily, evaluate whether these profiles differ on parental stress, environmental stress, and parental burnout. Methods: Five hundred and fifty French-speaking mothers suffering from exhaustion completed several questionnaires assessing parental stress, general perceived stress, maternal guilt, and depressive and anxious symptomology. Results from two hundred and ten mothers with burnout symptoms were explored (mean age [SD] = 33.69 [5.1] years). In order to identify possible subgroups, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed. Results: Three profiles were highlighted from the sample (Wilks’ λ = 0.156, p &lt; .0001): the first was characterized by high feelings of guilt (29.52%; n = 62), the second showed a dominance of anxiety symptoms and high feelings of guilt (36.19%; n = 76), and the fourth presented low levels of depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt (23.3%, n = 49). Discussion: These findings suggest different profiles of burned out mothers that vary according to severity of anxiety, depression, and guilt. That suggests that parental burnout, depression and anxiety are distinct disorders. This study also makes it possible to show the aggravating effect of guilt in the experience of burnout. Additional research is warranted as it is important to more carefully consider possible appropriate intervention strategies given the differing experiences of burned out mothers.

Personality traits and the risk of incident (hypo)mania among subjects initially suffering from depressive and anxiety disorders in a 9-year cohort study,"Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by the alternating occurrence of (hypo)manic and depressive episodes. The aim of the current study was to determine whether personality traits independently predicted the subsequent development of (hypo)manic episodes within a group of patients who were initially diagnosed with depressive and anxiety disorders. Methods: The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety is a cohort study with measurements taken at baseline and at 2-, 4-, 6-, and 9-year follow-up. Development of a (hypo)manic episode during follow-up was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and (hypo)manic symptoms were evaluated with the Mood Disorder Questionnaire. The Big Five personality traits were the independent variables in multivariable Cox regression analyses. Results: There were 31 incident cases of (hypo)manic episodes ( n = 1888, mean age 42.5 years, 68.3% women), and 233 incident cases of (hypo)manic symptoms ( n = 1319, mean age 43.1, 71.9% women). In multivariable analyses, low agreeableness was independently associated with an increased risk of developing a (hypo)manic episode, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.54 ( p = 0.002, 95% CI [0.37, 0.78]). This finding was consistent with the development of (hypo)manic symptoms (HR 0.77, p = 0.001, 95% CI [0.66, 0.89]). Limitations: The 2-year lag-time analysis reduced the number of participants at risk of a (hypo)manic episode. Conclusions: We conclude that low agreeableness is a personality-related risk factor for incident (hypo)mania among subjects initially suffering from depressive and anxiety disorders. Increased attention to personality deviances could help to recognize BD at an early stage.

Updated statistic to the gut–brain paper examining the effect of multispecies probiotics on anxiety score in young adults: A response,"Reply by the N. Tran to the comments made by Panahi et al. (2019) on the author's original paper (see record 2019-35165-035) on the effect of multispecies probiotics on anxiety. Probiotics appeared to worsen anxiety score (e.g., panic anxiety) while decreased negative affect and possibly also decreased worry in participants. The finding seems to cast doubt on the potential of probiotics for anxiety treatment. However, while the results of the Wilcoxon's analyses pointed to a possible relationship between probiotics and negative affect (probiotics increase negative affect score), and to some extent panic anxiety, it is difficult to assert high confidence over the finding when the comparison between the ranks had a sample size in the single-digit. It is worth noting that while the result of the study is by no means conclusive due to its limitations and weaknesses, it does provide some preliminary insights into the use of probiotics in mental health, and directions for future investigation.

Transcranial direct current stimulation for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: A randomized clinical trial,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common condition with current treatments being only moderately effective. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques might provide a novel approach for treating GAD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown promising efficacy and tolerability for major depression but has not been investigated for GAD yet. Thus, we investigated the effects of tDCS on patients with GAD. Methods: We conducted a pilot, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial on 30 GAD patients. Five sessions of tDCS (2 mA, 20 min, anode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cathode over the right supraorbital cortex) were performed. Anxiety was the primary outcome and it was measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Secondary outcomes were accessed by the Lipp Inventory of Stress Symptoms for Adults, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Data were examined at baseline, after the 5th day of intervention, and at 1-week follow-up. Results: Thirty patients finished the study. There were no significant improvements in anxiety, mood symptoms of stress, affectivity or depression. Anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC showed significant improvements in physical symptoms of stress in GAD patients. Limitations: Additional tDCS sessions could have resulted in larger tDCS effects. Conclusion: Five sessions of anodal tDCS over the DLPFC did not improve the main outcomes for GAD patients, although physical symptoms of stress were improved. The role of tDCS in GAD should be explored in larger patient samples using different parameters.

"The relationship of recalled adverse parenting styles with maladaptive schemas, trait anger, and symptoms of depression and anxiety","Background: Young's contention that early maladaptive schemas mediate the relationship between adverse parenting and later emotional difficulties has been lrttle tested. Also, most relevant research focuses only on depression, and on maternal parenting. Methods: One hundred and fifty-five non-clinical adults completed the Young Parenting Inventory (YPI) regarding both their mothers and fathers, Young's Schema Questionnaire (YSQ), the State/Trait Anger Scale (STAS) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results: Young's suggested 17-factor YPI structure was not supported. Rather, participants differentiated between recalled paternal and maternal parenting, with rejecting and controlling components emerging for each parent. There was an indirect effect of rejecting fathering on symptoms of depression, via the social isolation schema, in support of Young's theory. However, despite some significant relationships between parenting and schemas, and schemas and emotions, most effects of parenting on emotions were direct. Rejecting fathering had a direct positive effect on trait anger, and controlling mothering on symptoms of depression and anxiety. Controlling fathering had a negative effect on anxiety symptoms. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional, limited to participants in a single city, and had a preponderance of female respondents. Conclusions: Most effects of adverse parenting seem to be direct rather than operating through schemas. Prevention through early parenting programs, and adult cognitive therapies that draw on a broad range of schemas, seem to be called for.

Association between fecal microbiota and generalized anxiety disorder: Severity and early treatment response,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 260 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2019-64167-062). In the original article, there is a numerical error in Figure 1 (page 58). The “Finally included (HCs: n=36)” in the lower left corner should be corrected to “Finally included (HCs: n=24)”.] Background: Associations between abnormal gut microbiome compositions and anxiety-like behaviors are well established. However, it is unknown whether the gut microbiome composition is associated with the severity of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and relief from clinical symptoms in patients. Methods: Stool samples from 36 patients with active GAD (A-GAD group) and 24 matched healthy control subjects (HC group) were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Anxiety was assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and global assessments of functioning were performed at baseline and 1 month after drug treatment. Results: Gut microbiome compositions were altered in A-GAD patients, with fewer operational taxonomic units and lower fecal bacterial α-diversity. Specifically, Firmicutes and Tenericutes abundances were lower in A-GAD patients, and several genera were differentially represented in the A-GAD and HC groups. The abundances of Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes _group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, and Prevotella_9 correlated negatively with the anxiety severity and positively with anxiety reduction, whereas the abundances of Bacteroides and Escherichia-Shigella were positively associated with anxiety severity. Sex, smoking, and alcohol intake influenced the gut microbiome composition. Limitations: The sample sizes were small and the stool samples were collected only at baseline; therefore, a causal association between changes in intestinal flora and disease remission was not established. Moreover, the effects of different drugs on gut microbiome composition were not investigated. Conclusions: Altered gut microbiome composition may contribute to GAD pathogenesis and remission.

Bipolar depression and suicidal ideation: Moderators and mediators of a complex relationship,"Introduction: Not all patients with bipolar depression have suicidal ideation (SI). This study examines some factors that link bipolar depression to SI. Methods: 482 individuals with bipolar I or II were randomized to either lithium or quetiapine plus adjunctive personalized therapy in a 24 week comparative effectiveness trial. Severity of depression and SI were assessed with the Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS). We examined potential moderators (age, gender, age of illness onset, bipolar type, comorbid anxiety, substance use, past suicide attempts, childhood abuse and treatment arm) and mediators (severity of anxiety, mania, irritability, impairment in functioning (LIFE-RIFT) and satisfaction and enjoyment of life (Q-LES-Q)) of the effect of depression on SI. Statistical analyses were conducted using generalized estimating equations with repeated measures. Results: Bipolar type and past suicide attempts moderated the effect of depression on SI. Life satisfaction mediated the effect of depression and SI. The relationship between anxiety, depression and SI was complex due to the high level of correlation. Treatment with lithium or quetiapine did not moderate the effect of depression on SI. Limitations: Suicide assessment was only done using an item on BISS. Patient population was not specifically chosen for high suicide risk. Discussion: Individuals with Bipolar II experienced more SI with lower levels of depression severity. A history of suicide predisposed patients to higher levels of SI given the same severity of depression. Reduced life satisfaction mediates the effect of depression on SI and may be a target for therapeutic interventions.

"Testing the vulnerability and scar model of the relationship between self-concept, social support and anxiety symptoms among children of HIV-infected parents in China: A 3-year longitudinal study","Background: Mental illness is a great concern among children of HIV-infected parents (COHIP), who are at their crucial stage of psychosocial development. It has been shown that self-concept (SC) and social support (SS) are important correlates of anxiety symptoms (AS), however, nature of the causality remained unclear. Methods: A 3-year longitudinal study was conducted in rural Central China, where many people were infected with HIV through unhygienic blood donation. A total of 195 COHIP (mean age: 12.6 years, 49.2% male) completed the baseline assessment and were followed for three years. Cross-lagged structural equation modeling analyses were used to test competing theoretical models: vulnerability model (low SC/SS contributes to AS), scar model (AS erodes SC/SS) and reciprocity model (low SC/SS and AS predict each other). Results: At each wave, 104 (53.3%) and 67 (41.6%) participants presented with anxiety disorders respectively. Nested-model comparison supported the superiority of scar models wherein AS significantly predicted subsequent low SC (β = -0.24, p = 0.013) and SS (β = -0.31, p = 0.033), controlling for synchronous and autoregressive effects of all measures. The most parsimonious multivariate model that included significant relations was finally identified with a good model fit. Limitations: Findings might be subject to reporting bias; and could not inform the temporal relationship between SC and SS. Conclusion: Prevalence of anxiety was high among Chinese COHIP. The present study provides empirical evidence for scarring effects of AS; thus, highlighted the importance of identifying and treating COHIP's anxiety to mitigate long-term negative impacts on their psychosocial development.

The paradox of relaxation training: Relaxation induced anxiety and mediation effects of negative contrast sensitivity in generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder,"Background: The Contrast Avoidance Model postulates that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) fear a sharp spike in negative emotion, and thus, prefer to worry to maintain their negative affect rather than being in a more euthymic state, such as relaxation. Relaxation induced anxiety (RIA) is a paradoxical phenomenon wherein people experience a spike in their anxiety during relaxation training. Because these phenomena may be related and may also operate among individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), we attempted to test whether negative contrast sensitivity was a mediator of GAD or MDD in the prediction of RIA. Methods: Individuals with GAD ( n = 32), MDD ( n = 34), and healthy controls ( n = 30) were exposed to a negative emotional contrast by engaging with relaxation practice and then watching a negative emotional video. This was followed by the assessment of their negative contrast sensitivity. After this, participants engaged again with relaxation and RIA was measured. We examined mediation effects of negative contrast on the relationship between diagnostic status and RIA. Results: Negative contrast sensitivity fully mediated GAD and partially mediated MDD in predicting RIA. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypotheses that negative contrast sensitivity is the mediator of both GAD and MDD in predicting RIA. This may have implications for assessment and treatment of GAD and MDD.

"The convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21)","Background: Previous validity studies of Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were limited by yielding poor factor loading values and eventually skipping the critical process addressing convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity. Without the crucial process, it was risky that past studies insisted DASS-21 be ready for use. Therefore, the current study examined DASS-21 regarding the three kinds of validity to determine if DASS-21 can be further used in the future. Methods: The current study formulated a CFA model (i.e., modified one-factor model) of DASS-21, which yielded factor loading values over β = 0.70 and estimated a latent variable of Psychological Distress by employing indicators of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress. The data collection was conducted at two universities in the U.S. and South Korea in November 2016 ( N = 255). The study participants completed an online survey developed with DASS-21. With the collected data, the present study investigated the convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity of the modified one-factor model of DASS-21 through CFA. Results: The model fit of the modified one-factor model was complete as saturated. The convergent validity coefficient of Psychological Distress was 0.87, and average variance extracted of the variable was 0.68. The three correlations among the measured variables (i.e., indicators) were 0.50 &lt; r &lt; 0.75. Limitations: Application of the current study's findings to youth or older adults can be limited as the subjects were young adults. Conclusions: The current study made substantial evidence regarding the convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity of DASS-21 through CFA.

Trait anger and anger attacks in relation to depressive and anxiety disorders,"Background: Patients with various psychiatric disorders may suffer from feelings of anger, sometimes leading to maladaptive (e.g., aggressive) behaviors. We examined to what extent depressive and anxiety disorders, relevant clinical correlates, and sociodemographics determined the level of trait anger and the prevalence of recent anger attacks. Methods: In the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), the Spielberger Trait Anger Subscale and the Anger Attacks Questionnaire were analyzed in patients with depressive ( n = 204), anxiety ( n = 288), comorbid ( n = 222), and remitted disorders ( n = 1,107), as well as in healthy controls ( n = 470) based on DSM-IV criteria. Results: On average, participants were 46.2 years old ( SD = 13.1) and 66.3% were female. Trait anger and anger attacks were most prevalent in the comorbid group ( M = 18.5, SD = 5.9, and prevalence 22.1%), followed by anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, remitted disorder, and controls ( M = 12.7; SD = 2.9, and prevalence 1.3%). Major depressive disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder were most strongly associated to trait anger and anger attacks. Limitations: Due to a cross-sectional design, it was not possible to provide evidence for temporal or causal relationships between anger and depressive and anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Trait anger and anger attacks are linked to depressive and anxiety disorders, although the strength of the relationship differed among both anger constructs.

Antidepressant use and its relationship with current symptoms in a population-based sample of older Australians,"Background: Australia has the second highest per capita users of antidepressants globally, and their use is pronounced in older Australians. A better understanding of antidepressant use in older adults is important because the elderly are often prescribed multiple drugs, without review, for long periods. Methods: This study analysed questionnaire data obtained from the Personality and Total Health through life project. Individual respondent data was linked to Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) records. Associations between self-reported medicine use and current symptoms with antidepressant dispensing were examined. Results: 1275 participants aged over 65 were included in the final analysis. One hundred and forty-six (11.5%) participants were dispensed an antidepressant within the specified timeframe. Of those, 38.4% self-reported that they use medicine for depression, 12.3% for anxiety, 17.8% for both depression and anxiety, 6.2% for sleep problems and 3.4% for pain. One fifth of those dispensed an antidepressant did not self-report use of the medicine. Being female or reporting symptoms of depression, anxiety or suicidality were significant predictors of being on an antidepressant. Increasing pain severity was also associated with increased likelihood of being on an antidepressant. Limitations: We have presented a cross-sectional analysis, which can only provide associations between current symptoms and medicine use. We have only assessed respondents who received their scripts with PBS concession, which limits generalizability. Conclusion: Our analysis highlights the high use of antidepressants in the elderly for various reasons. Our findings also uncovered a high amount of under-reporting of antidepressant use by respondents.

Classical psychedelics for the treatment of depression and anxiety: A systematic review,"Background: Depression and anxiety are prevalent psychiatric disorders that carry significant morbidity. Pharmacological and psychosocial interventions are used to manage these conditions, but their efficacy is limited. Recent interest into the use of psychedelic-assisted therapy using ayahuasca, psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may be a promising alternative for patients unresponsive to traditional treatments. This review aims to determine the efficacy and tolerability of psychedelics in the management of resistant depression. Methods: Clinical trials investigating psychedelics in patients with depression and/or anxiety were searched via MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsychINFO. Efficacy was assessed by measuring symptom improvement from baseline, and tolerability was evaluated by noting the incidence and type of adverse effects reported. Risk of bias was assessed. Results: Seven studies, with 130 patients, were analysed in this review. Three were conducted in patients with depression, two in patients with anxiety and two in patients with both. In a supportive setting, ayahuasca, psilocybin, and LSD consistently produced immediate and significant anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects that were endured for several months. Psychedelics were well-tolerated. The most common adverse effects were transient anxiety, short-lived headaches, nausea and mild increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Limitations: At present, the number of studies on this subject is very limited; and the number of participating patients within these is also limited as the treatment under investigations is a relatively novel concept. Conclusions: Though further evidence is required, psychedelics appear to be effective in significantly reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety and are well-tolerated.

Parental divorce is associated with an increased risk to develop mental disorders in women,"Background: Parental divorce has been associated with reduced well-being in young adults. It is, however, unclear whether this finding is clinically relevant as studies using structured clinical interviews are missing. This study, therefore, investigated if young adults with divorced parents are at risk to develop mental disorders. Furthermore, differences in parental care, social connectedness, chronic stress and traumatic experiences between children of divorced and non-divorced parents were investigated. Methods: 121 women (mean age: 23 years) were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I (i.e., major mental disorders) and II (i.e., personality disorders) Disorders and asked to complete questionnaires assessing parental care, social connectedness (loneliness, attachment anxiety and avoidance), chronic stress, childhood trauma and depression. Results: Young adults of divorced parents had a higher risk for Axis I but not Axis II disorders as compared to young adults of non-divorced parents. Participants from divorced families as compared to non-divorced families reported more depression, loneliness, childhood trauma, attachment avoidance, attachment anxiety, chronic stress and less paterntal care. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional design of this study, conclusions about causality remain speculative. Conclusion: The increased vulnerability of children of divorced parents to develop mental disorders, and to experience more chronic stress, loneliness, attachment avoidance, attachment anxiety, and traumatic experiences during childhood is alarming and highlights the importance of prevention programs and psycho-education during the process of parental divorce. Parental support with regard to adequate caregiving is needed to help parents to better support their children during and after their divorce.

When worry may be good for you: Worry severity and limbic-prefrontal functional connectivity in late-life generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Late-life generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders in older adults. However, its neural markers have received relatively little attention. In this study, we explored the association between worry severity and limbic-prefrontal connectivity during emotional reactivity in late-life GAD. Methods: We recruited 16 anxious (GAD) and 20 non-anxious (HC) older adults to perform the faces/shapes emotional reactivity task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We investigated the functional connectivity of both the amygdala and the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis. We tested for (1) group differences in connectivity, (2) association between worry severity and connectivity, and (3) interaction between group and worry severity and its association with connectivity. Results: Amygdala-PFC and BNST-PFC functional connectivity were associated with worry severity in an inverse U-shape, and was independent of depression severity, global anxiety, neuroticism, and general cognitive function. Limitations: Our limitations include slightly skewed PSWQ distributions, lack of non-anxious individuals with high worry, small sample size, and low depression comorbidity in a sample of late-life GAD that may not generalize to GAD in younger populations. Conclusions: This suggests that moderate worry is associated with maximum engagement of the limbic-PFC connectivity, while severe worry is associated with failure of the limbic-PFC emotional regulation circuit. This may explain the aberrant and exaggerated responses to negative stimuli observed in participants with pathological worry.

One-year trajectories of mental health and work outcomes post return to work in patients with common mental disorders,"Background: We investigated one-year trajectories of symptom recovery, work functioning and the return to work percentage (RTW%) among patients with common mental disorders (CMDs). Methods: Data were used from a cluster-randomised controlled trial evaluating a problem-solving intervention for CMD patients ( N = 158) who had returned to work. Information on anxiety and depressive symptoms, work functioning and RTW% was collected at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. Latent class growth analyses were used to identify trajectories for the four outcomes and investigate how these trajectories clustered in higher order latent classes. Additionally, we investigated the relation between patient characteristics and class membership. Results: We identified four trajectories for all four outcomes and derived three higher order latent classes: slow recovery (42% [66/158]) (high anxiety and depressive symptoms, moderate to low work functioning and fast RTW); fast recovery (25% [40/158]) (low anxiety and depressive symptoms, high work functioning and fast RTW); and gradual recovery (33% [52/158] (decreasing anxiety and depressive symptoms, increasing or low work functioning and fast RTW). Participants with a higher work engagement and readiness to stay at work were more likely to belong to the fast recovery class. Limitations: Due to the relatively small sample size, some trajectories consisted of few participants. Symptom severity was self-reported. Conclusions: Many CMD patients experience high levels of mental health symptoms and work functioning problems during the year post RTW. Creating realistic recovery expectations (for both patients and their environments) could be important for successful and sustainable recovery and work participation.

The effects of alpha asymmetry and high-beta down-training neurofeedback for patients with the major depressive disorder and anxiety symptoms,"Background: Alpha-asymmetry neurofeedback (ALAY) was applied to patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the theory of frontal alpha asymmetry. Neurophysiological studies have found a higher high-beta activity of electroencephalography (EEG) at the posterior cortex among patients with comorbid MDD and anxiety symptoms. The present study examined the effects of ALAY and high-beta down-training (Beta) neurofeedback in symptoms of depression and anxiety and EEG parameters. Method: Eighty-seven patients with comorbid MDD and anxiety symptoms were allocated to the ALAY, Beta, or control groups. Both neurofeedback groups received ten-session neurofeedback. All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and five minutes resting EEG recording at pre-test and post-test. EEG raw signals were transformed into an A1 score [log (F4 alpha) - log (F3 alpha)], P3 and P4 high-beta power. Results: BDI-II and BAI scores decreased at post-test in both ALAY and Beta groups, but no significant difference between the two groups. No significant interaction effect in A1 score at pre-test and post-test between the ALAY, Beta, and control groups. The P3 high-beta was significantly decreased in the Beta group, an increase in the control group, and no change in the ALAY group at post-test compared to the pre-test. Conclusions: Both neurofeedback groups decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety. The Beta group was more effective in decreasing high-beta power at the parietal cortex compared to other groups. This non-invasive psychological intervention can be used in the future for patients with comorbid MDD and anxiety symptoms.

Trajectories of maternal pre- and postnatal anxiety and depressive symptoms and infant fear: Moderation by infant sex,"Background: Prior work has examined the links between pre- and postnatal maternal distress and infant negative affectivity; however, there is little understanding about how the continuity of infant exposure to pre- and postnatal maternal distress relates to infant development. This study investigated the continuity of maternal pre- and postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms and their relations with infant fear among 391 mother-infant dyads. An additional aim was to consider infant sex as a moderating factor. Methods: Maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured during gestational weeks 14, 24 and 34 and 3 and 6 months postpartum. Subsequently, infant fear was measured using mother reports (IBQ-R) at 6 months and in a laboratory setting (Lab-TAB Masks episode) at 8 months. Using growth mixture modeling, a three-class model describing the course of maternal symptoms across pregnancy and the early postnatal period was identified, consisting of mothers with “Consistently Low Distress”, “Prenatal-Only Distress”, and “Consistently High Distress”. Results: Infant girls exposed to prenatal-only maternal distress were higher in observed fear than infant boys exposed to prenatal-only distress. Infant girls exposed to consistently high distress also showed lower observed fear than their counterparts exposed to prenatal-only maternal distress. Limitations: The main limitation of the study is the relatively small group size within the Consistently High subgroup. Conclusions: The findings suggest that girls might be particularly sensitive to maternal distress, and that prenatal-only and continuous distress exposure are differentially related to female infant fear.

How maternal pre- and postnatal symptoms of depression and anxiety affect early mother-infant interaction?,"Background: Maternal pre- and postnatal psychological distress, such as anxiety and depression, may negatively affect mother-infant interaction quality. However, more information is needed on the role of specific types and timings of pre- and postnatal distress symptoms on mother-infant interaction. Research on the role of maternal anxiety is especially scarce. Methods: We examined whether maternal pregnancy- related anxiety (gestational weeks 24 and 34), general anxiety or depressive symptoms (gw 14, 24 and 34 and at the infant age of 3 and 6 months) associate with the quality of mother-infant interaction when the child is eight months old. Maternal symptoms ( N = 190) were measured with EPDS, SCL-90 anxiety subscale and PRAQ-R2. Mother-infant interaction was measured with the Emotional Availability Scales (EAS). Results: After controlling for background factors, general anxiety at the 3rd pregnancy trimester was associated with higher maternal intrusiveness in EAS. Depressive symptoms at 6 months postpartum associated with lower maternal structuring behavior and with the child's lower involvement of the mother. Limitations: A very small number of mothers with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Prenatal anxiety and postnatal depressive symptoms may each have unique effects on the different areas of mother-infant interaction, suggesting the need to develop more targeted interventions for mothers with different symptom profiles and timings. Prenatally anxious mothers could potentially benefit from early interventions decreasing stress and anxiety symptoms and specifically promoting their ability to read infant cues appropriately. Infants of postnatally depressed mothers may need interventions where both members of the dyad receive help.

Pre- and post-natal maternal anxiety and early childhood weight gain,"Background: While maternal depression has been linked to impaired child growth, the relationship between anxiety and child weight gain is unknown. The study objective was to investigate maternal pre- and post-natal anxiety in relation to child weight gain. Methods: Data included 1168 children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Child height and weight were measured at the median ages of 25 and 31 months postnatally and used to calculate body mass index (BMI). Maternal anxiety was measured with the Crown-Crisp Experiential Index at 18 and 32 gestational weeks, and two and 21 months postpartum. Mothers scoring in the top 15% at one or more of the four time points were considered to have anxiety. Maternal depressive symptoms were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale-7 (EPDS-7) at these same time points. Maternal depression was defined as EPDS-7 scores of &gt; 10. We used Generalized Estimating Equations to assess whether child BMI trajectories varied by the presence of maternal anxiety. Parallel analyses were conducted for maternal depression. Results: Among children of mothers who had anxiety at least at one timepoint, the BMI changes associated with a three-month increase in child age increased by 0.06 (95% CI:0.004-0.12) compared to BMI changes in children of mothers without anxiety. Maternal depressive symptoms were not associated with child BMI trajectories. Limitations: Maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms were based on maternal self-report.

"Differential associations between chronotype, anxiety, and negative affect: A structural equation modeling approach","Background: Increasing evidence implicates circadian rhythms, including chronotype, in anxiety symptoms and disorders. However, it remains unclear whether this relation is accounted for by sleep disturbance. Likewise, given overlap between anxiety and negative affect, a unique link between chronotype and anxiety remains to be established. The present study addressed these questions using a multimethod approach to determine whether there is a unique relation between chronotype and anxiety symptoms, controlling for sleep disturbance. Methods: Indicators of chronotype, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and negative affect were collected in a sample of adults ( N = 151) using a combination of subjective and behavioral measures both within and outside the laboratory over a 9-day period. Structural equation modeling was used to examine associations between latent constructs. Results: Results revealed significant associations between sleep disturbance and both anxiety and negative affect. A significant association was found between chronotype and anxiety, over and above the effect of sleep disturbance. In contrast, the relation between chronotype and negative affect was nonsignificant after controlling for sleep disturbance. Limitations: Unselected sample, lack of experimental manipulation, cross-sectional design. Conclusions: These findings suggest a unique role of chronotype in anxiety and point to circadian disruption as a potential biological mechanism in anxiety-related disorders.

"The validity of daily patient-reported anxiety measured using smartphones and the association with stress, quality of life and functioning in patients with bipolar disorder","Background: More than half of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) experience anxiety, which is associated with impaired functioning. In patients with BD, the present study aimed (1) to validate daily patient-reported symptoms of anxiety measured using smartphones against clinically rated symptoms of anxiety, (2) to estimate the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, and (3) to investigate the associations between patient-reported anxiety symptoms and stress, quality of life and functioning. Methods: A total of 84 patients with BD evaluated their anxiety symptoms daily for nine months using a smartphone-based system. Data on clinically evaluated symptoms of anxiety and functioning and patient-reported stress and quality of life were collected from each patient at five fixed time points during follow-up. Results: The patients presented mild affective symptoms only. The reporting of anxiety symptoms was evaluated for validity according to clinically evaluated anxiety scores based on the two anxiety sub-items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The patients experienced symptoms of anxiety 19.3% of the time. There were statistically significant associations between anxiety and stress, quality of life and functioning (all p -values &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: In patients with BD in full or partial remission, the self-reporting of anxiety symptoms using smartphones was validated. Anxiety is associated with increased stress, decreased quality of life and functioning even during full or partial remission. Identifying anxiety symptoms thus has clinical impact, which suggests that smartphones may serve as a valid tool.

Relationships of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Limited published research has examined the relationships of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms in Chinese school adolescents. We aimed to explore the effect of coping styles and sleep quality on anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, we investigated the interactions of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms. Methods: The survey was conducted in Jiangxi Province, China. The Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Chinese Secondary School Students Anxiety Scale were utilized to assess sleep quality, coping styles and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the relationships of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms. Results: A total of 3081 students participated in this study, 50.8% of whom were boys; the number of participants in grades 1, 2 and 3 were 979, 1085 and 1017, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 27.3%. Individuals with poor sleep quality were 3.558 (95% CI = 2.716–4.660) times as likely to have anxiety symptoms than those with good sleep quality. Higher negative coping style scores increased the prevalence of anxiety symptoms (OR = 2.101, 95% CI = 1.894–2.332), whereas higher positive coping style scores were related to reduced odds of anxiety symptoms (OR = 0.892, 95% CI = 0.800–0.995). Interactions of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms were not found (all p &gt; 0.05). The association between negative coping style and anxiety symptoms was mediated by sleep quality. Limitations: This study was cross-sectional and limited to Ganzhou City. Conclusions: The results of our study showed a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms compared with the result of a previous study in Chinese school adolescents. Negative coping style and poor sleep quality were associated with an increased prevalence of anxiety symptoms, whereas positive coping style was related to a decreased prevalence of anxiety symptoms.

A population-based examination of suicidality in comorbid generalized anxiety disorder and chronic pain,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and chronic pain conditions commonly co-occur, and are both independently associated with suicidality; however, little is known about the impact of chronic pain on suicidality among individuals with GAD. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between comorbid GAD and chronic pain conditions with suicide ideation, plans, and attempts in a population-based sample. Methods: We analyzed data from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (CCHS-MH; N = 25,113). Multiple logistic regressions examined the associations between comorbid GAD and chronic pain conditions (i.e., arthritis, migraine, back pain; reference = GAD alone) with suicidality (i.e., ideation, plans, and attempts). Results: After adjusting for sociodemographics, other psychiatric conditions, and other chronic pain conditions, results indicated that compared to GAD alone, comorbid GAD and migraine was associated with increased odds of suicide ideation and plans (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) range: 2.55–3.00) and comorbid GAD and arthritis was associated with increased odds of suicide attempts (AOR = 4.10, 95% CI [1.05–16.01]). Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the survey design does not permit causal assumptions regarding the emergent associations and the self-report assessment of chronic pain conditions may be associated with response biases. Conclusions: Results highlight the burden of chronic pain on suicidality among individuals with GAD. These results emphasize the importance of assessing risk of suicidality among individuals with comorbid GAD and chronic pain conditions, particularly migraine and arthritis.

A longitudinal exploration of the impact of social anxiety and individual attachment on depression severity,"Background: Research suggests that insecure attachment and early onset of social anxiety disorder (SAD) create vulnerability for future depression. The current study explores the mediating role of social anxiety symptoms in the relationship between attachment and depression at baseline and one year later. The study also looks at the longitudinal impact of changes in attachment and social anxiety, on depression severity. Methods: Participants ( n = 162) completed structured clinical interviews and measures of depression, social anxiety, and adult attachment. A subsample of the participants ( n = 77) returned for a follow-up one year later and repeated the measures. Mediation analysis and multivariate linear regression were performed to examine the relationships between depression, social anxiety, and attachment. Results: Social anxiety was a full mediator of the relationship between attachment avoidance and depression severity at baseline but only a partial mediator at one-year follow-up. Social anxiety was a partial mediator of the relationship between attachment anxiety and depression severity at both baseline and follow-up. Lower baseline depression levels, improvement in social anxiety and improvement in attachment avoidance over the next year, predicted lower levels of depression at follow-up. Limitations: The study did not gather information regarding the treatments received between baseline and follow-up. Conclusions: Social anxiety plays a significant role in mediating the vulnerability towards severe depression in insecurely attached individuals. Treating social anxiety, particularly in individuals with avoidant attachment, might decrease the severity of future depression. In addition, interventions targeting attachment avoidance in youth might aid primary prevention strategies.

Prevalence and clinical profiles of comorbid anxiety in first episode and drug naïve patients with major depressive disorder,"Background: Anxiety is a common comorbidity in major depressive disorder (MDD) that has been studied extensively in the past. However, few studies have explored anxiety in drug naïve (FEDN) patients with MDD and those presenting with a first episode. The objective of this current study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD in order to understand the relationship between MDD and anxiety in the acute early phase and provide important implications for therapeutic interventions. Methods: A total of 1718 FEDN patients with MDD were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Their anthropometric and clinical data, including suicide attempt and psychotic symptom, were collected. The Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) and Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) were used to evaluate depression and anxiety for all the patients in this study. Results: Overall, we found that the prevalence of anxiety in FEDN MDD patients was 80.3%. Correlation analysis showed that anxiety was associated with suicide attempt and psychotic symptom in FEDN patients with MDD. The rate of suicide attempt and psychosis in above patients with anxiety was 24.3% and 12.3%, respectively. Furthermore, stepwise regression analysis showed that suicide attempt and psychotic symptom were significant predictors for anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD. Conclusions: Our study showed that the prevalence of comorbid anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD is very high. We also found that two clinical variables, suicide attempt and psychosis, are risk factors for comorbid anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD.

Anxiety disorders anticipate the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in comorbid patients: Findings from an Italian tertiary clinic,"Background: Studies indicate bipolar disorder (BD) syndromal symptoms are commonly preceded by sub-syndromal BD symptoms, dysregulated sleep, irritability, and anxiety. We aimed to evaluate prevalence and clinical correlates of anxiety disorders (ADs) at BD onset in outpatients with versus without at least one AD at BD onset. Methods: 246 bipolar spectrum outpatients, according to the text revision of the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- IV-TR), attending Sacco University Hospital in Milan, were recruited and their onset and clinical features assessed retrospectively. Patients were stratified into those with versus without an AD at BD onset (w/A and wo/A), according to a semi-structured clinical interview to provide diagnoses according to (DSM- IV-TR). Results: 29% of patients reported being w/A, among whom Panic Disorder (PD, in 55.6%) was the most frequent AD, and first AD occurred approximately 4 years before BD diagnosis. Patients w/A versus wo/A had higher ( p &lt; 0.05) rates of BDII and first mood episode being depression versus elevation (mania/hypomania), and lifetime rates of separation anxiety disorder, substance poly-abuse and benzodiazepine abuse. In contrast, patients wo/A had higher lifetime rates of alcohol and illicit drug use. Conclusion: In this naturalistic sample, ADs, in particular PD, preceded BD in almost 1/3 of BD outpatients, and had distinctive clinical correlates. Further investigation into relationships between BD and AD at onset may enhance early BD diagnosis and treatment.

State anxiety in pregnancies affected by obstetric complications: A systematic review,"Background: Maternal mental health status remains an important area of study due to its influence on maternal health outcomes. Past reviews on anxiety in pregnancy have included multiple mental health diagnoses and pre-existing conditions. A systematic review was performed to understand maternal state anxiety during pregnancies affected by obstetrical complications. Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases was performed including quantitative, primary studies in the English language. The population of interest was women whose pregnancies were affected by maternal and/or fetal obstetric (not pre-existing) complications with state anxiety as the outcome. Twenty-six studies met the inclusion and methodological criteria and were included in the review. Results: The review revealed that 20% to 100% of women experiencing pregnancies affected by obstetric complications had high levels of state anxiety, and these rates are negatively influenced by complication type and severity, demographic characteristics, and maternal perceptions and expectations. Overall, antenatal state anxiety was shown to improve over the course of the pregnancy, though levels remained above clinical thresholds. Limitations: This review was based only on English peer-reviewed articles, many of which used convenience sampling with homogenous samples, limiting generalizability. Additional limitations include how anxiety prevalence was aggregated due to differences in measurement across studies. Conclusions: Anxiety is prevalent among women experiencing pregnancies affected by obstetric complications. Based on this review, we recommend that all women treated for obstetric complications are screened for anxiety; facilitating detection, referral, and treatment, ultimately contributing to optimal maternal outcomes.

"A systematic review of prevention programs targeting depression, anxiety, and stress in university students","Background: Given the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among university students, it is important to assess the effectiveness of prevention programs for these problems. Beyond examining effect sizes, applying a common elements approach can enhance our understanding of which practice elements are most frequently included in symptom-reducing programs. Method: This review examined effective (i.e., outcome-producing) prevention programs targeting depression, anxiety, and/or stress in university students. Programs could be delivered in a group-based, online/computer-delivered, or self-administered format and at the universal, selective, or indicated prevention level. Results: The resulting sample of 62 articles covered 68 prevention programs for college, graduate, or professional students across 15 countries. Average effect sizes for programs were moderate (overall g = 0.65), regardless of delivery format or prevention level. The most common practice elements (overall and for programs producing large effects) were: psychoeducation (72%), relaxation (69%), and cognitive monitoring/restructuring (47%). Many programs were limited by: (a) symptom target-outcome mismatches, (b) disproportionately female samples, and (c) inconsistently reported adherence data. Limitations: Commonness of practice elements across outcome-producing interventions does not imply their extensiveness nor unique contribution to effectiveness. Coding was based on information in articles rather than manuals, and inter-rater reliability was moderate for some practice elements. Conclusion: The outcome-producing prevention programs in our sample had common practice elements and produced moderate reduction in symptoms overall. Future research of depression, anxiety, and stress prevention programs for university students can investigate practice elements’ unique and combined impact on outcomes, further explore under-tested practice elements, and use findings to inform intervention design.

Utility of the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research in assessing psychological disorders in fibromyalgia patients,"Presents a study which aims to investigate the prevalence of psychosomatic syndromes in fibromyalgia (FM) patients by comparing them with a group of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, a “non functional” medical condition also characterized by pain and the impact of the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) syndromes on the psychosocial functioning in FM patients. Ninety-eight women with FM and 98 women with RA, balanced for age and years of education were assessed with the DCPR, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for depression (HADSD) and anxiety (HADS-A) symptoms, and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) that evaluates both the physical and the mental components of health. All the patients were recruited at the University Hospital of Turin. The results indicated a statistically significantly higher prevalence of psychosomatic syndromes in FM patients compared to RA patients; in particular, regarding the somatization, functional somatic symptoms, conversion symptoms, anniversary reaction, the irritability, and the demoralization. Considered together, the data confirmed the clinical utility of the DCPR in detecting psychological disorders in FM patients. The results highlighted a very high prevalence of psychosomatic syndromes in FM patients, who displayed an average of more than 4 psychosomatic syndromes each, with every patient displaying at least one.

Adherence to the MIND diet and prevalence of psychological disorders in adults,"Background: There is no study that examined the association of the MIND diet and odds of psychological disorders. We investigated the association between adherence to the MIND diet and odds of psychological disorders. Methods: A total of 3176 adults were included in this cross-sectional study. Dietary intakes of study participants were collected using a validated dish-based 106-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (DS-FFQ). The MIND diet score was calculated based on participants’ dietary intakes obtained from DS-FFQ. To assess depression and anxiety, the Iranian validated version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used. Psychological distress was examined using General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Results: After taking potential confounders into account, participants in the highest quartile of the MIND diet score had a lower odds of depression (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.53–0.89) and psychological distress (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.52–0.89) than those in the lowest quartile. No significant association was observed between consumption of MIND diet and odds of anxiety (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.51–1.03). When we did gender-stratified analyses, no significant association was seen between adherence to the MIND diet and odds of psychological disorders in men; however, women in the top quartile of the MIND diet score had lower odds of depression (OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45–0.81) and psychological distress (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.48–0.90) than those in the bottom quartile. Conclusion: We found that greater adherence to the MIND diet was inversely associated with odds of depression and psychological distress. No significant association was observed between consumption of MIND diet and odds of anxiety.

The validity of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale-5 in home-dwelling old adults in Norway,"Background: Little is known about the validity of the Norwegian versions of the Geriatric Depression Scale-5 (GDS-5) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-D (HADS-D). The aim of this study was therefore to validate the two assessment tools in a population of home-dwelling persons of 60 years of age and above. Methods: A sample of 194 home-dwelling old adults with and without depressive symptoms were recruited. The participants were examined for depressive symptoms (GDS-5, HADS-D) and cognitive impairment. Sociodemographic information was collected. The participants underwent a blinded diagnostic evaluation for a depressive episode according to the diagnostic criteria of ICD-10. Results: In all, 56 (28.9%) participants fulfilled criteria for a depressive episode according to ICD-10. The Receiver Operating Characteristics analyses of HAD-D and GDS-5 using the diagnostic criteria of ICD-10 for depression as gold standard was performed. For GDS-5 the Area under the Curve was 0.81 and for HAD-D 0.75. The cut-off points of the measures that produced the highest accuracies were ≥ 2 for GDS-5 with a sensitivity of 73.2% and a specificity of 73.2% and ≥ 4 for HADS-D with a sensitivity of 70.3% and a specificity of 69.6%. Limitations: A larger sample would have given the opportunity for analyzing home dwelling old adults with and without home health care separately. The participants were talked through the self-filling questionnaires. The procedure could have influenced the participants’ answers. Conclusion: GDS-5 and HADS-D are useful screening tools for old adults, but only fairly good to identify depression according to criteria of ICD-10.

Internet-delivered treatment for young adults with anxiety and depression: Evaluation in routine clinical care and comparison with research trial outcomes,"Introduction: Mood and anxiety disorders typically emerge in adolescence and early adult life, but young adults are often reluctant to seek treatment. The Mood Mechanic course is a transdiagnostic internet-delivered psychological intervention for symptoms of depression and anxiety, targeted at people aged 18–24 years. The current study compared the efficacy of the course when delivered under strict research trial conditions (research trial; n = 192) with its effectiveness in a routine health-care setting (routine care; n = 222). Methods: Symptoms of depression, anxiety and general distress at baseline, during, and after treatment were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and Kessler 10-Item Scale (K-10), respectively. Results: Both groups showed significant symptom reductions on all measures at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Deterioration rates were low, within-group effect sizes were large (&gt; 1.0) and both groups reported high levels of treatment satisfaction. Patients in routine care were less likely to complete post-treatment or follow-up symptom questionnaires. Limitations: The study is based on self-reported data from treatment-seeking individuals that were motivated enough to start the course, and the absence of a control group and a formal diagnosis in the routine care sample means that some caution is needed in generalising the results. Conclusion: The results show that the Mood Mechanic course is effective and acceptable in routine clinical care, and that online psychological interventions designed for young adults are an effective treatment option for this hard-to-reach group.

Psychological distress among the unemployed: Do core self-evaluations and emotional intelligence help to minimize the psychological costs of unemployment?,"Background: Past research has shown that emotional intelligence (EI) and core self-evaluations (CSE) have a unique and independent role in the prediction of psychological maladjustment in the unemployed population. However, no one to date has examined the joint contribution of EI and CSE in predicting well-being and psychological distress among the unemployed. Our objective was to examine the main and interactive role of EI and CSE in the prediction of indicators for happiness, depression, stress, and anxiety beyond socio-demographics variables. Methods: A sample of 1796 unemployed participants completed a battery that included socio-demographic data and questionnaires of EI, CSE, happiness, depression, stress, and anxiety. We processed the data with SPSS and Hayes PROCESS macro. Results: Pearson correlation analyses showed significant associations between EI and CSE with different mental health outcomes. Moderation analyses revealed that, beyond the main effects, the interactive term EI × CSE increased the explained variance of the prediction of happiness, but not of depression, anxiety, or stress. Limitations: The study comprised an incidental non-clinical sample of unemployed adults, so the results might not generalize to a clinical population. Also, the study was cross-sectional, and we relied only on self-report measures, which do not allow for establishing causal links and might include biases, such as social desirability and common method variance. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for developing more comprehensive models including the interaction of EI and dispositional traits as contributing factors in the prediction of positive outcomes among the unemployed. Also, future promotion programs should include dimensions related to EI and CSE for increasing well-being during unemployment.

The mediating roles of caregiver social support and self-efficacy on caregiver burden in Parkinson's disease,"Background: Most studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) have focused on the direct effects of social support and self-efficacy on caregiver burden. This study aimed to test our prediction that caregiver self-efficacy and social support were two chaining mediator variables on the paths for patient factors affecting caregiver burden, caregiver anxiety, and depression. Method: We enrolled patients with PD and their caregivers from the First Affiliated Hospital of Shanxi Medical University in China between July and December 2017. Patients completed scales evaluating their cognition, motor function, and depression. Caregivers completed scales evaluating social support, self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, and caregiver burden. We applied Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the mediating effects. Results: Caregiver self-efficacy was a partial mediator on the path of patient motor function effects on caregiver burden (Variance Accounted For, VAF = 0.741), caregiver anxiety (VAF = 0.498) and caregiver depression (VAF = 0.471). Social support for caregivers was a partial mediator on the path for patient motor function effects on caregiver self-efficacy (VAF = 0.247). Caregiver social support and self-efficacy were two chaining mediator variables on the pathway for patient motor function effects on caregiver burden (VAF = 0.768) and caregiver depression (VAF = 0.510). Limitations: Our sample only met the minimum sample size requirement for the PLS-SEM and we only focused on a part of variables we collected. Conclusions: Our prediction has been validated in this study. And this work supports the decision-making of health authorities and policymakers in managing caregiver social support and caregiver self-efficacy with the aim of reducing caregiver burden in PD.

Impacts of socio-cultural environment and lifestyle factors on the psychological health of university students in Bangladesh: A longitudinal study,"Background: The psychological health of university students is an issue of utmost concern worldwide. Its consequences include multifaceted outcomes from complex interactions of sociocultural, environmental, and individual lifestyle factors. This research explores the impacts of socio-cultural environment and lifestyle factors on the psychological health of university students in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A 15-month follow-up was carried out among 1140 university students from April 2016 to November 2017. Data were collected by using a pre-developed questionnaire, consisting of socio-demographic information, comprehensive lifestyle information, and psychological health information including a nine-item scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for assessing the level of depression, and a 7-item scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for assessing the level of anxiety. The collected data were analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 22. Results: With time, there was a 22.5% increase in the prevalence of provisional depression and a 27.1% increase in the prevalence of anxiety. In terms of demographic factors, findings revealed that students dissatisfied with university culture were significantly more likely to experience depression ( B = 5.13, p &lt; 0.01, β = 0.33) and anxiety ( B = 4.69, p &lt; 0.01, β = 0.34). ‘Being female’, ‘being students of social sciences faculty’, ‘dissatisfaction with current education, financial condition and future career’ were found to be significant predictors of students’ psychological disorders. In terms of lifestyle factors, participants with high and excessive recreational screen time were significantly more vulnerable to depression ( B = 1.25, p &lt; 0.01, β = 0.097 and B = 1.75, p &lt; 0.01, β = 0.12) and anxiety ( B = 0.86, p = 0.02, β = 0.08 and B = 1.22, p &lt; 0.01, β = 0.096). Additionally, ‘weekly physical inactivity’, ‘dissatisfaction with daily sleep’, ‘short and long sleep duration’, ‘low and high daily meal intake frequency’ and ‘alcohol consumption’ were inextricably linked with students’ depression and anxiety. Conclusion: The prevalence of provisional as well as major depressive and anxiety disorders among university students in Bangladesh is significantly high and augmented in nature. This study provides significant information about the adverse impacts of university socio-cultural environment and students’ lifestyle factors on their psychological health conditions.

Relationship between trait neuroticism and suicidal ideation among postpartum women in China: Testing a mediation model,"Background: Suicidal ideation is a common phenomenon among postpartum women around the world. However, evidence of the relationship between neuroticism and suicidal ideation among postpartum women is still lacking. Methods: From March 2017 to December 2018, a total of 1027 postpartum women (assessed no later than one month post-birth) were recruited to complete questionnaires assessing neuroticism, depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. Results: Anxiety and depression fully mediated the association between neuroticism and suicidal ideation (Total indirect effects = 0.11, 95%CI: 0.07, 0.15). The indirect effect of the pathway of EPQ (Neuroticism)-Anxiety-Suicidal ideation was more significant than other pathways (Indirect effects = 0.04, 95%CI: 0.02, 0.07). Conclusion: Interventions for suicidal ideation in postpartum women need to target neuroticism and further research is necessary understand the mechanisms by which neuroticism affects suicidal ideation.

Motivational interviewing prior to cognitive behavioural treatment for social anxiety disorder: A randomised controlled trial,"Background: We examined whether providing three sessions of treatment based on motivational interviewing (MI) prior to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) improved outcomes. Methods: Participants diagnosed with SAD ( N = 186) were randomly allocated to receive three sessions of MI (MI + CBT; n = 85) or supportive counselling (SC + CBT; n = 101) prior to a 12-week group CBT program. Assessments occurred at baseline, after preparatory treatment, after CBT, and at 6-months follow-up. Outcomes were expectations for change, number of CBT sessions attended, self- and clinician-rated CBT homework completion, and self- and clinician-rated social anxiety severity. Results: Conditions did not differ significantly on expectations for change, number of CBT sessions attended, or clinician-rated homework completion. Self-rated homework completion was greater in MI + CBT than in SC + CBT. Change over time in social anxiety severity did not differ between conditions overall, however, this outcome was significantly moderated by two variables; those in MI + CBT, as compared to SC + CBT, showed significantly poorer outcomes on self-reported social anxiety severity if they were higher in change readiness and significantly better outcomes on clinician-rated social anxiety severity if they were higher in functional impairment. Limitations: Although therapists in MI sessions were rated as behaving more consistently with MI than therapists in SC sessions, some MI consistent behaviors occurred in the SC sessions. Conclusions: Addition of a MI-based discussion prior to evidence-based CBT appears to benefit people with SAD who have high functional impairment but may interfere with outcomes for those higher in readiness for change.

Anxiety symptoms are associated with smaller insular and orbitofrontal cortex volumes in late-life depression,"Background: Increasing understanding of the neural correlates of anxiety symptoms in late-life depression (LLD) could inform the development of more targeted and effective treatments. Methods: Grey matter volume (GMV) was assessed with volumetric magnetic resonance imaging in a sample of 113 adults ≥ 60 years with MDD using the following regions of interest: amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and temporal cortex. Results: After controlling for demographic (age, sex, education) and clinical variables (antidepressant use, anxiolytic use, duration of illness, medical comorbidity, cognitive functioning), greater severity of anxiety symptoms was associated with lower GMV bilaterally in the insula, F (1,102) = 6.63, p = 0.01, and OFC, F (1,102) = 8.35, p = 0.005. By contrast, depressive symptom severity was significantly associated with lower bilateral insula volumes, F (1,102) = 6.43, p = 0.01, but not OFC volumes, F (1,102) = 5.37, p = 0.02. Limitations: Limitations include (1) the relatively mild nature of anxiety symptoms in our sample; (2) the cross-sectional research design, which prohibits inferences of directionality; (3) the relatively homogenous demographic of the sample, and (4) the exclusion of participants with significant psychiatric comorbidity, suicidality, or cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Decreased OFC volumes may serve as a unique biomarker of anxiety symptoms in LLD. Future longitudinal and clinical studies with long-term follow up and more diverse samples will help further elucidate the biological, psychological, and social factors affecting associations between anxiety and brain morphology in LLD.

Cyberbullying and depression among Chinese college students: A moderated mediation model of social anxiety and neuroticism,"Background: Cyberbullying is a serious social issue that can cause a number of psychological and behavioral problems for perpetrators and victims. Previous studies have shown that adolescent victims of cyberbullying are more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the perpetration of cyberbullying and depression, or the mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying this relationship. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted among 476 college students to investigate the relationships between cyberbullying perpetration and depression, the mediating role of social anxiety, and the moderating role of neuroticism. Results: The results showed that cyberbullying perpetration had a significant and positive predictive effect on depression. Social anxiety partially mediated this relationship. The direct predictive effect of cyberbullying perpetration on depression, and the relation between social anxiety and depression, were both moderated by neuroticism. Cyberbullying perpetration had a greater impact on depression for college students with lower levels of neuroticism and the predictive function of social anxiety on depression was stronger for individuals with low levels of neuroticism too. But neuroticism did not moderate the association between cyberbullying perpetration and social anxiety. Limitations: This study focused only on the individual variables influencing the relationship between cyberbullying perpetration and depression, and did not examine interpersonal or environmental variables. Also, the cross-sectional research design means that causality cannot be deduced from the results. Conclusions: Cyberbullying perpetration can predict depression directly, and also indirectly via the mediating role of social anxiety. Neuroticism moderates the relation both between cyberbullying and depression, and between social anxiety and depression. These findings provide new perspectives for the treatment and prevention of depression among college students.

The effect of short-term use of benzodiazepines on cognitive function of major depressive disorder patients being treated with antidepressants,"Background: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of short-term use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) on cognitive function of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients being treated with antidepressants (ADs). Methods: This was a part of a multi-center, multi-stage and prospective study of “Objective Diagnostic Indicators and Individualized Drug Intervention of Major Depressive Disorder (OIMDD)”. Three hundred and fifty-three patients treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) alone (Group 1) and 49 patients treated with SSRIs combined with short-term use of BZDs (Group 2) during the acute treatment period were included in the analysis. Cognitive function and depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed at baseline, weekend 8 and 48. A cognitive test battery included 5 domains: information processing speed assessed by the Animal Verbal Fluency Scale (AVFS), Digit Symbol Coding Test (DSCT) and Color Trial Test (CTT), verbal learning assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), visual learning assessed by the Brief Visual Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R), executive function assessed by the Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT), and attention or vigilance assessed by the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Results: Significant differences were found in education level ( χ ² = 5.442, p = 0.020), the severity of depressive ( t = −1.982, p = 0.048) and anxiety symptoms ( t = −2.629, p = 0.009) between Group 1 and 2 at baseline. There were no significant differences between G1 and G2 in cognitive functions at baseline. After Multiple correction, DSCT was better in patients treated with BZDs combined with ADs than in patients with ADs alone at weekend 8 without controlling education level, depressive and anxiety symptoms at baseline ( F = −2.747, p = 0.042). After controlling these factors at baseline, the DSCT was still slightly high in patients treated with ADs combined with BZDs than in patients with ADs alone at weekend 8 (OR = 1.052, 95%CI:1.000–1.105). The repeated measurement analysis of variance showed that the DSCT could be improved by the treatment of BZDs combined with ADs at 1-year follow-up compared to baseline ( F = 7.569, p = 0.006). Conclusions: The findings suggest that short-term use of BZDs does not impair cognitive function of MDD patients; conversely, it could improve the information processing speed after acute treatment and at 1 year follow up.

Examining an internet-delivered intervention for anxiety and depression when delivered as a part of routine care for university students: A phase IV trial,"Background: There has been growing interest in the potential of emerging internet-delivered psychological treatments for supporting the mental health needs of university students. However, no large-scale prospective effectiveness trials examining their real-world potential have been reported. Objective: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a brief, 5-week, internet-delivered and therapist-guided intervention for anxiety and depression, when delivered as part of routine care by a university counselling service. Design: A large, prospective, single-group Phase-IV clinical trial. Students ( n = 1326) engaging with the university counselling service were provided the opportunity to receive the intervention based on their preferences and identified needs. Students completed standardised measures of anxiety and depression at pre-treatment, each week of the intervention, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Results: Over a 4 year period, 1081 students (10% of those presenting to the counselling service) participated in the intervention. Large clinical reductions in symptoms of both anxiety (% reduction = 41%; Cohen's d = 0.94) and depression (% reduction = 36%; Cohen's d = 0.81) were observed alongside high levels of acceptability. The intervention required relatively little counsellor time ( M = 36.28 mins; SD = 20.56) per student, and symptom deterioration was observed in less than 5% of students. Conclusion: The findings of the current study are supportive of internet-delivered interventions provided as routine care to university students. Further research is needed to carefully explore whether these interventions could be used with a larger proportion of students presenting to counselling services, paying close attention to acceptability, engagement and clinical outcomes.

"The role of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and school functioning in the association between peer victimization and internet addiction: A moderated mediation model","Background: Both peer victimization and internet addiction are common public health problems for children and adolescents. Several studies found an association between peer victimization and internet addiction, but the mechanism underlying this association remained unclear. This study aimed to determine the mechanisms underlying this association. Methods: Data was extracted from an epidemiologic study involving middle and high school adolescents, in which 15,415 individuals (14.6 ± 1.7 years) were recruited. The moderated mediation models were examined using SPSS PROCESS macro 2.16 software, in which the mediation variables were depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, and the moderation variable was school functioning. Results: The total indirect effect of verbal victimization on internet addiction through depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms was found to be 0.4531, which accounted for 63.7% of the total effect of verbal victimization on internet addiction. Depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms totally mediated the association between relational victimization and internet addiction and the association between the physical victimization and internet addiction. There were gender differences in the mediating effects of depressive and anxiety symptoms on the association between peer victimization and internet addiction. The indirect effect of the three different types of peer victimization (physical, verbal, relational) on internet addiction became stronger as school functioning increased. Limitations: We included two mediators in one model, and the data used in this study was self-reported and cross-sectional. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms mediate the association between peer victimization and internet addiction. Students who score higher in school functioning were more likely to develop internet addiction when they encounter peer victimization.

"Social anxiety, posterior insula activation, and autonomic response during self-initiated action in a Cyberball game","Background: An earlier study characterized the neural correlates of self-initiated actions in a Cyberball game in healthy individuals. It remains unclear how social anxiety may influence these neural processes. Methods: We examined regional activations to self-initiated actions in 25 adults with low and 25 with high social anxiety (LA and HA, respectively). Skin conductance was recorded concurrently with fMRI. We followed published routines in the analyses of imaging and skin conductance data. Results: We hypothesized that HA as compared to LA individuals would demonstrate increased cortical limbic activations during self-initiated actions (tossing or T &gt; receiving or R trials, to control for motor activities) in social exclusion (EX) vs. fair game (FG) scenario. At a corrected threshold, HA as compared with LA group showed increases in bilateral posterior insula activation during T vs. R trials in EX as compared to FG. Further, HA as compared to LA showed higher skin conductance response to tossing trials during EX as compared to FG. Limitations: With a limited sample size, we did not examine potential sex effects. Further, we cannot rule out the effects of depression on the findings. Conclusions: Together, the results suggest that individuals with more severe social anxiety engaged the somatosensory insula to a greater extent and exhibited higher physiological arousal when initiating ball toss during social exclusion in the Cyberball game. Posterior insula response to self-initiated action may represent a biomarker of social anxiety. It remains to be investigated whether interventions to decrease physiological arousal may alleviate social anxiety.

"Prevalence, onset and course of anxiety disorders during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta analysis","Background: Anxiety disorders during pregnancy are associated with various adverse outcomes. Previous reviews of anxiety disorders during pregnancy have methodological limitations and were conducted without a meta-analysis. The present study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published research on the prevalence, onset and course of all anxiety disorders during pregnancy plus obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed on a wide range of databases. A random effects model was used for the meta-analysis. Results: Thirty-six studies were included. Prevalence rates of anxiety disorders during pregnancy varied considerably. The pooled prevalence rate of each disorder during pregnancy was 3%, except for specific phobia, where it was 6%. Between 13% and 39% of pregnant OCD women had the onset of OCD during pregnancy, and this occurred mainly in the 2nd trimester. The onset of panic disorder (PD) was more common in the 1st and 2nd trimesters of pregnancy. Limitations: Different designs of the included studies, as well as different assessment tools and assessment times during pregnancy and the paucity of studies of the onset and course, preclude definitive conclusions. Conclusions: Anxiety disorders are common during pregnancy. Unlike prevalence rates of other anxiety disorders during pregnancy, prevalence rates of PD and OCD during pregnancy were higher than their lifetime prevalence rates in women in the general population. The onset of OCD during pregnancy is not rare and the course of PD and OCD during pregnancy is highly variable. These findings suggest that pregnancy may be a specific risk factor for the occurrence and/or exacerbation of PD and OCD and underscore the importance of their early diagnosis and management.

"Excessive daytime sleepiness in medical students of Hunan province: Prevalence, correlates, and its relationship with suicidal behaviors","Background: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is common among medical students, but may have some serious consequences. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of EDS among the medical students of Hunan Province, China. The correlation between EDS and suicidal ideation in our participants was also explored. Methods: A cross-sectional study was employed among 4882 students from three medical schools in Hunan Province. Each student completed a survey on demographic variables, daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale), anxiety (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale), depression (Self-Rating Depression Scale), and suicidal behaviors. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the risk factors for EDS among all participants and suicidal behaviors among those with EDS. Results: Overall, the prevalence of EDS in this population was 24.6%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that being female, alcohol consumption, a history of physical disorder, body mass index, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation were independent correlates for EDS. Moreover, the prevalence of suicidal ideation among EDS participants was 38.6%, variables such as physical disorder history, age, anxiety, or depression were independently associated with suicidal ideation. Limitations: No causal relationships could be established as this was a cross-sectional study. Recall biases might exist due to the utilization of self-reported measurements. Moreover, participants were primarily female medical students (89%,4345/4882). Conclusion: EDS is very common among medical students. Special attention should be paid to students with EDS, especially when risks for suicidal ideation are particularly high among this population. These data are valuable for healthcare professionals in assessing the risks of suicide among participants with EDS.

Associations between grip strength and generalized anxiety disorder in older adults: Results from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing,"Background: Associations between grip strength and mental health disorders have been established; however, associations between grip strength and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) remain unstudied. Therefore, this study investigates associations between grip strength and prevalent and incident GAD. Methods: A prospective cohort design was utilized. At baseline, participants aged ≥ 50 years ( N = 3,952) completed a hand grip strength assessment and abbreviated Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and were divided into sex-specific tertiles based on strength. A score of ≥ 23 on the PSWQ defined caseness of GAD. At two-year follow-up, GAD was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview—Short Form. Results: Prevalence and incidence of GAD were 18.2% ( N = 718) and 0.9% ( N = 29), respectively. Adjusting for age, sex, waist circumference, social class, smoking status, and physical activity, a one-standard-deviation (1-SD) increase in strength was associated (OR, 95%CI) with 12.1% (OR = 0.88, 0.80–0.96; p &lt; 0.01) lower odds of prevalent GAD, and middle and high strength tertiles were associated with 27.3% (OR = 0.73, 0.59–0.89; p &lt; 0.01) and 23.1% (OR = 0.77, 0.62–0.95; p &lt; 0.05) lower odds, respectively. A 1-SD increase in strength was non-significantly associated with 24.2% (OR = 0.76, 0.50–1.14) lower odds of incident GAD, and middle and high strength tertiles were non-significantly associated with 31.4% (OR = 0.69, 0.30–1.58) and 66.5% (OR = 0.34, 0.11–1.00) lower odds, respectively (all p &gt; 0.05). There was no significant interaction between strength tertiles and sex. Limitations: The observational nature of the study limits inferring causality. Conclusions: Increased hand grip strength may be associated with lower odds of developing GAD in older adults. Larger investigations of prospective associations are needed.

Feeling better at work! Mental health self-management strategies for workers with depressive and anxiety symptoms,"Background: The aim of this study was to identify self-management strategies that can be used in a workplace setting by workers living with depression and anxiety. Methods: A two-round Delphi study was conducted among three panels of experts: (1) employees living with anxiety or depression ( n = 31); (2) managers of employees living with anxiety or depression ( n = 12); and (3) researchers with expertise in workplace mental health ( n = 15). Participants had to indicate whether each of 60 self-management strategies was applicable at work, and how useful each was for managing their symptoms while working. They could also reformulate or add strategies that were then evaluated in the second round. Results: A total of 60 existing and new self-management strategies were retained following the two rounds. Most useful strategies refer to the ability to set boundaries, maintain work-life balance, identify sources of stress and create positive relationships with supervisor and colleagues. Panels differed in their assessment of the usefulness of strategies focusing on employees’ empowerment. Limitations: Most participants were from Canada, limiting the generalizability of the results. Conclusion: The self-management strategies identified in this study should be included in programs focusing on mental health at work and disseminated to employees living with depression and anxiety. Managers should take employee's perspective into account when searching for solutions to help them. Future research should use an inductive approach to identify strategies that are specifically related to the workplace setting. Quantitative studies are also needed to evaluate the effect of such strategies on work functioning.

Effects of statins on anxiety and depression in patients with asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome,"Background: The effects of statins on anxiety and depression in patients with asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS) have not been reported. This population-based study investigated these effects. Methods: Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2010. We enrolled two ACOS cohorts, one of statin users ( n = 1252) and one of nonstatin users matched by age, sex, and index date ( n = 7887). The cumulative incidence of anxiety and depression was analyzed using time-dependent Cox proportional regression analysis. Results: After adjustment for multiple confounding factors, including age, sex, comorbidities, and medications—statins, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), and oral steroids (OSs)—the ACOS cohort with statin use had significantly lower risks of anxiety and depression (anxiety: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.28–0.42; depression: aHR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.25–0.53). The aHRs (95% CIs) for statin use with ICSs or OSs were 0.32 (0.13–0.78) and 0.37 (0.24–0.57), respectively. Conclusion: The ACOS cohort with statin use had lower risks of anxiety and depression, regardless of age, sex, commodities, or ICSs and OSs. The incidences of anxiety and depression were relatively low among users of statins with ICSs or OSs in the ACOS cohort.

"Corrigendum to: ""Prenatal maternal anxiety and children's brain structure and function: A systematic review of neuroimaging studies""","Reports an error in ""Prenatal maternal anxiety and children's brain structure and function: A systematic review of neuroimaging studies"" by Brianna Adamson, Nicole Letourneau and Catherine Lebel ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2018[Dec][1], Vol 241, 117-126). The authors regret not fully describing Mennes et al. (2009)’s use of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory as a key prenatal predictor and how it was employed differently as a potential confounder. This has been corrected in three places, as given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-46262-018). Background: Maternal anxiety disorders are common during pregnancy and postpartum, and are associated with increased behaviour problems and risk of mental health difficulties in children. Understanding alterations in brain structure and function associated with maternal anxiety may help elucidate potential mechanisms via which high maternal anxiety could affect children. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of extant research studying the associations between prenatal anxiety and children's brain structure and function, as assessed through neuroimaging. Data were gathered in accordance with the PRISMA review guidelines. Results: Ten articles were identified, and all found a significant association between antenatal maternal anxiety and child neurodevelopment. Studies vary considerably in their methods with five studies employing electroencephalography (EEG), one using magnetoencephalography (MEG), and the rest employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Limitations: The heterogeneity of neuroimaging techniques undertaken by the reviewed studies precluded a meta-analysis from being performed. The applicability of this systematic review to clinical practice is also limited given that the studies examined children across a wide age range (neonates to 17 years). Conclusions: From early infancy to late adolescence, findings suggest alterations of brain structure and function in frontal, temporal, and limbic areas in children born to mothers who experienced prenatal anxiety. These brain abnormalities may underlie associations between prenatal anxiety and children's behaviour, though more research incorporating neuroimaging and behavioural data is necessary to determine this.

Clinical effectiveness and cost minimisation model of Alpha-Stim cranial electrotherapy stimulation in treatment seeking patients with moderate to severe generalised anxiety disorder,"Background: Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is a well-tolerated neuromodulation treatment with demonstrated trial efficacy in anxiety disorders. The aim of the current study was to demonstrate its clinical and cost effectiveness during and after CES in people with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) who had not responded to low intensity psychological treatment in a routine health service. Methods: Consecutive sample of eligible patients with GAD waiting for individual cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) selected from two publicly funded services in England. They received 60 min per day Alpha-Stim CES for 6–12 weeks. Primary outcome was remission on the GAD-7 scale at 12 and 24 weeks. Cost effectiveness was examined using a cost minimisation model of direct health costs. Results: Of 161 patients recruited, 72 (44.7%) and 77 (47.8%) achieved remission on the GAD-7 at 12 and 24 weeks respectively with 122 (75.8%) receiving at least 6 weeks CES. Mean (sd) GAD-7 score at baseline significantly improved from 15.77 (3.21) to 8.92 (5.42) and 8.99 (6.18) at 12 and 24 weeks respectively ( p &lt; 0.001). 80 (49.7%) participants required further individual CBT. CES provided a saving of £540.88 per patient (95% CI −£327.12, £648.69). Limitations: Participants were not randomised and there was no control group. Only 48 (29.9%) participants completed every assessment. Conclusion: In patients with generalised anxiety disorder not responding to low intensity psychological treatment, 6–12 weeks daily Alpha Stim CES may be effective after treatment and 3 months later, thereby reducing the need for individual CBT and saving health costs.

"Body image and its relationships with sexual functioning, anxiety, and depression in women with polycystic ovary syndrome","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with lower levels of satisfaction with body image, which can affect sexuality and social well-being. Thus, we evaluated body image in women with PCOS and its association with body dis(satisfaction), anthropometric indices, sexual function, anxiety, and depression. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 94 women of reproductive age were grouped by body mass index (BMI) and sexual function. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), Figure Rating Scale (FRS), hospital anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) measurement scales, and anthropometric indices were used for data collection. Results: Women with PCOS presented with perceptual distortions of self-image independent of sexual function and BMI. There were negative correlations between HADS-A and HADS-D scores and the FSFI total score, and HADS-D scores had positive correlations with weight, anthropometric indices, and BSQ total score. The degree of dis(satisfaction) was a predictor of FSFI total score, depression, and anxiety, and the FSFI total score was predicted by HADS-D. Desired and ideal-gender BMIs were risk factors for sexual dysfunction, and overweight and obesity were risk factors for the degree of dis(satisfaction). Limitations: This study had the limitations of using a cross-sectional design and it investigated a restricted number of clinical/biochemical parameters, as well as lacked objective measures of acne and hirsutism, and a control group. Conclusions: Perception and cognitive-affective dimensions appear to play important roles in body image dysfunction in women with PCOS, and impact sexual dysfunction and depression associated the syndrome. Furthermore, these results provide additional treatment considerations for women with PCOS.

"Differential associations of locus of control with anxiety, depression and life-events: A five-wave, nine-year study to test stability and change","Background: The locus of control (LOC) construct has been associated with onset, course, and severity of anxiety and depression. We investigated the stability of LOC, the bidirectional relationships between LOC and symptom severity of anxiety and depression over nine years, and the influence of intermediate positive and negative life-events on these associations. Methods: Data came from five assessment waves over nine years of 2052 subjects with an anxiety or depressive disorder or healthy controls. First, the stability of LOC (assessed with 5-item Mastery Scale) was tested. Next, associations between LOC, anxiety severity (Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression severity (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology), and intermediate positive and negative life-events (20-item List of Threatening Experience Questionnaire) were determined with structural equation modeling. Results: LOC was rather stable over nine years ( r = 0.62), and scores increased slightly with age (i.e. became more internal). LOC yielded equal stability estimates as symptom levels of anxiety and depression did over nine years. A more external LOC predicted higher anxiety and depression severity, but did not influence the incidence of positive and negative life-events. Higher depression severity and more negative life-events predicted the development of a more external LOC, whereas more positive life-events predicted a more internal LOC. Anxiety severity had no effect on LOC. Limitations: Life-events were assessed with self-report measures. Conclusions: The prospective associations between LOC and meaningful changes in anxiety and depressive symptom severity and experienced life-events may yield important new insights for clinical interventions.

NEET status among young Greeks: Association with mental health and substance use,"Background: Prior studies have shown that young people “not in education, employment or training” (“NEET”) are at higher risk for psychopathology and substance abuse. Similar studies are lacking in Southern European populations. We aimed to examine the associations of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and substance use with NEET status in a large, randomized population-based sample in Greece. Methods: A telephone structured questionnaire was conducted in a representative sample of 2771 young Greeks aged 15–24 years. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed with GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales, respectively. Substances use and several sociodemographic parameters were also examined. Results: In our sample 16.4% were NEETs. In multivariate analyses, NEETs compared to non-NEETs were older, with lower family income, without insurance and more likely to be married and smoke. Furthermore, NEET status was associated with a higher GAD-7 score among older NEETs and long-term NEETs (NEETs unemployed for more than a year). Moreover, being NEET among older participants was associated with severe symptoms of anxiety and moderate/severe symptoms of depression. Limitations: This was a telephone survey and a clinical evaluation of the patients was not performed. Furthermore, the structured interview was not designed to detect the level of substance use or the reasons for being NEET. Conclusions: NEET status is frequent among young Greeks. Older, and long-term NEETs appear to be at higher risk for presenting anxiety/depression symptoms. Whether NEET status is associated with adverse outcomes later in life requires longitudinal studies.

Ng, Gabor S. Ungvari, Gang Wang and Yu-Tao Xiang ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2018[Sep], Vol 237, 37-46). In the original article, there were errors in the affiliation of the seventh author and in the first affiliation. The corrections are given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-27934-007). Background: The prevalence of comorbid depression is high in chronic gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). For these two disorders in particular, the findings have not been consistent. This meta-analysis systematically compares the rates and severity of comorbid depression between IBS and IBD patients. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wan Fang, SinoMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure from their inception date to September 12, 2017 for comparative studies on IBS and IBD patients. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (OR) of comorbid depression were calculated using random effect models. Data on comorbid anxiety in the included studies were also extracted and analyzed. Results: Altogether, 22 studies with 1,244 IBS and 1,048 IBD patients were included. While there was no significant group difference in the prevalence of depression (10 studies, OR = 1.18, 95%CI: 0.87–1.60, P = 0.29), the IBS group had more severe depression (pooled SMD = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.04–0.33, P = 0.01) and anxiety than the IBD group (pooled SMD = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.14–0.49, P = 0.0006). Sixteen (72.7%) studies were assessed as ‘high quality’ using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS). Conclusions: Although the prevalence of comorbid depression was similar between groups, IBS patients had more severe comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to IBD patients. Appropriate assessment and treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms in these patient groups should be implemented.

"Influencing factors for prenatal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy among women in Chongqing, China","Background: Prenatal mental disorders are associated with maternal and fetal adverse outcomes, while few studies have been performed in mainland China. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of maternal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy and provide scientific basis for reducing prenatal mental disorders. Methods: Data were obtained from 1220 women with &lt; 15 weeks gestation in a cohort study conducted in Chongqing, China. Prenatal stress, anxiety and depression were assessed using the pregnancy pressure scale, the Hamilton anxiety scale, and the self-rating depression scale, respectively. Results: The prevalence of prenatal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy was 91.86%, 15.04% and 5.19%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk factors for prenatal stress include housewife/unemployment, presence of anxiety and low- and moderate-level social support, besides, the protective factors were exercise, active smoking and no suggestion from parents. Housewife/unemployment, primiparity, presence of stress and depression and low-level social support were found to be associated with the development of anxiety symptoms, whereas exercise had a protective effect on it. Group-oriented personality, presence of anxiety, no suggestion from husband, low- and moderate-level family care, and low-level social support were risk factors for prenatal depression. Limitations: All participants were recruited from one region of China, and none of them have a history of cesarean section. Conclusion: Early screening and intervention may have great significance for reducing mental disorders of pregnant women, and the family and society support should be brought into the intervention as well.

Efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of depression with comorbid anxiety disorders,"Background: The presence of comorbid anxiety is generally associated with poorer treatment outcomes in people with depression. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to be effective for treatment resistant depression, but there has been little research examining rTMS in depressed patients with comorbid anxiety disorders. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of rTMS in patients with treatment resistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and comorbid anxiety disorders. Methods: This study included 248 patients with treatment resistant MDD who were treated with rTMS. Of these, 172 patients had one or more comorbid anxiety disorders, so their outcomes were compared with patients who did not have comorbid anxiety. Results: Patients both with and without comorbid anxiety disorders showed improvement in depression ratings after rTMS treatment, with no significant difference in remission rates between groups. In those with comorbid anxiety disorders, 23.3% met criteria for remission and 39.5% met response criteria. For each anxiety disorder diagnosis, there was a significant reduction in HAM-A, HAM-D21, MADRS and ZUNG scores ( p = &lt; 0.001 for all). Limitations: This was not a sham-controlled study, so placebo response rates are not known. Patients were referred by private psychiatrists so are not representative of all patients with depression. Conclusion: Our study indicates that rTMS is an effective treatment for Major Depressive Disorder in people who have comorbid anxiety disorders.

Factorial invariance of a computerized version of the GAD-7 across various demographic groups and over time in primary care patients,"Background: The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) is commonly used by clinicians and researchers to screen for anxiety disorders and to monitor anxiety symptoms in primary care. However, findings regarding its factor structure are mixed, with most studies reporting a best-fitting for a one-factor structure, whereas others indicate a two-factor model. To be valid for comparisons, the GAD-7 should measure the same latent construct with the same structure across groups and over time. We aimed to examine the best-fit factor structure model of the GAD-7 among primary care patients and to evaluate its measurement invariance. Methods: A total of 1255 patients completed the computerized version of GAD-7 and a subsample of 238 cases was assessed at the 3-month follow-up. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed and analyses of multiple-group invariance were also conducted to determine the extent to which the factor structure was comparable across various sociodemographic groups and over time. Results: The results showed that both a one- and two-factor structure (representing somatic and cognitive-affective components) were invariant across sociodemographic groups and over time. The two-factor structure provided the best model fit. Limitations: Results cannot be generalized to all primary care patients, as only patients whose general practitioners consider them to suffer emotional disorders were included. Conclusions: Our study supports the reliability and validity of the one- and two-factor model of the GAD-7, both for screening purposes and for monitoring response to treatment.

Psychometric properties and validation of the Spanish versions of the Overall Anxiety and Depression Severity and Impairment scales,"Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders are the most frequent disorders for which patients seek care in public health settings in Spain. This study aimed at validating the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) and the Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS), which are brief screening scales for anxiety and depression consisting of only five items each. Methods: The study was conducted in a Spanish clinical sample receiving outpatient mental health treatment ( N = 339). A subsample of participants (n = 219) was assessed before and after receiving a course of cognitive-behavioral treatment. Results: The results revealed excellent internal consistency estimates (Cronbach's alpha for the OASIS and the ODSIS was 0.87 and 0.94, respectively), along with promising convergent and discriminant validity and test-criterion relationships (i.e., moderate correlation with other measures of depression and anxiety, as well as with neuroticism, quality of life, adjustment, and negative affect). A one-dimensional structure was obtained for the OASIS and the ODSIS. The ROC analyses indicated an area under the curve of 0.83 for the OASIS and the ODSIS when predicting moderate-to-severe anxiety and depression, respectively. Good sensitivity to therapeutic change was also evidence and the analysis of the sensitivity as a function of 1-specificity area suggested a cutoff value of 10 for both scales. Limitations: Inter-rater reliability of diagnoses with the ADIS-IV interview could not be investigated and the results obtained may not be generalizable to other samples and health settings. Conclusions: The availability of these two short and psychometrically sound measures should make screening of anxiety and depressive symptoms in routine care more feasible.

Online help-seeking prior to diagnosis: Can web-based resources reduce the duration of untreated mood disorders in young people?,"Objective: Mood and anxiety disorders typically begin in adolescence or early adulthood, but those at the age of highest risk are among those least likely to access mental health services. However, they may be more likely than other demographic groups to seek help online. The goal of the present study was to investigate the online help- and information-seeking activity of young people newly diagnosed with mood and anxiety disorders in order to better understand how digital resources might serve this population. Method: Participants, aged 15 to 35, with a diagnosis of a mood or anxiety disorder were eligible if they had received their first mental health diagnosis within 24 months. Participants were interviewed with the Pathways to Care Questionnaire, which inquires about online activity prior to one's first interaction with mental healthcare providers. Results: Forty people participated (depression n = 30, bipolar disorder n = 5, generalized anxiety disorder n = 5); average age 21 years (SD=3.2), 60% female. Eighty-one percent reported seeking help and/or information about their symptoms online. The gap between symptom onset and in-person help seeking was 91.90 weeks (SD=133.7). Most participants (85%) reported they would be open to communicating with a mental health professional online. Conclusion: A majority of young people experiencing clinically-significant symptoms seek help online. However, the gap between symptom onset and treatment initiation remains unacceptably long. Better strategies are needed to translate young people's interest in online resources into meaningful care, whether through web-based services or facilitated pathways to traditional treatment.

Recovery from mood and anxiety disorders: The influence of positive mental health,"Background: Mood and anxiety disorders are associated with growing burden of disease. Recent evidence shows that monitoring and enhancing positive mental health might be one direction to reduce this burden. The aim was to determine whether positive mental health predict recovery from mental disorders. Methods: The study population consisted of 414 participants with a 12-month disorder from the representative general population Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2. Independent positive mental health indicators were mental well-being, its subscales emotional, social and psychological well-being and the category flourishing mental health. Recovery was defined as no longer fulfilling DSM-IV criteria of the index disorder 3 years later. Results: Despite meeting the criteria of a 12-month mental disorder, 19% with anxiety disorder were flourishing and 14% with mood disorder. Logistic regression analyses controlled for sociodemographics, physical health, life-events, service use, psychotropic medication, comorbidity and clinical severity showed that positive mental health positively influenced recovery from anxiety disorder (mainly by emotional and psychological well-being) and did not influence recovery from mood disorder. Limitations: The results are not generalizable to psychiatric patients in treatment settings and might differ for specific disorders within each DSM-IV category. Conclusions: Clinicians are encouraged to measure positive mental health in their patients and to improve positive mental health particularly in people with an anxiety disorder. The non-significant relation between positive mental health and recovery from mood disorder warrants further research, for example through using more in-depth assessment of positive mental health components and by investigating recovery from less severe mood disorders.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal association of non-exercise estimated cardiorespiratory fitness with depression and anxiety in the general population: The HUNT study,"Background: Cardiorespiratory fitness may help to prevent depression and anxiety. A paucity of literature has considered the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and the incidence of depression and anxiety. The objective of this study was to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with depression and anxiety. Methods: This study included middle-aged and older participants from the second (HUNT 2, 1995–1997) and third (HUNT3, 2006–2008) survery of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT). Baseline non-exercise estimated CRF (eCRF) was determined using standardized algorithms. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between eCRF and depression and anxiety. Results: In cross-sectional adjusted analysis including those who participated in HUNT2 ( n = 26,615 mean age 55.7 years), those with medium and high level of eCRF had 21% (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71–0.89) and 26% (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.66–0.83) lower odds of depression compared to those with low eCRF level, respectively. Longitudinal analysis including those who participated in both HUNT2 and HUNT3 ( n = 14,020 mean age 52.2 years) found that medium and level of eCRF was associated with 22% (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.96) and 19% (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66–0.99) lower odds of depression compared to those with low eCRF level, respectively. CRF was not associated with anxiety, either cross-sectionally or longitudinally. Conclusion: Our data suggest that a medium and high level of eCRF during late middle age is cross-sectionally and prospectively associated with lower odds of depression. However, our data do not support that eCRF is associated with anxiety. Further studies are warranted to conclude a causal relationship between eCRF and depression.

The gut-brain relationship: Investigating the effect of multispecies probiotics on anxiety in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of healthy young adults,"Intro: There has been an increased interest in understanding the therapeutic effect of gut-microbiota on health, particularly in mental health. However, limited research into the connection between gut-microbiota and mental health makes this study an important endeavor in exploring the effect of gut-microbiota, through probiotics intervention, on mental health like anxiety and factors related to anxiety (e.g., anxiety control, affect, negative mood regulation, and worry). Method: Healthy college students ( N = 86; 75.6% female), average age of 20.59, participated in a double-blind, placebo-control, and randomization-control study. Eligible participants completed a baseline survey before being assigned to a condition, which consisted of four probiotics conditions and one placebo condition. After 28 days of daily intake, the participants returned to complete their exit survey. Result: Probiotics were observed to improve panic anxiety, neurophysiological anxiety, negative affect, worry, and increase negative mood regulation. Furthermore, post hoc analyses revealed that the CFU (colony-forming unit) level was more effective than species counts in accounting for the number of significant improvements. A ceiling effect was detected in the study, participants with high distress reported higher number of improvements than those with normative distress. Conclusion: Overall, this study is the first to examine the effect of CFU and species count on probiotics’ efficacy. The study's finding suggested that probiotics may have the therapeutic potential to treat anxiety, however, further research is necessary to make that determination.

"Dynamic and bidirectional associations between maternal stress, anxiety, and social support: The critical role of partner and family support","Background: Stress and anxiety in pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with poor long-term maternal and child health outcomes. Social support has been shown to mitigate the effects of maternal stress and anxiety; however, the directionality and longitudinal associations among these variables are poorly understood. Using a novel multilevel modeling approach called dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM), we examined within-person (state-level) autoregressive and cross-lagged associations among stress, anxiety, and social support in the perinatal period in order to elucidate directional associations over time. Methods: Mothers from a longitudinal pregnancy cohort ( N = 3,388) completed self-report measures of stress, anxiety, and social support across 4 time points from pregnancy to 12 months postpartum. Results: Higher than average levels of stress and anxiety led to elevations in anxiety and stress and decreases in social support at subsequent time points. Importantly, earlier individual levels of partner and family support predicted subsequent decreases in stress and anxiety. Limitations: Support was measured via maternal self-report thus extrapolations cannot be made to tangible or instrumental supports and lagged relationships represent average lags over time. Conclusions: Using a novel statistical approach, these results suggest that increases in both partner and family support may be powerful protective factors for decreasing mental health difficulties in pregnancy and the postpartum, highlighting the importance of targeting and increasing this type of support from pregnancy to the postpartum period.

Comparison and change of defense mechanisms over the course of psychotherapy in patients with depression or anxiety disorder: Evidence from a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Defense mechanisms play an important role in the development and maintenance of both health and psychopathology. Research is still in the early stages of investigating the specific relationships among diagnostic groups and defense mechanisms along with their response to different treatment types. Methods: For the present study a total of 47 outpatients diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders were randomized to receive 25±3 sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy with integrated elements of either emotion-focused therapy (CBT + EFT) or treatment components based on self-regulation theory (CBT + SR). An observer-rated method, the Defense Mechanism Rating Scale (DMRS) was used to code transcripts of the 1st, 8th, 16th and 24th session to assess change in defensive functioning. Results: Over the course of therapy, overall defensive functioning (ODF) as well as adaptive defenses increased significantly, whereas maladaptive and neurotic defenses did not change. At the beginning of treatment, the proportion of adaptive defenses and ODF was significantly higher in patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders than in patients with depressive disorders. However, depressed patients exhibited greater improvement in their defensive functioning over the course of therapy. Conclusions: Results support the view of defense mechanisms as a useful transdiagnostic and transtheoretical concept and supports the notion that change of defense mechanisms may be a relevant mechanism of change in psychotherapy.

Trajectories of self-reported sleep disturbance across inpatient psychiatric treatment predict clinical outcome in comorbid major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: As there has been a demonstrated link between sleep disturbance and suicide, the present study investigated the relationship between self-reported sleep disturbance during inpatient psychiatric treatment and clinical outcomes at discharge and six months post-discharge. Methods: Participants were 2,970 adults receiving care in a long-term inpatient psychiatric hospital. Greater than 90% of inpatients reported at least mild sleep disturbance throughout treatment. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to determine patterns of sleep disturbance changes over time. Results: Participants fit into distinct categories based on their trajectories of sleep problems across treatment: No Sleep Problems (10.3% of participants, no sleep problems endorsed over the course of inpatient psychiatric treatment), Resolvers (sleep problems completely resolved over the course of inpatient psychiatric treatment; 10.6%), Non-Responders (did not respond to inpatient psychiatric treatment; 35.7%) and Responders (sleep problems decreased but did not fully resolve over the course of inpatient psychiatric treatment; 43.4%). Individuals with comorbid major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were significantly more likely to demonstrate higher rates of sleep disturbance throughout inpatient psychiatric treatment and their sleep problems did not respond to treatment as usual (Non-Responders). Further, patients in the Non-Responder group had significantly more suicidal ideation and worse clinical outcomes (higher anxiety, more disability, and lower well-being) at discharge and six months post-discharge, as well as were on more medication including hypnotics throughout treatment. Conclusions: Findings indicate the urgent need to design and implement inpatient psychiatry sleep protocols to not only improve sleep and clinical outcomes, but also reduce the risk for suicide post-discharge.

Increased risk of depression in Bell's palsy: Two longitudinal follow-up studies using a national sample cohort,"Background: Recently, a bidirectional association between Bell's palsy and anxiety disorders has been reported. Given the common comorbidity between anxiety and depressive conditions and the typical developmental trajectory of anxiety before depression, we hypothesized that the bidirectional association between Bell's palsy and depression is also reproducible. Methods: Using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort, data were collected from 3,526 Bell's palsy patients who were 1:4 matched by age, sex, income, region of residence, and past medical history with 14,104 controls. Additionally, 61,068 depression patients were matched with 244,272 control participants. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the hazard ratio (HR) of Bell's palsy for depression (study I) and depression for Bell's palsy (study II). Results: In study I, the adjusted HR for depression was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20–1.66) in the Bell's palsy group ( P &lt; 0.001). In subgroup analyses, an increased risk of depression was more evident, particularly in female participants ≥ 40 years old. This association was evident in follow-up periods 6 months after the index date. In study II, the adjusted HR for Bell's palsy was 1.08 (95% CI = 0.94–1.25) in the depression group ( P = 0.280). Conclusion: A history of Bell's palsy increased the risk of depression. Contrary to our hypotheses, depression did not increase the risk of Bell's palsy.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for childhood anxiety disorders: What happens to comorbid mood and behavioral disorders? A systematic review,"Background: High rates of comorbidity among children and adolescents with anxiety disorders are widely documented. To date the question of what happens to comorbid disorders upon treatment of the primary anxiety disorder has received little attention and the optimal treatment strategy for cases with comorbidity remains to be determined. Objectives: This review examines the literature on the impact of disorder-specific CBT on comorbid mood and behavioral disorders in young people with a primary anxiety disorder. Search methods: PsycINFO, EMBASE, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched using predefined selection criteria. Two reviewers independently assessed the relevance of studies, obtained data using a data extraction form and undertook methodological quality analysis. Results: Ten studies (1647 children in total) were included in the review. All studies demonstrated positive outcomes for CBT focused on the primary anxiety disorder on untargeted comorbid mood and/or externalising disorders. Conclusions: Findings suggest CBT focused on the primary anxiety disorder successfully reduces comorbid mood and/or behavioral diagnoses and symptoms of these co-occurring clinical diagnoses. Therefore, the implementation of disorder-specific CBT for the primary disorder is a valid alternative to transdiagnostic interventions and is recommended in cases of comorbidity in children and adolescents with a primary anxiety disorder.

"Disrupted interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity and structural connectivity in first-episode, treatment-naïve generalized anxiety disorder","Background: Aberrant functional and structural connectivity are considered to be involved in the underlying neural mechanism of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, alterations in functional and structural interactions between the bilateral hemispheres are rarely examined. The current study aimed to characterized interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity and white matter microstructural integrity of the corpus callosum in patients with GAD. Methods: Resting-state Blood oxygen level-dependent and diffusion tensor image were acquired for patients with GAD and healthy subjects. The two groups were matched in age, gender, education years. The voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) of whole brain and white matter integrity of the corpus callosum (CC) were compared between the two groups. Their correlations with clinical measures were further performed. Results: Compare to controls, decreased resting-state VMHC were found in the precentral gyrus, middle cingulate gyrus and insula/putamen in patients with GAD. No regions of increased VMHC were detected in GAD. Compared to controls, GAD patients showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) values in CC2. In GAD group, further Pearson's correlation analyses showed that VMHC of the midcingulate gyrus positively correlated with FA of CC2, FA of CC2 negatively correlated with anxiety severity. Further mediation analyses demonstrated that attenuated VMHC in bilateral midcingulate gyrus partly mediated the association between white matter integrity of CC2 sub-region and anxiety severity. Conclusion: Our findings suggested impairment of interhemispheric coordination in GAD. Moreover, disrupted interhemispheric connectivity correlated with anxiety severity in GAD. Our findings provided a novel clue about the neural mechanism of GAD, and may contribute to further deep exploration and treatment of GAD. Limitations: The study was lack of comparison with non-GAD anxiety disorders.

"Association between induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility respectively and the risk of psychiatric disorders in 57,770 women followed in gynecological practices in Germany","Aim: Our goal was to analyze the association between induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility respectively and the risk of psychiatric disorders in 57,770 women followed in gynecological practices in Germany. Methods: This case-control study was based on data from the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA). Women with a first documentation of depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, or somatoform disorder in one of 281 gynecological practices in Germany between January 2013 and December 2017 were included in this study (index date). Controls without depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, or somatoform disorder were matched (1:1) to cases by age, index year, and physician. A total of 57,770 women were included in the present study. The main outcome of the study was the risk of psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, somatoform disorder) as a function of induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility. Results: The mean age was 29.2 years (SD = 6.4 years) in women with and without psychiatric disorders. Induced abortion (odds ratios [ORs] ranging from 1.75 to 2.01), spontaneous abortion (ORs ranging from 2.16 to 2.60), and infertility (OR = 2.13) were positively associated with the risk of psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: A positive relationship between induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility respectively and psychiatric disorders was observed in gynecological practices in Germany.

The impact of resilience on prenatal anxiety and depression among pregnant women in Shanghai,"Background: Prenatal anxiety/depression has been a major public health problem globally with higher prevalence in developing countries, which leads to negative health outcomes for both mothers and children. Maternal stress varies over the course of pregnancy and the stress occurring in early pregnancy is the most critical. However, few studies have focused on the impact of resilience to stress on mental health of pregnant women. Aims: To explore the effect of resilience to stress on prenatal anxiety/depression in pregnant women. Methods: 2813 participants were recruited from Shanghai Maternal-Child Pairs Cohort (Shanghai MCPC) in this study. The Life Event Scale for Pregnancy Women (LESPW) was used to assess stress at 12–16 weeks of pregnancy and at 32–36 weeks of pregnancy, respectively. Resilience was assessed by the revised Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) at 12–16 weeks of pregnancy. The prenatal anxiety and depression were assessed at 32–26 weeks of pregnancy by Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiological Survey, Depression Scale (CES-D), respectively. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the direct effect of stress and resilience on prenatal anxiety and depression. The indirect effects of mediation were analyzed by structural equation models, and the indirect effect of modification was examined by stratification analysis. Results: There were 11.1% and 10.3% of pregnant women in Shanghai MCPC indicating anxiety and depressive mood, respectively. The stress caused by both subjective and objective events at 32–36 weeks of pregnancy is less than that at 12–16 weeks of pregnancy. We found that resilience was a protective factor for maternal mental health and meanwhile it was both an effect modifier and a mediator to the association between stress and prenatal anxiety/depression, with the mediating effect ratio of 15.1% and 23.8%, respectively. Limitations: The existence of recall bias, missing data, and restricted residential areas of the participants may limit the generalizability of the study. The measurements of resilience, prenatal anxiety, and depression were not designed specifically for pregnant women, so that they might have missed some important indications of mental issues related to pregnant women only. Conclusions: Resilience could be a direct and indirect protective factor for prenatal anxiety and depression caused by pregnancy stress.

Affective symptoms and apathy in myotonic dystrophy type 1 a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: To gain insight into the prevalence of apathy, depression and anxiety symptoms in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients on the basis of a systematic review with a meta-analysis. Methods: One author systematically searched and selected studies from Embase, Medline, PsychInfo and Web of Science (index periods up to August 2018). Data extraction and bias assessment were performed independently by two authors. We calculated (1) a weighted pooled prevalence and (2) weighted pooled standardized mean difference (Hedges’ g) from studies comparing DM1 patients to healthy and/or neuromuscular disease controls separately for symptoms of depression, anxiety and apathy. Results: The pooled prevalences of depression (26 studies, n = 1267 DM1 patients), anxiety (19 studies, n = 896) and apathy (5 studies, n = 428), were 18% (95%CI: 12–25), 16 (95%CI: 13–18) and 55% (95%CI: 50–60), respectively. Effect sizes (Hedges’ g) for depression, anxiety and apathy in DM1 patients compared to healthy controls were 1.04 (95%-CI: 0.71 to 1.37), 0.87 (95%-CI: 0.51 to 1.24) and 1.13 (95%-CI:0.54–1.71). Effect sizes for symptoms of depression, anxiety and apathy were 0.29 (95% CI: -0.12 to 0.70), 0.45 (95%-CI: –0.31 to 1.22) and 1.12 (95%-CI: 0.32–1.93) for DM1 patients versus neuromuscular disease controls. In most analyses, statistical heterogeneity was high. Conclusions: Estimated pooled prevalences of clinically significant levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and apathy in DM1 are 19, 17 and 55% respectively. Symptoms of depression and anxiety in DM1 may reflect reactive adjustment to progressive impairment and restricted participation similar to other chronic neuromuscular disease. The literature on the prevalence and severity of apathy, although a clinically relevant and characteristic symptom of DM1, is relatively scarce.

"Use of mental health services by community-resident adults with DSM-IV anxiety and mood disorders in a violence-prone area: São Paulo, Brazil","Background: While under-use of mental health services by adults with anxiety and/or depression is well established, use in a violence-prone area, and as a function of diagnosis and personality characteristics such resilience, is little known. We examine the sociodemographic and personality characteristics (specifically resilience), associated with use of mental health services in a violence-prone city by those with anxiety, depression, and their comorbidity. Methods: The structured Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to identify 12-month DSM-IV- and ICD-10-defined anxiety and depression in a cross-sectional, representative, community-resident sample age 15–75y ( N = 2536) in São Paulo, Brazil, and their use of mental health services. Resilience was determined by the Wagnild and Young scale. Analyses, using weighted, design-corrected statistical tests, included frequency measures and multivariable logistic regression. Results: Mental health services were used by 10% with only anxiety, 22% with only depression, and 34% with comorbidity, with odds of use in controlled analyses doubling from anxiety to depression to comorbidity. Use was significantly higher among those who were white, older (age &gt;30 years, with substantial social support, low resilience, living in low homicide rate areas; use was not affected by experience of traumatic events. Psychiatrists, general practitioners, and psychologists were the primary providers. Limitations: Cross-sectional design Conclusions: Contrary to expectation, use was greater among residents of lower homicide areas, and was not associated with personal traumatic experience. This may reflect increased immunity to violence in higher homicidal rate areas, lower resilience, and poorer access to services. Increased access to mental health services is needed.

Biological and psychosocial predictors of anxiety worsening in the postpartum period: A longitudinal study,"Background: As many as 20% of women will experience an anxiety disorder during the perinatal period. Women with pre-existing anxiety disorders are at increased risk of worsening during this time, yet little is known about its predictors. Study Aim: To investigate the psychosocial and biological risk factors for anxiety worsening in the postpartum in women with pre-existing anxiety disorders. Methods: Thirty-five ( n = 35) pregnant women with pre-existing DSM-5 anxiety disorders were enrolled in this prospective study investigating the psychosocial (e.g., childhood trauma, intolerance of uncertainty, depression) and biological risk factors (e.g. C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) for anxiety worsening in the postpartum period. Anxiety worsening was defined as an increase of ≥50% or greater on Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores from the third trimester of pregnancy (32.94 ± 3.35 weeks) to six weeks postpartum. Results: Intolerance of uncertainty, depressive symptom severity, and obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms present in pregnancy were significant predictors of anxiety worsening in the postpartum. Limitations: Sample heterogeneity and limited sample size may affect study generalizability. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to investigate psychosocial and biological risk factors for anxiety worsening in the postpartum in women with pre-existing anxiety disorders. Continued research investigating these risk factors is needed to elucidate whether they differ from women experiencing new-onset anxiety disorders in the perinatal period, and those in non-puerperal groups. Identifying these risk factors can guide the development of screening measures for early and accurate symptom detection. This can lead to the implementation of appropriate interventions aimed at decreasing the risk of perinatal anxiety worsening.

Screening for perinatal anxiety disorders: Room to grow,"Background: The anxiety and their related disorders (AD) are the most prevalent of all mental health conditions, disproportionately affecting women. The value of perinatal AD screening is well established but there is very limited evidence to support the applicability of existing anxiety screening instruments. To our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated an AD screening instrument in a perinatal population using full gold standard methodology. Objective: To assess the accuracy of the most commonly used and/or recommended screening tools for perinatal AD (i.e., the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and its anxiety subscale (EPDS-3A), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 and 2-item Scales (GAD-7 and GAD-2) alongside a clinically derived alternative; the Anxiety Disorder-13 (AD-13). Methods: 310 Canadian women completed mood and anxiety questionnaires at approximately 3-months postpartum. Those scoring at/above cut-off on one or more questionnaire completed a diagnostic interview for depression and all AD ( n = 115). The accuracy of each scale was assessed via ROC analyses. Results: Only the AD-13 met the standard of a clinically useful screening measure, with an area under the curve (AUC) above 0.8. This was achieved with and without the inclusion of the related disorders. No other measure demonstrated an AUC above 0.8, either including or excluding the related disorders. Conclusions: Neither the EPDS/EPDS 3-A, nor the GAD-7/GAD-2 can be recommended for widespread use as a perinatal AD screening tool. The high performance of the AD-13 is a good indication that an effective alternative is well within reach.

Exploring comorbidity between anxiety and depression among migrant Filipino domestic workers: A network approach,"Background: Depression and anxiety are comorbid. From the network model perspective, comorbidity is due to direct interactions between depression and anxiety symptoms. These interacting symptoms are called bridge symptoms, suppression of which is expected to halt other symptoms. This study investigates the network structure of depression, anxiety, and bridge symptoms in a sample of migrant domestic workers, who are among the most vulnerable and marginalized groups of workers. Method: Data were collected from 1375 Filipino domestic workers in Macao Special Administrative Region, China. Data from a subsample of 355 consisting of participants who met criteria for depression and anxiety were used in analysis. R software was used to estimate the network. Results: The eight strongest edges were between items from the same disorder. Six were between depression symptoms, like “concentration difficulties” and “psychomotor agitation/retardation,” and “psychomotor agitation/retardation” and “thoughts of death.” Two were between anxiety symptoms, including “worry too much” and “trouble relaxing.” For centrality indices, “fatigue” had highest strength and closeness, and “restlessness” had highest betweenness. Results revealed three bridge symptoms: “fatigue,” “depressed mood,” and “anhedonia.” Limitations: The results may not generalize to the entire Filipino population. Further, while the centrality index of strength had adequate stability, it was not highly stable. Conclusions: The current study highlighted critical transdiagnostic bridge symptoms as specific candidates for intervention. “Psychomotor agitation/retardation” was identified as key priority due to its association with suicidal ideation. Systemic multilevel interventions at the person-level (e.g., cognitive therapy and behavioral activation), and at the structural and policy-level to alleviate psychosocial stressors, could be applied to address disorder comorbidity in this population.

Differentiating acute suicidal affective disturbance (ASAD) from anxiety and depression symptoms: A network analysis,"Background: A growing body of literature supports the potential existence of a new clinical entity, Acute suicidal affective disturbance (ASAD), which is characterized by rapid-onset, acute suicidality. This study aimed to evaluate whether current ASAD symptoms (i.e., suicidal intent, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, disgust with others and oneself, agitation, irritability, insomnia, and nightmares) comprise a psychopathological network distinct from anxiety and depression symptoms. Methods: A sample of 167 psychiatric inpatients completed self-report measures of current ASAD, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Results: Network analyses revealed three distinct clusters of symptoms corresponding to ASAD, anxiety, and depression symptom self-report measure items. Namely, ASAD symptoms not only demonstrated strong associations with each other, but they also exhibited weak associations with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Limitations: This study utilized a cross-sectional design and distinct self-report measures to assess all constructs, which may have led to methodological confounds that influenced the observed network structure. Conclusions: Overall, our findings provide further evidence for ASAD as a syndrome with strongly interrelated symptoms. Furthermore, results indicate that ASAD may represent a construct distinct from anxiety and depression, underscoring its potential diagnostic value. Additional research is needed to replicate these findings across other high-risk populations, as well as to examine how ASAD symptoms may relate to other psychiatric symptoms.

Clinically relevant anxiety and risk of Alzheimer's disease in an elderly community sample: 4.5 years of follow-up,"Objectives: To investigate whether clinically relevant anxiety increased the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) while controlling for the presence of depression and other confounders; and to report the population attributable fraction (PAF) associated with anxiety disorder. Method: We used data from the longitudinal, community-based Zaragoza Dementia and Depression (ZARADEMP) study. A random sample of 4057 dementia-free community dwellers aged ≥55 years were followed for 4.5 years. The Geriatric Mental State-Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy package was used for the diagnosis of clinically significant cases and subcases of anxiety; and AD was diagnosed by a panel of research psychiatrists according to DSM-IV criteria. Multivariate survival analysis with competing risk regression model was performed. Results: We observed a significant association between anxiety cases at baseline and AD risk in the univariate analysis that persisted in the fully adjusted model (SHR: 3.90; 95% CI: 1.59–9.60; p = 0.003), with a PAF for AD of 6.11% (95% CI: 1.30%–16.17%). No significant association between ‘subcases’ of anxiety at baseline and AD risk was found. Limitations: Data on apolipoprotein E were not available. The hospital-based diagnosis was not completed in all cases of dementia. Conclusion: Late-life, clinically significant anxiety (but not subclinical anxiety) seems to increase the risk of AD, independently of the effect of several confounders, including depression. Taking into account the high prevalence of anxiety among the elderly, future studies are warranted to determine potential risk reduction of AD.

Buffering against maladaptive perfectionism in bipolar disorder: The role of self-compassion,"Background: Maladaptive perfectionism is a transdiagnostic risk and maintaining factor for a range of mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder (BD). Self-compassion represents a potential protective factor against maladaptive perfectionism, however no studies to date have examined the relationship of these constructs in BD. The aim of the present study was to examine associations between maladaptive perfectionism, self-compassion and symptoms among individuals with BD. Methods: Baseline data were collected from 302 participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BD participating in an international randomised controlled trial. Participants completed measures of maladaptive perfectionism, self-compassion, symptom severity and emotion regulation difficulties. Clinician-administered measures of depression and mania severity were additionally collected. Correlation and mediation analyses were conducted. Results: Maladaptive perfectionism was positively associated with depression, anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties. Lower levels of self-compassion correlated with greater self-reported depression, anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties. Self-compassion partially mediated relationships between maladaptive perfectionism, depression, anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties. Limitations: The cross-sectional design limits conclusions about causal relationships between study variables. Results may not be generalizable to other BD populations. The role of maladaptive perfectionism and self-compassion in elevated mood states of BD remains unclear. Conclusion: Self-compassion represents one mechanism through which maladaptive perfectionism influences symptoms of depression, anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties in BD. Self-compassion represents a modifiable treatment target; individuals with BD exhibiting maladaptive perfectionistic tendencies may benefit from interventions fostering self-compassion.

Correlates for state and trait anxiety in a multicultural sample of Turkish and Spanish women at first trimester of pregnancy,"Objective: The main objective of this research was to assess the potential influence of cultural factors on the anxiety levels of a multicultural sample of Spanish and Turkish pregnant women at the beginning of the pregnancy. Methods: Between October and December 2017 a total of 250 Turkish and 264 Spanish pregnant women attending their first pregnancy medical check-up between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy in three different cities, Istanbul, Antalya and Malaga, were recruited for study. These women completed a questionnaire that included the Turkish or Spanish validated of the state-trait anxiety Inventory, and a series of questions related to health status, general mood, and sociodemographic variables. Results: The mean value for State Anxiety was 47.1 [16–56] (SD 4.2), and mild, moderate and severe State Anxiety was observed in 56.8%, 14.7% and 20.5% of participants, respectively. Mean value for trait anxiety was 46.9 [34–89] (SD 4.6) and 31.4%, 19.7% and 20.2% of participants scored for mild, moderate and severe anxiety respectively. Anxiety scores were significantly higher among Turkish women. In the whole sample, religion, working status, pregnancy planning and perceived partner´s support predicted anxiety at first trimester of pregnancy. Social support and educational level were the most important predictive variables in the Spanish subgroup, while religion, the number of living children and the lack of husband´s support were among Turkish pregnant women. Conclusion: Our results confirm the existence of a high prevalence of women´s anxiety at the beginning of the pregnancy and some differences between Turkish and Spanish pregnant women have been observed. We have confirmed that some cultural features like family structure (having more children and cohabitants), the Islamic religion or the lack of perceived partner´s support became the most important vulnerability elements.

Trajectories of depression and anxiety symptom change during psychological therapy,"Background: Forty-percent of the variance in psychological treatment outcomes is estimated to be explained by symptom change by the third treatment session. However, change may not be uniform across patient groups and symptom domains. This study aimed to identify subgroups of patients with different trajectories of depression and anxiety symptom change during psychological therapy and identify baseline patient characteristics associated with these trajectories. Methods: 4394 patients attending two psychological treatment services completed sessional, self-report depression and anxiety measures. Trajectories of symptom change were investigated using latent class growth analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore associations between baseline patient characteristics and trajectory classes. Results: A number of distinct trajectories were identified. Anxiety symptom trajectories could be distinguished by the third treatment session, but for depression symptoms there was a class displaying limited change until session six followed by rapid improvement in symptoms thereafter. Compared to the non-responding trajectories, depression and anxiety trajectories indicating treatment response were associated with lower baseline severity, better social functioning and lower incidence of phobic anxiety, but not with medication prescription status. Limitations: Data came from two services, so wider generalisability is unknown. Predictors were limited to data routinely collected in the services; unmeasured factors may have improved the prediction of trajectories. Conclusions: Baseline characteristics and symptom change early in therapy can help identify different trajectories of symptom change. This knowledge could aid clinical decision making and help improve treatment outcomes. By ignoring distinct trajectories, clinicians may incorrectly consider patients as “not-on-track” and unnecessarily change or end therapy that would otherwise benefit patients.

Subtypes of treatment-resistant depression determined by a latent class analysis in a Chinese clinical population,"Background: This study aimed to explore subtypes of treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed on clinical and demographic data collected from 375 patients with TRD. Clinical variables were compared across subtypes. Treatment outcomes across subtypes of TRD were compared separately for those within each subtype with anxiety (those with a HRSD-17 anxiety/somatization factor score ≥ 7) and those without anxiety. LCA subtypes were compared using Cochran's and Mantel–Haenszel χ2 test, respectively. Unordered multinomial logistic regression was used to assess clinical correlates of TRD subtypes. Results: Three categories were detected: severe depression (66%), moderate depression with anxiety (9%) and mild depression with anxiety/somatization (25%). Gender, age, age at first onset, family monthly income, number of hospitalizations, HRSD-17 and clinical global impression-severity (CGI) scores were significantly different across the three groups. Remission rates were significantly different among anxious cases with severe (43.75%), moderate (22.73%) and mild (26.25%) depression subtypes. Compared to cases in the mild depression group, those in the severe depression group had a greater likelihood of being male, having a later age of first onset, higher numbers of hospitalization, higher HRSD-17 and CGI total scores, and lower family income. Those in the moderate depression group were more likely to be male and have lower family income than those in the mild depression group. Limitations: Representative bias, relatively small sample size, unbalanced group size and incomplete indicator variables might have a negative effect on the validity and generalization of the findings. Conclusions: Depression severity could be a basis for subtype classification of patients with TRD. The classification of latent class of TRD observed in our study was similar to the structure found in MDD. Longitudinal research into the stability of the latent structure of TRD across illness course is merited as is research into treatment outcomes for TRD subtypes.

Insomnia late in pregnancy is associated with perinatal anxiety: A longitudinal cohort study,"Background: Postpartum anxiety (PPA) affects a substantial number of women. Despite increasing recognition of PPA, few studies have focused on perinatal anxiety and potential PPA triggers. Here we aimed to estimate the prevalence of perinatal anxiety disorders, and to explore the association between insomnia during late pregnancy and anxiety before and after childbirth. Methods: This study was part of the large population-based Akershus Birth Cohort. We analyzed data from the hospital's birth records and questionnaire responses from pregnancy weeks 17 and 32 and postpartum week 8 ( n = 1563). Perinatal anxiety symptoms were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Check List. Anxiety disorder measurements were based on questions from the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Insomnia was measured using the Bergen Insomnia Scale. Results: Among perinatal women, 10% reported symptoms of at least one anxiety disorder. The observed prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder was higher after delivery (4.2%) than during pregnancy (2.5%). Multiple regression analysis, with adjustment for several psychosocial and reproductive variables, indicated that insomnia during pregnancy was significantly associated with postpartum anxiety symptoms. However, this association was markedly weakened when depression variables were included in the analysis, indicating that gestational insomnia may also be a marker for a mood disorder. Limitations: Immigrant and single women were underrepresented in our sample. Conclusions: Our results suggest that anxiety disorders are prevalent during the perinatal period. Moreover, insomnia during pregnancy is associated with perinatal anxiety. Health professionals should be aware that women with gestational insomnia may have an increased risk of mood and anxiety disorders.

"Feasibility of a group-based laughter yoga intervention as an adjunctive treatment for residual symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress in people with depression","Background: Laughter Yoga (LY) is a group-based intervention involving simulated laughter, gentle stretching, rhythmic breathing and meditation. There is some limited evidence that LY reduces depressive symptoms over the short term. However, the quality of previous LY studies is poor and none involved working-aged people with a clinical diagnosis of depression. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility and potential efficacy of LY for improving residual mood, anxiety and stress symptoms in adults diagnosed with depression. Methods: Fifty participants were randomised to the group LY intervention ( n = 23) consisting of eight sessions over four weeks, or treatment-as-usual ( n = 27). Participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and the Short Form 12 item Health Survey at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and at 3 months follow-up (T2). LY participants also completed a Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ8) at T1 and eleven participated in individual qualitative interviews at T2. Results: The LY group had statistically greater decreases in depression and improvements in mental health related quality of life compared to the control group from T0 to T1. The CSQ8 scores indicated a favourable level of satisfaction with the LY intervention. The qualitative interviews highlighted aspects of the intervention that were effective and those requiring modification. Limitations: Limitations include the small sample size and treatment-as-usual control group. Conclusions: A full scale RCT of LY could be feasible if some modifications were made to the protocol/intervention. The intervention may be effective to improve depression and mental health related quality of life immediately post intervention.

Trajectories of maternal distress and risk of child developmental delays: Findings from the All Our Families (AOF) pregnancy cohort,"Background: Existing literature on the impact of the course of maternal distress symptoms in the perinatal period and beyond has mainly focused on one source of distress (e.g., anxiety or depression) and only selected aspects of child development. This study examined the relative impact of trajectories of maternal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms from mid-pregnancy to early childhood on child communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal social development at three years of age. Methods: Data were analyzed from 1983 mother-child dyads who participated in the three-year follow-up of the All Our Families (AOF) study. Maternal distress and child development across five domains were measured using validated tools. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify trajectories of maternal distress over time. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between the trajectories and child development while adjusting for the covariates. Results: At age three years, 5.2% of children were at risk communication delay; 12.7% for gross motor delay; 15.4% for fine motor delay; 11.2 for problem solving delay; and 5.6% for personal-social delay on ASQ-3 domains. Multivariable analysis showed children born to mothers with persistent high anxiety symptoms from pregnancy to 3-years postpartum had an increased risk of delays in communication and personal-social domains. Limitations: The use of self-reported maternal mental health symptoms and maternal reported child development are the study limitations. Conclusions: The impact of high levels of maternal anxiety symptoms on the increased risk of child developmental delay in communication and personal-social domains highlights the importance of early intervention and addressing maternal anxiety from pregnancy through early childhood.

Vegetarian diet and mental health: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses in culturally diverse samples,"Background: Vegetarianism is linked with better physical health, but also to increased anxiety and depression. The aim of the present study is to examine the relationship between vegetarianism and both positive and negative mental health, across cultures and over time. Method: Self-report questionnaire data were obtained from a large-scale multi-national cross-sectional sample including 2007 representative adult members of the German population, 3020 representative adults from Russia, and 3038 representative adults from the USA. Participants for the longitudinal analyses include university students from Germany (1608) and China (12,744). Statistical models included multiple linear regression, longitudinal linear models and longitudinal logistic models. Results: Vegetarianism diet is not reliably related to positive or negative mental health in US and Russian representative samples or in German representative or student samples. Vegetarianism is related to slight increases over time in anxiety and depression in Chinese students. Conclusions: Vegetarianism is not associated with mental health in the US, Russia, or Germany, but is associated with anxiety and depression in China in this study. Future studies should examine the nuances of vegetarianism in more detail and their links with mental health, including dietary composition and cultural beliefs and economic circumstances. Future researchers in this area may also want to consider the effects of experimental manipulation of diet on mental health outcomes over time.

"Examining differential relationships among self-reported attentional control, depression, and anxiety in a transdiagnostic clinical sample","Background: Poor attentional control, defined as difficulty focusing attention on a task or shifting attention flexibly between tasks, is a transdiagnostic construct theorized to confer risk for, and maintain, depression and anxiety. Research to date in non-clinical samples has suggested a dissociable relationship between the two factors of self-reported attentional control and psychopathology, with depression being associated with difficulties shifting and anxiety being associated with focusing . However, to our knowledge no study has tested this differential set of relationships in a clinical sample. Methods: Adults ( N = 493) presenting for psychiatric treatment completed measures of depressive and anxiety symptom severity and self-reported attentional control. Hierarchical linear regression and Zou's (2007) confidence interval method were used to examine the relationship between clinical symptoms and attentional control. Results: Both shifting and focusing were significantly correlated with anxiety and depressive symptoms in this sample. However, focusing was more strongly associated with clinical symptomatology than shifting, which showed a weak correlation. Limitations: All constructs were measured cross-sectionally by self-report questionnaires. Conclusions: In contrast to studies conducted in non-clinical samples, attentional focusing appears to be more relevant than attentional shifting in a clinical sample for both depression and anxiety symptoms. These findings lend support to efforts to develop neurocognitive interventions that improve focusing. Replication of these findings, particularly in longitudinal studies, is warranted.

On a continuum to anxiety disorders: Adolescents at parental risk for anxiety show smaller rostral anterior cingulate cortex and insula thickness,"Background: Having a parent with an anxiety disorder increases the risk of anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders during the lifespan. Moreover, childhood and adolescence anxiety disorders and symptoms have been linked to a range of brain structure abnormalities. However, to date, no study has investigated brain anatomy in adolescents at high risk based on parental anxiety disorders and in adolescents with an anxiety disorder but without any treatment or therapy. Methods: Anatomical images from magnetic resonance imaging of 68 adolescents with anxiety disorders without any treatment ( N = 20), at risk for anxiety because of their parents’ anxiety disorders ( N = 21), and comparison youths ( N = 27), were analyzed using Freesurfer. Results: Compared to comparison group, smaller cortical thickness of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and of the insula was observed in anxious and at-risk groups; smaller amygdala volume was observed in the anxious group only. Limitations: The age range studied is large (10 to 17 years old). Moreover, this study is cross-sectional. Since adolescence is one of the biggest periods of cerebral reorganization, longitudinal follow-up of these youths would be necessary. Conclusions: Smaller rostral anterior cingulate cortex and insula cortical thickness appear to be cerebral markers of the risk of developing an anxiety disorder in adolescence. The reduction of the amygdala volume seems to be linked to the onset of the disorder.

"A longitudinal analysis of cannabis use and mental health symptoms among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in Vancouver, Canada","Background: Cannabis use, anxiety, and depression are common among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) and some report using cannabis to manage mental health symptoms. Methods: Sexually-active gbMSM aged ≥ 16 years were recruited into a longitudinal cohort through respondent-driven sampling and completed study visits every six months. Data on demographics, drug use, and anxiety and depression symptoms were collected via a self-administered computer-based survey. A study nurse determined previous mental health diagnoses and treatment. Using multivariable generalized linear mixed models, we examined factors associated with regular cannabis use (≥ weekly in the previous 3 months) and, among individuals who reported anxiety or depression/bipolar diagnoses, factors associated with moderate/severe anxiety or depression symptoms. Results: Of 774 participants (551 HIV-negative, 223 HIV-seropositive), 250 (32.3%) reported regular cannabis use, 200 (26.4%) reported ever being diagnosed with anxiety, and 299 (39.3%) reported ever being diagnosed with depression or bipolar disorder at baseline. Regular cannabis use was positively associated with HIV-seropositivity (aOR = 2.23, 95%CI:1.40–3.54) and previous mental health diagnosis (aOR = 1.52, 95%CI: 1.00–2.31, p = 0.05). Among those previously diagnosed with anxiety or depression/bipolar disorder, regular cannabis use was not associated with moderate/severe anxiety (aOR = 1.16, 95%CI:0.69–1.94) or depression symptoms (aOR = 0.96, 95%CI:0.59–1.58), respectively. Limitations: Because of observational study design, we are unable to determine absolute effect. Conclusions: Regular cannabis use was more likely among HIV-positive gbMSM and those previously diagnosed with a mental health disorder. No association was found between regular cannabis use and severity of anxious or depressive symptoms among those diagnosed with these conditions.

Prevalence and course of subthreshold anxiety disorder in the general population: A three-year follow-up study,"Background: This study examined the prevalence, course and risk indicators of subthreshold anxiety disorder to determine the necessity and possible risk indicators for interventions. Methods: Data were derived from the ‘Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2’ (NEMESIS-2), a psychiatric epidemiological cohort study among the general population ( n = 4528). This study assessed prevalence, characteristics, and three-year course of subthreshold anxiety disorder ( n = 521) in adults, and compared them to a no anxiety group ( n = 3832) and an anxiety disorder group ( n = 175). Risk indicators for persistent and progressive subthreshold anxiety disorder were also explored, including socio-demographics, vulnerability factors, psychopathology, physical health and functioning. Results: The three-year prevalence of subthreshold anxiety disorder was 11.4%. At three-year follow-up, 57.3% had improved, 29.0% had persistent subthreshold anxiety disorder and 13.8% had progressed to a full-blown anxiety disorder. Prevalence, characteristics and course of subthreshold anxiety disorder were in between both comparison groups. Risk indicators for persistent course partly overlapped with those for progressive course and included vulnerability and psychopathological factors, and diminished functioning. Limitations: Course analysis were restricted to the development of anxiety disorders, other mental disorders were not assessed. Moreover, due to the naturalistic design of the study the impact of treatment on course cannot be assessed. Conclusions: Subthreshold anxiety disorder is relatively prevalent and at three-year follow-up a substantial part of respondents experienced persistent symptoms or had progressed into an anxiety disorder. Risk indicators like reduced functioning may help to identify these persons for (preventative) treatment and hence reduce functional limitations and disease burden.

The relationship between phobic anxiety and 2-year readmission after Acute Coronary Syndrome: What is the role of heart rate variability?,"Objective: Phobic anxiety is a risk factor for poor prognosis following Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). A psychophysiological marker of vagal function, autonomic dysfunction may play a critical role in this relationship. The aim of the study was two-fold: to assess whether phobic anxiety was characterised by autonomic dysfunction (heart rate variability) in the short (1-month) and longer term (12-months) following ACS, and (ii) to quantify the extent to which HRV parameters modified the effect of phobic anxiety on all-cause hospital readmission over 2 years. Methods: The ADVENT study followed 416 ACS patients. At 1-month following discharge (T0), phobic anxiety and autonomic functioning were assessed using the Crown Crisp Index (CCI) and 11 indices of heart rate variability (HRV), respectively. HRV was measured again at 12-months (T1) ( n = 359). Hospital readmission (all cause) was derived from an audit of hospital records by two medically trained research fellows. Generalised linear modelling (GLM) was used to first determine the association between CCI score at T0 and HRV parameters at T0 and T1. Binary logistic regression was used to measure the relationship between CCI scores and readmission (yes/no) and the extent to which HRV parameters modified this effect. Results: CCI scores were associated with 7 of the 11 indices of HRV: Average RR (ms), SDRR (ms), RMSSD (ms), SDSD (ms), pRR50 (%), LF Powers (ms2) and HF Powers (ms2) at T0 but not T1. CCI scores at T0 significantly predicted likelihood of readmission to hospital in the subsequent 2 year period. No parameter of HRV at T0 modified this effect. Limitations: We were unable to provide adjudicated major adverse coronary events outcome data, or account for changes in medication adherence, diet or physical activity. Conclusions: While phobic anxiety is associated with both reduced vagal function in the short term after an ACS event and 2 year all cause readmission, HRV does not appear to be the pathway by which phobic anxiety drives this outcome.

Prediction of prolonged treatment course for depressive and anxiety disorders in an outpatient setting: The Leiden routine outcome monitoring study,"Objective: The aim of this study was to improve clinical identification of patients with a prolonged treatment course for depressive and anxiety disorders early in treatment. Method: We conducted a cohort study in 1.225 adult patients with a depressive or anxiety disorders in psychiatric specialty care setting between 2007 and 2011, with at least two Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) assessments within 6 months. With logistic regression, we modelled baseline age, gender, ethnicity, education, marital status, housing situation, employment status, psychiatric comorbidity and both baseline and 1st follow-up BSI scores to predict prolonged treatment course (&gt; 2 years). Based on the regression coefficients, we present an easy to use risk prediction score. Results: BSI at 1st follow-up proved to be a strong predictor for both depressive and anxiety disorders (OR = 2.17 (CI95% 1.73–2.74); OR = 2.52 (CI95% 1.86–3.23)). The final risk prediction score included BSI 1st follow-up and comorbid axis II disorder for depressive disorder, for anxiety disorders BSI 1st follow-up and age were included. For depressive disorders, for 28% of the patients with the highest scores, the positive predictive value for a prolonged treatment course was 60% (sensitivity 0.38, specificity 0.81). For anxiety disorders, for 35% of the patients with the highest scores, the positive predictive value for a prolonged treatment course was 52% (sensitivity 0.55, specificity 0.75). Conclusions: A high level of symptoms at 2–6 months of follow-up is a strong predictor for prolonged treatment course. This facilitates early identification of patients at risk of a prolonged course of treatment; in a relatively easy way by a self-assessed symptom severity.

Examining a training effect on the state anxiety response to an acute bout of exercise in low and high anxious individuals,"Background: An acute bout of exercise temporarily reduces state anxiety. The current study examined whether these benefits are greater for those with higher levels of anxiety, and whether these benefits are augmented with exercise training. Methods: Young adults were randomized to either a nine-week moderate-intensity exercise group or an inactive control group. We assessed changes in state anxiety in response to an acute bout of exercise each week. Results: State anxiety reductions following acute exercise increased in the exercise subgroup with high anxiety at baseline as training progressed ( p = .029). No training effects were observed for the exercise subgroup with low baseline anxiety ( p = .27). Limitations: A predominantly female sample, a single state anxiety measure post exercise and a non-exercise control group should be addressed in future research. Conclusions: The results support the use of regular physical activity as a method for managing state anxiety in young adults. In particular, regular physical activity may be especially beneficial for those experiencing higher levels of anxiety.

The long-term effect of bariatric surgery on depression and anxiety,"Background: No previous review has comprehensively assessed long-term changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms in bariatric surgery patients. This systematic review assessed the effects of bariatric surgery on long-term reductions (≥ 24 months) in anxiety and depressive symptom severity in morbidly obese (≥ 35 BMI kg/m²) participants. Short term effects (&lt; 24 months) are briefly reviewed for context. Methods: PsychINFO, Google Scholar and PubMed databases were systematically searched for prospective cohort studies published from inception to 14 June 2018 that evaluated long-term (≥ 24 months) changes in anxiety and depressive symptom severity in bariatric surgery patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² using a combination of the following search terms: bariatric surgery (and surgical approaches included under this term), obesity, depression, depressive disorder, anxiety, anxious, psychiatric disorders, mood disorders. Results: We reviewed 2058 articles for eligibility; 14 prospective studies were included in the systematic review. 13 studies (93%) reported significant reductions in depressive symptom severity 2–3 years after bariatric surgery. However, all studies recorded statistically significant reductions in depressive symptoms at the conclusion of the study. Similarly, there were reductions in overall anxiety symptom severity at ≥ 24 months follow-up (k = 8 studies, n = 1590 pooled). Pre-operative anxiety or depression scores did not predict outcomes of postoperative BMI. Similarly, post-surgery weight loss did not predict changes in anxiety symptoms. Limitations: Very few studies assessed anxiety or depression as a primary outcome. Therefore, we cannot suggest bariatric surgery as a stand-alone therapeutic tool for anxiety and depression based on our findings. Conclusion: Currently available evidence suggests that bariatric surgery is associated with long-term reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms. This supports existing literature showing that metabolic treatments may be a viable therapeutic intervention for mood disorders.

"Anxiety, depression, loneliness and social network in the elderly: Longitudinal associations from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA)","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 266 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2020-22174-104). In the original article, there were some errors in the Abstract section on page 82 and the Results section on page 85. The corrected texts are present in the erratum.] Background: Social network, loneliness, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depression disorder (MDD) are interrelated. However, as the directions of these associations are still unclear, we examined them prospectively using community-based data. Methods: Data on 5066 adults aged ≥ 50 years from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) were analyzed. Loneliness was assessed through the UCLA loneliness scale. Social integration was measured using the Berkman–Syme Social Network Index. MDD and GAD were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Logistic regression models were conducted. Results: The longitudinal association between experiencing loneliness and higher likelihood of suffering from MDD or GAD two years later is bidirectional but stronger with loneliness as origin, whereas the association between social isolation and higher likelihood of subsequent MDD or GAD as well as those between loneliness and subsequent deterioration of social integration are unidirectional. Conclusion: Objective and perceived social isolation independently affect the probability of suffering from MDD or GAD whereas loneliness is a risk factor for the deterioration of social life, which highlights the need to address the subjective factors (such as loneliness) and objective factors (such as social network size) of social isolation in a complementary way in order to improve the mental health of the older adult population.

Does bullying victimization really influence adolescents’ psychosocial problems? A three-wave longitudinal study in China,"Background: Traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization are associated with adolescents’ mental health problems, but the temporal sequence of these relations remains unclear. The present study analyzed the temporal and reciprocal relationships between both types of bullying victimization and six frequent psychosocial problems during adolescence: depression, general anxiety, stress, low self-esteem, social anxiety, and loneliness. Methods: A total of 661 Chinese adolescents in grades 7 and 8 at the initial wave of the study responded to the survey items assessing their bullying victimization experiences and self-reported psychosocial problems. This research was conducted at three separate time points, over a year and a half period. Results: Bullying victimization did not predict adolescents’ psychosocial problems. Instead, adolescents with psychosocial problems were more likely to experience bullying victimization. Depression and general anxiety were two common predictors of traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization. Stress was a specific predictor of traditional bullying victimization, whereas self-esteem, social anxiety, and loneliness were specific predictors of cyberbullying victimization. Psychosocial problems did not differentially predict the two types of bullying victimization. Boys with higher levels of loneliness were more likely than girls to experience cyber-bullying victimization. Limitations: The present study is limited in terms of its sample selection and self-reported instruments. Conclusions: This study emphasizes adolescents’ psychosocial problems as the potential risk factors for their future bullying victimization. Education professionals should pay special attention to adolescents’ mental health problems when formulating bullying interventions and programs.

Prevalence of anxiety disorder among older adults in Spain: A meta-analysis,"Background: Anxiety disorders are recognized as one of the most prevalent mental disorders in late-life. However, the prevalence of anxiety disorders in older Spanish people has not yet been determined. The aim was to review epidemiological studies systematically to calculate the overall prevalence of anxiety in Spanish older adults by using meta-analytic techniques. Methods: We searched relevant published studies in electronic databases up to January 2018 providing data on the prevalence of anxiety among people aged 65 + years in Spain. Overall anxiety prevalence estimates were calculated using random-effects models. Sources of heterogeneity were explored by means of univariate meta-regressions. Results: A total of 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis ( N = 12,577). Pooled overall prevalence of anxiety was 11% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6%–18%) representing 1958,471 people aged 65 + (95%CI: 1068,257–3204,771). Point, 12-month and lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders were 12%, 6% and 19%, respectively. Limitations: We detected a small publication bias effect for life-time prevalence of anxiety. The use of different diagnostic methods across the studies would have required separate analyzes. Conclusion: Some heterogeneity was found across studies, probably due to different methodological issues. Overall, the pooled prevalence of anxiety disorders in Spanish older adults was lower than that observed in other countries. Due to the negative consequences of anxiety disorders in older adults, detection and treatment should be a priority in this population.

Comorbid disorders as moderators of response to family interventions among adolescents with bipolar disorder,"Background: While family interventions have shown efficacy in improving mood symptoms and family functioning in pediatric bipolar disorder, few studies have examined the effects of comorbid psychiatric conditions on patients’ symptomatic or functional responses to treatment. Methods: 145 adolescents with bipolar I or II disorder were randomly assigned to family-focused therapy (FFT-A) or a brief psychoeducational therapy (enhanced care; EC) and followed over 2 years. Participants received pharmacotherapy for the study's duration. We examined whether comorbid anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs; i.e., oppositional defiant and conduct disorder) predicted the proportion of weeks that participants experienced mood symptoms during follow-up, and whether comorbid disorders moderated the effects of treatment assignment on mood symptoms and family conflict. Results: Comorbid anxiety was associated with a greater proportion of weeks with depressive symptoms, more severe (hypo)manic symptoms during follow-up, and greater family conflict over the 2-year study. Comorbid ADHD was associated with a greater proportion of weeks with (hypo)manic symptoms, more severe (hypo)manic symptoms, and greater family conflict. Additionally, youth with comorbid ADHD who received FFT-A had more favorable trajectories of (hypo)manic symptoms and family functioning than youth with comorbid ADHD who received EC. Comorbid DBDs were consistently associated with more severe depressive symptoms and greater family conflict throughout the study. Limitations: Randomization to treatments was not stratified on comorbid disorders. The longitudinal trajectories of anxiety, attentional, and disruptive behavior symptoms were not examined. Conclusions: The course of bipolar disorder in adolescents is strongly affected by comorbid disorders. Future research should examine whether adolescents with more complex presentations of bipolar disorder should be treated with different or more intensive psychosocial protocols than adolescents without these presentations.

Spatial complexity of brain signal is altered in patients with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Is it healthy to be chaotic? Recent studies have argued that mental disorders are associated with more orderly neural activities, corresponding to a less flexible functional system. These conclusions were derived from altered temporal complexity. However, the relationship between spatial complexity and health is unknown, although spatial configuration is of importance for normal brain function. Methods: Based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we used Sample entropy (SampEn) to evaluate the altered spatial complexity in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 47) compared to healthy controls (HCs; n = 38) and the relationship between spatial complexity and anxiety level. Results: Converging results showed increased spatial complexity in patients with GAD, indicating more chaotic spatial configuration. Interestingly, inverted-U relationship was revealed between spatial complexity and anxiety level, suggesting complex relationship between health and the chaos of human brain. Limitations: Anxiety-related alteration of spatial complexity should be verified at voxel level in a larger sample and compared with results of other indices to clarify the mechanism of spatial chaotic of anxiety. Conclusions: Altered spatial complexity in the brain of GAD patients mirrors inverted-U relationship between anxiety and behavioral performance, which may reflect an important characteristic of anxiety. These results indicate that SampEn is a good reflection of human health or trait mental characteristic.

Association of adult attachment and suicidal ideation in primary care patients with multiple chronic conditions,"Background: Suicidal ideation is a common health concern in primary care. Attachment theory indicates that subjects with higher anxiety and/or avoidance may be more susceptible to suicidal ideation. Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine the association of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and suicidal ideation in middle-aged to elderly, chronically ill primary care patients. Methods: The APRICARE Study comprised 207 patients aged 50–85 years with a minimum of three chronic diseases. Adult attachment, depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were measured via the self-report questionnaires Experiences in Close Relationships–Revised (ECR-RD12) and Patient Health Questionnaire—9 (PHQ-9). Univariable and adjusted associations of suicidal ideation with ECR-RD12-attachment anxiety, ECRRD12- attachment avoidance, and ECR-RD12-insecure adult attachment were examined via logistic regression analyses. Results: Suicidal ideation was present in 13% of all patients. ECR-RD12-anxiety was significantly associated with suicidal ideation (OR = 1.88, CI 1.44–2.44), while ECR-RD12-avoidance was not associated. In patients with suicidal ideation, 85% were insecurely attached compared to 63% in those without suicidal ideation—thus the OR for suicidal ideation in insecurely attached patients was 3.33 (CI = 1.10–10.04) with securely attached patients as reference. Further variables associated with suicidal ideation were depressive symptomatology, living alone (especially in men) and obesity (especially in women). Limitations: The study was cross-sectional in design, and suicidal ideation was assessed using a single item self-report measure. Conclusion: General practitioners should be aware of attachment styles in order to have a better chance to identify patients at risk for suicide.

Effects of the neuropeptide S receptor gene on the mediating effect of somatization on the association between life-event scores and psychological distress,"Background: The mechanisms underlying the relationship between life events and psychological distress are unclear. However, evidence of genetic involvement, including the neuropeptide S receptor gene (NPSR1), exists. Methods: A total of 600 Chinese adults were enrolled in this cross-sectional study using random cluster sampling. Demographic information, measures of life events and psychiatric symptoms, and fasting blood samples were collected. Results: Significant correlations were observed among life-event scores, somatization, and psychological distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms). Regression revealed life-event scores and somatization predicted anxiety, depressive symptoms, and psychological distress, while controlling for sex, age, income, education, and marital status. Structural equation modeling indicated that somatization mediated the association between life-event scores and psychological distress. Moreover, the mediating effect was influenced by the NPSR1 gene, suggesting that the NPSR1 polymorphisms rs324981, rs6947841, and rs6972158 influenced the association between life-event scores and somatization ( p s &lt; 0.05). The NPSR1 polymorphisms rs12673132 significantly affected the relationship of somatization with psychological distress ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: In conclusion, somatization mediated the association between life-event scores and psychological distress. The current study is the first to demonstrate this relationship with a Chinese sample, whereby the NPSR1 gene affects the mediating effect of somatization on the association between life-event scores and psychological distress.

What protects at-risk postpartum women from developing depressive and anxiety symptoms? The role of acceptance-focused processes and self-compassion,"Background: Not all women presenting risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD) develop depressive symptoms. Research has shown that acceptance-focused processes (nonjudgmental appraisal of thought content, psychological flexibility) and self-compassion play an important protective role in the development of psychological symptoms. However, considering the perinatal period, little is known about what variables can modify the negative impact of risk. Methods: The sample consisted of 185 postpartum women at risk of developing PPD (Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory-Revised &gt; 5.5). Data were collected regarding depressive (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), psychological flexibility (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II), nonjudgmental appraisal of thought content (Postnatal Negative Thoughts Questionnaire) and self-compassion (Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form). Results: Women not presenting depressive and anxiety symptoms reported significantly higher levels of psychological flexibility, nonjudgmental appraisal of thought content and self-compassion than women presenting depressive and anxiety symptoms. Hierarchical logistic regression showed that women with higher levels of psychological flexibility (OR = 1.06, CI: 1.01–1.12) and nonjudgmental appraisal of thought content (OR = 1.33, CI: 1.15–1.53) had a significantly higher likelihood of not presenting depressive and anxiety symptoms. Limitations: The limitations of this study were the cross-sectional design, the use of self-report questionnaires and the self-selected bias in recruitment. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the important role of acceptance-based processes, suggesting that at-risk women who are more accepting of their private events may be more protected from developing psychological symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider the promotion of these processes to improve women's adjustment to this period.

Impact of preoperative anxiety and depression on quality of life before and after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma,"Objective: The impact of anxiety and depression symptoms (ADS) is often estimated in terms of clinical endpoints such as the risk of complications and probabilities of readmission and survival. The purpose of this study was to provide a benchmark for capturing the negative effects of ADS on quality of life after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surgery and to provide an evidence base for future research and clinical interventions aimed at understanding and remediating these effects. Methods: This prospective study analyzed 410 HCC patients at three tertiary academic hospitals. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-H) were administered before HCC surgery and at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after HCC surgery. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate differences-in-differences models for examining the effects of ADS. Results: At baseline, 9.0% of the participants had anxiety symptom (BAI &gt; 10), 17.1% had depression symptom (BDI &gt; 13), and 7.1% had ADS. Throughout the study period, anxiety and depression (differences-in-differences value) had significant ( P &lt; 0.001) negative net effects on mean scores for all FACT-H dimensions, and the differences gradually increased over time. From baseline through all follow-up years, the two groups significantly ( P &lt; 0.001) differed in scores for all FACT-H dimensions, and the differences increased over time. Conclusions: For healthcare providers, this study highlights the need for continued monitoring for ADS in patients who have undergone hepatic resection and the need for timely and appropriate psychological care for these patients.

Comparative validity and responsiveness of PHQ-ADS and other composite anxiety-depression measures,"Background: Composite measures that assess the overall burden of anxiety and depressive symptoms have been infrequently evaluated in the same study. The objective of this study was to compare the validity and responsiveness of the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS) and other composite anxiety-depression measures. Methods: The sample comprised 256 primary care patients enrolled in a telecare trial of chronic musculoskeletal pain and comorbid depression and/or anxiety. Measures included the PHQ-ADS; the 8-item and 4-item depression and anxiety scales from the PROMIS profiles; the PHQ-anxiety-depression scale (PHQ-4); the SF-36 Mental Health scale; and the SF-12 Mental Component Summary scale. Correlations among these measures and health-related quality of life measures were examined. Responsiveness was evaluated by standardized response means, area under the curve (AUC) analyses, and treatment effect sizes in the trial. Results: Convergent and construct validity was supported by strong correlations of the composite depression-anxiety measures with one another and moderate correlations with health-related quality of life measures, respectively. All composite measures differentiated patients who were better at 3 months, whereas the PHQ-ADS and PHQ-4 also distinguished the subgroup that had worsened. AUCs for composite measures were generally similar, whereas treatment effect sizes were largest for the PHQ-ADS. Limitations: The study sample was predominantly male veterans enrolled from primary care who had chronic musculoskeletal pain and moderate levels of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Composite depression and anxiety scales are valid and responsive measures that may be useful as outcomes in research and clinical practice.

The effect of a six-week focused meditation training on depression and anxiety symptoms in Brazilian university students with 6 and 12 months of follow-up,"Background: Evidence shows high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among university students. This study investigated whether a meditation-based program would help reducing these symptoms in this population. Methods: Non-randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of a six-week focused meditation training on depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory) outcomes among university students. Participants were allocated into a meditation or waiting list control group. Assessment occurred pre and post intervention and only for the meditation group at 6 and 12 months follow-up. General linear model for repeated measures evaluated the intervention effect considering group and time factors, controlling for minor psychiatric disorders, gender and absence at meetings. Results: The meditation group presented a reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms after intervention compared to controls. Among the meditation group, depression (at 6 months follow-up) and anxiety (at 6 and 12 months follow-up) scores were lower for those who continued practicing. Limitations: Non-randomization and absence of daily practice record (precluding dose-response gradient evaluation). Conclusion: The meditation training was effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms, but the maintenance of these reductions only occurred for those who continued meditating. Permanent meditation programs may be an alternative for promoting mental health for university students.

Promoting the well-being of mothers with multidisciplinary psychosocial interventions in the perinatal period,"Background: Antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms are common and may persist over time after delivery, with negative consequences on the mothers and their children. Evidence on the efficacy of psychological and pharmacological interventions during pregnancy aimed at preventing post-partum depression is controversial. Methods: A consecutive sample of 318 women presenting for scheduled obstetric visits during pregnancy was screened for risk factors and anxiety or depressive symptoms. Based on the screening results, women were classified into three groups at increasing risk of post-partum depression (PPD) and were offered different interventions. Results: Depressive or anxiety symptoms were found in 91 (28.6%) women, 89 (28.0%) had low risk of PPD and 138 (43.4%) had no risk of PPD. The multidisciplinary psychosocial interventions offered to women with clinical symptoms were well accepted, with an uptake of 76/91 (83.5%). Thirty-three women who did not improve with psychotherapy were offered sertraline or paroxetine as a second-line treatment: 7 accepted and 26 (78.8%) refused. Eleven women already on medication at baseline continued their treatment along with the MPI. The MPI interventions had some positive effects in terms of post-partum recovery, symptom reduction, and in preventing a new onset of depression. Among the 227 non-symptomatic during pregnancy, only 5 (2.2%) developed symptoms in the post-partum period. At 12 months post-partum, 84.6% of women who were symptomatic at 2 months post-partum recovered. Limitations: Our results should be interpreted in light of important limitations, including the lack of a control group that was not offered the MPI, the lack of information on the reasons for refusal and discontinuation and on the number of psychotherapy sessions attended. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the potential usefulness of MPI in recognizing early signs or symptoms during pregnancy and the advantage of building specific interventions for preventing post-natal depression. The MPI has positive effects on women with depressive or anxiety symptoms during pregnancy, that however did not exceed significantly those observed in women who refused the intervention. Thus, in the absence of a control group, our results are preliminary and warrant confirmation and testing in future randomized clinical trials.

"Time perspective differences between depressed patients and non-depressed participants, and their relationships with depressive and anxiety symptoms","Background: Time perspective (TP) can be described as an individual's attitude towards his personal past, present and future. Literature suggests that it plays a role in several areas of psychological functioning (self-efficacy, coping) and impacts actual thoughts and behaviors. However, TP has seldom been studied in mental health, despite previous studies suggesting that the temporal profile is altered in depressed patients. This study investigates the differences of TP between depressed patients and non-depressed participants, and its relationship with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Methods: 45 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder were compared to 43 non-depressed participants recruited in the general population. Participants were asked to answer time perspective (ZTPI), depression (BDI- 13) and anxiety (STAI-Y) self-report inventories. Statistical analysis included comparisons of scores between depressed patients and non-depressed participants, correlation and regression analysis. Results: Results indicate that TP is significantly altered in depressed patients. They display a more negative view of their past, a less hedonistic perspective towards their present, and a more fatalistic perspective when compared to non-depressed participants. Regression analysis shows that depressive and anxiety symptoms are associated with negative past and fatalistic present , and similar results are found with correlation analysis. Limitations: The size of the sample was small, and longitudinal studies are needed to understand the dynamics and causal relationship between TP and depression. Conclusions: These results underline the importance of considering TP in depressed patients, and encourage an in depth study of the relationship between TP and mood disorders. Therapeutic perspectives are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2019
Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) in outpatients with anxiety and depressive disorders and their association with psychiatric and somatic comorbidity and revictimization. Cross-sectional observational study,"Background: This study aims to establish prevalence of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) and their association with somatic comorbidity and adult adverse events (AAE) in outpatients with anxiety or depressive disorders. Methods: Cross-sectional observational design. Specialty mental health outpatients classified with DSM-IV-TR anxiety or depressive disorder filled-out the ACE-IQ and the AAE-IQ. T-tests, ANOVA, logistic regressions and Chi-square analyses were performed and stratified for ACE score ≥ 4(high) versus ACE &lt; 4(low). Gender differences were explored. Results: From May 2015 -November 2016, in 298 consecutive patients 77.2% reported at least one ACE, 58.7% reported multiple ACE (mean 2.92). Scores were highest in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and in case of comorbid mental disorders. Somatic comorbidity was not associated with ACE-scores. AAE scores were significantly ( t = −9.33, p &lt; .001) higher in the high ACE-group ( M = 4.09 SD = 2.42) versus the low-ACE group ( M = 1.63 SD = 1.70), indicating general revictimization. An association between sexual ACE and sexual revictimization was found as well ( χ ² = 86.14, p &lt; .001).The effects did not differ for males and females. Conclusions: ACE and AAE are highly prevalent in depressive and anxiety disorders PTSD and psychiatric comorbidity are associated with higher scores, somatic comorbidity is not. Indications for general and sexual revictimization are shown. Further research is needed. Limitations: Selection bias may have influenced results on somatic comorbidity, as patients with obvious somatic comorbidity usually get referred to other health services. The generalisability of the results may be limited as non-Dutch speaking immigrants were excluded.

The association between an anxiety disorder and cancer in medical history,"Background: Cancer patients can feel depression and anxiety any time after a cancer diagnosis. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) is an instrument for the assessment of anxiety. The main objective of this work was to compare general anxiety levels between cancer survivors and individuals without a history of cancer in a population-based study (LIFE-ADULT) with 10,000 participants. Methods: All participants (18–80 years) completed the GAD-7 and other psychological and medical questionnaires. A score of 10 or greater for GAD-7 (of total 21) indicates a probable generalized anxiety disorder. Results: 954 participants reported a diagnosis of cancer in their medical history. In the multivariate analysis an anxiety disorder was associated with prior cancer diagnosis (OR: 1.8; 95% CI [1.4–2.4]), age -every additional year- (OR: 0.983; [0.976–0.991]), female gender (OR: 1.8; [1.5–2.2]) and low socioeconomic status (OR: 2.0; [1.7–2.5]) all p &lt; 0.001. There were no significant associations between general anxiety and other comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction (OR: 1.0; p = 0.948), stroke (OR: 1.4; p = 0.237) or diabetes (OR: 1.0; p = 0.326). There was also no significant difference in anxiety disorder among cancer survivors regarding the time passed since the initial cancer diagnosis (OR: 1.1; [0.6–1.9], p = 0.804 comparing 5–10 years after a diagnosis of cancer vs. ≤ 5 years and OR: 0.6; [0.4–1.1], p = 0.107 comparing &gt; 10 vs. ≤ 5 years). Limitations: This study has a cross-sectional character, therefore, causal conclusions cannot be drawn. Conclusion: Cancer survivors may require screening for anxiety disorders and long-term professional psychosocial support.

An evaluation of the impact of co-occurring anxiety and substance use disorder on bipolar disorder illness outcomes in STEP-BD,"Background: Anxiety disorder (AD) and substance use disorder (SUD) highly co-occur with bipolar disorder (BD). AD and/or SUD co-occurrence is associated with poorer clinical outcomes in BD. However, respective associations between AD and/or SUD diagnoses and BD outcomes require clarification. Baseline data from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) were therefore utilized to investigate independent and simultaneous contributions of ADs and SUDs on clinical variables in BD. Methods: Two latent factors, “pathological anxiety” and “substance use problems,” were derived from presence/absence of lifetime AD and SUD diagnoses. Latent dimensions’ associations with clinical variables, obtained from the Affective Disorders Evaluation, Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Range of Impaired Functioning, were estimated via structural equation modeling (SEM). Results: Modeled independently, pathological anxiety and substance use problems were significantly associated with several variables. Yet when modeled simultaneously, pathological anxiety's associations with functional impairment, past-year rapid cycling, and past-year %time spent anxious and depressed remained while most variables’ associations with substance use problems became non-significant. The only significant latent-factor interaction evidenced was for age of BD onset. Limitations: Analyses were limited to lifetime diagnoses and causality may not be inferred given cross-sectional data. Conclusions: ADs and SUDs impact on BD was mostly additive rather than synergistic. Findings highlight the potentially understated importance of treating inter-episodic anxiety in BD as it may exacerbate mood symptoms, increasing functional impairment and risk for subsequent mood episodes.

Neonatal isolation modulates glucocorticoid-receptor function and synaptic plasticity of hippocampal and amygdala neurons in a rat model of single prolonged stress,"Background: Early life and stressful experiences affect hippocampal and amygdala structure and function. They also increase the incidence of mental and nervous system disorders in adults. However, prospective studies have yet to show if early-life experiences affect the risk/severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: We applied neonatal isolation (NI) alone, single prolonged stress (SPS) alone and NI + SPS to rats. We evaluated anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory of behavior using open field, elevated plus maze, and Morris water maze tests. Then, we measured expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and synaptic-related proteins by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and western blotting in the hippocampus and amygdala. Results: NI + SPS exacerbated the increased anxiety levels and impaired spatial memory induced by NI alone or SPS alone. NI alone or SPS alone induced varying degrees of change in expression of GRs and synaptic proteins (synapsin I and postsynaptic density protein-95) in the hippocampus and amygdala. There were opposite changes in GR expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and basolateral amygdala. The degree of such change was exacerbated considerably by NI + SPS. In addition, neuroligin (NLG)-1 and NLG-2 were distributed in postsynaptic sites of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively. NI, SPS, and NI + SPS altered the patterns of NLG-1 and NLG-2 colocalization as well as their intensity. NI + SPS strengthened the increased ratio of NLG-1/NLG-2 in the hippocampus, but decreased this ratio in the amygdala. Conclusions: NI and SPS together induced greater degrees of change in anxiety and spatial memory, as well as GR and synaptic protein levels, in the hippocampus and amygdala than the changes induced by NI alone or SPS alone.

Response inhibition and anxiety in adolescents: Results from a population-based community sample,"Background: Anxiety disorders are prevalent among adolescents; however, without objective behavioral markers, anxiety disorders in adolescent populations may often go undiagnosed. Response inhibition is considered as a possible behavioral marker, based on the results with two-gate design, which can aid in early detection of anxiety disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between response inhibition and anxiety using a large-scale population-based adolescent sample with single-gate design. Methods: We used data from the Tokyo Teen Cohort study which was a population-based survey in adolescence. Anxiety was assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist answered by primary caregivers. Response inhibition was measured using the Go/No-Go task. We estimated Pearson's correlation coefficient to test the relationship between response inhibition and anxiety. Results: A total of 2,434 adolescents aged 11–13 years were included in our analyses. We found a significant but weak correlation between response inhibition and adolescent anxiety ( r = 0.07, confidence interval 0.03–0.11, p &lt; 0.001). Similar results were shown in most of subgroups according to gender, age, and intelligence. Limitations: The primary outcome was assessed only via parent-reported questionnaire, leading to potential informant bias. Conclusions: Response inhibition may not be considered as a suitable behavioral marker of adolescent anxiety.

Default mode network alterations in individuals with high-trait-anxiety: An EEG functional connectivity study,"Background: Although several researches investigated Default Mode Network (DMN) alterations in individuals with anxiety disorders, up to now no studies have investigated DMN functional connectivity in non-clinical individuals with high-trait-anxiety using quantitative electroencephalography (EEG). Here, the main aim was to extend previous findings investigating the association between trait anxiety and DMN EEG functional connectivity. Methods: Twenty-three individuals with high-trait-anxiety and twenty-four controls were enrolled. EEG was recorded during 5 min of resting state (RS). EEG analyses were conducted by means of the exact Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography software (eLORETA). Results: Compared to controls, individuals with high-trait-anxiety showed a decrease of theta connectivity between right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and right posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex. A decrease of beta connectivity was also observed between right mPFC and right anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, DMN functional connectivity strength was negatively related with STAI-T total score (i.e., lower connectivity was associated with higher trait anxiety), even when controlling for potential confounding variables (i.e., sex, age, and general psychopathology). Limitations: Small sample size makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Furthermore, we did not assess state variation of anxiety, which make our interpretation specific to trait anxiety. Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest that high-trait-anxiety individuals fail to synchronize DMN during RS, reflecting a possible top-down cognitive control deficit. These results may help in the understanding of the individual differences in functional brain networks associated with trait anxiety, a crucial aim in the prevention and in the early etiology understanding of clinical anxiety and related sequelae.

"Home-delivered attention bias modification training via smartphone to improve attention control in sub-clinical generalized anxiety disorder: A randomized, controlled multi-session experiment","Background: Mogg and Bradley (2016) proposed that attentional bias (to threat stimuli) among patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may be associated with the top-down attention control process. Additionally, some scholars (e.g., Enock &amp; McNally, 2013) have designed mobile applications to enable patients to engage in home-delivered attentional bias modification (HD-ABM); however, many problems related to these training systems have not yet been addressed. Method: A total of 82 participants (61 women, mean age = 21.47 y) who received GAD diagnoses were randomly assigned to an HD-ABM ( n = 30), placebo training ( n = 30), or waiting list ( n = 22) group. Both the HDABM and placebo groups were trained with the attention training application (through Android phones three times a day for four weeks). Results: (1) All measures of participants’ self-reported symptoms (except for trait anxiety) were significantly lower in Week 4 and in the follow-up. (2) Attentional network test (ANT) results demonstrated that all participants’ alerting scores significantly increased by Week 4. (3) Participants in the HD-ABM and placebo groups demonstrated significant increases in their self-reported attention control scores, decreases in their attention bias index (ABI) scores, and progress in their executive control abilities. Limitations: Self-report scales may have been insufficient for measuring effectiveness in the present study. Conclusions: This study helps to elucidate the mechanism underlying changes in attention processes after HDABM training implemented through a mobile application in GAD.

Screening for depressive and anxiety disorders among adolescents in Indonesia: Formal validation of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale,"Background: This study aimed to culturally verify and examine the empirical psychometric properties of the Indonesian versions of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CESD-R), the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-10 items (K10) and a subset of 6 items of the K10, the K6 to detect depressive and anxiety disorders among older adolescents in Indonesia. Methods: The empirical psychometric properties were examined formally among students aged 16–18 years attending high schools in Jakarta. The scales were validated against the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-Kid) modules for major depressive episode, dysthymia, panic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Results: In total, 196 students contributed complete data. All of the scales had Cronbach's alpha &gt; 0.8. The areas under the ROC Curve of CESD-R against MINI depressive disorders and K10/K6 against MINI depressive and anxiety disorders were at moderate to high accuracy levels (0.78 to 0.86). The optimal cut-off value of CESD-R (scores ranging: 0–60) to screen for any depressive disorder is ≥ 20 (sensitivity 75.0%; specificity 79.9%). The optimal cut-off value of K10 to detect any depressive/anxiety disorders is ≥ 18 (sensitivity 85.7%; specificity 74.7%); and K6 is ≥ 12 (sensitivity 81.0%; specificity 76.6%); Limitations: The school-based sample limits the generalisability of the findings to this group. Conclusions: This study suggests that the CESD-R I is a useful tool for screening for depressive disorders and both the K10 I and K6 I are useful for screening for any depressive or anxiety disorders among Indonesian adolescents.

Comorbid anxiety in bipolar CHOICE: Insights from the bipolar inventory of symptoms scale,"Background: Approximately 86–89% of patients with BD have a comorbid anxiety disorder associated with poor quality of life and reduced likelihood of recovery from an acute mood episode. The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence and impact of comorbid anxiety using the Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS) in patients with BD who participated in a 6-month pragmatic trial. Methods: Participants ( N = 482) in the Bipolar Clinical Health Outcomes Initiative in Comparative Effectiveness (CHOICE) study were adults with BD I or II. Anxiety diagnoses were assessed with the MINI. Global illness severity was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Version. Mood symptoms and anxiety severity were assessed using the BISS. Results: 61% of the study sample met criteria for a current anxiety disorder. Patients with a higher BISS anxiety score at baseline had a higher overall BD illness severity, depressive severity, and manic episode severity ( p &lt; 0.001). A single cutoff value of BISS anxiety had great sensitivity, yet poor specificity for determining a comorbid anxiety diagnosis. There were no significant differences in outcomes for individuals treated for anxiety disorders with anxiolytics compared with those who were not treated with anxiolytics. Limitations: Sample size limitations prevented an analysis of whether the BISS cutoff score of 10 performed differently across varied anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Given its ability to identify patients with co-occurring anxiety, the BISS anxiety subscale shows clinical utility as a screening measure though its application as a clinical assessment measure may not be advisable.

A randomised placebo controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of &lt;i&gt;Caralluma fimbriata&lt;/i&gt; supplement for reducing anxiety and stress in healthy adults over eight weeks,"Background: This study investigated the efficacy of a succulent, Caralluma fimbriata extract (CFE) in reducing anxiety and stress in healthy adults. Methods: An 8 week double-blind randomised clinical trial, in which 97 adults self-reporting mild to moderate anxiety were given 500 mg b.d. CFE ( n = 49), or 500 mg b.d. placebo ( n = 48). Anxiety and stress were measured at baseline, week 4, and week 8 to investigate the timing of treatment effect using the GAD-7, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and salivary cortisol. Data were analysed using mixed ANOVAs on SPSS v.24. Results: Results indicated a significant reduction in anxiety and stress in both groups at week 4 and week 8. The reduction in the CFE group was significantly greater ( p &lt; .05) than in the placebo group on the GAD-7 and PSS at week 4 and week 8, and in Negative affect at week 4. Improvement in Positive affect was greater in the CFE group than in the placebo group at week 8. Cortisol analysis indicated that CFE may act through the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, showing statistically significant changes in males, but not in females. Limitations: Self-reported instruments involve subjective interpretation thus salivary cortisol was employed as a more objective measure. The study would benefit from a larger sample and longer trial, and the inclusion of a wait-list group to allow comparison between treatment and no treatment. Conclusions: The findings indicate that CFE is superior to placebo in reducing subclinical anxiety and stress over 8 weeks.

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) accuracy for anxiety disorders detection in drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients,"Background: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) is the most prevalent type of surgically remediable epilepsy and highly associated with psychiatric comorbidities. This study aimed to evaluate Hospital anxiety and depression scale-anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory—Trait subscale (STAI-T) accuracy for detection of anxiety disorders in patients with drug-resistant MTLE-HS. Methods: One hundred three consecutive patients with drug-resistant MTLE-HS were enrolled. Diagnosis was based on the anamnesis, neurological examination, video-electroencephalogram (VEEG) analyses, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Psychiatric interviews were based on DSM-IV-TR criteria and ILAE Commission of Psychobiology classification as a gold standard; HADS-A and STAI-T were used as psychometric diagnostic tests, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the optimal threshold scores. Results: The areas under the curve (AUCs) were higher than 0.7 (0.6–0.8) for both scales. The STAI-T cutoff point of &gt;53 and the HADS-A cutoff point of &gt;7 showed both around of 80% (44.4–97.7) sensitivity and 80% (66.9–86.9) and 60% (46.5–68.6) of specificity, respectively. In this sample the prevalence of anxiety disorders was 11.7% and both scales showed a high negative predictive value such as 96% (87.1–99.0) but low positive predictive value such as 30% (22.1–45.2) and 20% (15.0–27.2) respectively. Limitations: The small number of cases in the diagnostic population; the results are only applied to drug resistant MTLE-HS; the psychiatric diagnosis were not based on a structured psychiatric interview; possible observer bias in 7 illiterate patients; the antidepressant treatment was not controlled. Conclusions: In MTLE-HS, STAI-T and HADS-A had a similar and low positive predictive value and high negative predictive value. The implications for the HADS-A and STAI-T usefulness for anxiety disorders screening in patients with other epilepsies types deserve further investigations. If replicated in other populations, these findings may have important relevance for the presurgical screening of anxiety disorders in MTLE-HS patients who are candidates to epilepsy surgery.

Dynamic functional abnormalities in generalized anxiety disorders and their increased network segregation of a hyperarousal brain state modulated by insomnia,"Background: Insomnia is frequently accompanied by the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) but mostly fMRI studies investigated their aberrant functional connectivity (FC) without this issue. Recently, dynamic FC approach is prevailing to capture the time-varying fluctuations of spontaneous brain activities. Nevertheless, it is unclear how the dynamic FC characteristics are altered by insomnia in GAD. Methods: We acquired resting state fMRI and neuropsychological tests for the 17 comorbid GAD with insomnia (GAD/IS), 15 GAD and 24 healthy controls (HC). Then, based on the sliding window correlations, we estimated distinct brain states and statistically compared their dynamic properties. Further combining with graph theory, their network properties of each state among groups were accessed. Lastly, we examined associations between abnormal parameters and neuropsychological tests. Results: We identified four brain states but did not observe significance on the state transitions. The mean dwell time and fraction of one globally hypoactive state accounted for high proportion of brain activities were significantly different (GAD &gt; HC &gt; GAD/IS). Meanwhile, we found gradual decreases in a brain state representing slight sleep/drowsiness (HC &gt; GAD/IS &gt; GAD). Additionally, we observed the GAD/IS patients had significantly increased network segregation and posterior cingulate cortex in a hyperarousal state, as well as significant associations with anxiety and insomnia severity. Limitations: The influences of depression on dynamic FC properties in GAD are unclear yet and more subjects should be recruited. Conclusions: These results provide new insights about the temporal features in GAD and offer potential biomarkers to evaluate the impacts of insomnia.

The effectiveness of four empirically supported psychotherapies for primary care depression and anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Depressive and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and detrimental in primary care settings. However, there are gaps in the literature concerning effectiveness and generalizability of empirically supported interventions and treatment of both depression and anxiety in primary care settings. The aim of this review is to systematically assess and meta-analyze the effectiveness of brief empirically-supported psychotherapies for treating depression and/or anxiety in primary care. Methods: Seven electronic databases, five professional websites and manual search of reference lists were searched through April 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of four psychotherapies treating primary care depression and anxiety: cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), problem-solving therapy (PST), motivational interviewing (MI), and solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT). Results: From an initial pool of 1140 articles, 179 articles were eligible for full-text review and 65 articles were included for final analysis. Sixty-five articles containing 198 effect sizes reported an overall treatment effect size of d = 0.462, p &lt; 0.001. Single-predictor meta-regression indicated that marital status, treatment modality (individual versus group), and treatment composition were significant moderators. Multiple-predictor meta-regression discovered treatment setting (inside versus outside primary care) significantly moderated treatment effect, b = −0.863, p = 0.039 after controlling for other intervention characteristics. Conclusion: Treatment effects were found for CBT and PST, both for depressive and anxiety disorders. Interventions delivered outside primary care settings were more effective than those within, individual treatment had greater treatment effects compared to group treatment, and both technology-assisted and in-person treatments were found to be effective.

"Prospective associations of androgens and sex hormone-binding globulin with 12-month, lifetime and incident anxiety and depressive disorders in men and women from the general population","Background: Findings on associations of androgens and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) with anxiety and depressive disorders in the general population remain inconclusive. Methods: We used data of n = 993 men and n = 980 women from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP, a prospective-longitudinal general population study from northeastern Germany). Immunoassay-measured serum concentrations of total testosterone, androstenedione and SHBG were assessed when participants were aged 20–80. 12-month, lifetime and incident DSM-IV anxiety and depressive disorders were assessed with the DIA-X/M-CIDI at 10-year follow-up, when participants were aged 29–89. Logistic regressions were adjusted for age, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, waist circumference, hypertension and oral contraceptive use (women only) at baseline and follow-up interval. Results: In men and women, androgens and SHBG were not associated significantly with incident anxiety and depressive disorders. In men, higher total testosterone predicted any 12-month (OR = 1.46) and lifetime (OR = 1.34) anxiety disorder, lifetime social phobia (OR = 2.15), and 12-month (OR = 1.48) and lifetime (OR = 1.39) specific phobia, but neither 12-month nor lifetime depression. Moreover, androstenedione in men interacted with age in predicting lifetime anxiety disorders (OR = 0.98): Higher androstenedione more strongly predicted lifetime anxiety in younger vs. older men. These findings, however, did not survive correction for multiple testing. In women, androgens and SHBG were not associated significantly with 12-month and lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders. Limitations: The follow-up period was relatively long and other factors might have affected the examined associations. Conclusions: Higher serum total testosterone in men and androstenedione in younger men may relate to an increased risk of anxiety disorders.

The relationship of anxious and depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease with voxel-based neuroanatomical and functional connectivity measures,"Background: Anxiety and depression are two frequent comorbidities of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying neural mechanism is still unclear and the studies on their neural correlates were insufficient. Methods: Using voxel-based neuroanatomical and functional connectivity (FC) measures, i.e. grey matter volume, fractional anisotropy, and weighted degree centrality (WD), we examined their correlations with the severity levels of anxious and depressive symptoms in 36 PD patients. Results: Positive correlations were shown between anxiety and the WDs in the left amygdala, and between depression and short-ranged WDs in the left parahippocampal gyrus. Using these two regions as the seeds, we found that the severity levels of anxiety and depression were positively correlated with the FCs between the two seeds and the areas in the default mode network (DMN), while negatively correlated with the FCs between the two seeds and the prefrontal and superior temporal cortices. Anxiety was also positively correlated with the FC between the amygdala and the superior parietal lobule. Limitations: The severity levels of anxious and depressive symptoms of our participants is relatively mild than some previous studies. The cross-sectional design of this study cannot clarify the etiological relationship between PD and two comorbidities. Conclusions: Our results were in line with the key roles of the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus in anxiety and depression, and reflected the distinct effects of the DMN, prefrontal and superior temporal cortices, and sensory-motor regions on emotional regulation. The identification of these neural substrates might assist clinical monitoring mood disturbances in PD.

Association of generalized anxiety symptoms and panic with health care costs in older age—Results from the ESTHER cohort study,"Background: Little is known specifically about the association between generalized anxiety symptoms or panic and health care costs in older age. The aim of this study was to examine the association between generalized anxiety symptoms, panic and health care costs in people aged 65 and over. Methods: Cross-sectional data from the 8-year follow-up of a large, prospective cohort study, the ESTHER study, was used. Individuals aged 65 and over, who participated in the study's home assessment, were included in this analysis ( n = 2348). Total and sectoral costs were analyzed as a function of either anxiety symptoms, probable panic disorder, or a panic attack, while controlling for selected covariates, using Two Part and Generalized Linear Models. Covariates were chosen based on Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Care Use. Results: There was no significant association between either of the anxiety or panic measures and total health care costs. Stratified by health care sectors, only the occurrence of a panic attack was significantly associated with incurring costs for outpatient non-physician services (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.15–3.45) and inpatient services (OR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.07–4.28). Other illness-related factors, such as comorbidities and depressive symptoms, were associated with health care costs in several models. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study relying on self-reported data. Conclusion: This study points to an association between a panic attack and sector-specific health care costs in people aged 65 and over. Further research, especially using longitudinal data, is needed.

The efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy in somatoform disorders and medically unexplained physical symptoms: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Background: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to update and give an overview of the evidence from published literature that focused on the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in the management of somatoform disorders and medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). Methods: A comprehensive literature search was carried out through an electronic search of various databases on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Primary outcome was the severity of somatic symptoms. Secondary outcomes were also measured based on severity of anxiety symptoms, severity of depressive symptoms, social functioning, physical functioning, doctor visits and the compliance with CBT, as well as follow-up visits. Effects were summarized by a random effects model using mean differences or odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 15 RCTs comprising 1671 patients with somatoform disorders or MUPS were enrolled in our systematic review and meta-analysis. The main analysis revealed that CBT could alleviate somatic symptoms: −1.31 (95% CI: −2.23 to −0.39, p = 0.005); anxiety symptoms: -1.89 (95% CI: −2.91 to −0.86; p &lt; 0.001); depressive symptoms: −1.93 (95% CI: −3.56 to −0.31; p = 0.020); improve physical functioning: 4.19 (95% CI: 1.90 to 6.49; p &lt; 0.001). The efficacy of CBT on alleviating somatic symptoms, anxiety and depressive symptoms were sustained on follow-up. CBT may not be effective in reducing the number of doctor visits: −1.23 (95% CI: −2.97 to 0.51; p = 0.166); and improving social functioning: 3.27 (95% CI: −0.08 to 6.63; p = 0.056). The results of subgroup analysis indicated that CBT was particularly beneficial when the duration of session was more than 50 min to reduce the severity of somatic symptoms from pre to post treatment time, when it was group based and applied affective and developed good interpersonal strategy during the treatment. Longer duration and frequency such as more than 10 sessions and 12 weeks treatments had significant effect on reduction of the comorbid symptoms including depression and anxiety, but they may underpin low level of compliance of CBT based treatments. Conclusions: CBT is effective for the treatment of somatoform disorders and MUPS by reducing physical symptoms, psychological distress and disability.

Effect of &lt;i&gt;bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;breve&lt;/i&gt; A-1 on anxiety and depressive symptoms in schizophrenia: A proof-of-concept study,"Background: Studies of probiotics have suggested they have a positive effect on anxiety and depressive symptoms in humans. This study investigated the effect of consuming the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve A-1 on anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and explored its effect on immune products such as cytokines and chemokines. Methods: In this open-label single-arm study, all participants received B. breve strain A-1 (10¹¹ cfu/day) for 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks of observation. The primary outcome was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score. Secondary outcomes were anxiety and depressive symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), blood test findings, and fecal microbiome composition. Results: Twenty-nine outpatients completed the study. HADS total score and PANSS anxiety/depression score were significantly improved at 4 weeks. Based on the criterion of a greater than 25% reduction in HADS total score at 4 weeks from baseline, there were 12 responders and 17 non-responders. Responders were found to have fewer negative symptoms, reduced intake of dairy products, and higher relative abundance of Parabacteroides in the gut microbiome than non-responders. Moreover, IL-22 and TRANCE expression was significantly increased at 4 weeks from baseline in responders but not in non-responders. Limitations: This open-label, single-arm study cannot exclude a placebo effect. Conclusions: The results suggest the potential effect of B. breve A-1 in improving anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Further studies should investigate this effect in patients with other psychiatric conditions and assess dietary habits and the gut microbiome.

Are children with social anxiety disorder more likely than children with other anxiety disorders to anticipate poor social performance and reflect negatively on their performance?,"Background: The cognitive theory of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggests that adults with SAD have a tendency to anticipate poor social performance and reflect negatively on their performance following a social event. While a number of studies with socially anxious adults have supported the role of poor performance anticipation and post-event rumination in SAD, to date, only a few studies have addressed whether this also applies to children with SAD. Methods: Children (7–12 years) diagnosed with SAD ( n = 40), other anxious children ( n = 40) and non-anxious children ( n = 34) were exposed to a social stressor speech task and their pre- and post-performance appraisals assessed, taking into account objective performance ratings. Results: Although observers rated some aspects of performance as significantly worse among children with SAD than children with other anxiety disorders, children with SAD were not more likely than their anxious or non-anxious peers to show a general bias in pre- or post-performance appraisals. Furthermore, children with SAD were just as likely as their anxious and non-anxious peers to recognize good performance but were more critical of themselves when their performance was poor. Limitations: The speech task did not involve a same-age peer. Participants were relatively affluent group of predominantly non-minority status. Specificity for SAD in relation to other anxiety disorders remains unclear. Conclusions: Focusing on counteracting pre- and post-event social performance appraisals may potentially be inappropriate for childhood SAD. Children with SAD might benefit from interventions that focus on helping them to become less critical of themselves after social interactions have not gone well.

Diagnostic consequences of a new category of anxious depression and a reduced duration requirement for anxiety symptoms in the ICD-11 PHC,"Background: A new diagnosis of anxious depression (AD), characterized by both depressive and anxious symptoms at case level, has been proposed for the classification of mental disorders for primary care for ICD-11 (ICD-11 PHC). The ICD-11 PHC proposes a duration requirement for anxiety symptoms of 2 weeks, in line with the requirement for depressive symptoms. This study examined diagnostic assignment under ICD-11 PHC as compared to the previous classification, the ICD-10 PHC, and the relationship of anxiety duration to disability and suicidal ideation. Methods: Primary care physicians in five countries referred patients based on either perceived psychological distress or distressing somatic symptoms to a research assistant who administered a computer-guided diagnostic interview. Complete data were obtained for 2279 participants. Results: Under ICD-11 PHC 47.7% participants received a diagnosis of AD and had greater disability than other diagnostic groups. Under ICD-10 PHC, in addition to meeting requirements for depressive episode, most of these patients met requirements for either generalized anxiety disorder (41.5%) or mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (45.4%). One third of individuals diagnosed with AD had anxiety durations between 2 weeks and 3 months and presented as much disability and suicidal ideation as individuals with longer anxiety durations. Limitations: The study was not designed to establish prevalence of these conditions. Conclusion: The proposed ICD-11 PHC encourages early identification and management of significant anxiety symptoms in primary care, particularly when these co-occur with depression. This study provides support for the clinical relevance of these symptoms and the importance of early identification.

"The relationships between health anxiety, online health information seeking, and cyberchondria: Systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Cyberchondria refers to an abnormal behavioral pattern in which excessive or repeated online searches for health-related information are distressing or anxiety-provoking. Health anxiety has been found to be associated with both online health information seeking and cyberchondria. The aims of the present systematic review and meta-analysis were to examine the magnitude of these associations and identify any moderator variables. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed across several databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase) and reference lists of included studies. Results: Twenty studies were included across two independent meta-analyses, with 7373 participants. Random effects meta-analyses showed that there was a positive correlation between health anxiety and online health information seeking [ r = 0.34, 95% CI (0.20, 0.48), p &lt; .0001], and between health anxiety and cyberchondria [ r = 0.62, 95% CI (0.52, 0.71), p &lt; .0001]. A meta-regression indicated that the age of study participants [ Q (1) = 4.58, p = .03] was partly responsible for the heterogeneity found for the relationship between health anxiety and cyberchondria. Limitations: The generalizability and validity of our findings are restricted by the methodological limitations of the primary studies, namely, an over-reliance on a single measure of cyberchondria, the Cyberchondria Severity Scale. Conclusions: Our review found a positive correlation between health anxiety and online health information seeking, and between health anxiety and cyberchondria. Further research should aim to explore the contexts for these associations as well as address the identified limitations of the extant literature.

Concordance of genetic variation that increases risk for anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorders and that influences their underlying neurocircuitry,"Background: There have been considerable recent advances in understanding the genetic architecture of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as the underlying neurocircuitry of these disorders. However, there is little work on the concordance of genetic variations that increase risk for these conditions, and that influence subcortical brain structures. We undertook a genome-wide investigation of the overlap between the genetic influences from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on volumes of subcortical brain structures and genetic risk for anxiety disorders and PTSD. Method: We obtained summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of anxiety disorders (N cases = 7016, N controls = 14,745), PTSD (European sample; N cases = 2424, N controls = 7113) and of subcortical brain structures (N = 13,171). SNP Effect Concordance Analysis (SECA) and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Score Regression were used to examine genetic pleiotropy, concordance, and genome-wide correlations respectively. SECAs conditional false discovery was used to identify specific risk variants associated with anxiety disorders or PTSD when conditioning on brain related traits. Results: For anxiety disorders, we found evidence of significant concordance between increased anxiety risk variants and variants associated with smaller amygdala volume. Further, by conditioning on brain volume GWAS, we identified novel variants that associate with smaller brain volumes and increase risk for disorders: rs56242606 was found to increase risk for anxiety disorders, while two variants (rs6470292 and rs683250) increase risk for PTSD, when conditioning on the GWAS of putamen volume. Limitations: Despite using the largest available GWAS summary statistics, the analyses were limited by sample size. Conclusions: These preliminary data indicate that there is genome wide concordance between genetic risk factors for anxiety disorders and those for smaller amygdala volume, which is consistent with research that supports the involvement of the amygdala in anxiety disorders. It is notable that a genetic variant that contributes to both reduced putamen volume and PTSD plays a key role in the glutamatergic system. Further work with GWAS summary statistics from larger samples, and a more extensive look at the genetics underlying brain circuits, is needed to fully delineate the genetic architecture of these disorders and their underlying neurocircuitry.

Acute effects of aerobic exercise on negative affect and obsessions and compulsions in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background: The acute effects of aerobic exercise on improved mood and anxiety reduction have been demonstrated across clinical and nonclinical populations. Limited work has evaluated the acute effects of aerobic exercise on negative affect, obsessions, and compulsions in patients with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Method: Fifty-five patients (64% female) with treatment-resistant OCD were randomized to either 12 weeks of aerobic exercise (AE) or health education contact (HEC) control. Participants rated negative affect (i.e., mood and anxiety), obsessions and compulsions before and after each weekly AE or HEC session. Multilevel models were constructed to evaluate the effect of intervention condition, treatment week (time), and their interaction in terms of acute change in affect, obsession, and compulsions. Results: Results reflected a main effect of condition, such that AE resulted in significantly larger increases in positive mood, and reductions in anxiety and compulsions, as compared to HEC. There was also a main effect of time in predicting acute anxiety reduction, such that linear reductions in anxiety over the course of treatment were observed. No significant effects were observed for acute changes in obsessions. Limitations: The sample was small and was limited in demographic heterogeneity. Bouts of aerobic exercise were not standardized in terms of duration and mode, which could impact affective response to exercise, and acute affective OCD effects were exclusively self-reported. Discussion: The current findings may help elucidate potential mechanisms of action of exercise on OCD outcomes. In addition, these results point toward the potential of designing exercise interventions that can teach patients to utilize individual bouts of physical activity, “in-the-moment” to improve mood and reduce anxiety and compulsions.

The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of e-health interventions for depression and anxiety in primary care: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Purpose: Psychological interventions are labor-intensive and expensive, but e-health interventions may support them in primary care. In this study, we systematically reviewed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of e-health interventions for depressive and anxiety symptoms and disorders in primary care. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane library, Embase, and PsychINFO until January 2018, for randomized controlled trials of e-health interventions for depression or anxiety in primary care. Two reviewers independently screened the identified publications, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Results: Out of 3617 publications, we included 14 that compared 33 treatments in 4183 participants. Overall, the methodological quality was poor to fair. The pooled effect size of e-health interventions was small (standardized mean difference = −0.19, 95%CI −0.31 to −0.06) for depression compared to control groups in the short-term, but this was maintained in the long-term (standardized mean difference = −0.22, 95%CI −0.35 to −0.09). Further analysis showed that e-health for depression had a small effect compared to care as usual and a moderate effect compared to waiting lists. One trial on anxiety showed no significant results. Four trials reported on cost-effectiveness. Limitations: The trials studied different types of e-health interventions and had several risks of bias. Moreover, only one study was included for anxiety. Conclusions: E-health interventions for depression have a small effect in primary care, with a moderate effect compared to waiting lists. The approach also appeared to be cost-effective for depression. However, we found no evidence for its effectiveness for anxiety.

"Comparing factor structures of depressed patients with and without suicidal ideation, a measurement invariance analysis","Background: Suicidality could be associated with specific combinations of biological, social and psychological factors. Therefore, depressive episodes with suicidal ideation could be different from depressive episodes without suicidal ideation in terms of latent variable structures. Methods: In this study we compared latent variable structures between suicidal and non-suicidal depressed patients using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), following a measurement invariance test procedure. Patients ( N = 919) suffering from major depressive disorder were selected from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) and split into a group that showed no symptoms of suicidal ideation (non-SI; N = 691) and a suicidal ideation (SI) group that had one or more symptoms of suicidal ideation ( N = 228). Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured using the short form of the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (MASQ-D30). Results: CFA implied a difference in latent variable structures between the non-SI sample (CFI 0.957; RMSEA 0.041) and the SI sample (CFI 0.900; RMSEA 0.056). Subsequent multiple-group CFA showed violations of measurement invariance. The General distress and Anhedonic depression subscales were best indicated by hopelessness and lack of optimism in the SI sample and by dissatisfaction and not feeling lively in the non-SI sample. Overall, the SI sample had higher scores and lower inter-item correlations on the Anhedonic depression items. Limitations: We have included very mild cases of suicidal ideation in our SI sample. Conclusions: On a latent variable level, depression with suicidal ideation differs from depression without suicidal ideation. Results encourage further research into the symptom structure of depression among suicidal patients.

Negative peer social interactions and oxytocin levels linked to suicidal ideation in anxious youth,"Background: Anxious youth are at risk for negative peer interactions including peer victimization, and for suicidal ideation. However, data about the pattern of association between these two factors are scarce. In this study we examined the association between negative peer interactions and suicidal ideation in a sample of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders, and whether oxytocin, which has been shown to enhance the impact of social events, moderates the impact of negative peer interactions on suicidal ideation. Method: Participants were 168 youths with primary anxiety disorders. All participants were assessed with semi-structured diagnostic interviews, and with self-report measures of suicidal ideation, negative peer interactions, anxiety, and depression. The anxious youths’ salivary oxytocin levels were measured with immunoassay. Results: Thirty percent of the anxious youths reported suicidal ideation, with suicidal ideation severity associated with negative peer social interactions and depressive symptoms. Consistent with past data indicating that oxytocin enhances the impact of social events, the association between peer negative social interactions and suicidal ideation was stronger in youths with high oxytocin levels than in youths with low levels (i.e., moderation). Limitations: Assessment focused on suicidal ideation and data on suicidal behavior were not available. Limitations inherent to immunoassay measurement of peripheral oxytocin levels are noted. Conclusion: Negative peer interactions are associated with suicidal ideation in youth with anxiety disorders, and the association is stronger in youth with high oxytocin levels.

The effect of complementary medicines and therapies on maternal anxiety and depression in pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Depression and anxiety are common during the antenatal and postnatal period, and are known to have a significant impact on the woman and her unborn infant. Pregnant women state a preference for non-pharmacological treatment options, and use complementary medicines and therapies to manage these symptoms. We examined the effectiveness and safety of these modalities on depression and anxiety during pregnancy. Methods: CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed databases were searched for randomised controlled trials comparing complementary therapies and medicines to a control, for pregnant women with depression or anxiety. The primary outcome measure was antenatal depression or anxiety. Results: Twenty randomised controlled trials containing 1092 women were included in the review. We found some evidence of reduced antenatal depression from three modalities. Acupuncture reduced the number of women diagnosed with antenatal depression (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.06–2.66, 1 trial). Massage reduced the severity of antenatal depression in one trial of 149 women (SMD −0.73, 95%CI −1.07–−0.39). One small trial of bright light therapy found reduced antenatal depression (RR 4.80, 95% CI −8.39–−1.21, 27 women). There was no evidence of a reduction in depression and anxiety from relaxation, yoga, mindfulness and fish oils. Overall the risk of bias was high or unclear for the majority of studies. Limitations: There are few high quality randomised controlled trials of complementary medicines and therapies examining the effect on anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Acupuncture, bright light therapy, and massage may reduce antenatal depression. There is a need for high quality and larger studies that include postnatal follow up and maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Anxiety and anhedonia in depression: Associations with neuroticism and cognitive control,"Background: Despite the fact that higher levels of anxiety and anhedonia in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are linked to poorer treatment outcomes, mechanisms contributing to these clinical presentations remain unclear. Neuroticism, impaired cognitive control, and blunted reward learning may be critical processes involved in MDD and may help to explain symptoms of anxiety and anhedonia. Methods: Using baseline data from patients with early-onset MDD ( N = 296) in the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) trial, we conducted a path analysis to model relationships between neuroticism, cognitive control, and reward learning to levels of anxiety and anhedonia. Results: Neuroticism was positively associated with both anhedonia (standardized coefficient = 0.26, p &lt; .001) and anxiety (standardized coefficient = 0.40, p &lt; .001). Cognitive control was negatively associated with anxiety (standardized coefficient = -0.18, p &lt; .05). Reward learning was not significantly associated with either anxiety or anhedonia. Limitations: Extraneous variables not included in the model may have even more influence in explaining symptoms of anxiety and anhedonia. Restricted range in these variables may have attenuated some of the hypothesized relationships. Most important, because this was a cross-sectional analysis in a currently depressed sample, we cannot draw any causal conclusions without experimental and longitudinal data. Conclusions: These cross-sectional findings suggest that neuroticism may contribute to anxiety and anhedonia in patients with early onset and either chronic or recurrent MDD, while enhanced cognitive control may protect against anxiety.

"The synergic relationship of social anxiety, depressive symptoms and waist circumference in adolescents: Mediation analysis","Background: It is not well established whether depression leads to weight loss or weight gain, or whether a relationship exists among depression, social anxiety, and weight status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the synergic association among social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and waist circumference (WC) during adolescence and examine whether depression mediated the relationship between social anxiety and WC. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed with 1296 adolescents from a northeastern district in Brazil. It was used the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A) to evaluate symptoms of social anxiety and the Depression Scale of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES-D) for symptoms of depression. Structural equation modeling was used to determine whether depression, social anxiety, and WC were synergically associated. Analysis was adjusted for sex, age, height, and mother's educational level. Results: Symptoms of social anxiety were directly associated with symptoms of depression and WC, whereas symptoms of depression were not associated with WC. Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study, and so we cannot infer causality in the interpretation of results. Conclusion: Social anxiety was found to be associated with depressive symptoms and WC. General medical doctors and health practitioners who observe overweight adolescents with any symptoms of anxiety might consider a thorough evaluation of the patient's mental health.

Validation of the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scales (RCADS) and RCADS short forms adapted for adults,"Background: The life span nature of anxiety and depression has led to an interest in whether assessments designed for use with children and young people are also valid for adults. The Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scales (RCADS) is a commonly used measure and we aimed to explore its structural validity in adults. Methods: We examined the factorial validity of the original and two short form versions of the (RCADS) adapted for adults, using confirmatory factor analysis with a convenience sample ( n = 371) aged 18–67. Results: All versions of the RCADS were found to provide reliable measures of general anxiety and depression in adults and of most subdimensions of anxiety corresponding to the original version of the RCADS. However, anxiety subdimension reliability was primarily driven by the strong general anxiety dimension, due to the high comorbidity between anxiety subtypes. Limitations: We did not include data for children as well as adults in our analyses and small changes were made to the wording of five RCADS items to make them appropriate for adults. Conclusions: Results suggest that all versions could be helpful for longitudinal and comparative research and evaluation of clinical outcomes, in situations where the focus is on general anxiety and depression, rather than clinical subtypes.

Prevalence of common mental disorders in widowhood: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Widowed people have a high risk of common mental disorders, however no summary estimates of the prevalences exist. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of common mental disorders in widowed people in the community. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase and PsycInfo were searched for papers reporting on prevalence of common mental disorders and widowhood. Eligible studies were included in random effects meta-analyses of the prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders. Subgroup analyses were performed on method of assessment of depression and age and sex. Results: The literature search identified 13,781 titles of which 42 were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of depression in studies using a screening scale was 40.6% (33.6%–47.6%) ( n = 30). For studies using full diagnostic criteria the pooled prevalence of depression was 19.2% (13.4%–25.0%) ( n = 12). Subgroup analyses of age (≥ or &lt; 65) and sex did not show any differences regarding depression. Five studies reported the prevalence of anxiety disorders. The pooled prevalence estimate was 26.9% (8.1%–45.7%). Limitations: The prevalence estimates in this study are summary estimates of prevalences from existing literature. Although the reporting bias assessment showed no evidence, there could be some reporting bias, as studies might only present results if there is a high prevalence. Conclusions: Widowed people have a high prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders. The high prevalence of depression was independent of age and sex. The study identifies a population group at high risk needing special attention in clinical practice.

Correlation between depression/anxiety symptom severity and quality of life in patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder,"Objective: To study the correlation between depression/anxiety severity and the quality of life (QOL) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BP). Methods: Two hundred forty-three outpatients diagnosed with MDD or BP were used to study the relationship between depression/anxiety severity and QOL. Depression and anxiety symptom-severity were measured with the QIDS-16-SR (the 16 Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology —Self Report), and Zung-SAS (Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale). The QOL was measured with the Q-LES-Q short-form (the Quality of Life, Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire). Correlation was assessed with regression analysis. Results: The percentage of maximum possible scores (MPS) of Q-LES-Q was 72.1%, 70.5%, and 67.6% for euthymic MDD, BPI, and BPII, respectively. Increases in QIDS-16-SR total scores significantly correlated to decreases in Q-LES-Q total scores, with an R ² = 0.61, R ² = 0.52, and R ² = 0.45 for MDD, BPI, and BPII, respectively. Increases in Zung-SAS scores also significantly correlated to decreases in Q-LES-Q total scores with an R ² = 0.20, R ² = 0.21, and R ² = 0.12 for MDD, BPI, and BPII. However, after controlling for depression severity, significant differences between Q-LES-Q and Zung-SAS scores disappeared in MDD and BP. After controlling for anxiety and other clinical variables, the negative correlation between QIDS-16-SR and Q-LES-Q scores remained significant in MDD and BP. Conclusions: In this outpatient sample, the MPS of Q-LES-Q in euthymic MDD and BP patients was at the lower end of non-psychiatric or medical community norm spectrum. Depression severity was the only independent variable negatively correlated to the QOL in both disorders.

Relations between trait anxiety and depression: A mediated moderation model,"Background: This study proposed a mediated moderation model based on the cognitive theory and susceptibility phenotype theory for depression to explore the moderating role of cognitive flexibility in the relationship between trait anxiety and depression and the mediating role of rumination in this interactive effect. Methods: The subjects were selected via the cluster sampling method. A cross-sectional survey of 1619 Chinese adults of Han nationality was recruited from three cities in central and western China. The trait anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Trait scale), Short Ruminative Response Scale (SRRS), Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) were used for a paper-and-pencil evaluation. The data were statistically processed using correlation analysis, multiple linear regression analysis, and a test of mediated moderation. Results: (1) Trait anxiety was significantly positively correlated with rumination and depression. There was a significant negative correlation between cognitive flexibility and trait anxiety, rumination, and depression. (2) The moderating effect of cognition flexibility on the relationship between trait anxiety and depression was mediated by rumination, and the indirect moderating effect accounted for 79.25% of the total variance. Limitations: Cross-sectional studies do not reveal the causal relationships between observed variables well. Self-report questionnaires lack objective indicators. The applicability of the current results in the clinical depression population requires further experimental tests. Conclusions: The results support the important role of trait anxiety in the development of depression. Cognitive flexibility moderates the relationship between trait anxiety and depression and has a risk-buffering effect on this relationship. Rumination plays a mediating role in the moderating effects of cognitive flexibility on the relationship between trait anxiety and depression. The findings enrich the research on the relationship between trait anxiety and depression and have important practical implications for the early prevention and intervention of depression, which can increase individual cognitive flexibility and address rumination to regulate depression.

Imagery-based treatment for test anxiety: A multiple-baseline open trial,"Background: Many students are affected by test anxiety (TA), which involves considerable distress and can lead to reduced performance. Despite its prevalence, TA has been under-studied; specifically, few effective and brief interventions have been identified to date. In our work, we explore the adaptation of imagery, an emotion-focused treatment technique used widely in the treatment of other anxiety disorders, for addressing TA. Methods: In a two-site concurrent multiple-baseline pilot study ( n = 31), we examined the effectiveness of a targeted six-session protocol developed for the treatment of TA, which integrates traditional cognitive behavioral techniques with imagery work. Results: The protocol was well-accepted by clients. We found that students’ test anxiety levels did not drop between the recruitment and pre-intervention assessments, but did drop significantly from recruitment or baseline to the delayed follow-up (Cohen's d = 0.75 and 0.84, respectively). We also found evidence for session-level processes tying the quality of the imagery work with session efficacy. Limitations: The study involved a relatively small sample size, leading to weaker power to detect treatment effects. Moreover, some clients did not have any exams scheduled before the delayed follow-up assessment. Due to the scheduling intensity of the sessions, some clients had insufficient time to implement or practice skills and to complete tasks discussed in the sessions. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for the utility of integrating imagery work with traditional cognitive-behavioral techniques for treating test anxiety.

"The moderating role of social support for marital adjustment, depression, anxiety, and stress: Evidence from Pakistani working and nonworking women","Background: This study examined how social support moderates the prolongation of mental distress related to depression, anxiety, stress, and marital adjustment in working and nonworking women. The study aimed to reveal the relationship between social support and mental health issues associated with depression, anxiety, stress, and marital adjustment among females. Methods: This research study is among the few studies performed in a Pakistani context and was conducted in 2017 to measure affective disorders among nonworking and working married females. Questionnaires were distributed among 500 targeted women, and valid responses were received from married working women in hospitals, banks, and multinational companies, and married nonworking women from residential areas of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Pakistan. A cross-sectional design with purposive sampling was adapted for this research, and three scales were used to measure stress, anxiety, depression, social support, and marital adjustment and its social and cultural implications among the sampled population. Results: Social support was positively and significantly associated with marital adjustment, although it showed a negative association with anxiety, depression, and stress in working and nonworking women; this finding reflects the better mental health of the study population. The findings proved that marital adjustment has a negative relation with depression and anxiety in married working and nonworking females. Social support acts as a moderator for marital cohesion, affection, stress, and depression, and the results reflected that nonworking women with higher marital cohesion and affection showed less stress and depression because of social support. Limitations: The findings of this sample cannot be generalized to the whole population as they are specific to the targeted respondents only. Conclusion: The study revealed that women's mental health is affected by psychological distress caused by depression, anxiety, stress, social and cultural norms, and their implications. Lower stress and depression lead to better mental health as ostensive social support may help to explain the relationship between depression, anxiety, and stress.

"Persistent depressive disorder has long-term negative impacts on depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms at 10-year follow-up among patients with major depressive disorder","Objective: The study aimed to investigate the impacts of persistent depressive disorder (PDD) and pharmacotherapy on depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) over a ten-year period. Methods: 290 outpatients with MDD were enrolled, including 117 with PDD, at baseline. Subjects were followed-up at six-month, two-year, and 10-year points. MDD and dysthymic disorder were diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale were used. Generalized Estimating Equation models were used to investigate the impacts. Results: MDD patients with PDD had greater severities of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms at the three follow-up points as compared with those without; however, these results were of statistical significance only in patients without pharmacotherapy. MDD patients with PDD had a longer duration of pharmacotherapy and a lower remission rate as compared with those without. After controlling for depression and anxiety at baseline, PDD was independently associated with more severe depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. Limitation: At the ten-year follow-up, approximately half of the subjects were lost to follow-up; this, in addition to the unequal follow-up intervals, might have caused bias. Conclusions: Among the patients, PDD continued to have negative impacts on depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms over the subsequent ten years. Differences in symptomatology between the patients with and without PDD were statistically insignificant when pharmacotherapy was utilized; however, pharmacotherapy did not fully compensate for the negative impacts of PDD.

Insomnia predicts increased perceived burdensomeness and decreased desire for emotional support following an in-laboratory social exclusion paradigm,"Background: Research suggests that insomnia is associated with elevated perceptions of loneliness and social disconnection; however, few quasi-experimental studies have tested the relationship between these constructs. This study examined whether insomnia symptom severity predicts changes in perceptions of interpersonal connectedness and desire for emotional support following in-laboratory participation in a social exclusion paradigm. Methods: Young adults ( N = 70) completed self-report measures assessing constructs of interest before and after engaging in a social exclusion paradigm (Cyberball). Linear regression analyses were used to evaluate whether baseline insomnia symptom severity predicted perceived burdensomeness, desire for emotional support, and thwarted belongingness after playing Cyberball; analyses controlled for baseline perceived burdensomeness, desire for emotional support, and thwarted belongingness, respectively, as well as baseline social anxiety and depression symptoms. Results: Greater insomnia symptom severity significantly predicted greater feelings of perceived burdensomeness following Cyberball participation, beyond baseline perceived burdensomeness, social anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms (β = .24, p = .001). More severe insomnia symptoms also significantly predicted lower desire for emotional support after playing Cyberball, beyond baseline desire for emotional support and social anxiety symptoms (β = -.14, p = .03) but not beyond baseline depression symptoms (β = -.16, p = .07). Insomnia symptoms were not significantly associated with thwarted belongingness after Cyberball (β = -.05–.08, p = .27–.57). Limitations: Replication in larger samples and using other sleep disturbance indices is needed. Conclusions: Findings suggest that individuals with more severe insomnia symptoms in the past two weeks experience greater perceptions of being a burden on others and less desire for emotional support in response to social exclusion.

"Prevalence, risk factors and multi-group latent class analysis of lifetime anxiety disorders comorbid depressive symptoms","Background: Previous studies about comorbidity have primarily focused on disorders based on diagnostic criteria instead of symptoms. This study aimed to describe the prevalence and risk factors of anxiety comorbid depression based on a population-based sample in Chifeng City Inner Mongolia and explored the gender differences of depressive subtypes in anxiety patients. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study conducted among 6376 community residents. Logistics analysis and multiple-group latent class analysis was used in exploring the risk factors and subtypes of anxiety comorbid depressive symptoms. Results: A total of 4528 respondents were interviewed in this study. The lifetime prevalence estimates for anxiety in the total sample was 5.70%. Among residents who had ever had anxiety, most of them reported having depressive symptoms while 15.79% of them met the criteria of MDD. Logistics analysis showed childhood adversities were associated with anxiety comorbid depressive symptoms. The results of multiple-group latent class analysis showed that the latent class probabilities were different between males and females. Conclusion: The prevalence rates of comorbidity were similar to the reports of previous regional surveys in China with statistically significant differences of comorbidity occurring between males and females. Precision prevention should therefore be targeted towards different kinds of populations.

Measurement equivalence of the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and Social Phobia Scale (SPS) across individuals with social anxiety disorder from Japanese and Australian sociocultural contexts,"Background: Cultural factors influence both the expression of social anxiety and the interpretation and functioning of social anxiety measures. This study aimed to test the measurement equivalence of two commonly used social anxiety measures across two sociocultural contexts using individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) from Australia and Japan. Methods: Scores on the straightforwardly-worded Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (S-SIAS) and the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) from two archival datasets of individual with SAD, one from Australia ( n = 201) and one from Japan ( n = 295), were analysed for measurement equivalence using a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) framework. Results: The best-fitting factor models for the S-SIAS and SPS were not found to be measurement equivalent across the Australian and Japanese samples. Instead, only a subset of items was invariant. When this subset of invariant items was used to compare social anxiety symptoms across the Australian and Japanese samples, Japanese participants reported lower levels of fear of attracting attention, and similar levels of fear of overt evaluation, and social interaction anxiety, relative to Australian participants. Limitations: We only analysed the measurement equivalence of two social anxiety measures using a specific operationalisation of culture. Future studies will need to examine the measurement equivalence of other measures of social anxiety across other operationalisations of culture. Conclusions: When comparing social anxiety symptoms across Australian and Japanese cultures, only scores from measurement equivalent items of social anxiety measures should be used. Our study highlights the importance of culturally-informed assessment in SAD.

Maternal pre- and postnatal anxiety symptoms and infant attention disengagement from emotional faces,"Background: Biases in socio-emotional attention may be early markers of risk for self-regulation difficulties and mental illness. We examined the associations between maternal pre- and postnatal anxiety symptoms and infant attention patterns to faces, with particular focus on attentional biases to threat, across male and female infants. Methods: A general population, Caucasian sample of eight-month old infants ( N = 362) were tested using eye-tracking and an attention disengagement (overlap) paradigm, with happy, fearful, neutral, and phase-scrambled faces and distractors. Maternal self-reported anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Symptom Checklist-90/anxiety subscale at five time points between gestational week 14 and 6 months postpartum. Results: Probability of disengagement was lowest for fearful faces in the whole sample. Maternal pre- but not postnatal anxiety symptoms associated with higher threat bias in infants, and the relation between maternal anxiety symptoms in early pregnancy and higher threat bias in infants remained significant after controlling for maternal postnatal symptoms. Maternal postnatal anxiety symptoms, in turn, associated with higher overall probability of disengagement from faces to distractors, but the effects varied by child sex. Limitations: The small number of mothers suffering from very severe symptoms. No control for the comorbidity of depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Maternal prenatal anxiety symptoms associate with infant's heightened attention bias for threat. Maternal postnatal anxiety symptoms, in turn, associate with infant's overall disengagement probability differently for boys and girls. Boys may show enhanced vigilance for distractors, except when viewing fearful faces, and girls enhanced vigilance for all socio-emotional stimuli. Long-term implications of these findings remain to be explored.

Maternal supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid reduce anxiety and lipid peroxidation in the offspring brain,"Background: Maternal consumption of fatty acids can alter neuronal membrane function, synaptic connections, and protect the brain from alterations caused by disturbances such as lipid peroxidation and anxiety in the offspring. We aimed to investigate how the maternal consumption of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) interferes in anxiety behavior of the offspring and cerebral lipid peroxidation. Methods: Three groups were formed: control (CG)—diet without CLA; CLA1—diet containing 1% of CLA; and CLA3—diet containing 3% of CLA. These diets were offered to the mothers from the 7th day of gestation until the end of lactation. The following behavioral tests were used: Elevated plus maze (EPM), Open Field (OF) and Light-dark Box (LDB). Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione were measured in the offspring's brains. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by the Holm–Sidak post-test or the Kruskal–Wallis test ( p &lt; 0.05). Results: CLA1 and CLA3 showed higher number of entries in the open arms and time spent in the central area in EPM, they translocated and ambulated more in the clear area of the LDB and presented more rearing in the OF compared to CG ( p &lt; 0.05); moreover, they presented higher concentration of glutathione and lower MDA in brain tissue ( p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: We evaluated the effect of maternal consumption of CLA on anxiety and lipid peroxidation in rats’ offspring, but a similar study should be performed in humans. Conclusions: Maternal intake of CLA induced a decrease in the parameters of anxiety and cerebral lipid peroxidation in the offspring.

A randomized controlled trial of ‘MUMentum Pregnancy’: Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program for antenatal anxiety and depression,"Background: Anxiety and depression are common during pregnancy and associated with adverse outcomes for the mother and infant if left untreated. Despite the need to improve treatment accessibility and uptake in this population, no studies have investigated internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for antenatal anxiety and depression. In a randomised controlled trial, we examined the efficacy and acceptability of a brief, unguided iCBT intervention—the MUMentum Pregnancy program—in pregnant women with anxiety and/or depression. Methods: Participants meeting clinical threshold on validated self-report measures of generalised anxiety and/or depression were recruited online and randomised to iCBT ( n = 43) or a treatment as usual (TAU) control ( n = 44). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-treatment and four-week follow-up; and included anxiety, depression, psychological distress, antenatal bonding, quality of life, and treatment acceptability. Results: Of the 36 women who started iCBT, 26 completed all three lessons of treatment (76% adherence rate). iCBT produced moderate to large effect size reductions for anxiety on the GAD-7 (Hedges’ g = 0.76) and psychological distress on the Kessler-10 ( g = 0.88) that were superior to TAU. Only small nonsignificant differences were found for depression outcomes ( g = &lt; 0.35). Participants reported that iCBT was an acceptable treatment for antenatal anxiety and/or depression. Limitations: Lack of an active control condition and long-term postpartum follow-up. Conclusions: This is the first study to evaluate brief unguided iCBT for antenatal anxiety and depression. While our findings are promising, particularly for anxiety reduction, additional RCTs are required to establish treatment efficacy.

Neuroticism and extraversion mediate the relationship between having a sibling with developmental disabilities and anxiety and depression symptoms,"Background: Children growing up with a sibling with disabilities report higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms as adults. Here, we examined whether personality characteristics also play a part in mediating this relationship. Method: We tested for differences in personality traits between 132 individuals who have a sibling with developmental disabilities and 132 closely matched comparisons. Results: Differences in Big Five factors of personality were demonstrated across the disability groups and between the disability groups and the comparisons, especially in Extraversion, Neuroticism and Openness. Individuals growing up alongside a sibling with developmental disabilities have a higher tendency to experience anxiety and depression symptoms, and this research is the first demonstration that personality traits mediate this relationship. Specifically, Neuroticism is a strong mediator of anxiety while both Neuroticism and Extraversion contribute mediating effects toward the development of depression. Limitations: Our study made use of self-report methodology which, although having recognized limitations, is more reliable than parental reports. Given the cross-sectional nature of our design, we were not able to examine pre-existing developmental factors that may have influenced the participant's propensity to particular personality traits and affective disorders. However, we obtained a large sample and closely matched participants to examine differences between those with a sibling with disabilities and those without. Conclusions: As such, differences in personality traits have important implications for the understanding and treatment of siblings presenting with anxiety and depression symptoms. We recommend that intervention should target those high in Neuroticism among individuals who have a sibling with disabilities, and that more social support is put in place for siblings to mitigate their tendency towards introversion and buffer them against psychological maladjustment.

Affective models of depression and anxiety: Extension to within-person processes in daily life,"Background: Affective models (e.g., tripartite model) delineate shared and unique components of depression and anxiety. Specifically, negative affect is broadly associated with these symptoms, whereas low positive affect is relatively specific to depression and social anxiety. However, it is unknown how affect relates to symptoms as they occur naturalistically in daily life or as a within-person dynamic process. Method: 135 treatment-seeking adults completed a baseline assessment of trait affect and then rated current affect and symptoms (depression, social anxiety, panic, worry) three times per day for 10 days. Multilevel structural equation modeling was used, and prospective analyses held constant current symptoms. Results: Baseline trait negative affect and individual differences in momentary negative affect predicted all four symptoms in daily life, whereas low positive affect predicted greater depression only. Similar results were found for within-person concurrent analyses. Prospectively, momentary negative affect predicted increased depression up to 24 h later, and increased panic or worry up to 8–16 h later. Low momentary positive affect predicted greater depression only (8 h later). Limitations: All data were self-reported, and some relevant anxiety and mood symptoms were excluded. The timing of reports was random and may have missed notable symptoms. Given the novelty of the study, replication is important. Conclusions: Affective models of depression and anxiety derived from retrospective assessments demonstrated strong ecological validity. With the exception of PA and social anxiety, associations found at the between-person level generally applied to within-person processes, which may be amenable to tracking and targeting in therapy.

The effects of childhood maltreatment and anxiety proneness on neuropsychological test performance in non-clinical older adolescents,"Background: The effect of childhood maltreatment (CM) on neuropsychological performance is well established, but the effect of anxiety proneness (AP) on such performance has been underexplored. We assessed the predictive ability of CM and AP, and their interaction, in non-clinical adolescents, for a range of previously documented neuropsychological deficits. Methods: Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the unique and combined influences of CM and AP on neuropsychological performance in 104 non-clinical adolescents, who underwent both neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessment. Results: The interaction of CM and AP was associated with poorer performance in executive functioning skills, processing speed, and estimated IQ. CM and AP were uniquely associated with verbal working memory performance, while verbal and visual memory performance and learning, and visuo-spatial ability, were not associated with either CM, AP or the interaction of CM and AP. Limitations: The use of self-report measures to determine participants’ levels of CM, AP, and depression. The CTQ-SF, a retrospective self-report measure, may have introduced recall bias. The neuropsychological evaluation was not conducted in the Xhosa language, the first language of most African participants. Most instruments utilized have not been validated in a South African adolescent sample. The impact of important moderator variables (e.g., age of onset of maltreatment) was not assessed. Conclusions: Increased levels of CM and AP may be risk markers for poor performance in several key neuropsychological domains. Our findings underscore the importance of assessing the impact of both CM and anxiety-related temperamental traits on neuropsychological performance.

Symptoms of social anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder: A network perspective,"Background: We used network analyses to examine symptoms that may play a role in the co-occurrence of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Whereas latent variable models examine relations among latent constructs, network analyses have the advantage of characterizing direct relations among the symptoms themselves. Method: We conducted network modeling on symptoms of social anxiety and depression in a clinical sample of 130 women who met criteria for SAD, MDD, both disorders, or had no lifetime history of mental illness. Results: In the resulting network, the core symptoms of social fear and depressed mood appeared at opposite ends of the network and were weakly related; so-called “bridges” between these symptoms appeared to occur via intervening variables. In particular, the worthless variable appeared to play a central role in the network. Limitations: Because our data were cross-sectional, we are unable to draw conclusions about the direction of these effects or whether these variables are related to each other prospectively. Conclusions: Continued testing of these pathways using longitudinal data will help facilitate the development of more effective clinical interventions for these disorders.

Testosterone is related to GABA+ levels in the posterior-cingulate in unmedicated depressed women during reproductive life,"Background: The role of testosterone (T) in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and anxiety is broadly supported. Evidence suggests that T has anxiolytic and antidepressant properties. One proposed route for the central effects of T is its interaction with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. We explored the relationship between T levels and GABA+ levels in anterior-cingulate (ACC) and the posterior-cingulate (PCC) regions in depressed women, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H-MRS). Methods: Twenty-one depressed patients with regularly cycling who were not taking hormonal or psychotropic drugs were recruited. We assessed severity of depression using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Blood samples were taken for quantification of free (FT) and total testosterone (TT) on the day of the magnetic resonance (MR) scan. We evaluated GABA+ levels in the PCC and ACC, using the Hadamard Encoding and Reconstruction of MEGA-Edited Spectroscopy (HERMES) sequence. Pearson correlations were used to evaluate the association between FT, TT, GABA+ concentrations, and HDRS scores. Results: TT and FT levels were positively correlated with GABA+ levels in the PCC. No correlation was observed between T levels and GABA+ levels in the ACC. The HDRS total scores correlated negatively with FT levels. Limitations: Limitations include the cross-sectional evaluation and the lack of a comparative healthy group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the potential anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of T are related to increased GABA+ levels in the PCC. This observation may contribute to increased understanding of the role of T in depressive and anxiety symptoms in women.

“Taxonicity and network structure of generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder: An admixture analysis and complex network analysis.”: Corrigendum,"Reports an error in ""Taxonicity and network structure of generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder: An admixture analysis and complex network analysis"" by Joshua Curtiss and David H. Klemanski ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2016[Jul][15], Vol 199, 99-105). In the methods section, the original description of the network estimation procedure should be changed to reflect that the glasso procedure was not used. An updated sentence is provided. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-24408-015). Background: Recent years have witnessed sustained efforts to delineate the nosology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), especially in light of its substantial comorbidity with major depressive disorder (MDD). Traditional diagnostic conceptualizations regard these disorders as categorically distinct; however, extant literature attests to appreciable similarities. The application of admixture analyses and complex network analyses has become more prevalent in recent years to investigate the presence of meaningful subgroups in mental disorders and to address qualitative similarity in network structure across disorders. To date, no studies have extended these analytic techniques to determine whether GAD and MDD constitute independent syndromes. The current study used a clinical sample comprising individuals diagnosed with primary GAD or primary MDD to examine potential subgroups and network structure using symptoms of each disorder as indicators. Methods: The current sample comprised 111 individuals who received primary diagnoses of either GAD or MDD and completed a battery of assessments related to anxiety and depression. Results: Results of the admixture analyses converged on a single class solution, suggesting that individuals with GAD derive from the same population as those with MDD. Furthermore, results of the complex network analyses did not reveal differences in centrality parameters across disorders, suggesting qualitative similarity. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of this study precludes conclusions about the temporal and causal dynamics of these disorders Conclusion: GAD and MDD exhibit robust similarities, as evidenced by the converging results of the admixture analyses and complex network analyses. This conclusion complements the findings of transdiagnostic research, which has identified common mechanisms underlying multiple emotional disorders.

Can chronotype function as predictor of a persistent course of depressive and anxiety disorder?,"Background: The role of chronotype, the individual timing of sleep/activity, has been studied in relation to depressive and anxiety disorders. A cross-sectional association between a depressive episode and evening-type has been identified. However, until now the predicting capacity of chronotype concerning persistence of psychiatric disorders remains unclear. Our aim is to examine whether a later chronotype in patients with a depressive and/or anxiety disorder can serve as a predictor of a persistent course. Methods: A subsample of patients with a depressive and/or anxiety disorder diagnosis and chronotype data of the longitudinal Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) was used. Diagnosis of depressive and anxiety disorders (1-month DSM-IV based diagnosis) were determined at baseline ( n = 505). From this group persistence was determined at 2-year (FU2) (persistent course: n = 248, non-persistent course: n = 208) and 4-year follow-up (FU4) (persistent course: n = 151, non-persistent course: n = 264). Chronotype was assessed at baseline with the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. Results: A later chronotype did not predict a persistent course of depressive and/or anxiety disorder at FU2 (OR (95% CI) = 0.99 (0.83–1.19), P = 0.92) or at FU4 (OR (95% CI) = 0.94 (0.77–1.15), P = 0.57). Limitations: Persistence was defined as having a diagnosis of depressive and/or anxiety disorder at the two-year and four-year follow-up, patients may have remitted and relapsed between assessments. Conclusion: Chronotype, measured as actual sleep timing, of patients with a depressive or anxiety disorder did not predict a persistent course which suggests it might be unsuitable as predictive tool in clinical settings.

Do comorbid social and other anxiety disorders predict outcomes during and after cognitive therapy for depression?,"Background: Cognitive therapy (CT) improves symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) plus comorbid anxiety disorder, but the specific type of anxiety may influence outcomes. This study compared CT outcomes among adults with MDD plus social, other, or no comorbid anxiety disorders. Methods: Outpatients with recurrent MDD ( N = 523, including 87 with social and 110 with other comorbid anxiety disorders) received acute-phase CT. Higher risk responders ( n = 241 with partial or unstable response) were randomized to 8 months of continuation treatment (CT or clinical management plus fluoxetine or pill placebo), followed by 24 months of assessment. Lower risk responders ( n = 49) were assessed for 32 months without additional research treatment. Depression, anxiety symptoms, and social avoidance were measured repeatedly. Results: Other (non-social), but not social, anxiety disorders predicted elevated depression and anxiety symptoms throughout and after acute-phase CT. Social, but not other, anxiety disorder predicted greater reduction in depressive symptoms during acute-phase CT and elevated social avoidance during and after acute-phase CT. Limitations: Anxiety disorders were assessed only before acute-phase treatment. The anxiety symptom measure was brief. Generalization to other patient populations and treatments is unknown. Conclusions: Non-social comorbid anxiety disorders may reduce the efficacy of acute-phase CT for MDD by diminishing both short- and longer term outcomes relative to depressed patients without comorbid anxiety disorders. Comorbid social anxiety disorder may increase relative reductions in depressive symptoms during acute-phase CT for MDD, but patients with comorbid social anxiety disorder may require specialized focus on social avoidance during CT.

Neural connectivity during affect labeling predicts treatment response to psychological therapies for social anxiety disorder,"Background: Although psychological treatments for social anxiety disorder (SAD) can be highly effective, many individuals do not respond to treatment. Identifying factors associated with improved outcomes can facilitate individualized treatment choices. We investigated whether patterns of neural connectivity predicted treatment responses and whether treatment type, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), moderated this effect. Methods: Participants with SAD ( n = 34) underwent fMRI prior to treatment and completed implicit and explicit emotion regulation tasks. Neural connectivity measures were estimates of amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity. Treatment responder status was defined using the ‘clinically significant change index’ (Loerinc et al., 2015). Results: Right amygdala-right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity during implicit emotion regulation was a significant predictor of treatment response (OR = 9.01, 95% CI = 1.77, 46.0, p = .008). Stronger inverse connectivity was associated with greater likelihood of treatment response. There were no significant neural moderators of treatment response to CBT versus ACT. Limitations: The primary limitation of this work was the small sample size which restricted the power to detect significant moderation effects, and results should be interpreted as preliminary. Conclusions: Amygdala-vlPFC connectivity during affect labeling predicted treatment responder status following CBT or ACT for social anxiety disorder. This suggests that the functioning of neural circuitry supporting emotion regulation capacities may be a ‘gateway’ to receiving benefit from psychological treatments. Future work should aim to replicate this effect in a larger sample and consider methods for enhancing functional connectivity within this circuitry as a potential treatment adjunct.

"Psychosocial factors associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress among single mothers with young children: A population-based study","Background: Abundant evidence highlights single parenthood as a common risk factor for depression, anxiety and stress but few studies have comprehensively examined psychosocial factors (adversities), particularly during early parenting. We investigated symptom prevalence and potential risk factors among mothers with very young children. Methods: Data stem from the 2015 National Psychosocial Burdens Prevalence Study (KiD 0–3). Mothers with children up to 3 years of age ( n = 6925) were recruited from random probability-sampled paediatric clinics ( n = 271) across Germany and reported on depression or anxiety, general and parenting stress using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4) and Parenting Stress Index (PSI). Multivariable logistic regression models determined risk factors and quantified potential mediation of psychosocial factors for all 3 outcomes. Results: Approximately 30% of single mothers ( n = 517) reported depressive or anxiety symptoms and 37% general stress, twice as high compared to partnered mothers ( n = 6408; p &lt; 0.0001). Parenting stress was also elevated ( p &lt; 0.0001). Adjusted regression models confirm that single mothers are twice as likely to report symptoms of depression or anxiety (OR 1.9, CI 95% 1.4–2.5). Risk factors for stress correspond to those for depression and anxiety. Inadequate social support and history of partner or childhood maltreatment were also consistent risk factors across all outcomes. Limitations: The study design and self-reported symptoms are limitations to consider. Conclusions: Single mothers with young children are more predisposed to mental health disorders than partnered mothers, especially when facing financial, social or distal adversities. Appropriate social support programs and screening measures are necessary to reduce further disparities.

A comparison of the interviewer-administered phone and self-complete online versions of the computerized eMINI 6.0 in a sample of pregnant women,"Background: This study compares the prevalence rates of depressive and anxiety disorders identified during pregnancy using an interviewer-administered phone version and a self-complete online version of the computerized eMINI 6.0. Methods: 888 pregnant women completed the computerized eMINI 6.0 (interviewer-administered phone, n = 253; self-complete online, n = 635). Results: There were no significant differences in the proportions of women meeting eMINI 6.0 criteria for current major depression, any current anxiety disorder, or lifetime panic or depressive disorder, by mode of administration. However, a greater proportion of women in the interviewer-administered phone group than in the self-complete online group met criteria for current minor depression (2.0% vs 0.2%, p = .008). Limitations: Study limitations include its non-randomized design, overall low prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders in the sample and inclusion of only a select number of eMINI 6.0 modules. Conclusions: This study demonstrated few differences in the rates of DSM-IV depressive and anxiety disorders identified between the interviewer-administered and self-administered versions of the eMINI 6.0. Findings provide preliminary support the practical value of self-completed computerized interviews in large scale studies examining common mental disorders in pregnant women.

"High risk of depression, anxiety, and poor quality of life among experienced fathers, but not mothers: A prospective longitudinal study","Background: Mental distress patterns in first-time or experienced mothers and fathers during the transition to parenthood have been inadequately studied. This longitudinal study thus investigated changes in depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life in both parents from early pregnancy until 1 year postpartum. Parity effects were specifically examined. Methods: In total, 531 pregnant women and their partners were recruited in Taiwan during early prenatal visits from 2011 to 2015, with five follow-ups from midpregnancy to 1 year postpartum. The participants’ self-reported data were collected and analyzed using generalized estimating equation models. Results: Maternal mental distress levels were highest at 1 month postpartum. During postpartum periods, depression scores increased and social relations domain scores decreased in men. Although mental distress levels were higher in mothers than in fathers, parity evidently affected men. Experienced fathers were independently associated with a 70% higher risk of perinatal depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2–2.3) and anxiety (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2–2.6). Experienced fathers also exhibited significantly lower perinatal scores than first-time fathers in the physical health and social relations domains. Limitations: Selection of both parents in metropolitan areas with higher socioeconomic status may restrict the generalizability of our findings. Conclusions: In addition to maternal mental distress during the transition to parenthood, we highlighted experienced fathers’ psychological difficulties throughout perinatal periods. Such trends may indicate unsatisfied needs and could guide timely intervention to prevent adverse consequences.

"Sense of coherence, burden and mental health in caregiving: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Informal caregiving is associated with a number of negative effects on carers’ physical and psychological well-being. The salutogenic theory argues that sense of coherence (SOC) is an important factor in psychological adjustment to stress. The main aim of this study was to systematically review current evidence on the association between SOC, burden and mental health outcomes in informal carers. Method: A systematic search was carried out up to September 2017 in the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), PsychInfo (OVID) and Scopus. Studies were included if they evaluated the relationship between sense of coherence and subjective caregiver burden and/or mental health outcomes, specifically symptoms of depression and anxiety. Meta-analyses were performed and subgroup analyses were carried out to explore if methodological factors influenced findings. Results: Thirty-five studies were included in the meta-analysis, which provided 40 independent samples with 22 independent comparisons for subjective caregiver burden, 26 for symptoms of depression and 7 for symptoms of anxiety. Higher levels of SOC were associated with lower levels of subjective caregiver burden and better mental health outcomes. Publication bias did not change the estimate of the effect. Limitations: Most of the studies included in this review were cross-sectional. Conclusions: Findings suggest that SOC is an important determinant of carer well-being and may protect carers from high levels of psychological distress and caregiver burden.

Sedentary behaviour and risk of anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective: This research synthesis sought to determine the magnitude of the association between sedentary behaviour (sitting time) and anxiety. Evidence acquisition: A comprehensive literature search of eight electronic databases (and a manual search) identified 13 observational studies that met inclusion criteria (22 effect sizes; total n = 70,425). Pooled mean effects were computed using inverse-variance weighted random effects meta-analysis and moderation by study and population characteristics were tested using random effects meta-regression. Evidence synthesis: Sedentary behaviour was associated with an increased risk of anxiety for non-adjusted effect sizes ( k = 7, OR = 1.33 [95% CI: 1.14, 1.55]) and effect sizes adjusted for sociodemographic and health-related factors ( k = 11, OR = 1.48 [95% CI: 1.25, 1.75]). There was no evidence of publication bias in the results. The regression models showed that effect sizes were not moderated by age or gender. However, there was some evidence of moderation by study quality and measurement of sedentary behaviour and anxiety. Measures of sitting time showed larger associations than measures of screen time, and measures of anxiety symptoms showed larger associations than measures of anxiety disorders. Conclusion: The research synthesis provides evidence that sedentary behaviour has a small positive association with anxiety, after controlling for sociodemographic and other health-related factors. Study limitations include low statistical power in meta-regression models and heterogeneity in measures of anxiety and sedentary behaviour. Findings might be of interest to health care professionals developing health care initiatives to reduce risk of anxiety.

Prenatal maternal anxiety and children's brain structure and function: A systematic review of neuroimaging studies,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 253 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2019-36780-058). The authors regret not fully describing Mennes et al. (2009)’s use of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory as a key prenatal predictor and how it was employed differently as a potential confounder. This has been corrected in three places, as given in the erratum.] Background: Maternal anxiety disorders are common during pregnancy and postpartum, and are associated with increased behaviour problems and risk of mental health difficulties in children. Understanding alterations in brain structure and function associated with maternal anxiety may help elucidate potential mechanisms via which high maternal anxiety could affect children. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of extant research studying the associations between prenatal anxiety and children's brain structure and function, as assessed through neuroimaging. Data were gathered in accordance with the PRISMA review guidelines. Results: Ten articles were identified, and all found a significant association between antenatal maternal anxiety and child neurodevelopment. Studies vary considerably in their methods with five studies employing electroencephalography (EEG), one using magnetoencephalography (MEG), and the rest employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Limitations: The heterogeneity of neuroimaging techniques undertaken by the reviewed studies precluded a meta-analysis from being performed. The applicability of this systematic review to clinical practice is also limited given that the studies examined children across a wide age range (neonates to 17 years). Conclusions: From early infancy to late adolescence, findings suggest alterations of brain structure and function in frontal, temporal, and limbic areas in children born to mothers who experienced prenatal anxiety. These brain abnormalities may underlie associations between prenatal anxiety and children's behaviour, though more research incorporating neuroimaging and behavioural data is necessary to determine this.

Repetitive negative thinking as a predictor of depression and anxiety: A longitudinal cohort study,"Background: Repetitive Negative Thinking (RNT) is assumed to be a transdiagnostic proximal risk factor in depression and anxiety. We examined the prospective relations of disorder-dependent as well as disorder-independent measures of RNT with depression and anxiety outcomes. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, 1972 adults completed a 3-year follow-up period (attrition = 12.6%). DSM-IV diagnoses were assessed with the CIDI, symptom severity with the IDS and BAI, and RNT with measures for perseverative thinking (PTQ), rumination (LEIDS-R) and worry (PWQ). Results: The common dimension of our RNT measurements (according to Confirmatory Factor Analysis) was significantly associated with comorbidity among depressive and among anxiety disorders, severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as persistence and relapse of depressive and anxiety disorders. Additionally, a specific factor for rumination predicted comorbidity of depressive disorders, comorbidity of anxiety disorders and relapse of depressive disorder, while a specific factor for worry predicted comorbidity of anxiety disorders and relapse of anxiety disorders, although to a lesser extent than general RNT. Limitations: The present study relied solely on self-report measures of RNT and controlling for baseline demographic and clinical variables greatly attenuated the predictive value of RNT. Discussion: Disorder-independent RNT may be a similar underlying process present across depressive and anxiety disorders. It seems more important than the representation of this process in disorder-specific cognitive content such as rumination in depression and worry in anxiety. RNT as a pathological trait deserves more attention in clinical diagnosis and the transdiagnostic treatment of comorbid depression and anxiety in particular.

"Cognitive biases predict symptoms of depression, anxiety and wellbeing above and beyond neuroticism in adolescence","Background: Adolescence represents a period of vulnerability to affective disorders. Neuroticism is considered a heritable risk factor for depression, but is not directly amenable to intervention. Therefore, it is important to identify the contributions of modifiable risk factors. Negative cognitive biases are implicated in the onset and maintenance of affective disorders in adults, and may represent modifiable risk factors in adolescence. Aim(s): This study sought to assess to what extent cognitive biases are able to predict depression, anxiety and wellbeing beyond that of neuroticism in adolescents. Methods: Adolescents (N = 99), recruited from Scottish secondary schools (54.5% female; mean age = 14.7), ensured a sample representing the breadth of the mental health spectrum. In line with prevalence estimates, 18% of this sample demonstrated clinical levels of depression symptoms. Cognitive biases of autobiographical memory, self-referential memory, ambiguous scenarios interpretation, facial expression recognition, rumination and dysfunctional attitudes were assessed. Depression, anxiety, and wellbeing were indexed using the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, Spence Children's Anxiety Scale and the BBC Subjective Wellbeing Scale. Results: Regression analyses demonstrated neuroticism to significantly predict depression, anxiety and wellbeing. The addition of cognitive biases resulted in a significant increase of explained variance with final models explaining just over 50% of variances of depression, anxiety and wellbeing. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that cognitive biases explain mental health symptoms over and above that of neuroticism. Depressive symptomology was particularly related to self-referential memory bias, while anxiety was predicted by interpretive bias. The key clinical implication is that targeting specific biases based on diagnostic features may be of particular benefit in alleviating distress and promoting wellbeing.

Effects of maternal anxiety and depression on fetal neuro-development,"Background: Fetal development is affected by maternal mental health with research indicating that maternal anxiety and depression are co-morbid; nevertheless differential effects on the fetus have been found. This study examines, prenatally, effects of maternal stress, anxiety and depression on fetal eye-blink reactions to experimental sound and light stimulation. Methods: Two groups of singleton fetuses (mean 32-weeks gestation) were examined using 4D ultrasound: a control group ( N = 14, 7 female) with no stimulation and an experimental group ( N = 21, 13 female) exposed to experimental sound, light and cross-modal stimulation. For both groups ultrasound scans were performed and fetal eye-blink was assessed. Mothers completed the Hospital-Anxiety-and-Depression Scale and the Perceived-Stress Scale. Analysis was carried out using Poisson mixed effects modelling. Results: Fetal eye-blink rate during experimental stimulation was significantly and differentially associated with maternal mental health with a 20% increase of fetal eye-blink rate for each unit increase in anxiety score ( p = 0.02) and a decrease of 21% of eye blink rate for each unit of increase in depression score (p = 0.02). Sound stimulation but not light stimulation significantly affected blink-rate with fetuses habituating to the stimuli ( p &lt; 0.001). Limitations: Limitations are the relatively small number of fetuses and that a follow up after birth is essential to establish potential long-term effects. Conclusions: Of clinical importance is the finding that although fetuses are affected by maternal mental health in general here we demonstrate, using eye-blink-rate during stimulation as measure of neuro-development, that fetuses are differentially affected by maternal anxiety and depression with anxiety increasing and depression decreasing fetal reactivity significantly.

Differential engagement of cognitive control regions and subgenual cingulate based upon presence or absence of comorbid anxiety with depression,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders are highly comorbid, sharing many similar symptoms, including impairments in cognitive control. Deficits in cognitive control could be a potential mechanism underlying impaired emotion regulation in mood disorders. Methods: Participants were 44 individuals with no history of mental illness (healthy controls, HC), 31 individuals in the remitted state of MDD (rMDD), and 18 individuals who met lifetime DSM-IV-TR criteria for rMDD and an anxiety disorder in remission (Comorbid). Participants completed a Parametric Go/No-Go (PGNG) test during fMRI. Event-related analyses modeled activity for cognitive control successes (Hits for Targets, Rejections for Lures) and failures (Commissions on Lures) on the PGNG task. Results: The rMDD group showed significantly reduced activity within the cognitive control network (CCN) during Commission errors, including the middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). The Comorbid group showed significantly reduced activity in several clusters within the CCN during correct Rejections, including the left IPL and right inferior frontal gyrus and greater subgenual cingulate. Notably, during correct Rejections, 60% of activation for the Comorbid group was within the Salience and Emotion Network (SEN), with 0% within the CCN. Limitations: The size of the Comorbid subgroup was modest, preventing subanalysis of the different AD subtypes. Conclusions: There is evidence that CCN activity declines in rMDD and that there may be compensatory SEN activity in individuals with Comorbid rMDD and anxiety. Our findings support the identification of comorbid anxiety as a meaningful subtype of MDD that may obscure group differences between rMDD and HCs.

Six-year healthcare trajectories of adults with anxiety and depressive disorders: Determinants of transition to specialised mental healthcare,"Background: To investigate potential facilitators and barriers for patients receiving specialised mental healthcare using a longitudinal design. Methods: Longitudinal data on 701 adult participants with a depressive and/or anxiety disorder were derived from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Demographic, clinical and treatment determinants at baseline were assessed with self-report questionnaires and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1). Transition to specialised mental healthcare was assessed at one, two, four, and six-year follow-up with a self-report resource use questionnaire (TiC-P). Results: 28.3% of patients with a depressive and/or anxiety disorder transitioned from receiving no care or primary mental healthcare to specialised mental health services during six-year follow-up. The multivariate Cox regression model identified suicidal ideation, younger age, higher education level, openness to experience, pharmacological treatment, prior treatment in primary mental healthcare and perceived unmet need for help as determinants of transition, explaining 8–18% of variance. Limitations: This study focused on baseline determinants of future transition to specialised mental healthcare. Recovery and remittance of depression and anxiety in relation to transition were not studied. Conclusions: Not all key clinical guideline characteristics such as severity of symptoms and comorbidity were predictive of a transition to specialised mental healthcare, while non-clinical factors, such as age and perceived unmet need for help, did influence the process.

Changes in the levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety in Ansan city after the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster,"Background: In April 2014, a ferry carrying 476 passengers sunk on the coast of Korea, resulting in 304 deaths. Of these, 250 were local high school students, and the disaster significantly affected their community. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety among Ansan city residents to understand their recovery process after the accident. Methods: Two cross-sectional surveys (survey 1, after 4–6 months and survey 2, after 16–18 months of disaster) were used to compare prevalence among residents of Ansan city and adjacent cities. Symptoms were determined by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale. Results: A total of 1,773 and 1,748 participants were included in Survey 1 and Survey 2, respectively. Survey 1 showed a significantly higher prevalence of depressive symptoms (19.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 16.9–21.1) and anxiety (6.1%; 95% CI, 5.0–7.5) among Ansan city, compared to participants from adjacent cities (depressive symptoms: 14.3%; 95% CI, 12.7–16.1; anxiety: 3.6%; 95% CI, 2.9–4.5). Survey 2 showed a decreased prevalence of depression (15.8%; 95% CI, 14.0–17.9) and anxiety (5.0%; 95% CI, 4.0–6.4) among Ansan city residents. Depressive symptoms and anxiety adjusted odds ratio in survey 2 compared with survey 1 were 0.74 (95% CI 0.62–0.89) and 0.81 (0.60–1.08) among Ansan city, respectively. Limitations: Cross-sectional study design and lack of pre-disaster baseline data for comparison are limitations of this study. Conclusions: Psychological distress occurred at a population level, not only among survivors and their families, but also among Ansan city residents indirectly impacted by the traumatic event. Although populations indirectly affected by a disaster show a natural recovery process, timely population-based interventions may be helpful.

Estimated prevalence and associated risk factors of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among medical college students in a Chinese population,"Background: To investigate the prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among medical college students in a Chinese population. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to collect demographic data on participants and their symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Data were collected through questionnaires filled out on a computer or through WeChat, a widely used social media app. Results: The prevalence of ADHD among 5693 college students was 3.5% (3.02∼3.98%). Individuals with ADHD showed higher scores on scales of anxiety and depression symptoms (both p &lt; 0.05) than the general population. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of ADHD grouped by smoking, drinking, suicidal ideation, suicidal plans, suicidal attempt, anxiety and depression (p &lt; 0.05). The odds ratio (OR) of ADHD was high for suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide attempts, anxiety and depression, with ORs of 5.901, 5.46, 6.011, 8.037 and 7.88, respectively. The ORs of suicidal behaviors for ADHD were decreased after adjusting for covariates such as drinking, smoking and depression. Limitations: The sample was exclusively selected from three medical-related colleges, which might not be best representation of college students in China. Furthermore, majority of the participants were females. Conclusions: ADHD remains a common disorder among Chinese medical college students and is significantly associated with suicidal behaviors, anxiety and depression. It is important to increase awareness and promote effective interventions to this particular population.

Salivary cortisol reveals overt and hidden anxiety in survivors of childhood cancer attending clinic,"Background: Symptoms of anxiety may arise from fear of cancer recurrence and memories of traumatic experiences during treatment. This study aimed to identify changes in mental health and cortisol, a biological marker of stress, associated with oncology surveillance clinic attendance. Methods: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of childhood cancer (aged 12–30 years, N = 46) attending a survivorship clinic were recruited. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, an anxiety self-rating and open answer question, and salivary cortisol collections were completed two weeks before and one day before clinic, on clinic day and two weeks after. Results: Trait anxiety scores were consistent with the normal population. State anxiety scores two weeks after clinic were significantly lower than baseline ( p = 0.02). Cortisol diurnal slopes were flatter than baseline after clinic ( p = 0.02). Evening cortisol levels were significantly higher than baseline two weeks post clinic ( p = 0.02). Limitations: Combined results from biological and psychometric assessments can be difficult to interpret. Larger cohorts will further delineate cortisol pathway activity and distress in AYA cancer survivors. Conclusions: Psychometric evidence indicates that AYA survivors of childhood cancer perceive themselves to be less anxious after a survivorship clinic visit. Biological evidence, however, indicates a dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which may be linked to clinic attendance. Weak correlations suggest that cortisol may not be a reliable indicator of self-perceived anxiety. This may be due to confounding lifestyle factors influencing the stress response or potential ‘coping strategies’ developed during past treatment experience which may, hypothetically, have masked self-perceived anxiety.

Gender-related patterns of psychiatric disorder clustering among bariatric surgery candidates: A latent class analysis,"Background: Psychiatric disorders tend to distribute unevenly in women and men with severe obesity. The current research aimed to identify homogeneous clusters of concurrent psychiatric disorders among patients seeking bariatric surgery, by gender. Methods: We recruited a consecutive sample of 393 candidates with obesity (311 women and 82 men) in a university-based bariatric center. Trained clinicians assessed psychiatric disorders through the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Latent class analysis categorized pre-surgical patients into uniform clusters of co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Results: For both genders, the 3-class psychopathological clustering was the best-fitting solution. Among women, the latent classes were: (1) “oligosymptomatic”, wherein 42% of patients showed low probability of psychiatric disorders; (2) “bipolar with comorbidities”, in 33%; and (3) “anxiety/depression”, in 25%. Among men, (1) “bipolar with comorbidities” was found in 47% of patients; (2) “oligosymptomatic”, in 40%; and (3) “anxiety/depression”, in 13%. For both genders, the probability of presenting eating disorders was higher in both “bipolar” and “anxiety/depression” classes. Substance use disorders was prominent among “bipolar” men. In comparison with “oligosymptomatic” class, the likelihood of higher BMI was observed among “bipolar” men and poorer work attainment among men with “anxiety/depression”. Limitation: Participants was cross-sectionally drawn from a single bariatric center. Conclusions: Pre-surgical men and women with severe obesity were distributed in three comorbidity profiles and revealed analogous psychopathological patterns. The class of “bipolar disorders” most likely presented comorbidity with eating and substance use disorder. This natural clustering of psychiatric disorders among bariatric patients suggests gender-related therapeutic approaches and surgical outcomes.

The adolescent grief inventory: Development of a novel grief measurement,"Background: To develop an empirically derived, reliable and valid measure of grief in adolescents, aged 12–18 years old. Methods: An online survey comprising 59 items derived from a qualitative study of 39 bereaved adolescents, the Hogan Inventory of Bereavement Children and Adolescents (HIB), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and a series of death- and mental health-related questions, targeted adolescents bereaved when aged 12–18 years, with 176 adolescents (80.6% girls) completing the survey. Results: Factor Analysis of the 59-items resulted in a final solution, the Adolescent Grief Inventory (AGI) comprised of 40 items and 6 factors: Sadness, Self-blame, Anxiety and Self-harm, Shock, Anger and Betrayal, and Sense of Peace, with indices of good fit (RMSEA = 0.057, CFI = 0.952, TLI = 0.948). There was strong evidence of convergent (HIB) and divergent (MSPSS) validity. Adolescents bereaved by suicide scored higher on Self-blame, Anger and Betrayal while those with a history of suicidal behaviour or having a mental health diagnosis scored higher overall than those who had not. Limitations: Study limitations include the self-selected, mostly female, sample, a high proportion of participants with a mental health and self-harm history, and reliance on self-reported data. Conclusions: The AGI is a novel, comprehensive and valid measure of grief in adolescents. It can be used broadly, including with bereaved adolescents at-risk of mental health ramifications.

Association between parental marital conflict and internet addiction: A moderated mediation analysis,"Background: The effect of parental marital conflict on Internet addiction has been well-established; however, little is known regarding the underlying mechanism of this effect. The aim of this study was to explore the mediating effect of depression and anxiety, as well as the role of peer attachment as a moderator in this relation between parental marital conflict and Internet addiction. Methods: The moderated mediation analysis was tested using data from a cross-sectional sample of 2259 high school students who completed questionnaires regarding marital conflict, depression, anxiety, peer attachment and Internet addiction. Results: The results indicated that the effect of parental marital conflict on Internet addiction was mediated by depression and anxiety. In addition, peer attachment moderated the association between parental marital conflict and depression/anxiety. Conclusions: This study helps to elucidate the mechanism underlying the association between parental marital conflict and Internet addiction.

Anxiety in Parkinson's disease is associated with reduced structural covariance of the striatum,"Background: Anxiety is highly prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD) and has great negative impact on quality of life. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies have contributed to our understanding of the symptomatology of PD but still little is known about the pathophysiology of PD-related anxiety. Methods: We used seed-based structural covariance analysis to study the anatomical network correlates of anxiety in PD. Structural covariance analysis is based on the statistical correlation between regional brain volumes measured on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. We investigated the association between anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and seed-to-whole-brain structural covariance networks in 115 patients with idiopathic PD using five bilateral seeds: basolateral amygdala, centromedial-superficial amygdala, dorsal caudate nucleus, dorsal-caudal putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Results: Severity of anxiety correlated negatively with structural covariance between the left striatal sub-regions and the contralateral caudate nucleus. Moreover, severity of anxiety was associated with reduced structural covariance between the right dorsal caudate nucleus and ipsilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and between the left nucleus accumbens and ipsilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Structural covariance of the amygdalar seeds did not correlate with anxiety. Conclusions: We interpret these findings as a reduced interhemispheric cooperation between the left and right striatum and reduced prefrontal-striatal connectivity, possibly related to impaired ‘top-down’ regulation of emotions. These findings shed more light on the pathophysiology of PD-related anxiety Limitations: This study did not include PD patients with an anxiety disorder.

Screening for childhood anxiety: A meta-analysis of the screen for child anxiety related emotional disorders,"Background: The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) is a commonly used instrument that evaluates anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents. Methods: This meta-analysis examined the psychometric properties of the SCARED instrument, including total instrument and subscale internal reliabilities for the parent and child versions, test-retest reliabilities, and the extent to which responses from the parent version correspond with responses from the child version. Databases reviewed included ERIC, PubMed, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and Google Scholar Results: Responses to the SCARED instrument for children and parents using a mixture of the 38-, 41-, 66-, 69-, and 71-item versions of the SCARED were analyzed for 65 studies conducted between 1997 and 2017. The results from the random-effects models suggested homogeneity of variance for all the effects examined. The weighted averages of the psychometric properties indicated the parent and child versions of the SCARED have exhibited excellent internal consistencies on the total score, panic disorder, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and animal phobia subscales. Furthermore, the SCARED demonstrated moderate to large test-retest reliabilities and moderate to large parent-child agreement rates. The school avoidance, obsessive-compulsive disorder, blood phobia, and situational phobia subscales did not demonstrate reliabilities considered appropriate for a screening instrument. Limitations: Publications that could not be translated to English or could not be retrieved due to not being published or archived were not included in the analysis. Conclusions: Overall the child and parent versions of the SCARED have robust psychometric properties and perform consistently well in community and clinical settings across various countries. The SCARED is clinically relevant as mental health providers and researchers can use it during diagnostic procedures and to monitor intervention effectiveness.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for bipolar disorder: A systematic review,"Background: Persisting high levels of relapse, morbidity and mortality in bipolar disorder (BD) in spite of first-line, evidence-based psychopharmacology has spurred development and research on adjunctive psychotherapies. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an emerging psychotherapy that has shown benefit in related and comorbid conditions such as major depressive, anxiety, and substance disorders. Furthermore, neurocognitive studies of MBCT suggest that it may have effects on some of the theorized pathophysiological processes in BD. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review using PsycINFO and PubMed databases to identify studies reporting clinical and/or neurocognitive findings for MBCT for BD. Results: This search revealed 13 articles. There was a wide range in methodological quality and most studies were underpowered or did not present power calculations. However, MBCT did not appear to precipitate mania, and there is preliminary evidence to support a positive effect on anxiety, residual depression, mood regulation, and broad attentional and frontal-executive control. Limitations: As meta-analysis is not yet possible due to study heterogeneity and quality, the current review is a narrative synthesis, and therefore net effects cannot be estimated. Conclusions: MBCT for BD holds promise, but more high-quality studies are needed in order to ascertain its clinical efficacy. Recommendations to address the limitations of the current research are made.

Experimentally investigating the joint effects of physical activity and sedentary behavior on depression and anxiety: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: To experimentally examine whether increasing sedentary behavior, among a young adult active population, for one week is still associated with increased depression and anxiety symptomology even when allowing for a moderate engagement in physical activity (PA). Methods: Participants were confirmed as active via self-report and accelerometry during baseline and randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups. The No Exercise Group ( n = 19) was instructed to reduce steps to less than 5000/day and were not allowed to exercise for one-week; the Reduced MVPA (moderate-to-vigorous PA) Group ( n = 18) was instructed to reduce steps to less than 5000/day but exercised for 50% of their previously reported vigorous PA for one-week; and the Control Group ( n = 20) maintained normal activity for one-week. PA, depression, and anxiety levels were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and after one week of resumed normal activity for the intervention groups. Results: The experiment was successful in altering physical activity levels among the intervention groups and maintaining activity habits in the control group (F Interaction = 16.053, P &lt; 0.001, η² p = 0.391). Anxiety and depression symptomology remained constant across the two time periods in the control group. For both intervention groups (No Exercise Group and Reduced MVPA Group), depression statistically significantly increased during the inactive week and then resumed back to baseline levels after a week of resumed activity. However, there were no differential trends in anxiety (F Interaction = 0.073, P = 0.897, η² p = 0.002) or depression (F Interaction = 0.276, P = 0.760, η² p = 0.008) among these two intervention groups. Conclusion: We provide experimental evidence that reducing habitual physical activity causes an increase in depression symptomology among young active adults. We did not, however, observe a joint effect of sedentary behavior and exercise on changes in anxiety and depression. At this point, it is still uncertain as to whether reduced MVPA or increased sedentary behavior were driving the observed changes in psychological function. Future research may help determine if these negative effects are from increased sedentary behavior or a reduction in MVPA.

Efficacy of narrative reformulation during cognitive analytic therapy for depression: Randomized dismantling trial,"Background: Narrative reformulation (NR) is a component of cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) that is assumed to increase client engagement and improve clinical outcomes. This study set out to test these claims. Methods: A single-blind randomized and controlled dismantling trial investigated treatment outcomes for moderate to severely depressed patients receiving CAT in Primary Care. Ninety-five participants were randomized to either full-CAT ( n = 52) or CAT minus narrative reformulation (CAT-NR, n = 43). Treatment duration in both arms was 8-sessions and was matched apart from the omission of the NR in the CAT-NR arm. The primary outcome measure was the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), with secondary outcome measures of anxiety, functioning, helpfulness and the therapeutic alliance. Outcomes were assessed at screening, every treatment session and at 8-weeks follow-up. Results: Growth curve modelling found that NR did not enhance the efficacy of CAT for depression. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of attendance, adverse events, anxiety, functioning, helpfulness or therapeutic alliance. There were large within-group effect sizes ( d + &gt; 1.5), as CAT with or without NR produced significant reductions in depression ( p &lt; .01). Limitations: The primary outcome were assessed via self-report and the follow-up period was brief. Conclusions: These results suggest that NR may be redundant when treating depression with CAT. Whilst a brief 8-session version of the CAT model appears suitable for treating depression in Primary Care, further research regarding the need for NR is indicated.

&lt;i&gt;CHRNA7&lt;/i&gt; copy number gains are enriched in adolescents with major depressive and anxiety disorders,"Objective: Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), specifically the α7 nAChR encoded by the gene CHRNA7 , have been implicated in behavior regulation in animal models. In humans, copy number variants (CNVs) of CHRNA7 are found in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including mood and anxiety disorders. Here, we aimed to determine the prevalence of CHRNA7 CNVs among adolescents and young adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders. Methods: Twelve to 21 year-old participants with MDD and/or anxiety disorders (34% males, mean ± std age: 18.9 ± 1.8 years) were assessed for CHRNA7 copy number state using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and genomic quantitative PCR (qPCR). Demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data, including the Beck Anxiety Index (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI), and the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS) were collected and compared across individuals with and without a CHRNA7 CNV. Results: Of 205 individuals, five (2.4%) were found to carry a CHRNA7 gain, significantly higher than the general population. No CHRNA7 deletions were identified. Clinically, the individuals carrying CHRNA7 duplications did not differ significantly from copy neutral individuals with MDD and/or anxiety disorders. Conclusions: CHRNA7 gains are relatively prevalent among young individuals with MDD and anxiety disorders (odds ratio = 4.032) without apparent distinguishing clinical features. Future studies should examine the therapeutic potential of α7 nAChR targeting drugs to ameliorate depressive and anxiety disorders.

The association between maternal-fetal bonding and prenatal anxiety: An explanatory analysis and systematic review,"Background: The prenatal period can be associated with an increase in distress and anxiety. Research indicates that impaired mental well-being influences the development of prenatal maternal-fetal bonding, which manifests in representations, emotions and behaviors. However, the impact of prenatal anxieties on maternal-fetal bonding is still not fully understood, partly due to heterogeneity in the conceptualization and the measurement of both constructs. The aims of this review were to identify studies assessing the relation between both constructs and to investigate direction and size of effects for different types of prenatal anxiety and conceptualizations of maternal-fetal bonding. Methods: A systematic search was carried out on January 7, 2017, and updated on October 23, 2017, based on four electronic databases and a targeted reference search. Of the 3845 identified publications, K = 31 studies fit the eligibility criteria. Results: While components of maternal-fetal bonding centering around pregnancy or maternal role were not affected, the quality of perceived emotional proximity to the child, as assessed by the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale, was impaired by anxieties across studies. Associations were overall negative and of low to moderate size. Limitations: Studies focusing on high-risk subpopulations were excluded. Included studies mostly assessed samples from Western societies, which limits the generalizability of results to non-Western cultures. Conclusion: The quality of perceived emotional proximity to the fetus was consistently impaired by anxiety. Nevertheless, varying effect sizes indicate a more complex association that is influenced by underlying confounders. Multivariate analyses are needed to improve the understanding of the interacting factors that influence maternal-fetal bonding.

Orbitofrontal connectivity is associated with depression and anxiety in marijuana-using adolescents,"Background: Prevalence of marijuana (MJ) use among adolescents has been on the rise. MJ use has been reported to impact several brain regions, including frontal regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The OFC is involved in emotion regulation and processing and has been associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Therefore, we hypothesized that adolescent MJ users would show disruptions in OFC connectivity compared with healthy adolescents (HC) which would be associated with symptoms of mood and anxiety. Methods: 43 MJ-using and 31 HC adolescents completed clinical measures including the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data was also acquired for all participants. Results: In MJ users, increased depressive symptoms were associated with increased connectivity between the left OFC and left parietal regions. In contrast, lower ratings of anxiety were associated with increased connectivity between right and left OFC and right occipital and temporal regions. These findings indicate significant differences in OFC connectivity in MJ-using adolescents, which correlated with mood/anxiety. Limitations: Future studies with an increased number of female participants is required to address potential sex differences in connectivity patterns related to symptoms of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: This study highlights the association between OFC connectivity, MJ use, and symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents. These findings provide further insight into understanding the neural correlates that modulate the relationship between comorbid MJ use and mood disorders and could potentially help us better develop preventive and treatment measures.

The association of affective disorders and facial scarring: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Facial scarring can have a dramatic effect on a patient's psychological health and wellbeing and present unique management challenges. This patient population remains poorly characterised in the contemporary literature. Aims: To evaluate the prevalence of, and risk factors associated with affective disorders in adult patients with facial scars. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using a protocol registered with PROSPERO and in line with the PRISMA statement. A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCHInfo and The Cochrane Library. Results: Twenty one studies were included, with a total of 2,394 participants. Using a random effects model, the weighted pooled prevalence of anxiety was 26.1% (95% CI 17.9%-36.3%) and the weighted pooled prevalence of depression was 21.4% (95% CI 15.4%-29.0%). Studies identified female gender, past psychiatric history and violent causation as factors associated with anxiety and depression. Limitations: Included studies were limited to those published in peer reviewed journals. Longitudinal trends in both anxiety and depression were limited by a short duration of follow up. Conclusions: There is a high and persistent burden of affective disorders in patients with facial scars. Additional research is required to further characterise this population and develop effective management strategies.

The role of emotion regulation difficulties in the relationship between attachment representations and depressive and anxiety symptoms in the postpartum period,"Background: Insecure attachment representations have been established as a vulnerability factor for postpartum depressive symptoms. However, there is a lack of studies on the effects of attachment (in)security on postpartum anxiety symptoms, and on the mechanisms through which attachment representations may affect women's postpartum adjustment, namely, emotion regulation difficulties. Methods: The sample included 450 women in the postpartum period (up to 12 months postpartum), who were recruited both online (advertisements on social media) and in person (study was presented by the researchers during the women's postpartum hospitalization). Results: Approximately one third of the women with clinically significant symptoms (33.3%) presented comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression, and these women presented more insecure attachment representations and more emotion regulation difficulties ( p &lt; .001) than did women without comorbid symptoms ( p &lt; .001). The relationship between more insecure attachment representations and depressive and anxiety symptoms occurred both directly and indirectly through emotional regulation difficulties. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the study, the use of self-report questionnaires that do not allow the establishment of clinical diagnosis and the self-selected bias in recruitment were study limitations. Conclusions: The results underline the need for attention to anxiety symptomatology, which is a condition that co-occurs frequently in this period. Interventions that focus on promoting adaptive strategies of emotional regulation are relevant rather than more intensive interventions to change attachment representations.

Involvement of prolactin in newborn infant irritability following maternal perinatal anxiety symptoms,"Background: Newborn irritability could be an unique and special status and/or adverse neurobehavioral outcomes which was independent of serious disease. To determine whether maternal perinatal anxiety symptoms was associated with newborn irritability, and whether the alteration of serum prolactin in newborns were involved in newborn irritability. Methods: 205 pregnant women were recruited: normal group (n = 100), and anxiety group (n = 105), which was randomly divided to Newborn Behavioral Observations (NBO) + anxiety group( n = 65) and control + anxiety group( n = 40). Newborn Irritability was assessed by Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale(NBAS). Serum prolactin, cortisol and 5-HT in mothers and infants were measured. Results: 1. The scores of irritability items in the newborns of anxiety group were higher than that of the normal group ( p &lt; 0.05). 2. Lower serum PRL, 5-HT and higher serum cortisol were found in the newborns of anxiety group compared with that of the control group both postpartum 2d and 15 ( p &lt; 0.05). 3. The level of serum PRL in newborn infants were significantly and negatively correlated to the scores of irritability items ( p &lt; 0.05). 4. After 7 rounds of NBO interventions, the anxiety scores of mothers and the scores of irritability items of newborns in the NBO intervention group were all lower than those of the control group ( p &lt; 0.05) . Limitations: In future experiments, we should explore the effect of PRL in the breast milk on newborn infant serum PRL. Conclusions: Prolactin could be a potential mediator in newborn irritability following maternal perinatal anxiety symptoms.

Social anxiety questionnaire (SAQ): Development and preliminary validation,"Background: The Social Anxiety Questionnaire (SAQ) was designed to assess five dimensions of social anxiety as posited by the Clark and Wells' (1995; Clark, 2001) cognitive model. Methods: The development of the SAQ involved generation of an item pool, followed by a verification of content validity and the theorized factor structure (Study 1). The final version of the SAQ was then assessed for reliability, temporal stability (test re-test reliability), and construct, criterion-related, and contrasted-group validity (Study 2, 3, and 4). Results: Following a systematic process, the results provide support for the SAQ as reliable, and both theoretically and empirically valid measure. A five-factor structure of the SAQ verified and replicated through confirmatory factor analyses reflect five dimensions of social anxiety: negative self-processing; self-focused attention and self-monitoring; safety behaviours; somatic and cognitive symptoms; and anticipatory and post-event rumination. Limitations: Results suggest that the SAQ possesses good psychometric properties, while recognizing that additional validation is a required future research direction. It is important to replicate these findings in diverse populations, including a large clinical sample. Conclusions: The SAQ is a promising measure that supports social anxiety as a multidimensional construct, and the foundational role of self-focused cognitive processes in generation and maintenance of social anxiety symptoms. The findings make a significant contribution to the literature, moreover, the SAQ is a first instrument that offers to assess all, proposed by the Clark–Wells model, specific cognitive-affective, physiological, attitudinal, and attention processes related to social anxiety.

Adverse drug events related to mood and emotion in paediatric patients treated for ADHD: A meta-analysis,"Background: ADHD is frequently comorbid with anxiety and mood disorders, which may increase the severity of inattention and hyperactivity symptoms. Emotional symptoms (anxiety, irritability, mood lability) also affect patients without comorbidity or emerge as adverse drug events. The influence of ADHD drugs on emotional symptoms demands investigation to improve therapies. Methods: Systematic review of trials reporting adverse events in patients pharmacologically treated for ADHD. Meta-analysis of the occurrence of irritability, anxiety, apathy, reduced talk, sadness, crying, emotional lability, biting nails, staring, perseveration, euphoria. Meta-regression analysis. Results: Forty-five trials were meta-analysed. The most frequently reported outcomes were irritability, anxiety, sadness, and apathy. Methylphenidates, especially immediate-release formulations, were most studied; amphetamines were half as studied and were predominantly mixed amphetamine salts. Reports on atomoxetine were scant. Meta-analysis showed that methylphenidates reduced the risk of irritability, anxiety, euphoria, whereas they worsened the risk of apathy and reduced talk; amphetamines worsened the risk of emotional lability. Factors influencing risks were study year and design, patients’ sex and age, drug dose and release formulation. Limitations: Possible discrepancy between adverse events as indicated in clinical trials and as summarised herein. Confounding due to the aggregation of drugs into groups; uninvestigated sources of bias; incomplete lists of adverse events; lack of observations on self-injury. Conclusions: Methylphenidates appeared safer than amphetamines, although younger patients and females may incur higher risks, especially with high-dose, immediate-release methylphenidates. Only atomoxetine holds a black-box warning, but amphetamines and methylphenidates also did not show a safe profile regarding mood and emotional symptoms.

Comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms and the risk of type 2 diabetes: Findings from the Lifelines Cohort Study,"Background: Prior studies indicate that depression is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D), though there is considerable heterogeneity in reported estimates. Identifying homogeneous subgroups of depression strongly associated with T2D may be beneficial. This study examined associations between depression and anxiety comorbidity with the risk of T2D. Methods: 78,025 participants from the Lifelines Cohort Study (age range = 30–75 years) without diabetes at baseline were included in this study. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview assessed depressive and anxiety symptoms at baseline. Incident T2D was assessed by self-report or hemoglobin A1c levels during an approximately 3.8-year follow-up period. Risk of T2D was compared across four groups (no depressive or anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms alone, anxiety symptoms alone, comorbid depressive/anxiety symptoms) using mixed effects logistic regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic characteristics. Results: 1,096 participants developed diabetes. Compared to those without depressive or anxiety symptoms ( n = 74,467), those with comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms ( n = 743) were more likely to develop T2D ( n = 28, OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.22–3.68). Depressive symptoms alone ( n = 650) and anxiety symptoms alone ( n = 2,165) were not significantly associated with T2D ( n = 23 and n = 24, respectively, developed diabetes). Those with comorbid symptoms were also more likely to develop T2D compared to those with depressive symptoms alone (OR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.25–6.54). Limitations: Depressive and anxiety symptom assessments were based on a screening tool. Hemoglobin A1c data were only available for a subset of participants. Conclusions: Depression with comorbid anxiety may be a subgroup of depression that is strongly associated with the risk of T2D.

Attentional bias modification alters intrinsic functional network of attentional control: A randomized controlled trial,"Introduction: Attentional bias modification (ABM) alleviates anxiety by moderating biased attentional processing toward threat; however, its neural mechanisms remain unclear. We examined how ABM changes functional connectivity (FC) and functional network measures, leading to anxiety reduction. Methods: Fifty-four healthy anxious individuals received either ABM or sham training for 1 month in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Anxious traits, attentional control, and attentional bias were assessed. Thirty-five participants completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans before and after training. Results: ABM significantly mitigated an anxious traits regarding physical stress vulnerability (η² = 0.12, p = 0.009). As compared to sham training, ABM significantly strengthened FC between the pulvinar and transverse temporal gyrus along the temporoparietal junction ( T = 3.90, FDR-corrected p = 0.010), whereas it decreased FC between the postCG and ventral fronto-parietal network (vFPN) regions such as the anterior insula and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (all T ≤ −3.19, FDR-corrected p ≤ 0.034). Although ABM diminished network measures of the postcentral gyrus (postCG) (all T ≤ −4.30, FDR-corrected p ≤ 0.006), only the pulvinar-related FC increase was specifically correlated with anxiety reduction ( r = − 0.46, p = 0.007). Limitations: Per-protocol analysis and reduced sample size in MRI analysis. Conclusions: ABM might augment the pulvinar's control over vFPN to maintain endogenous attention to a behavioral goal, while diminishing the information exchanges of the postCG with vFPN to inhibit the capture of exogenous attention by potential threats. The pulvinar might play a critical role in ABM anxiolytic efficacy.

Risk factors of new onset anxiety and anxiety exacerbation in the perinatal period: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Even though more than 20% of women meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder during the perinatal period, very little is known about the predictors of these problems. As a result, we systematically reviewed the literature on risk factors for new onset anxiety and maternal anxiety exacerbation in the perinatal period. Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Ovid, ProQuest Portal, and Web of Science were searched for studies assessing risk factors for the development of new onset anxiety or anxiety worsening in women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Results: 11,759 citations were identified, with 11 studies meeting eligibility criteria. New onset anxiety was assessed in 7 studies, anxiety worsening in 3, and 1 assessed both. Lower educational attainment, living with extended family members, multiparity, a family history of psychiatric disorders, hyperemesis gravidarum, comorbid sleep disorders, and prenatal oxytocin exposure were risk factors for new onset perinatal anxiety, while presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders and prenatal oxytocin were risk factors for anxiety worsening. Limitations: Studies not explicitly stating whether participants had pre-existing anxiety disorders were excluded. As a result, meta-analysis was not possible for several risk factors. Conclusions: Risk factors for new onset anxiety and anxiety worsening during the perinatal period include psychological, social, and biological exposures. Given the lack of studies differentiating women with and without pre-existing anxiety disorders, additional research is required in order to determine whether these factors differ from the non-puerperal population, as well as from each other.

Affective styles in mood and anxiety disorders—Clinical validation of the “Affective Style Questionnaire” (ASQ),"Background: Emotion regulation plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of psychological disorders. Less is known about the association of affective styles and psychopathology. The 20-item “Affective Style Questionnaire” (ASQ) has been validated in nonclinical samples. The American and German validation studies resulted in a three-factor structure (concealing, adjusting, and tolerating). The present study aimed to investigate three aspects: (1) the validation of the ASQ within a clinical sample, (2) the examination of possible differences in affective styles between patients suffering from affective versus anxiety disorders, and (3) the association of affective styles and anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms. Methods: Overall 917 patients receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy at an outpatient clinic participated in this study, 550 participants were female. All data were collected before the beginning of treatment. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed the same three-factor structure found in the previous Western samples (CFI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.06): Concealing (α = 0.81), adjusting (α = 0.71), and tolerating (α = 0.70). Significantly lower scores in the ASQ subscale adjusting were found in patients suffering from affective disorders than patients suffering from anxiety disorders. The results of the regression analyses showed that the ASQ adjusting and concealing behavior seem to play a more important role than the ERQ reappraisal and suppression for depression, anxiety, and stress among clinical populations. Limitations: A number of limitations must be taken into consideration while evaluating the present study. First and foremost, the clinical data were based on primary diagnoses. We did not ascertain comorbid diagnoses. This distinction may be important, since affective and anxiety disorders are often linked to each other. In addition, we only used data collected before the beginning of psychotherapeutic treatment and were therefore not able to analyze changes in affective styles during and after intervention. Furthermore, all data were based on self-reported information of patients. We did not implement either a therapeutic rating of affective styles or physiological measures, for instance arousal, which could have shown whether the used strategies successfully reduce negative emotions. Future research should address this question. Another limitation is the fact that we concentrated on the main categories of mental disorders and, therefore, did not subdivide patients with affective and anxiety disorders in terms of their concrete diagnoses. This is of special importance, because there might also be differences in affective styles within the main categories.

Looking forward to the future: Impoverished vividness for positive prospective events characterises low mood in adolescence,"Background: Enhancing positive future imagery offers promise for treatment innovation in adult depression but has been neglected in adolescence. While negative life events are linked with depression-onset in adolescence, mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood. We investigate whether difficulties in generating vivid positive future imagery characterise depression, compared to anxiety, and examine potential moderation of the relationship between negative life events and depressive symptoms in adolescence. Method: Three hundred and seventy-five young people (11–16 years) completed the Prospective Imagery Task, and self-reported on symptoms of anxiety and depression. They were also asked to describe a past negative life event they had been thinking about or imagining over the last seven days, which was subsequently coded by a clinician over whether it was no, low, moderate or high impact. Results: Symptoms of depression were associated with less vivid positive imagery and more vivid negative imagery whether past or future, whilst symptoms of anxiety were associated with increased vividness for past negative events only. The relationship between life event severity and depression was increased for those with poorer vividness for positive future events. Limitations: These data were collected at a single time-point only, limiting conclusions on temporal relationships. All measures were also self-reported, increasing shared method variance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the relationship between negative life events and prospective positive imagery are specific to depressive symptoms in adolescence and provide foundations for novel approaches to strengthen psychological interventions.

Cognitive impairment as measured by the THINC-integrated tool (THINC-it): The association with self-reported anxiety in Major Depressive Disorder,"Background and objectives: This study evaluated the association between self-reported anxiety and objective/subjective measures of cognitive performance in adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Methods: Acutely depressed subjects with recurrent MDD ( n = 100) and age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (HC; n = 100) between the ages of 18 and 65 completed the cross-sectional validation study of the THINC-integrated tool (THINC-it; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02508493). Objective cognitive performance was assessed using the THINC-it, and subjective cognitive impairment with the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire for Depression–5-item. Subjects also completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7-item (GAD-7) questionnaire. Results: Subjects with MDD reported significantly more anxiety symptoms, as assessed by the GAD-7, compared to HC ( p &lt; 0.001). Linear regression analysis determined that anxiety symptoms significantly accounted for 70.4% of the variability in subjective cognitive impairment, adjusting for depression severity. Moreover, subjects’ ratings of the difficulties caused by their anxiety were reported as significantly more severe among subjects with MDD when compared to HC ( p &lt; 0.001). Likewise, greater self-reported difficulties with anxiety significantly predicted 57.8% of the variability in subjective cognitive impairment, adjusting for depression severity. Neither anxiety symptoms nor impairment due to anxiety symptoms predicted objective cognitive performance. Limitations: Subjects were not prospectively verified to have a clinical diagnosis of GAD. Rather, this study examined the relationships between symptoms of generalized anxiety, assessed using a brief screening tool, and subjective and objective cognitive function. Conclusions: Results from the current study indicate that adults with MDD and high levels of self-reported anxiety are significantly more likely to report experiencing subjective cognitive dysfunction.

Intrinsic functional neurocircuitry associated with treatment response to transdiagnostic CBT in bipolar disorder with anxiety,"Background: Anxiety in bipolar disorder (BD) exacerbates emotion dysregulation and reduces treatment response. We recently conducted a pilot trial of transdiagnostic CBT to target anxiety and emotion dysregulation in BD adjunctive to pharmacotherapy. Reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms were significantly predicted by baseline levels of neuroticism and perceived affective control, as well as changes over time in emotion regulation skills. The present study investigates mechanism of treatment response by examining the relationship between baseline emotion regulation-related neural circuitry and trial outcomes. Methods: Nineteen patients completed baseline resting state fMRI scans prior to treatment randomization. Functional connectivity between the anterior insula (AI) and regions in the salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and executive control network (ECN) were examined as predictors of baseline and treatment-related changes in emotion regulation. Results: Greater improvements in emotion regulation were predicted by weaker right dorsal AI—right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC; SN) and stronger bilateral dorsal AI—bilateral amygdala functional connectivity. Baseline neuroticism was negatively correlated with right dorsal AI- inferior parietal lobule (ECN) functional connectivity, and baseline deficits in perceived affective control were positively associated with ventral AI—bilateral dACC (SN) connectivity. Limitations: Small sample limits interpretability of treatment-specific effects. Conclusion: Baseline functional connectivity of emotion-regulation related neural circuitry significantly predicted change in emotion regulation-related dimensions associated with anxiety and depression symptom reduction. Future studies are needed to determine if employing methods such as neuromodulation to rehabilitate relevant neural circuitry may improve ultimate treatment outcomes of transdiagnostic CBT for BD and anxiety.

Different patterns of alcohol consumption and the incidence and persistence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among older adults in Ireland: A prospective community-based study,"Background: The associations of different patterns of alcohol consumption and the incidence and persistence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in older age remain unclear. Methods: Data on 6095 adults aged ≥ 50 years old from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) was analyzed. Participants completed the CAGE instrument to screen for problematic alcohol use at baseline between October 2009 and February 2011. Outcomes were incident (assessed by the CES-D scale) and anxiety (assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depressive scale) symptoms after a two-year follow-up as well as persistence of probable depression and anxiety among those with a positive screen for those disorders at baseline. Associations were adjusted for potential confounders through multivariable models. Results: In the overall sample, problem drinking did not predict incident and persistent depression and anxiety in this sample. Among females, problem drinking increased the risk for incident depression (OR = 2.11; 95%CI = 1.12–4.00) and anxiety (OR = 2.22; 95%CI = 1.01–4.86). In addition, problem drinking increased the risk of persistent depressive symptoms (OR = 2.43; 95%CI = 1.05–5.06) among females. Conclusion: Problem drinking may increase the risk of incident probable depression and anxiety among older females. Furthermore, problem drinking led to a higher likelihood of persistent depressive symptoms in older female participants. Interventions targeting problem drinking among older females may prevent the onset and persistence of depression in this population, while also decreasing the incidence of anxiety symptoms.

Couples’ relationship affects mothers’ and fathers’ anxiety and depression trajectories over the transition to parenthood,"Background: The association between the couple relationship and the mothers’ and fathers’ psychological adjustment to the transition to parenthood has been examined in the literature. However, the direction of effects between these variables has not been extensively explored. This study aimed to assess the direction of effects between mothers’ and fathers’ positive and negative interactions and anxiety and depression symptoms trajectories over the transition to parenthood. Methods: A sample of 129 couples ( N = 258) completed self-report measures of positive and negative interactions, anxiety and depression symptoms at each trimester of pregnancy, at childbirth, and at 3- and 30-months postpartum. Dyadic growth curve models were performed using multilevel modeling. Results: Whereas anxiety and depression showed no moderation effect on positive and negative interactions over time, negative interaction moderated depression from 3- to 30-months postpartum. Mothers and fathers with high negative interaction scores experienced a steeper increase in depression from 3- to 30-months postpartum. Additionally, gender moderated the effect of positive interaction on anxiety from 3- to 30-months postpartum. Fathers with low positive interaction scores experienced an increase in anxiety, whereas fathers with high positive interaction scores and mothers with high or low positive interaction scores did not experience changes in anxiety from 3- to 30-months postpartum. Limitations: Despite the longitudinal aspect of the models, a possible causal relationship need to be taken with caution. Conclusions: Our results suggest that mothers’ and fathers’ positive and negative interactions affect their anxiety and depression symptoms trajectories: negative interaction raises mothers’ and fathers’ depression symptoms and positive interaction prevents the increase of fathers’ anxiety symptoms over the postpartum period.

Depression and anxiety symptoms are associated with prooxidant-antioxidant balance: A population-based study,"Background: Depression and anxiety are significantly associated with systemic inflammation. Moreover, oxidative stress resulting from a disturbance in the prooxidant-antioxidant balance is linked to inflammation-related conditions. Therefore, depression/anxiety symptoms may also be associated with oxidative stress. Objective: To examine the association between depression/anxiety symptoms and serum prooxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB) in adults who participated in a large population-based, cross-sectional study. Methods: Serum PAB values were measured in 7516 participants (62% females and 38% males) aged 35–65 years, enrolled in a population-based cohort study. beck depression and anxiety inventories were used to evaluate symptoms of depression and anxiety. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the effect of confounders on the status of serum PAB change. Results: Among men, serum PAB values were increased incrementally from 1.55 ± 0.47 to 1.59 ± 0.47, 1.69 ± 0.38, and 1.68 ± 0.38 in the no or minimal, mild, moderate and severe depression groups, respectively ( P trend &lt; 0.001). Serum PAB values also increased significantly across these four corresponding groups among women [1.70 ± 0.45, 1.73 ± 0.44, 1.75 ± 0.44, and 1.76 ± 0.40, ( P trend = 0.005)]. About anxiety, serum PAB values increased significantly across the four groups in men ( P trend = 0.02) but not in women ( P trend = 0.2). The adjusted odds ratios for serum PAB values among men with severe depression and anxiety symptoms were 1.75 and 1.27, respectively. Moreover, the adjusted odds ratios for serum PAB values among women with severe depression and anxiety symptoms were 1.40 and 1.17, respectively. Conclusion: Symptoms of depression and anxiety appear to be associated with higher degrees of oxidative stress, expressed by higher serum PAB values.

Heart rate variability as candidate endophenotype of social anxiety: A two-generation family study,"Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the extreme fear and avoidance of one or more social situations. The goal of the current study was to investigate whether heart rate variability (HRV) during resting state and a social performance task (SPT) is a candidate endophenotype of SAD. Methods: In this two-generation family study, patients with SAD with their partner and children, and their siblings with partner and children took part in a SPT (total n = 121, 9 families, 3–30 persons per family, age range: 8–61 years, 17 patients with SAD). In this task, participants had to watch and evaluate the speech of a female peer, and had to give a similar speech. HRV was measured during two resting state phases, and during anticipation, speech and recovery phases of the SPT. We tested two criteria for endophenotypes: co-segregation with SAD within families and heritability. Results: HRV did not co-segregate with SAD within families. Root mean square of successive differences during the first resting phase and recovery, and high frequency power during all phases of the task were heritable. Limitations: It should be noted that few participants were diagnosed with SAD. Results during the speech should be interpreted with caution, because the duration was short and there was a lot of movement. Conclusions: HRV during resting state and the SPT is a possible endophenotype, but not of SAD. As other studies have shown that HRV is related to different internalizing disorders, HRV might reflect a transdiagnostic genetic vulnerability for internalizing disorders. Future research should investigate which factors influence the development of psychopathology in persons with decreased HRV.

The relationship between schizotypal traits and hoarding symptoms: An examination of symptom specificity and the role of perceived cognitive failures,"Background: Hoarding disorder presents significant individual and interpersonal consequences. Because hoarding has only recently been added to the DSM, relatively little is known about associated comorbidity patterns. Several researchers have postulated a relationship between hoarding and schizotypy. To date, however, no investigations have considered which specific types of schizotypal traits relate to hoarding symptoms. Methods: We examined the association between hoarding and schizotypal symptoms using multivariate analyses in two samples—a sample of 120 young adults and a community sample of 291 individuals recruited from Mechanical Turk's online crowdsourcing system. Results: Individuals who fell within the clinical range on the Saving Inventory Revised endorsed significantly greater levels of schizotypal symptoms compared to those with normative saving behaviors. Odd speech, magical thinking, and social anxiety were the most consistent schizotypal correlates of hoarding symptoms. Perceived cognitive dysfunction mediated the effects between odd speech and social anxiety and hoarding symptoms, suggesting that shared abnormalities in cognitive functioning may help explain the relationship between hoarding and schizotypy. Limitations: This study examined the spectrum of schizotypy and hoarding symptoms via self-report in two nonclinical populations. Conclusions: Findings underscore the importance of assessing schizotypal traits in patients with hoarding, and suggest future avenues of research to better understand the underlying causes explaining the overlap, as well as potential treatment implications.

Strong correlation between the self-model/other-model system and the anxiety/avoidance system assessing basic attachment dimensions,"The article presents a study on the Strong Correlation Between the Self-Model/Other-Model System and the Anxiety/Avoidance System Assessing Basic Attachment Dimensions . The authors decided to test if the two systems correlated to each other. The subjects were 400 Japanese volunteers free from mental and physical disorders. Their mental and physical conditions were checked by the methods described previously. Two hundred forty-five were males and 155 were females. The mean ± SD of age was 26.7 ± 7.7 years. The protocol of this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Yamagata University School of Medicine, and all participants provided written informed consent to participate in this study. Statistical analyses were conducted by linear regression analysis using SPSS Version 22. A P value of less than 0.05 was regarded as significant. Table 1 shows the correlation between the self-model/ other-model system and the anxiety/avoidance system. There were strong negative correlations between self-model scores and anxiety scores and between other-model scores and avoidance scores. The effect sizes of these correlations were large, while those of other correlations were all small. The results suggest that the self-model/other-model system and the anxiety/avoidance system strongly correlate to each other, and that they can be used interchangeably in attachment research.

In the original article, there were errors in the affiliation of the seventh author and in the first affiliation. The corrections are given in the erratum.] Background: The prevalence of comorbid depression is high in chronic gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). For these two disorders in particular, the findings have not been consistent. This meta-analysis systematically compares the rates and severity of comorbid depression between IBS and IBD patients. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wan Fang, SinoMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure from their inception date to September 12, 2017 for comparative studies on IBS and IBD patients. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (OR) of comorbid depression were calculated using random effect models. Data on comorbid anxiety in the included studies were also extracted and analyzed. Results: Altogether, 22 studies with 1,244 IBS and 1,048 IBD patients were included. While there was no significant group difference in the prevalence of depression (10 studies, OR = 1.18, 95%CI: 0.87–1.60, P = 0.29), the IBS group had more severe depression (pooled SMD = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.04–0.33, P = 0.01) and anxiety than the IBD group (pooled SMD = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.14–0.49, P = 0.0006). Sixteen (72.7%) studies were assessed as ‘high quality’ using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS). Conclusions: Although the prevalence of comorbid depression was similar between groups, IBS patients had more severe comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to IBD patients. Appropriate assessment and treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms in these patient groups should be implemented.

Threatened miscarriage and depressive and anxiety symptoms among women and partners in early pregnancy,"Background: Antenatal depression has been associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes, and threatened miscarriage is often seen clinically to impact adversely on maternal wellbeing, notwithstanding the limited research evidence. Our study aims to examine the link between threatened miscarriage and antenatal depression and anxiety in an Asian obstetric population. Methods: We recruited 121 women and 68 partners facing threatened miscarriage, and 241 women and 180 partners experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies from a tertiary maternity hospital in Singapore. All participants completed a Patient Information Questionnaire and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: The proportion of women with major depressive and anxiety symptomatology was significantly higher among women facing threatened miscarriage compared to those with stable pregnancies (depressive: 33.1% vs. 17.0%, p = 0.008; anxiety: 48.8% vs. 23.7%, p &lt; 0.0001). Amongst their partners, there was a non-significant trend towards a similar finding (depressive: 10.3% vs. 7.2%, p = 0.439; anxiety: 23.5% vs. 18.9%, p = 0.478). Threatened miscarriage remained significantly associated with major depressive symptomatology after adjusting for potential confounders among women (OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.55, 4.71; p &lt; 0.0001) but not among their partners (OR 1.47; 95% CI 0.56, 3.87; p = 0.430). Limitations: This study is limited by its cross-sectional design and relatively small sample size for male partners. Conclusion: Antenatal depressive and anxiety symptomatology affects one in four women in their first trimester, with even higher prevalence among women facing threatened miscarriage. Targeted depression and anxiety screening that includes women facing threatened miscarriages may facilitate early and efficient detection and management of mental health problems among pregnant women.

"A genetically informative analysis of the association between dyadic adjustment, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms","Background: Prior research has found a reliable and robust association between poor dyadic (e.g., marital) adjustment and depression and anxiety. However, it is possible that this association may be due, at least in part, to confounding variables (i.e., variables that are causally associated both with marital adjustment and psychopathology and could account for their covariation). The present study was conducted using a genetically informative sample of twins to examine the association between dyadic adjustment and symptoms of depression and anxiety, accounting for unmeasured genetic and shared environmental confounds. Methods: A Swedish sample of monozygotic and dizygotic twins (218 female twin pairs and 321 male twin pairs) and their spouse or long-term partner completed self-report measures of dyadic adjustment, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Results: Results suggest that dyadic adjustment was significantly and negatively associated with depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms in twins, and nonshared environmental influences largely accounted for this association. Furthermore, results obtained from partners’ reports of dyadic adjustment were largely consistent with those obtained from twins’ reports, suggesting that results were not a function of shared method variance. Limitations: Longitudinal research in genetically informative samples would provide a stronger test of the causal association between dyadic adjustment and psychopathology. Conclusions: The pattern of findings suggest that common nonshared environmental influences, such as partners’ characteristics, may lead to poorer dyadic adjustment and depression and anxiety. Therefore, couple-based interventions that improve dyadic adjustment may be effective in preventing and treating psychopathology in relationship partners.

"Are individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder successful in regulating their emotions? A mixed-method investigation using self-report, subjective, and event-related potentials measures","Background: Models of social anxiety emphasize the role of emotion dysregulation, but the nature of these impairments needs clarification. Methods: We utilized a mixed-method approach to examine impairments in cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression in social anxiety disorder. Forty nine treatment-seeking individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and 35 healthy controls completed self-reports and a lab-based task of suppression and reappraisal. Unpleasantness ratings and event-related potentials (ERPs) were collected while participants regulated their emotions in response to shame-arousing pictures. ERP analyses focused on the late positive potential, a measure of increased attention to emotional stimuli that is reduced during emotion regulation. Results: Participants with social anxiety reported less frequent and effective use of reappraisal and more frequent and effective use of suppression than controls. Counter to most models and our hypotheses, participants with social anxiety were more successful than controls in lab-based reappraisal as measured by unpleasantness ratings, but no differences emerged for ERPs. No differences were found in measures of lab-based suppression. Limitations: Use of standardized, and not participant-generated, materials in the lab-based task of emotion regulation may limit the generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: Subjective appraisals of self-efficacy and frequency suggest strong impairments in emotion-regulation in social anxiety that are not revealed in the laboratory. Models and treatment protocols should specify the exact nature of emotion dyregulation in social anxiety, highlighting difficulties in implementation of potentially intact emotion regulation abilities.

Key Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) items associated with DSM-IV depressive and anxiety disorder 12-months post traumatic brain injury,"Background: Anxiety and depression are common problems following traumatic brain injury (TBI), warranting routine screening. Self-report rating scales including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) are associated with depression and anxiety diagnoses in individuals with TBI. The relationship between individual HADS symptoms and structured clinical interview methods (SCID) requires further investigation, particularly in regard to identifying a small number of key items that can potentially be recognised by clinicians and carers of individuals with TBI. Methods: 138 individuals sustaining a complicated-mild to severe TBI completed the HADS, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Research Version (SCID) at 12-months post-injury. The associations between individual HADS items, separately and in combination, as well as overall depression and anxiety subscale scores, and SCID-diagnosed depressive and anxiety disorders were analysed. Results: CART (Classification and Regression Tree) analysis found HADS depression item 2 “I still enjoy the things I used to enjoy” and a combination of two anxiety items, 3 “I get a sort of frightened feeling as if something awful is about to happen” and 5 “worrying thoughts go through my mind”, performed similarly to total depression and anxiety subscales in terms of their association with depressive and anxiety disorders respectively, at 12-months post-injury. Limitations: Patients were predominantly injured in motor vehicle accidents and received comprehensive care within a no-fault accident compensation system and so may not be representative of the wider TBI population. Conclusions: Although validation is required, a small number of self-report items are highly associated with 12-month post-injury diagnoses.

Negative affect and intolerance of uncertainty as potential mediators of change in comorbid depression in transdiagnostic CBT for anxiety,"Background: Transdiagnostic group cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety (TGCBT) has demonstrated effectiveness in improving comorbid conditions, including depression. Mediators of change in reductions in comorbid depression have yet to be established following this anxiety-focused treatment. Negative affect (NA) and intolerance of uncertainty (IU) have demonstrated contributions to anxiety reduction in TGCBT, as has positive affect (PA) on depression reductions in other cognitive behavioral treatments. IU is also associated with depression and anxiety as a transdiagnostic vulnerability. This study evaluated the mediational effect of NA, IU, and PA on reduction in comorbid depressive symptoms in TGCBT. We hypothesized the indirect effect of the treatment through IU would be significant even when controlling for indirect effects through NA, PA, anxiety symptoms, and diagnostic severity. Method: Data collected as a part of previous clinical trials at a clinic at a large university in the southwestern United States were used. Participants included 61 individuals from a mixed anxiety-disordered sample for whom pre- and post-treatment data were available. Mediation analyses were conducted using ordinary least squares regression in path-analytic form. Results: The total effect of the model was significant ( F (10, 50) = 8.40, p &lt; .001). When controlling for potential mediators, the direct effect of treatment was not significant (B = -1.01, t = -0.40, p = .688). Analysis of indirect effects revealed significant effects of NA ( B = 0.50, SE = 0.17, p = .005, 95%CI [0.02, 0.83]) and IU (B = 0.13, SE = 0.05, p = .010, 95%CI [0.03, 0.23]), but not diagnostic severity (B = 1.39, SE = 0.86, p = .114, 95%CI [-0.35, 3.12]), anxiety symptoms (B = 0.19, SE = 0.12, p = .136, 95%CI [-0.06, 0.44]), or PA (B = -0.25, SE = 0.13, p = .051, 95%CI [-0.51, 0.01] on depression symptoms when modeled with TGCBT). Conclusion: These results suggest IU contributes uniquely to the improvement of comorbid depression in TGCBT above negative affect, an established change process. Implications for treatment and theory are discussed.

Emotional rigidity negatively impacts remission from anxiety and recovery of well-being,"Objectives: Emotional rigidity is described in clinical literature as a significant barrier to recovery; however, few there are few empirical measures of the construct. The current study had two aims: Study 1 aimed to identify latent factors that may bear on the construct of emotional rigidity while Study 2 assessed the potential impact of the latent factor(s) on anxiety remission rates and well-being. Method: This study utilized data from 2472 adult inpatients (1176 females and 1296 males) with severe psychopathology. Study 1 utilized exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to identify latent factors of emotional rigidity. Study 2 utilized hierarchical logistic regression analyses to assess the relationships among emotional rigidity factors and anxiety remission and well-being recovery at discharge. Results: Study 1 yielded a two-factor solution identified in EFA was confirmed with CFA. Factor 1 consisted of neuroticism, experiential avoidance, non-acceptance of emotions, impaired goal-directed behavior, impulse control difficulties and limited access to emotion regulation strategies when experiencing negative emotions. Factor 2 consisted of lack of emotional awareness and lack of emotional clarity when experiencing negative emotions. Results of Study 2 indicated higher scores on Factor 1 was associated with lower remission rates from anxiety and poorer well-being upon discharge. Factor 2 was not predictive of outcome. Conclusions: Emotional rigidity appears to be a latent construct that negatively impacts remission rates from anxiety. Limitations of the present study include its retrospective design, and inefficient methods of assessing emotional rigidity.

The impact of pre- and perinatal factors on psychopathology in adulthood,"Background: : There is considerable evidence that pre- and post-natal factors are associated with a wide range of psychopathology in offspring during childhood and adolescence. Objective: The main aims of the present study were to examine the associations between pre- and perinatal factors and psychopathology in offspring during adulthood, and to explore whether family factors (i.e., family cohesion, mother's social support, and father's social support) mediate these relationships. Method: : Information on pre- and perinatal events was collected from biological mothers of the participants ( N = 315) when they were between 14 and 18 years who were then followed up until they reached age 30. Results: : Maternal obstetric history and illness during first year were significant predictors of offspring anxiety disorder. Maternal emotional health predicted offspring affective disorder. Difficult delivery and breast feeding predicted disruptive disorder. The relationship between maternal obstetric history/emotional health and anxiety/affective disorder was no longer significant after controlling for family cohesion. Limitations: : The information was based on maternal recall when their offspring were between 14 and 18 years which may be subjected to recall bias. Conclusion: : The association between pre- and postnatal factors and psychopathology of offspring during adulthood is mediated by familial factors.

Prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders among youth with intellectual disabilities: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: The purpose of this meta-analytic study was to determine the pooled prevalence estimates of anxiety and depressive disorders among children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities (ID) and to assess the extent to which these pooled prevalence rates differed according to studies’ characteristics. Method: A systematic literature search was performed in nine databases and 21 studies, published between 1975 and 2015, met the inclusion criteria. Results: The resulting pooled prevalence estimates of combined subtypes of anxiety and depressive disorders were respectively (a) 5.4% and 2.8% across samples; (b) 1.2% and 0.03% among children; and (c) 7.9% and 1.4% among adolescents. Pooled prevalence estimates for specific subtypes of anxiety disorders ranged from (a) 0.2% to 11.5% across samples; (b) 0.7% to 17.6% among children; and (c) 0.6% to 19.8% among adolescents. Pooled prevalence estimates of dysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder were respectively (a) 3.4% and 2.5% across samples; (b) 2.1% and 3.2% among children; and (c) 6.9% and 5.7% among adolescents. Finally, subgroup analyses showed significant variations in the pooled prevalence estimates of combined subtypes of anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder; and combined subtypes of depressive disorders. Limitations: The present findings of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution given several limitations related to the characteristics of the populations, diagnostic method and sampling method. Conclusion: Findings provide recommendations for future studies investigating psychological disorders among youth with ID, as well as how clinicians and policy makers can improve diagnostic practices and support for youth with ID.

The influence of dietary patterns and stressful life events on psychological problems in a large sample of Iranian industrial employees: Structural equations modeling approach,"Background: Psychological problems affect many employees and their job performance. Although, the association of diet and stress, as modifiable risk factors, with psychological problems have been investigated separately, however their simultaneous impacts have not been studied. The present study aimed at reinvestigating the association of major dietary patterns and stressful life events with intensity of psychological problems in a large sample of Iranian industrial employees. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 3063 employees in an industrial unit in Isfahan, Iran were investigated. Psychological problems profile as a latent construct was extracted from three common psychological problems; depression, anxiety and psychological distress. Depression and anxiety were measured by Persian validated version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and psychological distress by the 12 items General Health Questionnaires (GHQ). Major dietary patterns were derived from a validated short form of semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) using explanatory factor analysis. Stressful life events dimensions were extracted based on factor analysis, from self-perceived frequency and intensity of Stressful Life Events (SLE) questionnaire. Associations of the obtained factors were investigated in a latent structural modeling framework. Results: Three dietary patterns i.e. western, traditional and healthy and two stressors dimensions including personal life and socioeconomics were extracted. Greater adherence to healthy diet was protectively associated with psychological problems profile scores (β = -0.54; 95% CI: -0.74, -0.34). Adherence to western (β = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.45) and Iranian traditional (β = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.68) dietary patterns were positively associated with higher psychological problems scores in employees. But after adjustment for life stressors only adherence to a healthy diet remained significantly associated with psychological problems profile (β = -0.43; 95% CI: -0.59, -0.27). Also, personal life stressors (β = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.99) and socioeconomics stressors (β = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.16) had significantly direct association with psychological problems profile scores. Limitations: Variables assessment by self-reported questionnaires, not affording causality because of cross sectional design, not adjusting the nutrients intake in association analyses, relatively small sample size of women. Conclusions: Life stressors particularly personal stressors have negative direct association with psychological health of employees. Adherence to a healthy diet can be related to improvement of psychological health in employees. The results can be useful in occupational health planning in order to improve mental health and job productivity.

"Changing patterns in the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode and generalized anxiety disorder over 24 months following a road traffic crash: Results from the UQ SuPPORT study","Objective: To examine the prevalence and changing patterns of PTSD, major depressive episode (MDE), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adult claimants who sustained a non-catastrophic injury in a road traffic crash (RTC) in Queensland, Australia. Method: Participants ( N = 284) were assessed at approximately 6, 12, and 24 months post-RTC using the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI) modules for PTSD, and CIDI-short form for MDE, and GAD. Results: The prevalence of at least one of these disorders was 48.2%, 52.5%, and 49.3%, at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Comorbidity was common (20.8% at 6 months, 27.1% at 12 months, and 21.1% at 24 months) and only 33.1% of participants never met PTSD, GAD, or MDE criteria. A substantial proportion of participants (42.3%) had an unstable diagnostic pattern over time. Participants with multiple diagnoses at 6 months were more likely to continue to meet diagnostic criteria for any disorder at 12 and 24 months than participants with a single diagnosis. Participants with PTSD (with or without MDE/GAD) were more likely to meet criteria for any disorder at 24 months than participants with another diagnosis. Preinjury psychiatric history increased the likelihood of any disorder at 24 months post-injury, but did not significantly increase the likelihood of PTSD. Conclusions: People injured in a RTC are at risk of having complex psychological presentations over time. Interventions to prevent mental disorders, especially PTSD, in the early post-injury period are needed to prevent chronic psychological injury, including consideration of comorbidity and dynamic course.

Temperament clusters associate with anxiety disorder comorbidity in depression,"Background: Individual temperament is associated with psychiatric morbidity and could explain differences in psychiatric comorbidities. We investigated the association of temperament profile clusters with anxiety disorder comorbidity in patients with depression. Methods: We assessed the temperament of 204 specialized care-treated depressed patients with the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-R) and their diagnoses with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Two-step cluster analysis was used for defining patients’ temperament profiles and logistic regression analysis was used for predicting different anxiety disorders for various temperament profiles. Results: Four temperament clusters were found: 1) Novelty seekers with highest Novelty Seeking scores ( n = 56),2) Persistent with highest Persistence scores ( n = 36), 3) Reserved with lowest Novelty Seeking scores ( n = 66) and 4) Wearied with highest Harm avoidance, lowest Reward Dependence and lowest Persistence scores ( n = 58). After adjusting for clinical variables, panic disorder and/or agoraphobia were predicted by Novelty seekers’ temperament profile with odds ratio [OR] = 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8 − 6.9, p &lt; 0.001), social anxiety disorder was predicted by Wearied temperament profile with OR = 3.4 (95% CI = 1.6 − 7.5, p = 0.002), and generalized anxiety disorder was predicted by Reserved temperament profile with OR = 2.6 (95% CI = 1.2 − 5.3, p = 0.01). Limitations: The patients’ temperament profiles were assessed while displaying depressive symptoms, which may have affected results. Conclusions: Temperament clusters with unique dimensional profiles were specifically associated with different anxiety disorders in this study. These results suggest that TCI-R could offer a valuable dimensional method for predicting the risk of anxiety disorders in diverse depressed patients.

The Pregnancy-related Anxiety Scale: A validity examination using Rasch analysis,"Background: Pregnancy-related anxiety is increasingly recognised as a common condition that is associated with many deleterious outcomes for both the mother and infant (e.g., preterm birth, postnatal depression). Limitations in the psychometric properties and/or breadth of existing scales for pregnancy-related anxiety highlight the need for a psychometrically sound measure to facilitate effective screening and possible early interventions. The recently developed Pregnancy-related Anxiety Scale (PrAS) was evaluated using Rasch analysis to explore how the scale's psychometric properties could be fine-tuned. Method: A sample of 497 pregnant women completed the PrAS. Data were subjected to Rasch analysis, and the resulting scale structure examined using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Results: After minor modifications, the Rasch model with 33-items and 8-factors demonstrated good fit, unidimensionality and excellent targeting and internal consistency. Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirmed the final structure, and Cronbach's alpha demonstrated excellent reliability. Limitations: The use of the same sample for all analyses was a potential limitation due to the possibility of sample-specific influences. Conclusions: The Rasch analysis further supports the internal construct validity of the PrAS. Ordinal to interval score conversions provide added precision to the analysis of the PrAS scores. The Rasch results, together with previous validation evidence, point to the PrAS as a comprehensive and psychometrically sound screening scale for pregnancy-related anxiety. The PrAS offers clinicians the ability to screen for pregnancy-related anxiety. The subscales provide additional insights into a woman's pregnancy-related anxiety and her specific areas of concern, enabling more targeted interventions.

Prediction of preterm birth should be done before the preterm birth occurs,"Comments on an article by C. Doktorchik et al. (see record 2018-05068-011). Doktorchik et al. reported on the association between changes in anxiety and depression levels during pregnancy and the prediction of preterm birth. We have however a concern about the validity of the research. The authors collected data using two questionnaires, the Spielberg State Anxiety Scale, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale to determine anxiety and depression scores respectively. Anxiety and depression were measured at a specific point in time between 17 and 24 weeks and again between 32 and 36 weeks’ gestation. While we do not have an issue with the validity of these assessment tools, it is unclear how an increase in scores in the third trimester of pregnancy can be predictive of preterm birth (PTB), which by definition occurs before 37 weeks.

"Generalized anxiety disorder and associated factors in adults in the Amazon, Brazil: A population-based study","Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults using the seven-item GAD scale (GAD-7) and to evaluate the properties of the two-item (GAD-2) as a population screening tool. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional population-based study in the Manaus Metropolitan Region in 2015, Brazil. Adults aged 18 years or more were eligible to participate. We performed probabilistic three-phase sampling and collected sociodemographic and clinical variables. Descriptive statistics and a Poisson regression with robust variance with corrections for complex sampling were used. The accuracy of GAD-2 was assessed using GAD-7 as the gold standard. Results: We included 4001 participants. The prevalence of GAD was 8.4% (95% confidence interval 7.6–9.4%) and was significantly associated with self-reported poor health status and presenting depressive symptoms ( p &lt; 0.01). GAD-2 sensitivity was 63.9%, and its specificity was 97.4%. Limitations: Because of the cross-sectional design of the study, the results are prone to reverse causality and recall bias. The surveyed people were not questioned about their medical diagnosis of anxiety, access to mental health services, or alcohol, tobacco or other drug use. The screening tools were not validated in the Brazilian or Amazon population. Conclusion: About eight in 100 adults living in Manaus presented GAD, and it is more prevalent among people with a poorer health status and depression. Because of its low sensitivity, GAD-2 is not useful as a screening tool.

Prevalence of anxiety in patients with mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Prevalence rates of anxiety in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) varied widely across studies and may confer a higher likelihood of progression to dementia. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of anxiety in MCI and identify reasons for heterogeneity in the reported results. Methods: A computerized search in PubMed, EMBASE, and Psyc INFO for studies on anxiety in MCI was performed up to March 2017. The overall prevalence of anxiety in patients with MCI was pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was explored using stratification (recruitment resource; method of anxiety diagnosis; method of MCI diagnosis; and region) and random-effects meta-regression. Results: Of 2494 unique abstracts, 290 were selected for full-text review, and 39 studies, representing 10,587 patients, met all inclusion criteria. The overall pooled prevalence of depression in patients with MCI was 21.0% (95% CI, 16.2–26.7) with significant heterogeneity present (I² = 97.2%, p &lt; 0.001). When stratified by source, the prevalence of anxiety in patients with MCI in community-based samples was 14.3% (95% CI, 9.7–20.5) and was 31.2% (95% CI, 23.6–40.0) in clinic-based samples, which was significantly different ( p &lt; 0.01). The prevalence of anxiety estimates also differed significantly, when stratification by the method of anxiety diagnosis ( p &lt; 0.01). However, the criteria used for MCI diagnosis and geographical region did not significantly influence the prevalence estimate. Limitations: We did not consider the usage of anti-anxiety drugs and language bias. Conclusions: The prevalence of anxiety in patients with MCI was common and variability in prevalence of anxiety across studies can be attributed partly to the source of the sample and method of anxiety diagnosis. Further research is needed to identify sources of heterogeneity.

Do mothers who are anxious during pregnancy have inattentive children?,"Background: Maternal somatic anxiety during pregnancy may affect neural foetal development via corticoid pathways. Using a large epidemiological cohort, this study explores the relationship between maternal somatic anxiety in pregnancy and child scores on the Test of Everyday Attention in Children (TEA-Ch). Methods: Linear regression was used to analyse the association of maternal somatic anxiety during pregnancy and performance of children on three subtests of the TEA-Ch at age 8.5 years that assess selective attention (Sky Search), sustained attention (Sky Search Dual Test) and attentional control (Opposite Worlds). Results: Children with complete data on each subtest were included in the analysis, comprising 4,198 children for the Sky Search subtest, 3,845 for the Sky Search Dual Test and 4,202 for the Opposite Worlds subtest. No association was found between exposure to maternal somatic anxiety and child's performance in any of the TEA-Ch subtests either before or after adjusting for confounders. The results did not change when stratifying by gender. Limitations: Selective attrition, lack of sensitivity of tests and lack of adjustment for the postnatal environment are possible limitations to this study. Conclusions: We found no evidence of an association between exposure to maternal somatic anxiety in pregnancy and TEA-Ch scores. These results suggest that anxiety during pregnancy does not affect the development of children's attentional skills measured by TEA-Ch.

Development and external validation of a prediction rule for an unfavorable course of late-life depression: A multicenter cohort study,"Background: Given the poor prognosis of late-life depression, it is crucial to identify those at risk. Our objective was to construct and validate a prediction rule for an unfavourable course of late-life depression. Methods: For development and internal validation of the model, we used The Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons (NESDO) data. We included participants with a major depressive disorder (MDD) at baseline ( n = 270; 60–90 years), assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). For external validation of the model, we used The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) data ( n = 197; 50–66 years). The outcome was MDD after 2 years of follow-up, assessed with the CIDI. Candidate predictors concerned sociodemographics, psychopathology, physical symptoms, medication, psychological determinants, and healthcare setting. Model performance was assessed by calculating calibration and discrimination. Results: 111 subjects (41.1%) had MDD after 2 years of follow-up. Independent predictors of MDD after 2 years were (older) age, (early) onset of depression, severity of depression, anxiety symptoms, comorbid anxiety disorder, fatigue, and loneliness. The final model showed good calibration and reasonable discrimination (AUC of 0.75; 0.70 after external validation). The strongest individual predictor was severity of depression (AUC of 0.69; 0.68 after external validation). Limitations: The model was developed and validated in The Netherlands, which could affect the cross-country generalizability. Conclusions: Based on rather simple clinical indicators, it is possible to predict the 2-year course of MDD. The prediction rule can be used for monitoring MDD patients and identifying those at risk of an unfavourable outcome.

Feasibility of a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group intervention as an adjunctive treatment for postpartum depression and anxiety,"Background: Many women experience moderate-to-severe depression and anxiety in the postpartum period for which pharmacotherapy is often the first-line treatment. Many breastfeeding mothers are reticent to increase their dose or consider additional medication, despite incomplete response, due to potential adverse effects on their newborn. These mothers are amenable to non-pharmacological intervention for complete symptom remission. The current study evaluated the feasibility of an eight-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention as an adjunctive treatment for postpartum depression and anxiety. Methods: Women were recruited at an outpatient reproductive mental health clinic based at a maternity hospital. Participants had a diagnosis of postpartum depression/anxiety within the first year following childbirth. They were enrolled in either the MBCT intervention group (n = 14) or the treatment-as-usual control group (n = 16), and completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) at baseline and at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months following baseline. Results: Multivariate analyses demonstrated that depression and anxiety levels decreased, and mindfulness levels increased, in the MBCT group, but not in the control group. Many of the between-group and over time comparisons displayed trends towards significance, although these differences were not always statistically significant. Additionally, the effect sizes for anxiety, depression, and mindfulness were frequently large, indicating that the MBCT intervention may have had a clinically significant effect on participants. Limitations: Limitations include small sample size and the non-equivalent control group design. Conclusions: We demonstrated that MBCT has potential as an adjunctive, non-pharmacological treatment for postpartum depression/anxiety that does not wholly remit with pharmacotherapy.

"The effect of fecal microbiota transplantation on psychiatric symptoms among patients with irritable bowel syndrome, functional diarrhea and functional constipation: An open-label observational study","Backgrounds: The intestinal microbiota is considered as a potential common underpinning pathophysiology of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGIDs) and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) has been reported to have therapeutic effects on diseases related to dysbiosis, but few studies have evaluated its effect on psychiatric symptoms. Methods: We followed 17 patients with either Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Functional Diarrhea (FDr) or Functional Constipation (FC) who underwent FMT for the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms and observation of psychiatric symptoms. Changes in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and subscale of sleep-related items, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) between baseline and 4 weeks after FMT, and relationship with the intestinal microbiota were measured. Results: At baseline, 12 out of 17 patients were rated with HAM-D ≥ 8. Significant improvement in HAM-D total and sleep subscale score, HAM-A and QIDS were observed ( p = 0.007, p = 0.007, p = 0.01, p = 0.007, respectively). Baseline Shannon index indicated that microbiota showed lower diversity in patients with HAM-D ≥ 8 compared to those of healthy donors and patients with HAM-D &lt; 8. There was a significant correlation between baseline Shannon index and HAM-D score, and a correlation between Shannon index change and HAM-D improvement after FMT. Limitations: The small sample size with no control group. Conclusions: Our results suggest that depression and anxiety symptoms may be improved by FMT regardless of gastrointestinal symptom change in patients with IBS, FDr and FC, and the increase of microbiota diversity may help to improve patient's mood.

The course of anxiety in persons with dementia in Norwegian nursing homes: A 12-month follow-up study,"Background: Knowledge is scarce about the course of anxiety in persons with dementia (PWD) in nursing homes. This study aimed to describe the course of anxiety, anxiety symptoms, and the correlates of change in the Norwegian version of the Rating Anxiety in Dementia scale (RAID-N) score in PWD in nursing homes. Methods: Using the RAID-N, anxiety was assessed in 298 PWD aged 65 years and above from 17 Norwegian nursing homes. The assessments were made at baseline and after a mean follow-up period of 350 days (SD 12.3). Associations between the change in RAID-N score and demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed with multilevel regression models. Results: At 12 months, 93 participants (31.2%) had died. There was no significant change in the proportion of participants with anxiety, defined as RAID-N score ≥ 12, from baseline (33.7%) to follow-up (31.2%) (McNemar, p = 0.597). “Motor tension”, “frightened and anxious”, and “irritability” were the most frequent anxiety symptoms among those with dementia and anxiety. A higher Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) sub-syndrome affective baseline score and more use of anxiolytics were associated with reduction in RAID-N score, whereas a higher NPI-Q sub-syndrome aroused baseline score and more use of antipsychotics were associated with an increase in RAID-N score at follow-up. Limitations: The study did not control for ongoing treatment or changes of comorbidities. Conclusions: Anxiety and anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent among PWD in nursing homes over a12-month period. The symptoms “motor tension”, “frightened and anxious”, and “irritability” require attention in screening for anxiety.

Psychometric properties of the social anxiety subscale of the Youth Anxiety Measure for DSM-5 (YAM-5-I-SAD) in a clinical sample of Spanish-speaking adolescents,"Background: The Youth Anxiety Measure-I for DSM-5 has recently been developed to assess youth's anxiety symptomatology. As social anxiety is one of the most common disorders in adolescence, this scale includes a subscale measuring social anxiety. However, psychometric properties of the YAM-5-I social anxiety subscale (YAM-5-I-SAD) in clinical samples are lacking. This paper aims to bridge the gap. Methods: The sample comprised 24 clinically diagnosed and 24 healthy control Spanish-speaking adolescents aged 14–17 years. Results: Data revealed that the YAM-5- I-SAD yielded excellent sensitivity, which makes it particularly useful as a screening tool to early detect socially anxious adolescents. In addition, the YAM-5-I-SAD evidenced good internal consistency and construct validity. Limitations: Data are limited to the social anxiety subscale. Conclusions: The YAM-5-I-SAD is a sensitive and specific measure to screen for adolescents with social anxiety.

PI3K-AKT-GSK3β-CREB signaling pathway regulates anxiety-like behavior in rats following alcohol withdrawal,"Background: Alcohol abuse and anxiety disorders often occur concurrently, but their underlying cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Neuroadaptation within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) have been implicated in the molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol drinking behavior and withdrawal. Methods: A chronic alcohol exposure rat model (35 consecutive days of 10% alcohol intake and 48 h of withdrawal) was established, then, wortmannin (0.5 µg/side) was injected bilaterally into the mPFC. The elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT) were used to assess anxiety-like behavior. Western blot assays were used to assess protein levels. Results: We found that anxiety-like behavior peaked approximately 6 h after alcohol withdrawal. However, wortmannin greatly decreased alcohol intake and attenuated anxiety-like behavior in the alcohol exposure rats. Moreover, the PI3K-AKT-GSK3β signaling pathway was activated after alcohol withdrawal, and phosphorylation of the downstream cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) was increased. Wortmannin uniformly reversed PI3K-AKT-GSK3β-CREB pathway phosphorylation. Limitations: The downstream GSK3β activity was not intervened and a single dose level of wortmannin was used. Conclusion: Our results suggest that activating the PI3K-AKT-GSK3β-CREB pathway in the mPFC is an important contributor to the molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol withdrawal. PI3K signaling pathway inhibitors are thus potential candidates for treating alcohol abuse.

The mediation roles of discrepancy stress and self-esteem between masculine role discrepancy and mental health problems,"Introduction: Masculine role discrepancy and discrepancy stress occur when men perceive that they fail to live up to the ideal manhood derived from societal prescriptions. The present study examined the associations between masculine role discrepancy and two emotional and mental health problems (social anxiety and depressive symptoms), and potential mediation effects through discrepancy stress and self-esteem in a male general population. Methods: Based on random population-based sampling, 2000 male residents in Hong Kong were interviewed. Levels of masculine role discrepancy, discrepancy stress, self-esteem, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms were assessed by using validated scales. Results: Results of structural equation modeling analysis indicated that the proposed model fit the sample well. (χ²(118) = 832.34, p &lt; .05, CFI = 0.94, NNFI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.06). Those who were young, single and less educated were vulnerable to masculine role discrepancy, discrepancy stress, and emotional/mental health problems. We found that discrepancy stress significantly mediated the association between masculine role discrepancy and social anxiety, while self-esteem significantly mediated the associations between masculine role discrepancy and both social anxiety and depression. Limitations: Study limitations mainly included the cross-sectional design and reliance on self-reported questionnaires. Conclusions: The associations between masculine discrepancy and social anxiety/depressive symptoms among men may be explained by the increase in discrepancy stress and decrease in self-esteem. The findings suggest needs and directions for future research for the relationship between masculine role discrepancy and men's mental health, mechanisms involved, and interventions for improvement.

Gender-specific associations of depression and anxiety symptoms with mental rotation,"Background: Men score higher on mental rotation tasks compared to women and suffer from depression and anxiety at half the rate of women. The objective of this study was to confirm the gender-specific effects of depression and anxiety on mental rotation performance. Methods: We collected data in non-experimental conditions from 325 university students at three universities. Participants completed rating scales of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and then simultaneously performed a mental rotation task using tablet devices. Results: We observed no significant difference between men and women in the depressive and anxiety symptoms and task response time. Men had a significantly higher correct answer rate compared with women. The scores of depression and anxiety of all participants were positively correlated. Task response time correlated positively with intensity of depressive symptoms and anxiety in women, but not in men. Women with high depressive symptoms had significantly longer response times than did women with low depressive symptoms, while men had no differences due to depressive symptoms. Limitations: We did not directly examine brain functions; therefore, the underlying neurobiological results are only based on previous knowledge and action data. Conclusions: The pathology of depression and anxiety was reflected in the correct answer rate and response time in relation to the gender difference of brain function used in mental rotation.

Temperamental factors in remitted depression: The role of effortful control and attentional mechanisms,"Background: Temperamental effortful control and attentional networks are increasingly viewed as important underlying processes in depression and anxiety. However, it is still unknown whether these factors facilitate depressive and anxiety symptoms in the general population and, more specifically, in remitted depressed individuals. Methods: We investigated to what extent effortful control and attentional networks (i.e., Attention Network Task) explain concurrent depressive and anxious symptoms in healthy individuals ( n = 270) and remitted depressed individuals ( n = 90). Both samples were highly representative of the US population. Results: Increased effortful control predicted a substantial decrease in symptoms of both depression and anxiety in the whole sample, whereas decreased efficiency of executive attention predicted a modest increase in depressive symptoms. Remitted depressed individuals did not show less effortful control nor less efficient attentional networks than healthy individuals. Moreover, clinical status did not moderate the relationship between temperamental factors and either depressive or anxiety symptoms. Limitations: Limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the study. Conclusions: Our study shows that temperamental effortful control represents an important transdiagnostic process for depressive and anxiety symptoms in adults.

A naturalistic examination of the perceived effects of cannabis on negative affect,"Background: Cannabis is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of negative affect. However, a paucity of research has examined the acute effects of cannabis on negative affect in everyday life. The current study provides a naturalistic account of perceived changes in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress as a function of dose and concentration of Δ⁹tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Method: Data from the app Strainprint TM (which provides medical cannabis users a means of tracking changes in symptoms as a function of different doses and chemotypes of cannabis) were analyzed using multilevel modeling. In total, 11,953 tracked sessions were analyzed (3,151 for depression, 5,085 for anxiety, and 3,717 for stress). Results: Medical cannabis users perceived a 50% reduction in depression and a 58% reduction in anxiety and stress following cannabis use. Two puffs were sufficient to reduce ratings of depression and anxiety, while 10 + puffs produced the greatest perceived reductions in stress. High CBD (&gt; 9.5%)/low THC (&lt; 5.5%) cannabis was associated with the largest changes in depression ratings, while high CBD (&gt; 11%)/high THC (&gt; 26.5%) cannabis produced the largest perceived changes in stress. No changes in the perceived efficacy of cannabis were detected across time. However, baseline symptoms of depression (but not anxiety or stress) appeared to be exacerbated across time/tracked sessions. Limitations: The primary limitations are the self-selected nature of the sample and the inability to control for expectancy effects. Conclusions: Cannabis reduces perceived symptoms of negative affect in the short-term, but continued use may exacerbate baseline symptoms of depression over time.

Prospective predictors of first-onset depressive disorders in adolescent females with anxiety disorders,"Background: Anxious youth are at increased risk for later depressive disorders, but not all anxious youth develop depression. Sequential comorbidity models emphasize shared risk factors and anxiety sequelae, but some anxious youth who later develop depression may have risk factors that are relatively specific to depression, in addition to a liability to anxiety. We examined several variables that appear relatively specific to risk for depression—the personality traits of low positive affectivity and high sadness, and an electrophysiological measure of blunted response to reward—in predicting first-onset depressive disorders and depressive symptoms in clinically anxious adolescent girls. Methods: A sample of 114 adolescents with baseline anxiety disorders completed personality and psychopathology measures, psychophysiology tasks, and diagnostic interviews. Interviews and a measure of depressive symptoms were re-administered over 27 months. Results: After controlling for baseline depressive symptoms, blunted reward sensitivity uniquely predicted first-onset depressive disorders and depressive symptoms 27 months later. Post-hoc analyses indicated that blunted reward sensitivity only predicted first-onset depressive disorders and depressive symptoms in girls with high social anxiety symptoms. Limitations: Analyses were unable to account for concurrent anxiety symptoms and disorders. Conclusions: The depression-specific risk factor, blunted reward sensitivity, may comprise one pathway to subsequent depressive disorders and symptoms in anxious youth and indicate which anxious youth need intervention to prevent later depression, particularly in socially anxious girls.

Anxiety disorders and figural fluency: A measure of executive function,"Background: Anxiety possibly interferes with executive functioning, although most studies rely on anxiety symptoms or lack control for comorbid depression. The objective of the present study is to examine the association between executive functioning and (individual) anxiety disorders with ak,ld without controlling for depression. Method: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder with and without agoraphobia, agoraphobia, social phobia, as well as depressive disorder according to DSM-IV criteria were assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview in 82,360 community-dwelling people participating in the Lifelines cohort. Figural fluency as a measure of executive functioning was assessed with the Ruff Figural Fluency Test (RFTT). Linear regression analyses with the RFFT score as the dependent variable and psychiatric diagnosis as independent variables (dummies) were performed, adjusted for potential confounders. Multivariate results are presented with and without adjustment for depression. Results: Presence of any anxiety disorder was associated with worse performance on the RFFT (B = − 0.78, SE = 0.32, p = .015), independent of depression. No dose-response relationship with the number of anxiety disorders was found. Only agoraphobia and generalized anxiety disorder were significantly associated with the RFFT score in the multivariate models. Agoraphobia remained significant when further adjusted for depressive disorder (B = − 1.14, SE = 0.41, p &lt; .01), while GAD did not (B = 0.013, SE = 0.431, p = .975). Limitations: Executive function was tested by only one measure, namely figural fluency. Conclusion: Agoraphobia is associated with worse executive functioning. Treatment of agoraphobia could be influenced by the executive dysfunction which clinicians should be aware of when regular treatment fails.

"Generalized anxiety disorder in urban China: Prevalence, awareness, and disease burden","Introduction: Limited published research has quantified the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) prevalence and its burden in China. This study aimed to fill in the knowledge gap and to evaluate the burden of GAD among adults in urban China. Methods: This study utilized existing data from the China National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS) 2012–2013. Prevalence of self-reported diagnosed and undiagnosed GAD was estimated. Diagnosed and undiagnosed GAD respondents were compared with non-anxious respondents in terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), resource utilization, and work productivity and activity impairment using multivariate generalized linear models. A multivariate logistic model assessed the risk factors for GAD. Results: The prevalence of undiagnosed/diagnosed GAD was 5.3% in urban China with only 0.5% of GAD respondents reporting a diagnosis. Compared with non-anxious respondents, both diagnosed and undiagnosed GAD respondents had significantly lower HRQoL, more work productivity and activity impairment, and greater healthcare resource utilization in the past six months. Age, gender, marital status, income level, insurance status, smoking, drinking and exercise behaviors, and comorbidity burdens were significantly associated with GAD. Limitations: This was a patient-reported study; data are therefore subject to recall bias. The survey was limited to respondents in urban China; therefore, these results focused on urban China and may be under- or over-estimating GAD prevalence in China. Causal inferences cannot be made given the cross-sectional nature of the study. Conclusions: GAD may be substantially under-diagnosed in urban China. More healthcare resources should be invested to alleviate the burden of GAD.

Trajectories of maternal stress and anxiety from pregnancy to three years and child development at 3 years of age: Findings from the All Our Families (AOF) pregnancy cohort,"Background: Existing literature on maternal distress has focused on stress and anxiety during the pregnancy or postnatally and their relationship with child development. However, few studies have investigated the association between maternal stress and anxiety symptoms over time and child development in preschool children. The aim of this study was to examine the association between trajectories of maternal stress and anxiety symptoms from mid-pregnancy to three years postpartum and child development at age three years. Methods: Data were analyzed from 1983 mother-child dyads who participated in the three year follow-up of the All Our Families (AOF) study. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify trajectories of women's stress and anxiety across from mid-pregnancy to three years postpartum. Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between the stress and anxiety trajectories and child developmental delays while adjusting for the covariates. Results: LCA identified three distinct trajectories of maternal stress and anxiety symptoms over time. Multivariate analysis showed mothers assigned to the high anxiety symptoms class had an increased risk (adjusted OR 2.80, 95% CI 2.80 (1.42─5.51), p = 0.003) of having a child with developmental delays at 3 years. Limitations: The use of self-reported maternal mental health symptoms and no data on fathers’ mental health are our study's limitations. Conclusions: The findings from a population-based Canadian sample provide empirical support for a relationship between maternal anxiety overtime and risk of child developmental delays. Identifying and supporting mothers experiencing high anxiety symptoms in the perinatal period may mitigate the risk of these delays in children.

A computerized version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 as an ultra-brief screening tool to detect emotional disorders in primary care,"Background: The Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) is an ultra-brief self-report consisting of a 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2) and a 2-item anxiety scale (GAD-2). The aim of the present study is to determine the psychometric properties of a computerized version of the PHQ-4 used to detect emotional disorders (anxiety and depression) in the primary care setting. Method: A total of 1052 patients with suspected anxiety, depression, or somatic symptoms were recruited from 28 primary care centres participating in the PsicAP trial and completed the full version of the computerized PHQ. In addition, 178 of these patients also underwent in clinical interviews as a gold standard. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses showed very good fit indices for a two-factor solution. This model was structurally invariant among the various age and gender groups and internal consistency was acceptable (PHQ-4; α = .83, PHQ-2; α = .86, and GAD-2; α = .76). The best cut-off points to obtain high sensitivity values was 3, on both the PHQ-2 (major depressive disorder) and the GAD-2 (generalized anxiety disorder). The criterion validity (sensitivity and specificity) for the PHQ-2 were .90 and .61 and for the GAD-2, .88 and 0.61. Limitations: The study was not designed as a prevalence study. Therefore, does not contain information on patients whose general practitioners do not consider them to suffer emotional disorders. Conclusion: This is the first study to provide evidence for the reliability and validity of a computerized version of the PHQ-4. This computerized tool can be used to detect depression and anxiety in a primary care setting.

Genome-wide QTL analysis for anxiety trait in bipolar disorder type I,"Background: Genetic studies have been consistent that bipolar disorder type I (BPI) runs in families and that this familial aggregation is strongly influenced by genes. In a preliminary study, we proved that anxiety trait meets endophenotype criteria for BPI. Methods: We assessed 619 individuals from the Central Valley of Costa Rica (CVCR) who have received evaluation for anxiety following the same methodological procedure used for the initial pilot study. Our goal was to conduct a multipoint quantitative trait linkage analysis to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to anxiety trait in subjects with BPI. We conducted the statistical analyses using Quantitative Trait Loci method (Variance-components models), implemented in Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines (SOLAR), using 5606 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). Results: We identified a suggestive linkage signal with a LOD score of 2.01 at chromosome 2 (2q13-q14). Limitations: Since confounding factors such as substance abuse, medical illness and medication history were not assessed in our study, these conclusions should be taken as preliminary. Conclusions: We conclude that region 2q13-q14 may harbor a candidate gene(s) with an important role in the pathophysiology of BPI and anxiety.

Temporal dynamics and longitudinal co-occurrence of depression and different anxiety syndromes in youth: Evidence for reciprocal patterns in a 3-year prospective study,"Background: Depression is highly comorbid with anxiety in youth. It is frequently reported that anxiety precedes depression; however, evidence surrounding the temporal precedence of anxiety over depression is mixed. Many studies of anxiety-depression co-occurrence lump distinct forms of anxiety, obscuring information regarding trajectories of specific anxiety syndromes. This study sought to more accurately describe the development of anxiety and depression over time by moving beyond the question of temporal precedence to investigate a developmentally dynamic model of anxiety-depression co-occurrence. Methods: A community sample of 665 youth ( M = 11.8, SD = 2.4; 55% female) completed repeated self-report measures of depression and anxiety (social, physical, and separation anxiety) over a 3-year longitudinal study. Prospective associations between distinct syndromes of anxiety with depression were analyzed using an autoregressive cross-lagged path model over four time points. Results: Physical symptoms and depression symptoms reciprocally predicted each other, above and beyond the stability of either domain. Social anxiety and depression symptoms similarly predicted each other in a systematic pattern. Limitations: Our study is limited in its generalizability to other forms of anxiety, like worry. Additional research is needed to determine whether similar patterns exist in clinical populations, and whether these processes maintain symptoms once they reach diagnostic levels. Conclusions: The development of syndromes of depression, physical, and social anxiety during childhood and adolescence occurs in a predictable, systematic reciprocal pattern, rather than sequentially and unidirectionally (i.e., anxiety syndromes precede depression). Results are clinically useful for predicting risk for disorder, and demonstrate the necessity of tracking symptom levels across domains.

Inflammatory markers as predictors of depression and anxiety in adolescents: Statistical model building with component-wise gradient boosting,"Background: Immune system abnormalities have been repeatedly observed in several psychiatric disorders, including severe depression and anxiety. However, whether specific immune mediators play an early role in the etiopathogenesis of these disorders remains unknown. Methods: In a longitudinal design, component-wise gradient boosting was used to build models of depression, assessed by the Mood-Feelings Questionnaire-Child (MFQC), and anxiety, assessed by the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) in 254 adolescents from a large set of candidate predictors, including sex, race, 39 inflammatory proteins, and the interactions between those proteins and time. Each model was reduced via backward elimination to maximize parsimony and generalizability. Results: Component-wise gradient boosting and model reduction found that female sex, growth- regulated oncogene (GRO), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) predicted depression, while female sex predicted anxiety. Limitations: Differential onset of puberty as well as a lack of control for menstrual cycle may also have been responsible for differences between males and females in the present study. In addition, investigation of all possible nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the outcomes was beyond the computational capacity and scope of the present research. Conclusions: This study highlights the need for novel statistical modeling to identify reliable biological predictors of aberrant psychological behavior.

A systematic review of the associations between maternal nutritional biomarkers and depression and/or anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum,"Background: Nutritional requirements need to be met in order to adapt to pre- and postnatal changes. Our aim was to systematically review the evidence of associations between nutritional biomarkers and psychological distress during pregnancy and in the first postnatal year. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scielo, LILACS, clinicaltrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched for articles from inception to 4/15/2016. Studies of maternal nutritional biomarkers in blood (fatty acids/micronutrients/amino acids) and associations with psychological distress (depression/anxiety/stress) were included. Two independent reviewers extracted data based on study designs, participants, outcomes, exposures, and association measures. Results: Thirty-eight studies were included. A total of 13 studies showed divergent or no associations between serum/plasma/erythrocyte fatty acid concentrations and depression/anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum. Changes in serum cholesterol levels from pregnancy to postpartum showed a significant inverse correlation with depression in one out of three studies. Five out of seven studies found an inverse association between serum vitamin D levels and pre- and postnatal depression. Plasma tryptophan levels were inversely correlated with postnatal depression scores in three out of four studies. We identified that one out of two studies presented no significant association between vitamin B₁₂/folate/ferritin concentrations and depression in postpartum. Limitations: There was higher variability between association measures, time and scales of depression and anxiety assessments. Conclusions: The majority of high-quality studies suggest that lower vitamin D levels may be associated with postpartum depression. However, further evidence is needed for guiding clinical practice on nutritional biomarkers.

High levels of mitochondrial DNA are associated with adolescent brain structural hypoconnectivity and increased anxiety but not depression,"Background: Adolescent anxiety and depression are highly prevalent psychiatric disorders that are associated with altered molecular and neurocircuit profiles. Recently, increased mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-cn) has been found to be associated with several psychopathologies in adults, especially anxiety and depression. The associations between mtDNA-cn and anxiety and depression have not, however, been investigated in adolescents. Moreover, to date there have been no studies examining associations between mtDNA-cn and brain network alterations in mood disorders in any age group. Methods: The first aim of this study was to compare salivary mtDNA-cn between 49 depressed and/or anxious adolescents and 35 well-matched healthy controls. The second aim of this study was to identify neural correlates of mtDNA-cn derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography, in the full sample of adolescents. Results: There were no diagnosis-specific alterations in mtDNA-cn. However, there was a positive correlation between mtDNA-cn and levels of anxiety, but not depression, in the full sample of adolescents. A subnetwork of connections largely corresponding to the left fronto-occipital fasciculus had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in adolescents with higher than median mtDNA-cn. Limitations: Undifferentiated analysis of free and intracellular mtDNA and use of DTI-based tractography represent this study's limitations. Conclusions: The results of this study help elucidate the relationships between clinical symptoms, molecular changes, and neurocircuitry alterations in adolescents with and without anxiety and depression, and they suggest that increased mtDNA-cn is associated both with increased anxiety symptoms and with decreased fronto-occipital structural connectivity in this population.

State-trait anxiety levels during pregnancy and foetal parameters following intervention with music therapy,"Background: Research indicates that anxiety during pregnancy may be a risk factor for the development of alterations in the mental health of the pregnant woman and of obstetric complications. Objective: to investigate the effect of music therapy on maternal anxiety, before and after a non-stress test (NST), and the effect of maternal anxiety on the birthing process and birth size. Methods: 409 nulliparous women coming for routine prenatal care were randomized in the third trimester to receive either music therapy (n = 204) or no music therapy (n = 205) during an NST. Maternal anxiety was assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory before and after the NST. Results: After the NST, the women from the music group showed significantly lower scores in state anxiety (OR = 0.87; p &lt; 0.001) as well as trait anxiety (p &lt; 0.001) than the control group. Furthermore, the pregnant women from the music group presented lower levels of state-trait anxiety than the control group in relation to the variables of birth process, and higher birth weight and chest circumference in the newborn (OR = 3.5 and OR = 0.81, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: This study was limited by the fact that it was a single-centre study; the observers conducting the NST were not blinded to the allocation, although neither midwife had any knowledge of the maternal anxiety scores, and we could not apply the double-blind method due to the nature of the observation. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that music therapy intervention during pregnancy could reduce elevated state-trait anxiety levels during the third trimester. Further research into the influence of music therapy as intervention on maternal anxiety and on the birthing process and birth size is required during pregnancy.

"Transdiagnostic assessment of repetitive negative thinking and responses to positive affect: Structure and predictive utility for depression, anxiety, and mania symptoms","Background: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a cognitive process that is repetitive, passive, relatively uncontrollable, and focused on negative content, and is elevated in emotional disorders including depression and anxiety disorders. Repetitive positive thinking is associated with bipolar disorder symptoms. The unique contributions of positive versus negative repetitive thinking to emotional symptoms are unknown. The first aim of this study was to use confirmatory factor analyses to evaluate the psychometrics of two transdiagnostic measures of RNT, the Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire (RTQ-10) and Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ), and a measure of repetitive positive thinking, the Responses to Positive Affect (RPA) Questionnaire. The second aim was to determine incremental predictive utility of these measures. Method: All measures were administered to a sample of 2088 undergraduate students from the Netherlands ( n = 992), Australia ( n = 698), and America ( n = 398). Results: Unidimensional, bifactor, and three-factor models were supported for the RTQ-10, PTQ, and RPA, respectively. A common factor measured by all PTQ items explained most variance in PTQ scores suggesting that this measure is essentially unidimensional. The RNT factor of the RTQ-10 demonstrated the strongest predictive utility, although the PTQ was also uniquely although weakly associated with anxiety, depression, and mania symptoms. The RPA dampening factor uniquely predicted anxiety and depression symptoms, suggesting that this scale is a separable process to RNT as measured by the RTQ-10 and PTQ. Limitations: Findings were cross-sectional and need to be replicated in clinical samples. Conclusions: Transdiagnostic measures of RNT are essentially unidimensional, whereas RPA is multidimensional. RNT and RPA have unique predictive utility. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2018
12-month prevalence and concomitants of DSM-IV depression and anxiety disorders in two violence-prone cities in Brazil,"Background: Estimating 12-month prevalence of depression, anxiety, and comorbid anxiety/depression in noninstitutionalized adults (age 15–75) in two violence-prone cities. Methods: The Composite International Diagnostic Interview v2.1 (Portuguese), administered in population-representative surveys (age 15–75) in São Paulo (N = 2536) and Rio de Janeiro (N = 1208), yielded 12-month prevalence of violent events experienced, and DSM-IV diagnoses of depression and anxiety, which were classified into mutually exclusive groups: 1) no anxiety/depression; 2) anxiety only; 3) depression only; 4) comorbid anxiety/depression. Weighted analyses estimated 12-month prevalence, multinomial logistic regression compared the demographic characteristics of the diagnosis groups, and association with experienced violence. Results: Twelve-month prevalence of anxiety alone, depression alone, and comorbid anxiety/depression was 12.7% (of whom 24.9% were also depressed), 4.9% (of whom 46.2% had anxiety), and 4.2% respectively for São Paulo; and 12.1% (18.2% of whom were depressed), 4.6% (37.0% with anxiety), and 2.7% respectively for Rio de Janeiro. All conditions were approximately twice as prevalent in women than in men in both cities. In São Paulo, comorbidity was associated with age under 60, depression alone was more prevalent among 30–59 year olds, but in 23–29 year-olds in Rio de Janeiro. Exposure to violence increased the odds of anxiety, depression, and their comorbidity. With rare exception, marital status, education, and race/ethnicity were not associated with anxiety, depression, or their comorbidity. Limitations: Cross-sectional design. Conclusions: Prevalence rates for all conditions were high, and particularly associated with exposure to violence. Means to ameliorate violence, and its mental health effects, particularly for women, are needed.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of interpersonal psychotherapy for perinatal women,"Background: Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) has demonstrated efficacy for the prevention and treatment of perinatal depression. Previous systematic reviews have not evaluated the effects of IPT on other outcomes, most notably symptoms of anxiety and interpersonal functioning, or assessed moderators of treatment efficacy specific to IPT. Method: A systematic review identified 28 studies assessing the efficacy of IPT during pregnancy or the first year postpartum. Random effects meta-analyses assessed the average change in outcomes (depression, anxiety, relationship quality, social adjustment, and social support) from pre- to post-treatment, the difference in the change in outcomes between treatment and comparison conditions, and the difference in prevalence of depressive episodes between treatment and comparison conditions. Study, intervention, and sample characteristics were evaluated as potential moderators of effect sizes. Results: In prevention studies, IPT was effective for reducing depressive symptoms and the prevalence of depressive episodes. In treatment studies, IPT reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety and improved relationship quality, social adjustment and social support. Few significant moderators were identified, and results of moderation analyses were inconsistent across outcomes. Limitations: There are insufficient studies to evaluate the effects of preventive IPT on anxiety and interpersonal outcomes. Analyses of potential moderators were limited by the number of studies available for subgroup comparisons. Conclusions: IPT is an effective preventive intervention for perinatal depression. IPT is clearly effective for treating depressive symptoms and promising as a treatment for anxiety and improving interpersonal functioning. Further research is necessary to assess whether adaptations to IPT enhance its efficacy.

The influence of comorbid anxiety on the effectiveness of Cognitive Therapy and Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Major Depressive Disorder,"Background: Anxious depression is an important subtype of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) defined by both syndromal (anxiety disorders) and dimensional (anxiety symptoms) criteria. A debated question is how anxiety affects MDD treatment. This study examined the impact of comorbid anxiety disorders and symptoms on the effectiveness of and dropout during Cognitive Therapy (CT) and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for MDD. Methods: Depressed individuals were randomized to CT ( n = 76) or IPT ( n = 75). Outcome was depression severity measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at the start of each therapy session, post treatment, and monthly up to five months follow-up. Anxiety disorders were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, (phobic) anxiety symptoms were assessed with Brief Symptom Inventory subscales. Results: Approximately one third of participants had a comorbid anxiety disorder. Comorbid anxiety disorders and anxiety symptoms were associated with less favorable depression change during IPT as compared to CT in the treatment phase, but not in the trial follow-up phase. Individuals with a comorbid anxiety disorder had significantly higher treatment dropout during both treatments. Limitations: Not all therapists and participants were blind to the assessment of comorbid anxiety disorders and the assessments were performed by one rater. Conclusions: A preference for CT over IPT for MDD is justifiable when comorbid anxiety is present, although long-term differences are not established and replication of this finding is needed. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of dropout for depressed individuals with an anxiety disorder.

A systematic review of the association of anxiety with health care utilization and costs in people aged 65 years and older,"Theoretical background: In older people, anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders and a high proportion suffers from clinically relevant anxiety symptoms. Despite studies suggesting an association of anxiety with health care utilization (HCU) and a resulting economic burden to the health care system, we found no review systematically analyzing evidence on this association in older people. Objective: To analyze and synthesize evidence on the association of anxiety disorders and symptoms with HCU and costs in people aged 65 years and over in a systematic review. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed literature was conducted in three electronic databases. Additional references were identified through reference lists of included studies. Inclusion criteria were: studies reporting the association of anxiety disorders or symptoms with HCU or costs, specifically in people aged 65 years and over, with observational study design, in German or English language. Findings were synthesized qualitatively and study quality was assessed. Results: N = 15 studies (HCU n = 10, costs n = 5) were included in the final synthesis. Overall, studies either reported significantly increased HCU in anxiety disorders compared to a healthy comparison group/according to degree of symptoms, or found no significant association between these variables. Total excess costs for anxiety disorders ranged from -116 to 19,003 $PPP per year. Limitations: Differences in methodology limited the comparability of included studies. Conclusion: Most studies suggest an increased economic burden due to anxiety in older people. Studies using standardized instruments are needed.

Towards an evidence-based unified psychodynamic protocol for emotional disorders,"Background: In psychotherapy research unified, transdiagnostic and modular treatments have emerged. This is true for both cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy. Recently, two unified psychodynamic protocols were presented, one for anxiety disorders, another for depressive disorders. Integrating the treatment principles for these two highly prevalent disorder groups into one protocol for ""emotional disorders"" may be useful for both clinical practice and training in psychotherapy. Methods: After updating the evidence for psychodynamic therapy in anxiety and depressive disorders in terms of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by a systematic search, the treatment elements applied in those RCTs providing evidence for the efficacy of psychodynamic therapy in depressive or anxiety disorders were reviewed and compared. Results: Twenty-seven RCTs for anxiety or depressive disorders were identified. A review revealed a high overlap between the principles used for the psychodynamic treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders, reflecting the transdiagnostic nature of psychodynamic therapy. The overlap suggested to integrate the identified treatment principles into one unified psychodynamic protocol for ""emotional disorders"" (UPP-EMO). As a result, seven treatment principles or modules were distilled which can be flexibly applied depending on the patient´s symptoms and needs. In addition, a separate module addresses diagnostic assessment. Across modules, a focus on resources has been included. Limitations: Despite being based on RCTs, UPP-EMO has not yet been examined in an RCT—which is planned as a next step. Conclusions: As psychodynamic therapy is transdiagnostic in origin focusing on core underlying processes of mental disorders, acceptability of UPP-EMO among psychodynamic psychotherapists is likely to be high.

"affron®, a standardised extract from saffron (Crocus sativus L.) for the treatment of youth anxiety and depressive symptoms: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study","Background: Saffron has antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in adults with mild-to-moderate depression. However, this is the first study examining its mood-related effects in teenagers. Methods: In this 8-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, youth aged 12–16 years, with mild-to-moderate anxiety or depressive symptoms were given tablets containing placebo or a saffron extract (affron®, 14 mg b.i.d). The youth and parent versions of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) were used as outcome measures. Results: 80 participants were enrolled and 68 completed the study. Based on youth self-reports, affron® was associated with greater improvements in overall internalising symptoms (p = 0.049), separation anxiety (p = 0.003), social phobia (p = 0.023), and depression (p = 0.016). Total internalising scores decreased by an average of 33% compared to 17% in the placebo group (p = 0.029). However, parental reports of improvements were inconsistent as mean improvements in RCADS scores were greater in the saffron group (40% vs 26%) (p = 0.026), although no other significant differences were identified. affron® was well-tolerated and there was a trend of reduced headaches in participants on the active treatment. Limitations: The use of a self-report instrument, limited study duration, single treatment dose, and non-clinical sample used in this study limit the generalisability of study findings. Conclusion: The administration of a standardised saffron extract (affron®) for 8 weeks improved anxiety and depressive symptoms in youth with mild-to-moderate symptoms, at least from the perspective of the adolescent. However, these beneficial effects were inconsistently corroborated by parents.

"Course, risk factors, and mental health outcomes of excessive daytime sleepiness in rural Chinese adolescents: A one-year prospective study","Background: This study aimed to examine the one-year incidence and persistence of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in rural Chinese adolescents and their risk factors. In addition, we also aimed to explore the potential bidirectional associations of EDS with anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms. Methods: A total of 3736 adolescents from 5 high schools from rural area in the south China were eligible for follow-up. Among them, 2787 responded to follow-up after one year. EDS was defined as having a total score of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale over 10. Results: The one-year persistence rate and incidence rate of EDS were 27.6% and 9.3%, respectively. After controlling for age and sex, new incident EDS was significantly associated with perceived high study stress, depressive symptoms, insomnia symptoms, and high life events at baseline. Baseline EDS predicted new onsets of depression and anxiety at follow-up. Cross-lagged analyses further revealed that there were bidirectional associations between EDS and anxiety symptom and between EDS and depressive symptoms. Persistent EDS was only associated with eveningness chronotype. In particular, short sleep duration and obesity were associated with neither new incidence nor persistence of EDS in this population. Limitations: All measures relied on self-reported questionnaires rather than objective assessments, which might have led to report bias. Conclusions: We have identified a number of risk factors of the one-year incidence of EDS (such as perceived high study stress, depressive symptoms, insomnia symptoms, and high life events) and persistence of EDS (eveningness chronotype) in rural adolescents. There is a reciprocal relationship of EDS with anxiety and depression. In this population, sleep loss and obesity seem not related to the course of EDS.

Exploring the pathway from anxiety sensitivity intervention to suicide risk reduction: Chained mediation through anxiety and depressive symptoms,"Background: The suicide rate in the Unites States continues to increase suggesting novel intervention strategies are needed. Anxiety sensitivity (AS), or a fear of anxiety-related sensations, is a suicide risk factor that can be ameliorated via a single-session, computerized intervention called the Cognitive Anxiety Sensitivity Treatment (CAST). Results from randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that reductions in suicidal ideation (SI) due to CAST were mediated by AS reductions. However, a more detailed analysis of the mechanisms of SI reduction due to AS interventions is needed to further our understanding of theoretical models of AS and suicide, and to refine AS treatments. Methods: Participants ( N = 74) with co-occurring anxiety pathology and SI were randomized to a single-session computerized treatment (CAST + cognitive bias modification) or a control intervention. Assessments were conducted immediately post treatment, and at 1 month and 4 month follow-ups. Results: Chained mediation models revealed significant reductions in SI (month 4 follow-up) through AS (post-treatment) and subsequently anxiety symptoms (month 1 follow-up), but not depressive symptoms. There were no direct mediation effects through either AS or anxiety or depressive symptoms. Limitations: Limitations include self-report assessment of symptoms, a sample of only individuals with a diagnosed anxiety pathology, and exploratory nature of anxiety/depression dimension analyses. Conclusions: Results of the current study help clarify the mechanistic pathways of SI reduction due to an AS intervention, and suggest future work attempting to increase the efficacy of AS interventions should consider the potentially important role of downstream mechanisms that follow AS reduction.

Unique trajectories of anxiety among Chinese-Canadian women across the first postpartum year: A longitudinal cohort study,"Background: Our objectives were to identify subtypes of Chinese-Canadian women with unique trajectories of anxiety symptomatology over the first postpartum year, investigate covariates associated with group membership, and determine if mental healthcare utilization varies by group membership. Methods: This was a longitudinal cohort study of 570 Chinese immigrant and Canadian-born women in Toronto, Canada with live births in 2010–2014. Covariates were age, immigrant status, income, fatigue, social support, acculturative stress, and depression. Mental healthcare utilization included visits at 4–24 weeks postpartum. Anxiety symptomatology was measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify latent classes corresponding to trajectories of anxiety symptomology at 4–52 weeks. Results: Three groups were identified: “consistently non-anxious” (74%, stable low levels of anxiety), “consistently anxious” (19.5%, clinically meaningful anxiety at baseline and across time), and “anxious-improving” (6.5%, high anxiety at baseline followed by decline). Compared to consistently non-anxious women, consistently anxious women were more likely to report baseline fatigue, depression, and acculturative stress; anxious-improving women were more likely to report baseline fatigue, depression, and history of depression before pregnancy. At 12–24 weeks, 13.8% of anxious-improving women sought mental healthcare compared to 8.6% of consistently-anxious women and 4.7% of non-anxious women (p = .06). Limitations: Our sample comprised Chinese immigrant and Canadian-born women; results should be replicated in other groups. Conclusions: We identified three subtypes of postpartum anxiety trajectories. These groups of women may respond differently to interventions due to exposure to various combinations of risk factors.

Social and academic functioning in adolescents with anxiety disorders: A systematic review,"Background: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent during adolescence. Although literature points out that anxiety symptoms are related to problems in social and academic functioning, the extent of these problems among adolescents with clinical anxiety disorders has not been systematically reviewed before. Methods: Electronic databases were searched up to October 2017, with keywords representing anxiety disorders, adolescents, and social or academic functioning. The inclusion criteria were studies with a sample of adolescents (10–19 years) with anxiety disorders that provided data regarding their social or academic functioning. 3431 studies were examined, of which 19 met the inclusion criteria. Results: Adolescents with anxiety disorders had a lower social competence relative to their healthy peers. They reported more negativity within interpersonal relationships, higher levels of loneliness, and victimization. Most adolescents with anxiety disorders felt impaired at school, however, findings of their average school results, compared to peers, were mixed. In addition, they had a higher risk for school refusal and entered higher education less often. Impairments in social and academic functioning differed across type and the number of anxiety disorders. Limitations: Most studies examined social phobia or anxiety disorders in general and methodological approaches varied widely between studies. Conclusions: This systematic review indicates that adolescents with anxiety disorders experience a range of significant problems in both social and academic functioning. These findings suggest that the assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders in adolescence should focus on improving functioning across domains.

Do clinically anxious children cluster according to their expression of factors that maintain child anxiety?,"Background: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for childhood anxiety disorders, yet a significant proportion of children do not benefit from it. CBT for child anxiety disorders typically includes a range of strategies that may not all be applicable for all affected children. This study explored whether there are distinct subgroups of children with anxiety disorders who are characterized by their responses to measures of the key mechanisms that are targeted in CBT (i.e. interpretation bias, perceived control, avoidance, physiological arousal, and social communication). Methods: 379 clinically anxious children (7–12 years) provided indices of threat interpretation, perceived control, expected negative emotions and avoidance and measures of heart rate recovery following a speech task. Parents also reported on their children's social communication difficulties using the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). Results: Latent profile analysis identified three groups, reflecting (i) ‘Typically anxious’ (the majority of the sample and more likely to have Generalized anxiety disorder); (ii) ‘social difficulties’ (characterized by high SCQ and more likely to have social anxiety disorder and be male); (iii) ‘Avoidant’ (characterized by low threat interpretation but high avoidance and low perceived control). Limitations: Some measures may have been influenced by confounding variables (e.g. physical variability in heart rate recovery). Sample characteristics of the group may limit the generalizability of the results. Conclusions: Clinically anxious children appear to fall in to subgroups that might benefit from more targeted treatments that focus on specific maintenance factors. Treatment studies are now required to establish whether this approach would lead to more effective and efficient treatments.

Neurobiology of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in GAD: Aberrant neurometabolic correlation to hippocampus and relationship to anxiety sensitivity and IQ,"Introduction: The neurometabolism underlying the cognitive and affective symptoms associated with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) remain poorly understood. After we have linked worry to intelligence in patients with GAD, we hypothesized that aberrant neurometabolic correlations between hippocampus and neocortical regions may underlie a shared substrate in GAD patients for both anxiety sensitivity and intelligence. Methods: GAD patients (n = 16; F = 11) and healthy volunteers (n = 16; F = 10) were assessed using 1H-MRSI. Co-axial planes I [hippocampus (HIPP)] and co-axial plane III [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), central gyrus (CG)] were examined. Using general linear models, we examined resting metabolite concentrations using HIPP as a hub to CG and DLPFC. Neocortical ROIs were related to Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) and Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) in GAD patients versus controls. Results: Right hippocampal Cho/Cr directly predicted left DLPFC Cho/Cr in GAD (r = 0.75), an effect distinguishable (p = 0.0004) from controls. Left HIPP Cho/Cr positively predicted left CG Cho/Cr in GAD, an effect distinguishable from controls. In patients, both left and right DLPFC Cho/Cr positively predicted ASI but only left DLPFC Cho/Cr inversely predicted IQ. By contrast, IQ in controls correlated directly with left CG Cho/Cr. Limitations: Small sample size precluded us from investigating how gender and FSIQ subscales related to neurochemical correlations in the ROIs examined. Conclusions: Aberrant resting state neurochemical correlation between left DLPFC and right HIPP may contribute to GAD symptomatology. Unlike controls, in GAD, IQ and worry may share a common yet inverse neurometabolic substrate in left DLPFC.

The regional homogeneity of cingulate-precuneus regions: The putative biomarker for depression and anxiety,"Objectives: In addition to clinical interview, the modern putative biomarker to differentiate depression and anxiety would be warranted. The translational medicine characteristics of neuroimaging, such as the regional homogeneity (ReHo), is an option for depression and anxiety. Therefore we designed this study trying to identify the biomarker pattern for depression and anxiety. Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired for 53 patients with first-episode medicine-naïve major depressive disorder (MDD), 53 first-episode medicine-naïve patients with panic disorder (PD) and 54 controls. The calculation of ReHo was performed. The ANOVA repeated measures were applied for the 3 groups to investigate the putative differences between MDD and PD (FDR corrected p &lt; 0.05). Results: After multiple comparisons, the major findings of ReHo were found in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral precuneus. MDD group had lower ReHo values than PD group in the left anterior cingulate cortex. MDD group had significant alterations of ReHo in the left anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral precuneus when compared to controls. PD group had alterations in the bilateral precuneus when compared to controls. Conclusion: The specific cingulate alterations might be a putative ReHo biomarker to differentiate MDD from PD in cingulate-precuneus background for ReHo alterations.

Mapping network connectivity among symptoms of social anxiety and comorbid depression in people with social anxiety disorder,"Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and depressive symptoms often covary. Yet, uncertainty still abounds vis-à-vis the individual symptom-to-symptom associations between these two disorders. Inspired by the network approach to psychopathology that conceptualizes comorbidity as a natural consequence arising from bridge symptoms that can transmit activation from one disorder to the other, we applied network analytic methods to characterize the associations among core symptoms of SAD—i.e. fear and avoidance of social situations—and comorbid depressive symptoms among 174 individuals with DSM-IV-TR criteria for SAD. Methods: We first explored the general structure of these symptoms by estimating a regularized partial correlation network using the graphical LASSO algorithm. Then, we specifically focused on the symptoms’ importance and influence. Of critical interest was the estimation of the unique influence of each symptom from one disorder to all symptoms of the other disorder using a new metric called bridge expected influence. Results: The graphical LASSO revealed several cross-associations between SAD and comorbid depression. For each disorder, symptoms exhibiting the strongest cross-association with the other disorder were identified. Limitations: Given our cross-sectional data, our findings can only suggest hypotheses about cause-effect relationships. Conclusions: This study adds to a small but growing empirical literature revealing that the co-occurrence between two disorders is best portrayed as sets of symptom-to-symptom connections. As some individual symptoms show differential association in the co-occurrence between SAD and depression, those symptoms may be valuable targets for future research and treatment.

Evaluation of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in screening stroke patients for symptoms: Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis,"Background: Variations have been reported in the number of underlying constructs and choice of thresholds that determine caseness of anxiety and /or depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). This study examined the properties of each item of HADS as perceived by stroke patients, and assessed the information these items convey about anxiety and depression between 3 months to 5 years after stroke. Methods: The study included 1443 stroke patients from the South London Stroke Register (SLSR). The dimensionality of HADS was examined using factor analysis methods, and items’ properties up to 5 years after stroke were tested using Item Response Theory (IRT) methods, including graded response models (GRMs). Results: The presence of two dimensions of HADS (anxiety and depression) for stroke patients was confirmed. Items that accurately inferred about the severity of anxiety and depression, and offered good discrimination of caseness were identified as “I can laugh and see the funny side of things” (Q4) and “I get sudden feelings of panic” (Q13), discrimination 2.44 (se = 0.26), and 3.34 (se = 0.35), respectively. Items that shared properties, hence replicate inference were: “I get a sort of frightened feeling as if something awful is about to happen” (Q3), “I get a sort of frightened feeling like butterflies in my stomach” (Q6), and “Worrying thoughts go through my mind” (Q9). Item properties were maintained over time. Limitations: Approximately 20% of patients were lost to follow up. Conclusion: A more concise selection of items based on their properties, would provide a precise approach for screening patients and for an optimal allocation of patients into clinical trials.

Parental bonding and adolescents’ depressive and anxious symptoms in Pakistan,"Introduction: A quantitative cross sectional study was carried out to investigate the role of parental bonding in relation to depressive and anxious symptoms among secondary school adolescents in Pakistan. The study also aimed to investigate the construct validity of the parental bonding inventory in the cultural context of Pakistan. Methods: The sample consisted of 1124 adolescents recruited from eight secondary schools in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Urdu translated versions of Parental Bonding Instrument (Qadir et al., 2005) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (Mumford et al., 1991) were administered in classroom settings. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were used to analyze the data. Results: Results from the CFA of the Urdu version of the Parental Bonding Instrument supported a modified version of the three factor model proposed by Kendler (1996) consisting of warmth, protectiveness and authoritarianism. Based on SEM, we found a significant relationship between low parental warmth and depression symptoms among adolescents, whereas maternal protectiveness was a significant predictor for anxiety. Parental authoritarianism was not a significant predictor for depression or anxiety. Discussion: Findings of this study indicate that parental bonding is a central construct within a developmental framework in the cultural context of Pakistan, and is important when considering long-term psychosocial functioning of individuals. It should be explored further in clinical populations of Pakistani adolescents to ascertain significance of these constructs for interventions.

Specificity in mediated pathways by anxiety symptoms linking adolescent stress profiles to depressive symptoms: Results of a moderated mediation approach,"Background: We investigated the specificity in mediated pathways that separately link specific stress dimensions through anxiety to depressive symptoms and the protective utility of resilience. Thus, this study goes beyond lumping together potential mediating and moderating processes that can explain the relations between stress and (symptoms of) psychopathology and the buffering effect of resilience. Methods: Ghanaian adolescents between 13 and 17 years (female = 285; male = 244) completed the Adolescent Stress Questionnaire (ASQ), Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Short Mood Feeling Questionnaire (SMFQ) and the Resilience Scale for Adolescents (READ). Independent samples t -test, multivariate analysis of covariance with follow-up tests and moderated mediation analyses were performed. Results: Evidences were found for specificity in the associations between dimensions of adolescent stressors and depressive symptoms independent of transient anxiety. Transient anxiety partly accounted for the indirect effects of eight stress dimensions on depressive symptoms. Except stress of school attendance and school/leisure conflict, resilience moderated the indirect effects of specific stress dimensions on depressive symptoms. Results suggested differences in how Ghanaian adolescents view the various stress dimensions, and mediated pathways associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Limitations: Use of cross-sectional data does not show causal process and temporal changes over time. Conclusions: Findings support and clarify the specificity in the interrelations and mediated pathways among dimensions of adolescent stress, transient anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Conditional process analyses shows that resilience does not only buffer direct, but also indirect psychological adversities. Interventions for good mental health may focus on low resilience subgroups in specific stress dimensions while minimizing transient anxiety.

"Incidence, recurrence and comorbidity of anxiety disorders in four major developmental stages","Background: Anxiety disorders are common in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, and frequently comorbid with other mental disorders. Objective: The main aim of the present study was to examine the incidence, recurrence and comorbidity rates of anxiety disorders across four developmental periods, namely, during childhood (5– 12.9 years), adolescence (13–17.9 years), emerging adulthood (18–23.9 years), and adulthood (24–30 years). Method: Eight hundred and sixteen participants from a large community sample were interviewed twice during adolescence, at age 24, and at age 30. They completed self-report measures of psychosocial functioning and semi-structured diagnostic interviews during adolescence and adulthood. Results: The result showed first incidence of anxiety disorders to be significantly higher in childhood and adulthood than in adolescence and emerging adulthood. Female gender was associated with first incidence, but not with recurrence. Significant comorbidity was found between anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder (MDD) across the four developmental periods. The comorbidity between anxiety and substance use disorders (SUD) was significant in childhood, emerging adulthood and adulthood, but not in adolescence. The presence of anxiety disorders during childhood and adolescence significantly increased the probability of having an anxiety disorder during emerging adulthood. Limitations: The participants are ethically and geographically homogenous. Conclusion: Incidence and recurrence rates of anxiety disorders differed across four diverse developmental periods. The magnitude of comorbidity between anxiety disorders and MDD was comparable across periods.

Delta-beta correlation as a candidate endophenotype of social anxiety: A two-generation family study,"Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by an extreme and intense fear and avoidance of social situations. In this two-generation family study we examined delta-beta correlation during a social performance task as candidate endophenotype of SAD. Methods: Nine families with a target participant (diagnosed with SAD), their spouse and children, as well as target's siblings with spouse and children performed a social performance task in which they gave a speech in front of a camera. EEG was measured during resting state, anticipation, and recovery. Our analyses focused on two criteria for endophenotypes: co-segregation within families and heritability. Results: Co-segregation analyses revealed increased negative delta-low beta correlation during anticipation in participants with (sub)clinical SAD compared to participants without (sub)clinical SAD. Heritability analyses revealed that delta-low beta and delta-high beta correlation during anticipation were heritable. Delta-beta correlation did not differ between participants with and without (sub)clinical SAD during resting state or recovery, nor between participants with and without SAD during all phases of the task. Limitations: It should be noted that participants were seen only once, they all performed the EEG tasks in the same order, and some participants were too anxious to give a speech. Conclusions: Delta-low beta correlation during anticipation of giving a speech might be a candidate endophenotype of SAD, possibly reflecting increased crosstalk between cortical and subcortical regions. If validated as endophenotype, delta-beta correlation during anticipation could be useful in studying the genetic basis, as well as improving treatment and early detection of persons at risk for developing SAD.

Patterns of change in anxiety and depression during pregnancy predict preterm birth,"Background: To determine whether changes in anxiety and depression during pregnancy influence the risk of having a preterm birth (PTB), and whether chronic stress modifies this relationship. Methods: The data source for the current study is the All Our Babies prospective cohort (AOB). Anxiety and depression were measured at 17–24 weeks and again at 32–36 weeks’ gestation using the Spielberg State Anxiety Scale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, respectively. Chronic stress was assessed at 17–24 weeks’ gestation as a potential covariate, and was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to assess each relationship Results: Women who experienced an increase in anxiety scores, (time point 32–36 weeks, compared to the earlier time point 17–24 weeks), had 2.70 times higher odds of preterm delivery, compared to those with a reduction in anxiety scores (95% CI 1.28, 5.69). Consistent low or high depression scores did not significantly influence the odds of PTB compared to a decrease in depression scores. A co-occurring increase in anxiety and depression scores was not found to increase the risk of PTB, and chronic stress did not modify any of these relationships. Limitations: This study was limited by a relatively small sample of women who delivered preterm, and therefore it was not possible to conduct additional analyses. Further, the analyses were limited to mostly late preterm infants (32–36 weeks’ gestation). Conclusions: These findings should be validated with additional cohorts and a larger sample size. Ultimately, primary prevention could address anxiety during pregnancy.

"The prevalence, reporting, and treatment of anxiety among older adults in nursing homes and other residential aged care facilities","Background: Little is known about anxiety in aged care populations, despite its increase in this frail population. This study investigated the prevalence, recording, and treatment rate of anxiety disorders among aged care residents. Methods: A cross-sectional, observational design was used to assess 180 elderly residents from 12 aged care facilities in Melbourne, Australia. Participants were assessed for threshold and subthreshold anxiety disorders and comorbid depression using the MINI for DSM-5. Medical files were also reviewed to determine whether there was any indication that anxiety had previously been detected, and what treatment those with a threshold/ subthreshold diagnosis were receiving. Results: Overall prevalence of threshold and subthreshold anxiety disorders was 19.4% and 11.7%, respectively. Generalized anxiety disorder was the most common threshold disorder and agoraphobia was the most prevalent subthreshold anxiety disorder. While less than half of those with a threshold or subthreshold anxiety disorder had an indication of anxiety in their file, the majority received psychotropic medication. Cognitive impairment was not significantly associated with the prevalence or treatment of anxiety. Conclusions: The prevalence of threshold and subthreshold anxiety in aged care settings is high, but remains under-reported by staff and GPs. Facility staff and GPs should ensure they are aware of how anxiety presents in elderly residents and routinely screen for this common mental health issue. This cohort had poor access to psychological treatments for their condition.

Worry amplifies theory-of-mind reasoning for negatively valenced social stimuli in generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Theory-of-mind (ToM) is the ability to accurately infer others’ thoughts and feelings. In generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), cognitive and emotion regulation theories allude to the plausibility that ToM is conditional on the degree of individuals’ state worry, a hallmark symptom. GAD and state worry may interact to predict ToM constructs. However, no experiments have directly tested such interactional hypotheses, and used ToM as a framework to advance understanding of social cognition in GAD. This study therefore aimed to address this gap. Methods: 171 participants (69 GAD, 102 Controls) were randomly assigned to either a Worry or Relaxation induction and completed well-validated ToM decoding (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test) and reasoning (Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition) tasks. Results: GAD status significantly interacted with state worry to predict accuracy of overall reasoning, cognitive-reasoning, positive-reasoning, and negative-reasoning ToM. Worry, as opposed to relaxation, led sufferers of GAD to display more accurate overall reasoning and cognitive-reasoning ToM than controls, especially for negative signals. Participants with GAD who worried, but not relaxed, were also significantly better than the norm at interpreting negative signals. These findings remained after controlling for gender, executive function, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms. For other ToM abilities, mean scores of persons with and without GAD who either worried or relaxed were normative. Limitations: The ToM reasoning measure lacked self-reference, and these preliminary findings warrant replication. Conclusions: Theoretical implications, such as the state worry-contingent nature of ToM in GAD, and clinical implications are discussed.

"Test anxiety effects, predictors, and correlates: A 30-year meta-analytic review","Background and objectives: Since the 1988 publication of Hembree's seminal meta-analysis on test anxiety, much has changed in the theoretical conceptualization of test anxiety, as well as the influences on test performance. The present study examined the influence of test anxiety on a variety of educational outcomes, in addition to demographic and intrapersonal correlates. Design and methods: Results of 238 studies from 1988 to the present, were synthesized via a meta-analytic framework to explicate predictors, correlates, and relationships with the test anxiety construct. Pooled effect sizes were calculated. Results: Results indicated that test anxiety was significantly and negatively related to a wide range of educational performance outcomes, including standardized tests, university entrance exams, and grade point average. Results were most pronounced at the middle grades level. Self-esteem was a significant and strong predictor of test anxiety. Perceived difficulty of the test and the high-stakes nature or consequences of the test was also related to higher test anxiety. Conclusions: The magnitude of the relationship of test anxiety across a number of variables was in the small to moderate range. Implications for researchers and educators are discussed including the use of evidence-based assessment and interventions when warranted.

Determinants of comorbid depression and anxiety postnatally: A longitudinal cohort study of Chinese-Canadian women,"Background: Women with comorbid depression and anxiety in the postpartum period experience more complex and severe symptoms than women with depression or anxiety alone; however, little is known about what influences these symptoms, especially among women from specific ethnic backgrounds. The objective of this study was to identify determinants of comorbid depression and anxiety symptomatology by 24 weeks postpartum in a cohort of Chinese-Canadian women. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was completed where 549 Chinese immigrant and Canadian-born women in Toronto were followed to 24 weeks postpartum. Questionnaires included risk factors measured at 4 weeks. Logistic regression was used to develop a model of comorbidity (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score &gt; 9; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score &gt; 40) up to and including 24 weeks. Results: Previous history of postpartum (AOR 2.42, 95% CI 1.42–4.14) and non-postpartum (AOR 4.20, 95% CI 2.21–7.98) depression, maternal age&lt; 26 years (AOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.04–3.22), perception of support (AOR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–1.00), acculturative stress (AOR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.04), maternal fatigue (AOR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07–1.17), and perceived infant sleep problems (AOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.27–3.43) were significantly associated with comorbid depression and anxiety in the first 24 weeks postpartum. Limitations: Our sample consisted of Chinese-Canadian women; this study should be replicated in other ethnic groups to see if and how risk factors of postpartum comorbidity differ. Conclusion: The factors identified herein offer insight into groups of Chinese-Canadian women who might benefit most from early identification and treatment and suggest targets for prevention.

Association of comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders with suicidal behaviors,"Background: Suicidal behaviors are strong predictors of suicide death and are much more common than completed suicides. This study aimed to describe the prevalence and transitions of suicidal behaviors in an Inner Mongolian City of China and to explore the association of comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders with suicidal behaviors. Method: This study was a cross-sectional study. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview-3.0 (CIDI-3.0) was administered face-to-face to make diagnoses of mental disorders, measure suicidal behaviors and collect social demographic information. Results: A total of 4528 respondents were interviewed. The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide plan and suicide attempt were 1.52%, 0.70% and 0.54%, respectively. Among those respondents with suicidal ideation, 21.1% of them had planned suicide attempt, and 6.6% had unplanned suicide attempt. When comorbidity was not considered in the model, mood and anxiety disorders were the most important drivers of suicidal behaviors. However, when including the comorbidity, those respondents with mood and anxiety disorders, rather than those with a specific disorder only, had a significant positive association with suicidal behaviors. In the model, being unemployed, rural, female, no income and childhood adversities were also related to suicidal behaviors. Limitations: There might be systematic recall bias as the data were based on retrospective self-reports. Suicide is a sensitive question, so the respondents were probably ashamed to talk about suicidal behaviors. Conclusions: The comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders was the most important risk factor of suicidal behaviors. Special attention should be paid to those patients with this comorbidity.

Residual anxiety may be associated with depressive relapse during continuation therapy of bipolar II depression,"Background: Anxiety symptoms are common in bipolar disorder. We explored the effect of anxiety on the outcome of acute and continuation pharmacotherapy of bipolar II depression. Methods: Data were derived from a randomized double-blind 12-week acute (N = 129) and 6-month continuation (N = 55) comparison of venlafaxine versus lithium monotherapy in bipolar II depression in adults. We distinguished between the items of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) that capture depression vs. anxiety (i.e., psychomotor agitation, psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, hypochondriasis, and obsessive-compulsive concerns) and examined the effect of treatment on depression and anxiety. Additionally, we explored whether baseline anxiety or depression predicted changes over time in depression and anxiety ratings or moderated treatment outcomes. We also explored whether residual depressive and anxious symptoms predicted relapse during continuation therapy. Results: Venlafaxine was superior to lithium in reducing both depression and anxiety, though its effects on anxiety were more modest than those on depression. Baseline anxiety predicted change over time in anxiety, but not depression. By contrast, baseline depression did not predict change over time in depression or anxiety. Residual anxiety, specifically uncontrollable worry, was a stronger predictor of relapse than residual depression. Conclusion: Successful treatment of symptoms of anxiety in bipolar depression may protect against depressive relapse.

Offspring of depressed and anxious patients: Help-seeking after first onset of a mood and/or anxiety disorder,"Background: Offspring of patients with depressive and/or anxiety disorders are at high risk of developing a similar disorder themselves. Early recognition and treatment may have substantial effects on prognosis. The main aim of this study was to examine the time to initial help-seeking and its determinants in offspring after the first onset of a mood and/or anxiety disorder. Methods: Data are presented of 215 offspring with a mood and/or anxiety disorder participating in a cohort study with 10 year follow-up. We determined age of disorder onset and age of initial help-seeking. Offspring characteristics (gender, IQ, age of onset, disorder type, suicidal ideation) and family characteristics (socioeconomic status, family functioning) were investigated as potential predictors of the time to initial help-seeking. Results: The estimated overall proportion of offspring of depressed/anxious patients who eventually seek help after onset of a mood and/or anxiety disorder was 91.9%. The time to initial help-seeking was more than two years in 39.6% of the offspring. Being female, having a mood disorder or comorbid mood and anxiety disorder (relative to anxiety) and a disorder onset in adolescence or adulthood (relative to childhood) predicted a shorter time to initial help-seeking. Limitations: Baseline information relied on retrospective reports. Age of onsets and age of initial help-seeking may therefore be subject to recall bias. Conclusion: Although most offspring eventually seek help after onset of a mood/anxiety disorder, delays in help seeking were common, especially in specific subgroups of patients. This information may help to develop targeted strategies to reduce help-seeking delays.

Predictors and outcomes of somatization in bipolar I disorder: A latent class mixture modeling approach,"Background: Mood disorders are often associated with somatic symptoms. The role of somatic symptoms on disease progression in unipolar depression is substantially better characterized than that role in bipolar disorder. Moreover, the contribution of comorbid anxiety disorders and medical illness is not well understood. Method: We investigated 527 patients with bipolar I disorder clustered within 102 families using a latent class approach. Predictors were added stepwise into the model. Anxiety and commonly associated medical illnesses were added as covariates. Results: The rate of somatic symptoms in this sample was 73% (mean 1.7 symptoms), and 27.3% had a comorbid anxiety disorder. A two-class model, with a subgroup at high-risk for somatization, gave the best fit to the data. Multilevel mixture modeling accounted for family clusters. Somatic symptoms were independently associated with disease severity, defined as earlier age of first seeking psychiatric help (x = 21.7 vs x = 24.7, p = 0.005) and first psychiatric hospitalization (x = 25.7 vs x = 28.2, p = 0.03), greater probability of attempting suicide (x = 0.41 vs x = 0.32, p = 0.047), and rapid-cycling disease course (x =0.57 vs x = 0.36, p &lt; 0.001). Persons with few or no somatic symptoms were more likely to be hospitalized for severe mania (x = 0.63 vs x = 0.51; p = 0.013), but did not significantly differ in hospitalization for severe depression. Limitations: The study is correlational. Information on pharmacologic interventions and comorbid diseases was limited. Conclusions: Somatic symptoms in bipolar disorder could be an independent indicator for disease severity, suicidality, and rapid-cycling disease course. In severe mental illness, somatic and psychological symptoms must be jointly addressed.

Dorsomedial frontal cortical metabolic differences of comorbid generalized anxiety disorder in refractory major depression: A [¹⁸F] FDG PET brain imaging study,"Background: Refractory major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental disorder, chronic and difficult to treat. Although generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is frequently observed as a comorbid diagnosis, little is known on the comorbid neurobiological substrate. Better insights may improve adequate treatment algorithms. Objective: To examine this poorly understood clinical question, we recruited 52 individuals to participate in a [¹⁸F] FDG PET brain imaging study. Methods: Twenty-two refractory MDD patients were diagnosed with and 15 refractory MDD patients without comorbid GAD. To compare to the none-depressed state a sample of 15 age and gender matched never-depressed individuals were included. Results: Compared to healthy control subjects, all patients showed significantly higher metabolic activity in the bilateral parahippocampal areas. Compared to MDD patients, healthy subjects displayed significant higher metabolic activity in distinct (bi)frontotemporal and parietal cortices. Refractory MDD patients without comorbid GAD showed significant higher metabolic activity in the dorsomedial parts of the frontal cortex (dmFC). Conclusions: The impaired dmFC metabolic activity observed in comorbid GAD within refractory MDD may be indicative of specific emotional dysfunctional top-down processing in this subgroup, conform the anxiety state. Additional psychotherapeutic interventions may be warranted.

"Saffron in the treatment of depression, anxiety and other mental disorders: Current evidence and potential mechanisms of action","Background: Depression and anxiety are two common mental health problems with high economic and social costs. Currently, a number of treatments are available for patients with depression and anxiety disorders such as psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy and antidepressant drugs. Due to safety concerns, adverse effects, limited efficacy and low tolerability associated with many antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications, identification of novel agents with less toxicity and more favorable outcome is warranted. Methods: The current article provides a non-systematic review of the available in vitro, in vivo and clinical evidence on the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of saffron and its active ingredients in the treatment of anxiety, depression and other mental disorders. Results: Several interesting data have been reported about the antidepressant and anti-anxiety properties of saffron, the dried stigmas of Crocus sativus L., in several preclinical and clinical studies. In particular, a number of clinical trials demonstrated that saffron and its active constituents possess antidepressant properties similar to those of current antidepressant medications such as fluoxetine, imipramine and citalopram, but with fewer reported side effects. Conclusion: Saffron may exert antidepressant effects and represents an efficacious and safe treatment.

Development and assessment of stressful life events subscales—A preliminary analysis,"Background: Stress affects people of all ages, genders, and cultures and is associated with physical and psychological complications. Stressful life events are an important research focus and a psychometrically valid measure could provide useful clinical information. The purpose of the study was to develop a reliable and valid measurement of stressful life events and to assess its reliability and validity using established measures of social support, stress, depression, anxiety and maternal and child health. Methods: The authors used an adaptation from the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) to describe the prevalence of life events; they developed a 4-factor stressful life events subscales and used Medical Outcomes Social Support Scale, Social Support Scale, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and 14 general health items for validity analysis. Analyses were performed with descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha, Spearman's rho, Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon 2-sample test. Results: The 4-factor stressful life events subscales showed acceptable reliability. The resulting subscale scores were significantly associated with established measures of social support, depression, anxiety, stress, and caregiver health indicators. Limitations: The study presented a number of limitations in terms of design and recall bias. Conclusions: Despite the presence of a number of limitations, the study provided valuable insight and suggested that further investigation is needed in order to determine the effectiveness of the measures in revealing the family's wellbeing and to develop and strengthen a more detailed analysis of the stressful life events/health association.

Prevalence and correlates of comorbid depression in a nonclinical online sample with DSM-5 internet gaming disorder,"Background: We investigated the prevalence and correlates of comorbid depression among patients with internet gaming disorder using the Internet Gaming Disorder scale (IGD-9) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) among nonclinical online survey respondents. Methods: Korean adolescents and adults from 14 to 39 years of age were selected. We compared internet gaming use patterns and sociodemographic and clinical variables between patients with internet gaming disorder who had depression and those without depression. Results: In 2016, 7200 people participated in an online survey. Respondents with internet gaming disorder that was comorbid with depression were older, more often female, had greater Internet Addiction Test total scores, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test total scores, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 total scores, Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence total scores, and higher Dickman Dysfunctional Impulsivity Instrument dysfunctional subscale scores than those without depression. The binary logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender, problematic alcohol use, anxiety, and a past history of psychiatric counseling or treatment due to internet gaming use were significant predictors for comorbid depression among participants with internet gaming disorder. Conclusion: Depression was a common comorbidity of internet gaming disorder. Internet gaming disorder with comorbid depression was related to more serious psychiatric phenomenology and a greater psychiatric burden.

Video game play and anxiety during late adolescence: The moderating effects of gender and social context,"Background: Few studies have examined factors that moderate the relationship between playing video games and adolescent psychological adjustment. Therefore, the primary goal of this study was to examine the relationship between playing video games and anxiety symptomatology in a sample of 441 11th and 12th grade students, while considering both gender and the social context (whether they played alone or with others). Methods: Participants (66% non-Hispanic White) were administered a survey (including measures of technology use and anxiety symptomatology) in school at baseline and one year later. Results: Both gender and the social context moderated the relationship between playing video games and anxiety symptomatology. Boys who played video games the most had the lowest levels of anxiety, whereas girls who played video games the most had the highest levels of anxiety. This relationship was exacerbated in the context of playing with others. Limitations: Although the study has a number of strengths including the longitudinal design and the diverse sample, the study relied on self-report data. In addition, the sample was limited to adolescents residing in the Mid-Atlantic United States. Therefore, caution should be taken in regard to generalizing the results. Conclusions: Findings from this study underscore the need to consider both gender and the social context when examining the relationship between playing video games and adolescent psychological adjustment.

Quantitative genetic analysis of anxiety trait in bipolar disorder,"Background: Bipolar disorder type I (BPI) affects approximately 1% of the world population. Although genetic influences on bipolar disorder are well established, identification of genes that predispose to the illness has been difficult. Most genetic studies are based on categorical diagnosis. One strategy to overcome this obstacle is the use of quantitative endophenotypes, as has been done for other medical disorders. Methods: We studied 619 individuals, 568 participants from 61 extended families and 51 unrelated healthy controls. The sample was 55% female and had a mean age of 43.25 (SD 13.90; range 18–78). Heritability and genetic correlation of the trait scale from the Anxiety State and Trait Inventory (STAI) was computed by using the general linear model (SOLAR package software). Results: we observed that anxiety trait meets the following criteria for an endophenotype of bipolar disorder type I (BPI): 1) association with BPI (individuals with BPI showed the highest trait score (F = 15.20 [5,24], p = 0.009), 2) state-independence confirmed after conducting a test-retest in 321 subjects, 3) co-segregation within families 4) heritability of 0.70 (SE: 0.060), p = 2.33 × 10 –14 and 5) genetic correlation with BPI was 0.20, (SE = 0.17, p = 3.12 × 10 −5 ). Limitations: Confounding factors such as comorbid disorders and pharmacological treatment could affect the clinical relationship between BPI and anxiety trait. Further research is needed to evaluate if anxiety traits are specially related to BPI in comparison with other traits such as anger, attention or response inhibition deficit, pathological impulsivity or low self-directedness. Conclusions: Anxiety trait is a heritable phenotype that follows a normal distribution when measured not only in subjects with BPI but also in unrelated healthy controls. It could be used as an endophenotype in BPI for the identification of genomic regions with susceptibility genes for this disorder.

Peripheral proinflammatory cytokines in Chinese patients with generalised anxiety disorder,"Background: Inflammatory responses and inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of affective disorders, particularly major depression. Given the limited evidence relating to the potential role of proinflammatory cytokines in generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), we aimed to examine peripheral proinflammatory cytokines in Chinese patients with GAD. Methods: A case-controlled cross-sectional study design, with recruitment of 48 patients with first episode GAD and 48 matched healthy controls. All participants completed measures of anxiety using well-established questionnaires, and serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured using multiplex technology. Results: Serum levels of CRP, IL-1α, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF were significantly higher in the GAD group in comparison to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Pearson correlation revealed significant positive correlations between anxiety measures and serum levels of CRP, IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF (p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: The cross-sectional study design does not permit definite conclusions on causal directions between inflammation and GAD. The study was limited to a panel of 8 cytokines and does not exclude the possibility of other important cytokines being involved. Conclusions: These findings indicate an elevated peripheral proinflammatory response, and provide further support for low grade inflammation in GAD. Further research may identify an ‘inflammatory signature’ for diagnosis and treatment response, and guide the search for novel pharmacological interventions.

Relation of plasma tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy to maternal sleep and mental well-being: The GUSTO cohort,"Background: Evidence suggests a relation between plasma tryptophan concentrations and sleep and mental wellbeing. As no studies have been performed in pregnant women, we studied the relation of plasma tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy with sleep quality, and mood during and after pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (n = 572) from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes study completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at 26–28 weeks gestation and three months post-delivery. Plasma tryptophan concentrations were measured at 26–28 weeks gestation. Poisson regressions estimated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association between tryptophan and poor sleep quality (PSQI global score &gt; 5), probable antenatal depression (EPDS ≥ 15) and probable anxiety (STAI-state ≥ 41) were calculated adjusting for covariates. Results: Mean plasma tryptophan concentrations was 48.0 μmol/L (SD: 8.09). Higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a lower prevalence of antenatal poor sleep quality adjusting for covariates [PR: 0.88 (95% CI 0.80, 0.97) per 10 μmol/L], especially in those participants who also suffered from anxiety symptoms [PR: 0.80 (95% CI 0.67, 0.95)]. No associations were observed between tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy and postnatal sleep quality or mental well-being. Limitation: Subjective measures were used to assess sleep and mental well-being. Conclusions: We observed that higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a 12% lower prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy, in particular among those with anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest the importance of having adequate tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy.

Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression,"Background: Attentional and memory biases are viewed as crucial cognitive processes underlying symptoms of depression. However, it is still unclear whether these two biases are uniquely related to depression or whether they show substantial overlap. Methods: We investigated the degree of specificity and overlap of attentional and memory biases for depressotypic stimuli in relation to depression and anxiety by means of meta-analytic commonality analysis. By including four published studies, we considered a pool of 463 healthy and subclinically depressed individuals, different experimental paradigms, and different psychological measures. Results: Memory bias is reliably and strongly related to depression and, specifically, to symptoms of negative mood, worthlessness, feelings of failure, and pessimism. Memory bias for negative information was minimally related to anxiety. Moreover, neither attentional bias nor the overlap between attentional and memory biases were significantly related to depression. Limitations: Limitations include cross-sectional nature of the study. Conclusions: Our study showed that, across different paradigms and psychological measures, memory bias (and not attentional bias) represents a primary mechanism in depression.

Binge eating behaviours in bipolar disorders,"Background: Recent research, especially from the USA, suggests that comorbid binge eating (BE) behaviour and BE disorder are frequent in individuals with Bipolar Disorder (BD). Although basic clinical associations between BD and BE have been investigated, less is known about psychological or temperamental dimensions and qualitative aspects of eating habits. In a French cohort of patients with BD, we investigated the prevalence of BE behaviour and any associations with illness characteristics, anxiety, impulsivity, emotional regulation and eating habits. Methods: 145 outpatients with BD (I and II) were assessed for the presence of BE behaviour using the Binge Eating Scale (BES). Characteristics identified in univariate analyses as differentiating BD cases with and without BE behaviour were then included in a backward stepwise logistic regression (BSLR) model. Results: In this sample, 18.6% of BD patients met criteria for BE behaviour. Multivariate analysis (BSLR) indicated that shorter duration of BD, and higher levels of anxiety and emotional reactivity were observed in BD with compared to BD without BE behaviour. Limitations: Relatively small sample referred to specialist BD clinics and cross-sectional evaluation meant that it was not possible to differentiate between state and trait levels of impulsivity, emotional instability and disinhibition. These dimensions may also overlap with mood symptoms. Conclusion: BE behaviour is common in females and males with BD. Emotional dysregulation and anxiety may represent important shared vulnerability factors for worse outcome of BD and increased likelihood of BE behaviour.

Prevalence trends of pre- and postnatal depression in Japanese women: A population-based longitudinal study,"Background: This study aimed to describe the prevalence trends of pre- and postnatal depression, via measures of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) total and factor scores, from 20 weeks’ gestation to 3 months postpartum, stratified by parity, in a Japanese female population. Methods: A longitudinal, population-based study was conducted among perinatal women giving birth at maternity facilities in Setagaya area of Tokyo, Japan. Of the 1775 women who participated, 1311 women met the inclusion criteria of this analysis. All data, including EPDS, were collected via self-administrated questionnaires at 20 weeks’ gestation and at 5 time points postpartum, from the first few days to 3 months postpartum. We divided EPDS items into three factors: “anxiety,” “anhedonia,” and “depression,” according to factor analysis. Results: The prevalence of individuals exhibiting depressive symptoms, EPDS total score, and each factor score peaked at two weeks postpartum in primiparas (EPDS total = 5.58, anhedonia = 0.47, anxiety = 2.64, and depression = 1.23). In contrast, the EPDS total score and factor scores for “anxiety” and “depression” gradually decreased for multiparas, from the prenatal to postpartum period (EPDS total 3.33, 3.03, 3.03, 2.72, 2.76, and 2.37). Limitations: Each factor score was not weighted; instead, we simply added up the item scores ranging from 0 to 3 for each question. Additionally, the population representativeness of Japanese women was not high, although the sample was population-based and had a high follow-up rate. Conclusions: This study shows that the trends of EPDS total and factor scores differ by parity throughout the preand postnatal periods among a Japanese female population.

"The influence of alexithymia on mobile phone addiction: The role of depression, anxiety and stress","Background: Alexithymia is an important predictor of mobile phone addiction. Enhancing and improving college students’ mental health can reduce the rate of mobile phone addiction. However, it is not clear about the role of depression, anxiety and stress in the relationship between college students’ alexithymia and mobile phone addiction. Methods: A total of 1105 college students were tested with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and the Mobile Phone Addiction Index. Results: An individual’s level of alexithymia was significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, stress and mobile phone addiction. Alexithymia had a significantly positive prediction effect on mobile phone addiction, and depression, anxiety, and stress on mobile phone are positive predictors. Depression, anxiety or stress had partially mediating effects between alexithymia and mobile phone addiction. Alexithymia not only directly had a positively impact on mobile phone addiction, but both also had an indirect effect on mobile phone addiction through depression, anxiety or stress. Limitations: Limitations included sampling method and modest sample size, self-report measures, and unmeasured potential confounders. Conclusion: Alexithymia is an important correlate of mobile phone addiction, and depression, anxiety or stress is an important mediator in this relationship.

The effectiveness of adjunct mindfulness-based intervention in treatment of bipolar disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been increasingly used as an adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy for a few psychiatric disorders. However, few studies have investigated the efficacy of MBIs in bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of MBIs as an adjunctive treatment in BD. Major electronic databases were independently searched by two authors for controlled and uncontrolled studies which examined the effects of MBIs on psychiatric symptoms in subjects with BD. Data from original studies were synthesized by using a random effects model. Results: Twelve trials were eligible for inclusion into current meta-analysis, including three controlled studies (n=132) and nine uncontrolled studies (n = 142). In within-group analysis, MBIs significantly reduced depressive (7 studies, n = 100, Hedges’ g = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (4 studies, n = 68, Hedges’ g = 0.34, p = 0.043) symptoms, but not manic symptoms (6 studies, n = 89, Hedges’ g = 0.09, p = 0.488) and cognition (3 studies, n=43, Hedges’ g = 0.35, p = 0.171), compared to baseline. In between-group analysis (intervention group versus waiting list group, all patients with BD), MBIs did not reduce depressive (3 studies, n = 132, Hedges’ g = 0.46, p = 0.315) or anxiety (3 studies, n=132, Hedges’ g = 0.33, p = 0.578) symptoms. Limitations: Only three controlled trials compared MBIs to control conditions. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis showed significantly beneficial effects on depressive and anxiety symptoms of BD patients in within-group analysis. However, this significance was not observed in comparison with the control groups. Further clinical trials are warranted to investigate the differences in the benefits of MBIs between treatment and control subjects.

Anxiety disorders and childhood maltreatment as predictors of outcome in bipolar disorder,"Background: Comorbid anxiety disorders and childhood maltreatment have each been linked with unfavourable outcomes in people with bipolar disorder. Because childhood maltreatment is associated with anxiety disorders in this population, their respective predictive value remains to be determined. Methods: In 174 adults with bipolar disorder, we assessed childhood maltreatment using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and lifetime anxiety disorders with the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview. We constructed an overall index of severity of bipolar disorder as a sum of six indicators (unemployment, psychotic symptoms, more than five manic episodes, more than five depressive episodes, suicide attempt, and hospital admission). We tested the relationship between childhood maltreatment, the number of anxiety disorders and the overall severity index using ordered logistic regression. Results: The number of lifetime anxiety disorders was associated with the overall severity index (OR = 1.43, 95%CI = 1.01–2.04, p = 0.047). This relationship was only slightly attenuated when controlled for childhood maltreatment (OR = 1.39, 95%CI = 0.97–2.00, p = 0.069). The relationship between childhood maltreatment and the overall severity index was not statistically significant (OR = 1.26, 95%CI = 0.92–1.74, p = 0.151). Secondary analyses revealed that childhood maltreatment was associated with suicide attempts (OR = 1.70, 95%CI = 1.15–2.51, p = 0.008) and obsessive compulsive disorder was associated with the overall severity index (OR = 9.56, 95%CI = 2.20–41.47, p = 0.003). Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study with a moderate-sized sample recruited from a specialist program. Conclusions: While comorbid anxiety disorders are associated with the overall severity of bipolar disorder, childhood maltreatment is specifically associated with suicide attempts. Clinicians should systematically assess both factors. Interventions to improve outcomes of people with bipolar disorder with comorbid anxiety disorders and history of childhood maltreatment are needed.

"Intolerance of Uncertainty, anxiety, and worry in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis","Background: Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has been implicated in the development and maintenance of worry and anxiety in adults and there is an increasing interest in the role that IU may play in anxiety and worry in children and adolescents. Method: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize existing research on IU with regard to anxiety and worry in young people, and to provide a context for considering future directions in this area of research. The systematic review yielded 31 studies that investigated the association of IU with either anxiety or worry in children and adolescents. Results: The meta-analysis showed that IU accounted for 36.00% of the variance in anxiety and 39.69% in worry. Due to the low number of studies and methodological factors, examination of potential moderators was limited; and of those we were able to examine, none were significant moderators of either association. Most studies relied on questionnaire measures of IU, anxiety, and worry; all studies except one were cross-sectional and the majority of the studies were with community samples. Limitations: The inclusion of eligible studies was limited to studies published in English that focus on typically developing children. Conclusions: There is a strong association between IU and both anxiety and worry in young people therefore IU may be a relevant construct to target in treatment. To extend the existing literature, future research should incorporate longitudinal and experimental designs, and include samples of young people who have a range of anxiety disorders.

Uric acid in major depressive and anxiety disorders,"Background: Uric acid has neuroprotective effects, owing to its antioxidant properties. Lowered antioxidant capacity, causing increased oxidative stress, may be involved in affective disorders and might be altered by antidepressants. This study investigated the association of plasma uric acid, the greatest contributor to blood antioxidant capacity, with major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders. Methods: Data were from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety including patients with current (N = 1648), remitted (N = 609) MDD and/or anxiety disorders (of which N = 710 antidepressant users) and 618 controls. Diagnoses were established with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Symptom severity was assessed with the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self Report, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Fear Questionnaire. Uric acid was measured in plasma. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, health and lifestyle variables. Results: Plasma uric acid adjusted mean levels were lower in current MDD and/or anxiety disorder(s) (289 μmol/l) compared to remitted disorders (298 μmol/l, p &lt; .001) and controls (299 μmol/l, p &lt; .001; Cohen's d .10). This finding was independent of antidepressant use. Depressive (β-.05, p = .0012), anxiety (β-.04, p = .009) and phobic (β-.03, p = .036) symptom severity, and symptom duration (β-.04, p = .009) were negatively associated with uric acid. Limitations: Limitations include the lack of data on dietary intake which could be a potential confounding factor. From these cross-sectional findings, the association between uric acid and psychopathology cannot be inferred to be causal. Conclusion: This large scale study finds plasma uric acid levels are lower in current, but not remitted, MDD and/or anxiety disorders, according to a dose-response gradient. This suggests the involvement of decreased antioxidant status in affective disorders, and points to their potential as an avenue for treatment.

Effects of traumatic experiences on obsessive-compulsive and internalizing symptoms: The role of avoidance and mindfulness,"Background: Trauma exposure is associated with adverse psychological outcomes including anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. Adolescence is increasingly recognized as a period of vulnerability for the onset of these types of psychological symptoms. The current study explored the mediating roles of experiential avoidance and mindfulness processes in the association between retrospective reports of childhood trauma and current internalizing and OC symptoms in adolescents. Method: A group of at-risk adolescents ( N = 51) and a group of college students ( N = 400) reported on childhood trauma, experiential avoidance, mindfulness, anxiety, depressive, and OC symptoms. Mediation analyses were performed to examine the mechanistic roles of avoidance and mindfulness in the association between trauma and internalizing and OC-specific symptoms. Results: In the group of at-risk adolescents, experiential avoidance and mindfulness both significantly mediated the association between childhood trauma and OC symptoms. In the college student sample, experiential avoidance mediated the association between trauma and OC symptoms. Experiential avoidance, as well as the observe, act with awareness , and nonjudgmental facets of mindfulness all significantly mediated the association between trauma and internalizing symptoms. Limitations: The group of at-risk adolescents was small, and the college student group was demographically homogeneous. All data was self-report and cross-sectional. Conclusion: The current study demonstrated that experiential avoidance and mindfulness processes may be the mechanisms through which the association between trauma and obsessive-compulsive and trauma and internalizing symptoms exist in adolescents. These findings provide potential targets for clinical intervention to improve outcomes for adolescents who have experienced trauma.

"The presence of anxiety, depression and stress in women and their partners during pregnancies following perinatal loss: A meta-analysis","Background: Research indicates perinatal loss is associated with anxiety, depression and stress in women and partners during subsequent pregnancies. However, there are no robust estimates of anxiety, depression and stress for this group. We meta-analytically estimated rates of anxiety, depression and stress in pregnant women and their partners during pregnancies after previous perinatal loss. Methods: Databases (Medline, PsychInfo, Embase, Cinahl Plus) and grey literature were searched from 1995 through to May 2016. Search terms included: depression, anxiety, or stress with perinatal loss (miscarry*, perinatal death, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, intrauterine death, TOPFA) and subsequent pregnancy. Case-controlled, English-language studies using validated measures of anxiety, depression or stress in women or partners during pregnancy following perinatal loss were included. Data for effect sizes, study and demographic data were extracted. Results: We identified nineteen studies representing n = 5114 women with previous loss; n = 30,272 controls; n = 106 partners with previous perinatal loss; and n = 91 control men. Random effects modelling demonstrated significant effects of perinatal loss on anxiety ( d = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.41–0.97) and depression ( d = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.15–0.30) in women; but no effect on stress ( d = − 0.002, 95% CI = − 0.0639 to 0.0605). Limitations: This study was limited by the quality of available studies, underpowered moderator analyses and an inability to examine additional covariates. Insufficient data were available to generate reliable effects for psychological distress in partners. Conclusions: Our findings confirm elevated anxiety and depression levels during pregnancies following perinatal loss. Further research on predictors of distress in women and their partners is required.

&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; infection and common mental disorders in the Finnish general population,"Objective: We investigated whether T. gondii seropositivity is associated with 12-month depressive, anxiety and alcohol use disorders and current depressive symptoms and whether inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) level, explains these associations. Method: Health 2000 study (BRIF8901), conducted in years 2000–2001, is based on a nationally representative sample of Finns aged 30 and above, with 7112 participants and 88.6% response rate. DSM-IV depressive, anxiety and alcohol use disorders were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and depressive symptoms with the Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI-21). We used logistic regression to investigate the association of T. gondii seropositivity with mental disorders and linear regression with BDI-21 scores. Results: T. gondii seroprevalence was significantly associated with 12-month generalized anxiety disorder but not with other anxiety, depressive or alcohol use disorders. T. gondii seropositivity was associated with higher BDI-21 scores (beta 0.56, 95% CI 0.12–1.00, P = 0.013) and with having a comorbid depressive and anxiety disorder (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.16–2.97, P = 0.010). Higher CRP levels were associated with these outcomes and with T. gondii seropositivity, but adjusting for CRP did not change the effect of T. gondii seropositivity. Limitations: Cross-sectional study design with no information on the timing of T. gondii infection. Conclusion: T. gondii seropositivity is associated with generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders, which is not mediated by inflammation.

Cognitive bias modification: A review of meta-analyses,"Background: Cognitive bias modification (CBM) is a novel, but controversial intervention with considerable divergence amongst conclusions in individual studies and reviews. This systematic review synthesizes meta-analyses of CBM to determine whether CBM is effective, and what parameters most reliably evoke the process of CBM. Methods: A systematic literature search resulted in twelve meta-analyses in total, from which the published effect sizes were extracted. Results: Attention bias modification (ABM) shifted targeted biases in adults (ES = 0.24–1.16), was effective as a buffer to stressor vulnerability (ES = 0.33–0.77) and in symptom control (ES = 0.16–0.41). Cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) modified targeted biases (ES = 0.52–0.81) but did not reliably reduce stressor vulnerability (ES = 0.01–0.24, p &gt; .05). CBM consistently reduced anxiety symptoms, but effects on depressive symptomatology were less compelling. The long-term efficacy of CBM was only supported in addiction studies. Limitations: The review included a single CBM-I only meta-analysis, and two meta-analyses with pooled reporting on ABM and CBM-I outcomes. Conclusions: Overall, this synthesis shows CBM is effective in the short-term for anxiety in adults, and highlights some conditions under which CBM is most efficacious. Rather than debating the efficacy of CBM, future research should focus on developing procedures that more reliably induce bias modification and determining the most efficacious clinical applications.

"Posttraumatic stress disorder and suicidal ideation, plans, and impulses: The mediating role of anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns among veterans","Background: Although the relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide has been firmly established, research on underlying mechanisms has been disproportionately low. The cognitive concerns subscale of anxiety sensitivity (AS), which reflects fears of cognitive dyscontrol, has been linked to both PTSD and suicide and thus may serve as an explanatory mechanism between these constructs. Methods: The sample consisted of 60 male veterans presenting to an outpatient Veteran Affairs (VA) clinic for psychological services. Upon intake, veterans completed a diagnostic interview and brief battery of self-report questionnaires to assist with differential diagnosis and treatment planning. Results: Results revealed a significant association between PTSD symptom severity and higher suicidality (i.e., ideation, plans, and impulses), even after accounting for relevant demographic and psychological constructs. Moreover, AS cognitive concerns mediated this association. Limitations: Limitations include the small sample size and cross-sectional nature of the current study. Conclusions: These findings add considerably to a growing body of literature examining underlying mechanisms that may help to explain the robust associations between PTSD and suicide. Considering the malleable nature of AS cognitive concerns, research is needed to determine the extent to which reductions in this cognitive risk factor are associated with reductions in suicide among at risk samples, such as those included in the present investigation.

“Music therapy as an adjunct to standard treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder and co-morbid anxiety and depression: A randomized clinical trial”: Corrigendum,"Reports an error in ""Music therapy as an adjunct to standard treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder and co-morbid anxiety and depression: A randomized clinical trial"" by Shahrzad Shirani Bidabadi and Amirhooshang Mehryar ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2015[Sep][15], Vol 184, 13-17). In the original article, the author Shahrzad's name has been changed to Melina. The correct identification is Melina Shiranibidabadi and email address: Melinashirani@miau.ac.ir. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-34966-003). Background: Previous studies have highlighted the potential therapeutic benefits of music therapy as an adjunct to standard care, in a variety of psychiatric ailments including mood and anxiety disorders. However, the role of music in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) have not been investigated to date. Methods: In a single-center, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial (NCT02314195) 30 patients with OCD were randomly assigned to standard treatment (pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavior therapy) plus 12 sessions of individual music therapy ( n = 15) or standard treatment only ( n = 15) for one month. Maudsley Obsessive–Compulsive Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-Short Form were administered baseline and after one month. Results: Thirty patients completed the study. Music therapy resulted in a greater decrease in total obsessive score (post-intervention score: music therapy + standard treatment: 12.4 ± 1.9 vs standard treatment only: 15.1 ± 1.7, p &lt; 0.001, effect size = 56.7%). For subtypes, significant between-group differences were identified for checking ( p = 0.004), and slowness ( p = 0.019), but not for washing or responsibility. Music therapy was significantly more effective in reducing anxiety (post-intervention score: music therapy+standard treatment: 16.9 ± 7.4 vs standard treatment only: 22.9 ± 4.6, p &lt; 0.001, effect size = 47.0%), and depressive symptoms (post-intervention score: music therapy+standard treatment: 10.8 ± 3.8 vs standard treatment: 17.1 ± 3.7, p &lt; 0.001, effect size = 47.0%). Limitations: Inclusion of a small sample size, lack of blinding due to the nature of the intervention, short duration of follow-up. Conclusion: In patients with OCD, music therapy, as an adjunct to standard care, seems to be effective in reducing obsessions, as well as co-morbid anxiety and depressive symptoms.

"Factors affecting lumbar surgery outcome: A nation-wide, population-based retrospective study","Background: Lower back pain is a very common symptom and treatment strategies vary according the severity and duration of illness. Surgical approaches are becoming increasingly popular with the advent of new and less invasive technologies; however, treatment outcomes are not yet well established on a population-based level. Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) is longitudinal and includes 98% of the population since its inception in 1995. The database includes the ICD 9.0 codes (International Classification of Diseases) of all patients with lower back pain and lumbar surgery; furthermore, all the prescriptions. Methods: As part of a population-based cohort study of one million participants randomly selected from the NHIRD, we analyzed changes in prescription of analgesics 1 year before and 1 year after lumbar surgery; comorbidities, such as diabetes, asthma, osteoporosis, arthritis, depression and anxiety were also analyzed as covariates. A total of 3916 cases were enrolled in final analysis. Results: Post-operatively, the defined daily dosage (DDD) of analgesics decreased from a median DDD of 50.0 to a median of 14.2. In a multivariate model analysis, female, older age, anxiety and asthma were the significant factors for unfavorable outcome (defined by dosage of analgesics decreased less than 50% after surgery). Conclusions: The analgesics significantly decreased for patients received lumbar surgeries, implying the decreased of pain. In addition, co-morbidity factors were identified by the failure for analgesics reduction, such as female, older age, anxiety and asthma. For patients with lower back pain, these factors should be considered before receiving lumbar surgeries.

"Adult attachment's unique contribution in the prediction of postpartum depressive symptoms, beyond personality traits","Background: Personality traits such as neuroticism can help identify pregnant women at risk of postpartum depressive symptoms (PPDS). However, it is unclear whether attachment style could have an additional contribution to this risk elevation. This study aimed to examine the overlap of adult attachment insecurity and neuroticism/trait anxiety as PPDS predictors, taking into account baseline depressive symptoms. Methods: A Swedish population-based sample of pregnant women reported on adult attachment and either neuroticism (n = 1063) or trait anxiety (n = 555). Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline, and at six weeks and six months postpartum. Correlations between attachment and neuroticism/trait anxiety were calculated. Generalized linear models of PPDS tested the effect of attachment anxiety and avoidance, adjusting for neuroticism/trait anxiety and baseline depression. Logistic regression models with combined high attachment anxiety and neuroticism/trait anxiety visualized their value as risk factors beyond antenatal depression. Results: Attachment and neuroticism/trait anxiety were highly correlated (r = .55–.77). Attachment anxiety exerted a partially independent effect on PPDS at six weeks (p &lt; .05) and at six months (p &lt; .05) adjusting for neuroticism. Among antenatally non-depressed, combined high attachment anxiety and high neuroticism or trait anxiety was predictive of PPDS at both assessment points. Limitations: Low acceptance rate, exclusive use of self-reports. Conclusions: Beyond personality, attachment anxiety had a small independent effect on the risk of PPDS. Combining items of adult attachment and neuroticism/trait anxiety could prove useful in antenatal screening for high risk of PPDS.

Comparing brief interventions for suicidal individuals not engaged in treatment: A randomized clinical trial,"Background: Non-treatment-engaged individuals experiencing suicidal thoughts have been largely overlooked in the intervention literature, despite reviews suggesting most individuals who die by suicide were not in treatment immediately prior to their death. Most intervention studies recruit individuals from treatment providers, potentially neglecting those individuals who are not already engaged in services. These individuals clearly represent a group in need of additional empirical attention. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare a single-session dialectical behavior therapy skills-based intervention to a relaxation training control condition. Ninety-three non-treatment-engaged subjects participated in a single in-person assessment, received one of the intervention protocols, and completed follow-up phone interviews for three months including measures of suicidal ideation, emotion dysregulation, and coping skills, as well as other relevant assessments. Results: Both conditions reported significantly reduced levels of suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety; however, analyses revealed no significant differences between conditions on the main outcome measures of suicidal ideation, emotion dysregulation, skills use, depression, or anxiety. Limitations: The two interventions may have been too similar to permit detection of differential effects with this sample size. Specifically, the control condition may have been too active and there may have been stylistic overlap by providers who delivered both interventions. Conclusions: Encouragingly, half of subjects contacted other mental health services during the follow-up period. Although the two interventions under investigation did not yield differential results, the significant changes in important domains across interventions suggest that brief interventions may hold promise for this difficult-to-reach population.

Factors associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) 4–6 weeks and 6 months after birth: A longitudinal population-based study,"Background: Identifying factors that precipitate and maintain post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) after birth is important to inform clinical and research practice; yet, prospective longitudinal studies on the predictors of PTSS are limited. This study aimed to determine the pregnancy and postpartum factors associated with PTSS at 4–6 weeks and 6-months postpartum. Method: A systematic sample of 950 pregnant women were recruited from three maternity hospitals in Turkey. Participants completed assessments of depression, anxiety, PTSS and social support in pregnancy, 4–6 weeks and 6-months postpartum. Fear of childbirth was assessed in pregnancy and 4–6 weeks after birth. Results: Regression models showed that PTSS six months after birth were associated with anxiety and PTSS in pregnancy, complications during birth, satisfaction with health professionals, fear of childbirth 4–6 weeks after birth, PTSS and depression 4–6 weeks after birth, social support 4–6 weeks after birth, traumatic events after birth, need for psychological help, and social support 6-months after birth. PTSS was highly comorbid with depression and anxiety at all-time points. The most robust predictor of PTSS at 6-months postpartum was PTSS at 4–6 weeks postpartum. Intra-partum complications were not associated with PTSS 4–6 weeks after birth. No socio-demographic variables were correlated with PTSS postpartum. Limitations: Self-report questionnaires were used to measure outcomes. This study is based on sampling from public hospitals so may not represent women treated in private hospitals. Conclusions: Associated risk factors may help to identify women at risk of PTSS after birth and to inform targeted early intervention.

"Mapping the relationship between anxiety, anhedonia, and depression","Introduction: Anxiety and depression are often comorbid conditions, but there is uncertainty as to how this comorbidity develops. Thus, in three studies, we attempted to discern whether anhedonia may be a key linking factor between anxiety and depression. Methods: Three studies asked participants about their symptoms of anxiety and depression: in Study 1, 109 participants completed measures of anxiety, depression, activity avoidance, and perceived enjoyability and importance of avoided activities; in Study 2, 747 participants completed measures of anhedonia, anxiety, depression, and defensiveness; in Study 3, 216 participants completed measures assessing the same constructs as in Study 2 at four time-points (ranging 11 months in span). Results: In Study 1, symptoms of anxiety and depression were positively related only in individuals who relinquished potential enjoyment due to their anxiety-related avoidance; in Study 2, the indirect effect of anhedonia helped explained how anxiety symptoms imparted risk onto depressive symptoms; and in Study 3, anxiety led to anhedonia and then depression over time and anhedonia led to anxiety and then depression at both 5 and 11 months. Limitations: The manuscript is limited by the use of a student sample in study 2, cross-sectional methods in studies 1 and 2, and reliance on self-ratings. Conclusions: Anxiety may devolve into depression through anhedonia, such that anxious individuals begin to lose pleasure in anxiety-provoking activities, which results in the development of other depressive symptoms.

Agreement between clinical and MINI diagnoses in outpatients with mood and anxiety disorders,"Background: Standardized Diagnostic Interviews (SDIs) such as the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) are widely used to systematically screen for psychiatric disorders in research. To support generalizability of results to clinical practice, we assessed agreement between the MINI and clinical diagnoses. Methods: Agreement was assessed in a large, real life dataset (n = 7016) using concordance statistics such as sensitivity, specificity, efficiency and area under the curve (AUC). Results: 41.5% of clinical diagnoses were mood disorders, 26.5% were anxiety disorders. Overall, we found moderate agreement between MINI and clinical diagnoses (median efficiency: 0.92, median AUC: 0.79). For mood disorders, the AUC for all participants showed a range between 0.55 and 0.81 (median: 0.73), and for anxiety disorders the AUC ranged from 0.78 to 0.88 (median: 0.83). The AUC showed better agreement for mood disorders in the single diagnosis group than in the total group (median 0.77 vs. 0.71). For anxiety disorders, the AUC for the single diagnosis group was comparable to the AUC of the total group (median: 0.81 vs. 0.83 respectively). Numbers of false positives were high for both mood and anxiety diagnoses, but less so in the single diagnosis group. Limitations: Time lag between MINI and clinical diagnosis, the availability of only the primary clinical diagnosis, and relatively high severity of the current sample are limitations of the current study. Conclusions: Agreement between MINI and clinical diagnoses was moderate at best, which partly reflects the difference between the different measures used in the current study.

"Dual burden of chronic physical diseases and anxiety/mood disorders among São Paulo megacity mental health survey sample, Brazil","Background: We assessed comorbid associations of 12-month DSM-IV mood/any anxiety disorders with chronic physical conditions within the São Paulo (SP) Megacity Mental Health cross-sectional survey of 5037 participants and explored whether strength of comorbid associations were modified when controlling for demographics. Methods: Chi-square tests and logistic regressions were used to examine comorbid associations of DSM-IV mood/anxiety disorders as measured by the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0), and self-reported chronic physical conditions among adults from the SP Megacity Mental Health Survey. Results: Among those with any mood or anxiety disorder, chronic pain disorder was the most common physical condition (48.9% and 44.9%, respectively). Significant unadjusted odds ratios (OR) of comorbidity were found between diagnosis of two or more physical conditions and any mood disorders (3.08, 95% CI: 2.27–4.17), and any anxiety disorders (2.49, 95% CI: 1.95–3.17). Comorbidities remained significant when stratified by gender and controlling for marital status, household income, and education (latter two only included within anxiety models). Limitations: These results cannot be generalized to other cities or rural populations. Homeless and institutionalized populations were not surveyed. Due to cross-sectional study design, the direction of association between chronic disease/chronic disease risk factors and mood disorders is unclear. Conclusions: Dual burden of chronic physical conditions and mood/anxiety disorders is a notable problem among the São Paulo Megacity Survey population, with enhanced comorbidity experienced by community members with multiple physical conditions. Clinicians should consider these findings in understanding healthcare delivery for individuals suffering from both psychiatric disorders and chronic physical conditions.

Simplifying profiles of comorbidity in bipolar disorder,"Background: Comorbid psychiatric symptoms in bipolar disorder (BD) predict poorer course of illness and treatment outcome. The sheer number of comorbid symptoms has thwarted developing treatments to address these comorbid concerns. The goal of this study was to develop a more parsimonious approach to understanding clusters of comorbid symptoms within BD. Method: Data were collected as part of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Structured diagnostic interviews were conducted with 43,093 participants using the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-IV (AUDADIS-IV). Analyses were conducted on lifetime symptom counts for the most common 14 comorbid disorders among the 1411 persons who met lifetime criteria for bipolar I disorder. Results: An exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation as well as confirmatory factor analyses revealed a three-factor solution of Externalizing, Anxiety, and Mood syndromes, with a higher order Internalizing factor comprised of the Mood and Anxiety factors. Limitations: Further research is needed in a clinical sample. Conclusions: Comorbid symptoms in BD tend to cohere into Internalizing and Externalizing disorders, which could simplify research and treatment on comorbidity in BD.

Brain antioxidant effect of mirtazapine and reversal of sedation by its combination with alpha-lipoic acid in a model of depression induced by corticosterone,"Background: Depression is accompanied by activated neuro-oxidative and neuro-nitrosative pathways, while targeting these pathways has clinical efficacy in depression. This study aimed to investigate the effects of mirtazapine (MIRT) alone and combined with alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) against corticosterone (CORT) induced behavioral and oxidative alterations. Methods: Male mice received vehicle or CORT 20mg/kg during 14 days. From the 15th to 21st days they were divided in groups administered: vehicle, MIRT 3mg/kg or the combinations MIRT+ALA100 or MIRT+ALA200. On the 21st day of treatment, the animals were subjected to behavioral tests. Twenty-four hours after the last drug administration hippocampus (HC) and striatum (ST) were dissected for the determination reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LP) and nitrite levels. Results: CORT induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors as observed by increased immobility time in the tail suspension test and decreased sucrose consumption. MIRT or MIRT+ALA are effective in reversing anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors induced by CORT. CORT and MIRT alone prolonged sleeping time and this effect was reversed by MIRT+ALA. CORT significantly increased LP, which was reversed by MIRT or MIRT+ALA. Nitrite levels were increased in CORT-treated animals and reversed by MIRT+ALA200 (HC), MIRT or MIRT+ALA (ST). Limitation: A relative small sample size and lack of a washout period between drug administration and behavioral testing. Conclusions: MIRT or MIRT+ALA reverse CORT-induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors probably via their central antioxidant effects. Augmentation of MIRT with ALA may reverse sedation, an important side effect of MIRT. Randomized controlled studies are needed to examine the clinical efficacy of this combination in human depression.

Lifetime anxiety disorder and current anxiety symptoms associated with hastened depressive recurrence in bipolar disorder,"Aims: To assess differential relationships between lifetime anxiety disorder/current anxiety symptoms and longitudinal depressive severity in bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: Stanford BD Clinic outpatients enrolled during 2000–2011 were assessed with the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD (STEP-BD) Affective Disorders Evaluation and followed with the STEP-BD Clinical Monitoring Form while receiving naturalistic treatment for up to two years. Baseline unfavorable illness characteristics/current mood symptoms and times to depressive recurrence/recovery were compared in patients with versus without lifetime anxiety disorder/current anxiety symptoms. Results: Among 105 currently recovered patients, lifetime anxiety disorder was significantly associated with 10/27 (37.0%) demographic/other unfavorable illness characteristics/current mood symptoms/current psychotropics, hastened depressive recurrence (driven by earlier onset age), and a significantly (&gt; two-fold) higher Kaplan-Meier estimated depressive recurrence rate, whereas current anxiety symptoms were significantly associated with 10/27 (37.0%) demographic/other unfavorable illness characteristics/current mood symptoms/current psychotropics and hastened depressive recurrence (driven by lifetime anxiety disorder), but only a numerically higher Kaplan-Meier estimated depressive recurrence rate. In contrast, among 153 currently depressed patients, lifetime anxiety disorder/current anxiety symptoms were not significantly associated with time to depressive recovery or depressive recovery rate. Limitations: American tertiary BD clinic referral sample, open naturalistic treatment. Conclusions: Research is needed regarding differential relationships between lifetime anxiety disorder and current anxiety symptoms and hastened/delayed depressive recurrence/recovery—Specifically whether lifetime anxiety disorder versus current anxiety symptoms has marginally more robust association with hastened depressive recurrence, and whether both have marginally more robust associations with hastened depressive recurrence versus delayed depressive recovery, and related clinical implications.

Transdiagnostic treatment of bipolar disorder and comorbid anxiety using the Unified Protocol for Emotional Disorders: A pilot feasibility and acceptability trial,"Background: Comorbid anxiety in bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with greater illness severity, reduced treatment response, and greater impairment. Treating anxiety in the context of BD is crucial for improving illness course and outcomes. The current study examined the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the Unified Protocol (UP), a cognitive behavioral therapy, as an adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy for BD and comorbid anxiety disorders. Methods: Twenty-nine patients with BD and at least one comorbid anxiety disorder were randomized to pharmacotherapy treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU with 18 sessions of the UP (UP+TAU). All patients completed assessments every four weeks to track symptoms, functioning, emotion regulation and temperament. Linear mixed-model regressions were conducted to track symptom changes over time and to examine the relationship between emotion-related variables and treatment response. Results: Satisfaction ratings were equivalent for both treatment groups. Patients in the UP+TAU group evidenced significantly greater reductions over time in anxiety and depression symptoms (Cohen's d's &gt; 0.80). Baseline levels of neuroticism, perceived affective control, and emotion regulation ability predicted magnitude of symptom change for the UP+TAU group only. Greater change in perceived control of emotions and emotion regulation skills predicted greater change in anxiety related symptoms. Limitations: This was a pilot feasibility and acceptability trial; results should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions: Treatment with the UP+TAU was rated high in patient satisfaction, and resulted in significantly greater improvement on indices of anxiety and depression relative to TAU. This suggests that the UP may be a feasible treatment approach for BD with comorbid anxiety.

Severity of anxiety– but not depression– is associated with oxidative stress in Major Depressive Disorder,"Background: Oxidative stress is implicated in both depression and anxiety, but it is currently unclear whether this relates to syndromal diagnoses or trans-diagnostic dimensional symptoms. We examined the relationship between oxidative stress and severity of depression and anxiety symptoms in individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Methods: Plasma oxidative stress markers F2-isoprostanes and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and the antioxidant reduced glutathione (GSH), were assessed in 69 physically healthy, medication-free MDD subjects. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A) and Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) Rating Scales. Total HAM-A and HAM-D scores, along with “core” anxiety and depression subscales, and individual HAM-D items “psychic anxiety” and “depressed mood,” were related to oxidative stress markers. Analyses controlled for age, sex, BMI, and smoking. Results: Total HAM-A ratings were positively associated with F2-isoprostanes ( β =.26, p =.042) and GSSG ( β =.25, p =.049), but not GSH ( β =.05, p =.711). Core anxiety severity was positively associated with F2-isoprostanes ( β =.34, p =.012) and GSSG, although this did not reach significance ( β =.24, p =.074). None of the biological markers were significantly associated with total HAM-D or core depression ratings (all p &gt; .13). Subjects scoring high on “psychic anxiety” had elevated F2-isoprostanes ( p =.030) and GSSG ( p =.020). This was not seen with “depressed mood” scores (all p &gt;.12). Limitations: We assessed peripheral oxidative markers, but their relationship to the brain is unclear. Conclusions: Oxidative stress is more closely related to anxiety than depression symptoms in MDD. This highlights the importance of relating oxidative stress to specific symptoms and could provide new insights into the biological correlates of affective disorders.

Pregnancy-related anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with visuospatial working memory errors during pregnancy,"Background: Cognitive deficits, especially in memory and concentration, are often reported during pregnancy. Similar cognitive dysfunctions can also occur in depression and anxiety. To date, few studies have investigated the associations between cognitive deficits and psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy. This field is of interest because maternal cognitive functioning, and particularly its higher-order aspects are related to maternal well-being and caregiving behavior, as well as later child development. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 230), reporting low (n = 87), moderate (n = 97), or high (n = 46) levels of depressive, general anxiety and/or pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms (assessed repeatedly with EPDS, SCL-90/anxiety subscale, PRAQ-R2, respectively) were tested in mid-pregnancy for their cognitive functions. A computerized neuropsychological test battery was used. Results: Pregnant women with high or moderate level of psychiatric symptoms had significantly more errors in visuospatial working memory/executive functioning task than mothers with low symptom level. Depressive symptoms throughout pregnancy and concurrent pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms were significant predictors of the performance in the task. General anxiety symptoms were not related to visuospatial working memory. Limitations: Cognitive functions were evaluated only at one time-point during pregnancy precluding causal conclusions. Conclusions: Maternal depressive symptoms and pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms were both associated with decrements in visuospatial working memory/executive functioning. Depressive symptoms seem to present more stable relationship with cognitive deficits, while pregnancy-related anxiety was associated only concurrently. Future studies could investigate, how stable these cognitive differences are, and whether they affect maternal ability to deal with demands of pregnancy and later parenting.

Oxytocin receptor and G-protein polymorphisms in patients with depression and separation anxiety,"Background: The impact of combined variants of Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) and G protein β3 subunit genes was investigated in relation to retrospective reports of childhood as well as contemporary adult separation anxiety (SA), based on evidence of a β/γ dimer-mediated signaling for OXTR. Methods: A case-control association study (225 healthy adults and 188 outpatients with depression) was performed to establish Risk-Combined Genotype (RCG) of the studied variants (OXTR rs53576 and the functional Gβ3 subunit rs5443). Current SA was evaluated by the ASA-27 and retrospective childhood symptoms by the SASI. GG genotype of OXTR rs53576 combined with T-carrier genotype of Gβ3 rs5443 represented the RCG. Results: Compared to non-RCG, those with RCG had significantly higher levels of childhood and adult SA. The RCG was significantly associated with childhood SA threshold score (OR = 2.85, 90%CI: 1.08–7.50). Childhood SA was, in turn, strongly associated with a threshold SA score in adulthood (OR = 15.58; 95% CI: 4.62–52.59). Limitations: Although the overall sample size is sizable, comparisons among subgroups with specific combination of alleles are based on relatively small numbers. Conclusions:: Our study indicates that variations in OXTR and Gβ3 genes are specifically associated with presence and severity of SA in childhood and adulthood, but not with depression or anxiety in general. Because there is increasing interest in oxytocin in social behavior, the gene-SA associations identified have potential translational and clinical relevance.

Efficacy of an Internet-based CBT program for children with comorbid high functioning autism spectrum disorder and anxiety: A randomised controlled trial,"Background: All trials conducted to date on BRAVE-ONLINE for youth anxiety disorders have excluded children with High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HFASD) and therefore it is unknown whether these programs might be beneficial to HFASD children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of BRAVE-ONLINE in HFASD children with an anxiety disorder. Methods: Forty-two HFASD children, aged 8–12 years, with an anxiety disorder, and their parents, were randomly assigned to either the BRAVE-ONLINE condition (NET) or a waitlist control (WLC). Diagnostic interviews and parent/child questionnaires were completed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Results: At post- assessment, compared to children in the WLC condition, children in the NET condition demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in number of anxiety diagnoses, clinical severity of diagnosis, and self and parent reported anxiety symptoms, as well as significantly greater increases in overall functioning. However, loss of primary diagnosis in this sample was lower than in previous studies. Limitations: The small sample size, coupled with attrition rates, makes it difficult to generalise the findings of the study to HFASD population and to conduct analyses regarding mediators, moderators and predictors of outcomes. Conclusions: The BRAVE-ONLINE program may be useful in reducing anxiety symptoms in HFASD children, although the effects are less strong than those found in neurotypical children for a variety of reasons.

Depression and anxiety among chronic pain patients receiving prescription opioids and medical marijuana,"Background: High rates of depression and anxiety have been consistently reported among patients suffering from chronic pain. Prescription opioids are one of the most common modalities for pharmacological treatment of pain, however in recent years medical marijuana(MM) has been increasingly used for pain control in the US and in several countries worldwide. The aim of this study was to compare levels of depression and anxiety among pain patients receiving prescription opioids and MM. Methods: Participants were patients suffering from chronic pain treated with prescription opioids (OP,N = 474), MM (N = 329) or both (OPMM,N = 77). Depression and anxiety were assessed using the depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). Results: Prevalence of depression among patients in the OP, MM and OPMM groups was 57.1%, 22.3% and 51.4%, respectively and rates of anxiety were 48.4%, 21.5% and 38.7%, respectively. After controlling for confounders, patients in the OP group were significantly more likely to screen positive for depression (Adjusted Odds Ratio(AOR) = 6.18;95%CI = 4.12–9.338) and anxiety(AOR = 4.12;CI = 3.84–5.71)) compared to those in the MM group. Individuals in the OPMM group were more prone for depression (AOR for depression = 3.34;CI = 1.52–7.34)) compared to those in the MM group. Limitations: Cross-sectional study, restricting inference of causality. Conclusions: Levels of depression and anxiety are higher among chronic pain patients receiving prescription opioids compared to those receiving MM. Findings should be taken into consideration when deciding on the most appropriate treatment modality for chronic pain, particularly among those at risk for depression and anxiety.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder has a reduced placebo (and antidepressant) response compared to other anxiety disorders: A meta-analysis,"Background: Previous studies have indicated that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) might have a reduced placebo response compared to other anxiety-related disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety disorder. No previous analysis has directly compared antidepressant and placebo responses between OCD and these conditions. Method: We analyzed pre-post change scores within drug and placebo groups as well as between-groups change scores (i.e., drug compared to placebo) for all FDA-approved antidepressants for the treatment of these five anxiety-related disorders. Antidepressants included duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. Random effects meta-analysis was used to examine all trials submitted to the FDA, plus additional post-approval trials available from manufacturer-sponsored clinical trial registers. Clinician-rated symptom inventories were the outcome measures for all conditions to facilitate comparisons across diagnoses. Results: Fifty-six trials met inclusion criteria. OCD had significantly lower pre-post effect sizes ( ps &lt; 0.003) for both placebo (Hedges' g = 0.49) and antidepressants ( g = 0.84) compared to the other four conditions ( gs between 0.70 and 1.10 for placebo and 1.11 and 1.40 for antidepressants). However, the drug-placebo effect sizes did not significantly differ across diagnoses (Q(4) = 6.09, p = 0.193, I ² = 34.3% [95% CI: −7.0,59.7]), with gs between = 0.26 and 0.39. Conclusions: Overall pre-post change scores were smaller for OCD compared to other anxiety disorders for both antidepressants and placebo, although drug-placebo effects sizes did not significantly differ across disorders. Theoretical and clinical implications for the understanding and treatment of OCD are discussed.

Precursors in adolescence of adult-onset bipolar disorder,"Background: Although the estimated contribution of genetic factors is high in bipolar disorder, environmental factors may also play a role. This Swedish register-based cohort study of men examined if physical and psychological characteristics in late adolescence, including factors previously linked with bipolar disorder (body mass index, asthma and allergy), are associated with subsequent bipolar disorder in adulthood. Unipolar depression and anxiety are analysed as additional outcomes to identify bipolar disorder-specific associations. Methods: A total of 213,693 men born between 1952 and 1956, who participated in compulsory military conscription assessments in late adolescence were followed up to 2009, excluding men with any psychiatric diagnoses at baseline. Cox regression estimated risk of bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety in adulthood associated with body mass index, asthma, allergy, muscular strength stress resilience and cognitive function in adolescence. Results: BMI, asthma and allergy were not associated with bipolar disorder. Higher grip strength, cognitive function and stress resilience were associated with a reduced risk of bipolar disorder and the other disease outcomes. Limitations: The sample consisted only of men; even though the characteristics in adolescence pre-dated disease onset, they may have been the consequence of prodromal disease. Conclusions: Associations with body mass index and asthma found by previous studies may be consequences of bipolar disorder or its treatment rather than risk factors. Inverse associations with all the outcome diagnoses for stress resilience, muscular strength and cognitive function may reflect general risks for these psychiatric disorders or intermediary factors.

Adult attachment style and anxiety—The mediating role of emotion regulation,"Background: Although there is substantial evidence for the role of emotion regulation in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders, knowledge about what contributes to emotion dysregulation is sparse. Attachment style is related to emotion regulation and anxiety symptoms, but these variables have rarely been examined together. Examining emotion dysregulation within the context of anxiety disorders through an attachment theory framework will lead to a better understanding of the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. In the present study we combined theoretically and empirically derived knowledge to examine the mediating role of emotion regulation between attachment dimensions (avoidance and anxiety) and anxiety symptoms. Methods: A total of 147 individuals were assessed with Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R) and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and statistical mediation analyses were conducted. Results: Our results indicate that the significant association between anxiety and attachment anxiety was mediated by emotion dysregulation, whereas attachment avoidance was not significantly related to anxiety when covarying for attachment anxiety. The primary limitation of our study is that data is cross-sectional and so causation cannot be inferred. Secondly, all measures used in this study were derived from self-reported questionnaires, which may be more susceptible to bias. Conclusions: Our results suggest that it is not insecure attachment in general that is important in anxiety disorders, but that attachment anxiety is specifically relevant. Thus, clinical interventions for anxiety disorders may improve by targeting attachment related difficulties.

The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale: A systematic review and reliability generalization meta-analysis,"Background: Anxiety and depression are among the most common mental disorders during childhood and adolescence. Among the instruments for the brief screening assessment of symptoms of anxiety and depression, the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) is one of the more widely used. Previous studies have demonstrated the reliability of the RCADS for different assessment settings and different versions. The aims of this study were to examine the mean reliability of the RCADS and the influence of the moderators on the RCADS reliability. Methods: We searched in EBSCO, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and NCBI databases and other articles manually from lists of references of extracted articles. Results: A total of 146 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The RCADS showed robust internal consistency reliability in different assessment settings, countries, and languages. We only found that reliability of the RCADS was significantly moderated by the version of RCADS. However, these differences in reliability between different versions of the RCADS were slight and can be due to the number of items. Limitations: We did not examine factor structure, factorial invariance across gender, age, or country, and test-retest reliability of the RCADS. Conclusions: The RCADS is a reliable instrument for cross-cultural use, with the advantage of providing more information with a low number of items in the assessment of both anxiety and depression symptoms in children and adolescents.

Prefrontal and amygdala engagement during emotional reactivity and regulation in generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Emotion dysregulation is prominent in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), characterized clinically by exaggerated reactivity to negative stimuli and difficulty in down-regulating this response. Although limited research implicates frontolimbic disturbances in GAD, whether neural aberrations occur during emotional reactivity, regulation, or both is not well understood. Methods: During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 30 individuals with GAD and 30 healthy controls (HC) completed a well-validated explicit emotion regulation task designed to measure emotional reactivity and regulation of reactivity. During the task, participants viewed negative images (‘Look-Negative’ condition) and, on some trials, used a cognitive strategy to reduce negative affective response (‘Reappraise’ condition). Results: Results from an Analysis of Variance corrected for whole brain multiple comparisons showed a significant group x condition interaction in the left amygdala and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Results from post-hoc analyses showed that the GAD group engaged these regions to a greater extent than HCs during Look-Negative but not Reappraise. Behaviorally, the GAD group reported feeling more negative than the HC group in each condition, although both groups reported reduced negative affect following regulation. Limitations: As comorbidity was permitted, the presence of concurrent disorders, like other anxiety disorders and depression, detracts our ability to classify neural engagement particular to GAD alone. Conclusions: Individuals with GAD exhibited over-engagement of amygdala and frontal regions during the viewing of negative images, compared to HCs. Together, these aberrations may indicate that deficits in emotional reactivity rather than regulation contribute to emotion dysregulation in those with GAD.

Can smartphone mental health interventions reduce symptoms of anxiety? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Background: Various psychological interventions are effective for reducing symptoms of anxiety when used alone, or as an adjunct to anti-anxiety medications. Recent studies have further indicated that smartphone-supported psychological interventions may also reduce anxiety, although the role of mobile devices in the treatment and management of anxiety disorders has yet to be established. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reporting the effects of psychological interventions delivered via smartphone on symptoms of anxiety (sub-clinical or diagnosed anxiety disorders). A systematic search of major electronic databases conducted in November 2016 identified 9 eligible RCTs, with 1837 participants. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate the standardized mean difference (as Hedges’ g) between smartphone interventions and control conditions. Results: Significantly greater reductions in total anxiety scores were observed from smartphone interventions than control conditions (g = 0.325, 95% C.I. = 0.17–0.48, p &lt; 0.01), with no evidence of publication bias. Effect sizes from smartphone interventions were significantly greater when compared to waitlist/inactive controls (g = 0.45, 95% C.I. = 0.30–0.61, p &lt; 0.01) than active control conditions (g = 0.19, 95% C.I. = 0.07–0.31, p = 0.003). Limitations: The extent to which smartphone interventions can match (or exceed) the efficacy of recognised treatments for anxiety has yet to established. Conclusions: This meta-analysis shows that psychological interventions delivered via smartphone devices can reduce anxiety. Future research should aim to develop pragmatic methods for implementing smartphone-based support for people with anxiety, while also comparing the efficacy of these interventions to standard face-to-face psychological care.

Long-term influences of parental divorce on offspring affective disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: The prevalence of divorce in Western countries has increased in recent decades. However, there is no recent systematic review and/or meta-analysis of studies testing for long-term effects of parental divorce on offspring affective disorders. The present study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published since 1980 testing for the association between parental divorce and offspring depression and anxiety in adulthood. Method: PUBMED, Science Direct, Medline, PsychInfo, and PsychArticles databases were searched for eligible studies. Random-effect meta-analyses were used to synthesize effect sizes and to test whether associations of parental divorce with offspring affective disorders differed among three publication periods (i.e., before 1996, 1996–2005, 2006–2015). Results: In total, 29 studies were eligible for the systematic review, and 18 studies were included in the meta-analyses (depression: n = 21,581; anxiety: n = 2472). There was significant association between parental divorce and offspring depression (OR = 1.56; 95%CI [1.31, 1.86]), but not anxiety (OR = 1.16; 95%CI [0.98, 1.38]). The effect of parental divorce on offspring depression was not weaker in the reports published in more recent decades. Limitations: There is limited research in relation to offspring anxiety in adulthood. Conclusions: Parental divorce is associated with an increased risk of adult offspring depression, with no indication of the effect being weaker in recent publications.

The influence of attention biases and adult attachment style on treatment outcome for adults with social anxiety disorder,"Background: Attention biases figure prominently in CBT models of social anxiety and are thought to maintain symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAD). Studies have shown that individual differences in pre-treatment attention biases predict cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) outcome. However, these findings have been inconsistent as to whether vigilance towards threat predicts better or poorer treatment outcome. Adult attachment style is an individual characteristic that may influence the relationship between attention bias and SAD. This study investigates the relationship between attention biases and CBT treatment outcome for SAD. Furthermore, we examined the influence of adult attachment style on this relationship. Method: Participants with a primary diagnosis of SAD completed a passive viewing (measuring vigilance towards threat) and a novel difficulty to disengage (measuring difficulty to disengage attention) eye-tracking task prior to attending 12 CBT group sessions targeting SAD. Symptom severity was measured at pre- and post-treatment. Regression analyses were conducted on a sample of 50 participants. Results: Greater vigilance for threat than avoidance of threat at pre-treatment predicted poorer treatment outcomes. Greater difficulty disengaging from happy faces, compared to neutral faces, predicted poorer treatment outcomes. Attachment style did not moderate these relationships. Limitations: The associations between attention biases and specific components of CBT treatment were not examined. The novel findings regarding difficulty to disengage attention require replication. Conclusions: The findings have implications for the theoretical models of SAD and for the treatment of SAD.

Fear reactivity to cognitive dyscontrol via novel head-mounted display perceptual illusion exercises,"Background: Anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns (ASCC), refer to fears of mental catastrophe or losing control over mental processes. Recent findings show that ASCC are related to suicide risk, mood disorders and trauma-related disorders. Using controlled experimental psychopathology paradigms could be one heretofore unutilized method of increasing understanding of ASCC. Our goal was to test fear reactivity to four head-mounted display perceptual illusion challenges designed to bring on feelings of cognitive dyscontrol (i.e., derealization, depersonalization) in a group of high and low anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns participants. Methods: Participants (N = 49) with Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 cognitive scores at least 1.5 SD above or below the mean completed four cognitive dyscontrol challenges utilizing head-mounted display technology. Results: Results showed all four challenges successfully elicited high cognitive anxiety symptoms. Consistent with other laboratory challenge studies; high versus low ASCC participants reported comparable cognitive symptoms but reported significantly greater fear. Limitations: This was an initial proof of concept study designed to examine fear reactivity to cognitive dyscontrol challenges. Therefore, no control exercises were evaluated. Conclusions: The finding that fear reactivity to the laboratory challenges can potentially serve as a viable behavioral correlate of ASCC provides a potentially useful exposure exercise for clients experiencing high levels of ASCC. Given the association between ASCC and severe psychopathology, with further investigation and refinement, such exposure exercises could be integrated into cognitive-behavioral treatments.

Anxiety among adults with a history of childhood adversity: Psychological resilience moderates the indirect effect of emotion dysregulation,"Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been widely identified as risk factors for increased symptoms of anxiety across the lifespan. Little is known, however, about the processes by which ACEs set the stage for increased symptoms of anxiety in adulthood. The current study evaluated whether emotion dysregulation and psychological resilience influence the association between ACEs and symptoms of anxiety. Methods: A sample of adult primary care patients ( N = 4006) completed self-report measures related to ACEs, symptoms of anxiety, emotion dysregulation, and psychological resilience. Results: A moderated mediation analysis showed that emotion dysregulation mediated the association between ACEs and anxiety symptoms, and that the strength of this effect varied as a function of psychological resilience. Specifically, the influence of ACEs on emotional dysregulation was stronger among individuals with low levels of psychological resilience than among those with high levels of psychological resilience. These findings remained significant when controlling for a range of sociodemographic variables in the model. Limitations: Cross-sectional designs preclude inferences about causality and self-report data may be susceptible to reporting biases. Other psychological variables that may be relevant to the current results, such as protective factors in childhood, were not assessed. Conclusions: These results have implications for the conceptualization of ACEs, emotion dysregulation, and psychological resilience in etiological models of anxiety. They also highlight the relevance of ACEs, emotion dysregulation, and psychological resilience to the detection, treatment, and prevention of anxiety disorders.

High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment for major depression: Dissociated effects on psychopathology and neurocognition,"Objectives: This open-label pilot study explored the effects of a course of accelerated high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) on two neurocognitive domains (decision-making and impulse control) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Participants with MDD and a treatment resistant major depressive episode (n = 24) underwent twice-daily HF-rTMS targeted at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) over two weeks. Psychopathology was assessed by clinician-administered and self-reported measures of depression and anxiety; decision-making was assessed by the Iowa Gambling Task, the Balloon Analog Risk Task and the Game of Dice Task; impulse control was assessed by the Stroop Color-Word Task, the Continuous Performance Task and the Stop-Signal Task. Results: Depression and anxiety scores significantly improved from pre-post HF-rTMS treatment. However, none of the decision-making or impulse control variables of interest changed significantly from pre-post HF-rTMS. Moreover, there was no correlation between changes in psychopathological symptoms and in neurocognition. Limitations: This is a moderately sized open label trial, and the confounds of ongoing psychotropics and illness chronicity can not be excluded in this treatment resistant sample. Conclusions: There is dissociation between acute symptomatic benefit after a course of accelerated HF-rTMS applied to the lDLPFC in treatment resistant MDD and performance on tests of decision making and impulse control. Though rTMS appears cognitively safe, additional research is warranted to understand this potential dissociation and its putative clinical implications.

Neural reactivity to reward and internalizing symptom dimensions,"Background: Reduced reward responsiveness, measured via the event-related potential (ERP) component the reward positivity (RewP), has been linked to several internalizing psychopathologies (IPs). Specifically, prior studies suggest that a reduced RewP is robustly related to depression and to a lesser extent anxiety. No studies to date, however, have examined the relation between the RewP and IP symptom dimensions in a heterogeneous, clinically representative patient population that includes both depressed and/or anxious subjects. The primary aim of the current study was to examine the relation between the RewP and specific internalizing symptom dimensions among patients with a variety of IP diagnoses and symptoms. Methods: A total of 80 treatment seeking adults from the community completed a battery of questionnaires assessing a range of IP symptoms and a well-validated reward processing task known to robustly elicit the RewP. Results: A principal components analysis (PCA) on clinical assessments revealed two distinct factors that characterized the patient sample: affective distress/misery and fear-based anxiety. Results showed that within this sample, an attenuated RewP was associated with greater affective distress/misery based symptoms; however, the RewP was unrelated to fear-based anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: The current findings suggest that patients with higher distress/misery symptoms are characterized by decreased responsivity to rewards at the physiological level, and that this response tendency distinguishes distress/misery symptoms from fear-based symptoms. The RewP may be one promising transdiagnostic biological target for intervention efforts for individuals with distress-based symptoms of psychopathology.

"Maternal depression and personality traits in association with child neuropsychological and behavioral development in preschool years: Mother-child cohort (Rhea Study) in Crete, Greece","Background: Poor perinatal maternal mental health has been linked with negative outcomes on early child development; however, the importance of maternal personality has been neglected thus far. We aimed to examine the effects of antenatal and postnatal maternal mental health, including assessment of maternal personality characteristics, on child neuropsychological and behavioral development at preschool years in a population based mother-child cohort (Rhea Study) in Crete, Greece. Method: Self-reported measures of maternal depression (EPDS), trait anxiety (STAI-Trait) and personality traits (EPQ-R) were assessed in a sample of 288 women at 28–32 weeks of gestation. A larger sample of 642 mothers completed the EPDS scale at 8 weeks postpartum. Children's neuropsychological (MSCA) and behavioral (ADHDT and SDQ) development were assessed at 4 years of age. Linear regression analyses were used to estimate the associations between the exposures and outcomes of interest after adjustment for potential confounders. Results: Regarding child neuropsychological development, increased postnatal depressive symptoms were associated with child's perceptual performance, whereas increased maternal psychoticism was linked with child's motor ability at 4 years of age. Furthermore, elevated levels of maternal depression during pregnancy and postpartum, and the predisposing personality characteristics of trait anxiety and neuroticism, were associated with children's behavioral difficulties. Limitations: A clinical diagnostic instrument for maternal mental health was not used and assessment of children's behavior was based on maternal report. Conclusion: These findings suggest that poor perinatal maternal mental health and an adverse personality profile may be associated with impaired child neuropsychological and behavioral development at preschool years.

Gender differences in automatic thoughts and cortisol and alpha-amylase responses to acute psychosocial stress in patients with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,"Introduction: Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) has a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfection, and mental and interpersonal control at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency. The aims of the present study were to explore the relationship between OCPD and psychological stress and psychological tests. Methods: We evaluated 63 OCPD patients and 107 healthy controls (HCs). We collected saliva samples from patients and controls before and after a social stress procedure, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), to measure the concentrations of salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and salivary cortisol. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Profile of Mood State (POMS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale (SASS), and Depression and Anxiety Cognition Scale (DACS) were administered to patients and HCs. Results: Following TSST exposure, the salivary amylase and cortisol levels were significantly decreased in male patients compared with controls. Additionally, OCPD patients had higher CTQ, POMS, STAI, and BDI scores than HCs and exhibited significantly higher anxiety and depressive states. OCPD patients scored higher on future denial and threat prediction as per the DACS tool. According to a stepwise regression analysis, STAI, POMS, and salivary cortisol responses were independent predictors of OCPD. Conclusions: Our results suggested that attenuated sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity in male OCPD patients occurs along with attenuated salivary amylase and cortisol responses to the TSST. In addition, there was a significant difference between OCPD patients and HCs in child trauma, mood, anxiety, and cognition.

Empirically derived patterns of psychiatric symptoms in youth: A latent profile analysis,"Background: By conceptualizing domains of behavior transdiagnostically, the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria (NIMH RDoC) initiative facilitates new ways of studying psychiatric symptoms. In this study, latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to empirically derive classes or patterns of psychiatric symptoms in youth that transect traditional nosologic boundaries. Methods: Data were drawn from 509 children and adolescents (ages 7-18 years; mean age =12.9 years; 54% male) who were evaluated in the NIMH Emotion and Development Branch and were heterogeneous with respect to presenting diagnoses and symptoms. Youth and/or their parents completed measures of several core symptom dimensions: irritability, anxiety, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). LPA was used to parse response patterns into distinct classes, based on the levels of, and interrelations among, scores on the different measures. Results: Five classes emerged: low levels of symptomatology (52% of sample); anxiety and mild depressive symptoms (17%); parent-reported irritability and ADHD (16%); irritability and mixed comorbid symptoms (10%); and high levels of irritability, anxiety, depression, and ADHD (5%). Importantly, these latent classes cut across informants and the clinical conditions for which youth were initially evaluated. Further, the classes characterized by irritability exhibited the poorest overall functioning. Limitations: These data were cross-sectional. Examination of external validators, including neurobiological correlates and symptom course, is warranted. Conclusions: Results inform our understanding of the structure of psychiatric symptoms in youth and suggest new ways to operationalize psychopathology and examine it in relation to neurobiology.

Investigating the nature of co-occurring depression and anxiety: Comparing diagnostic and dimensional research approaches,"Background: Although approximately half of adults diagnosed with a depressive or anxiety disorder exhibit their simultaneous co-occurrence, traditional research has centered on single-target diagnoses, overlooking comorbidities within samples. In this article, we review and extend the literature that directly investigates co-occurring depression and anxiety, with the goal of shifting the focus from co-occurring diagnoses to symptom dimensions. Methods: First, we review studies that have directly compared psychobiological features (neural, neuroendocrine, autonomic) across depression, anxiety, and their co-occurrence, defined either categorically or dimensionally. Second, we analyze adults’ diurnal cortisol secretion to examine the independent and interactive relations of continuously-assessed depressive and anxiety symptoms to neuroendocrine function. Results: Previous findings on the psychobiology of diagnostic co-occurrence are mixed. While nascent, evidence from dimensionally focused studies suggests that co-occurring levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms can interact with one another, as reflected in a distinct psychobiological profile for individuals with high levels of both symptom dimensions. Results of our analyses support this formulation: we found that depressive and anxiety symptom dimensions interacted consistently in their relation to the measures of diurnal cortisol. Limitations: The illustrative sample was relatively small and included only women; future research should examine generalizability of these findings. Conclusions: A dimensional approach to investigating the psychobiology of co-occurring depression and anxiety affords both conceptual and practical advantages. Simultaneously assessing depressive and anxiety symptom dimensions can efficiently capture their unique, shared, and interactive features, thereby identifying targets for intervention across a wide range of symptom presentations.

Latent variable analysis of positive and negative valence processing focused on symptom and behavioral units of analysis in mood and anxiety disorders,"Background: Mood and anxiety disorders are highly heterogeneous and their underlying pathology is complex. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach seeks to establish dimensionally and neuroscience-based descriptions of psychopathology that may inform better classification and treatment approaches. The current investigation sought to determine the latent variables underlying positive and negative valence processing in terms of symptoms and behavioral units of analysis. Method: As part of an ongoing study, individuals with mood and anxiety problems were recruited largely from primary care clinics at UCLA (n = 62) and UCSD (n = 58). These participants underwent a comprehensive symptomatic and behavioral assessment. An implicit approach avoidance task and a modified dot probe detection task were used to measure positive and negative valence processing. Results: Principal components analysis with varimax rotation identified four symptom components, three behavioral components for the dot probe task, and two behavioral components for the implicit approach avoidance task. These components yielded two meta-components consisting of: negative valence symptoms, negative approach bias, and high sustained, selective attention; and positive valence symptoms, positive approach bias, and slow selective or sustained attention. The components did not differ between males and females, nor by age or medication status. Limitations: The limitations are: (1) relatively small sample, (2) exploratory analysis strategy, (3) no test/re-test data, (4) no neural circuit analysis, and (5) limited reliability of behavioral data. Conclusions: These preliminary data show that positive and negative valence processing domains load on independent dimensions. Taken together, multi-level assessment approaches combined with advanced statistical analyses may help to identify distinct positive and negative valence processes within a clinical population that cut across traditional diagnostic categories.

Moderators of age effects on attention bias toward threat and its association with anxiety,"Objective: The current study used a research domain criteria (RDoC) approach to assess age differences in multiple indicators of attention bias and its ties to anxiety, examining stimulus domain and cognitive control as moderators of older adults’ oft-cited positivity effect (bias towards positive and away from negative stimuli, when compared to younger adults). Method: 38 Younger adults and 38 older adults were administered a battery of cognitive control and trait and state anxiety measures, and completed a dot-probe task to assess attention bias, during which reaction time and fixation duration (using eye-tracking) were recorded for negative and neutral social (a salient threat domain for younger adults) and physical (a salient threat domain for older adults) stimuli. Results: Mixed-effects models demonstrated that older adults were faster to react to dot-probe trials when the probe appeared in the place of negative (vs. neutral) physical stimuli, but displayed no difference in reaction time for social stimuli. Also, older (vs. younger) adults with lower levels of cognitive control were less negatively biased in their visual fixation to social stimuli. A negative reaction time attention bias on the dot-probe task predicted greater trait anxiety among participants with low levels of cognitive control, with a more complex pattern predicting state anxiety. Conclusion: Older adults do attend to social and physical stimuli differently. When stimuli concern a social threat, older adults do not preferentially attend to either neutral or negative stimuli. However, when stimuli concern physical threat, older adults preferentially attend to negative stimuli. Threat biases are associated with anxiety at all ages for those with low cognitive control.

Nice guys: Homozygocity for the &lt;i&gt;TPH2&lt;/i&gt; -703G/T (rs4570625) minor allele promotes low aggressiveness and low anxiety,"Background: Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of serotonin. We examined whether the TPH2 polymorphism -703G/T (rs4570625) is associated with aggressiveness and impulsivity, and the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, in a population-representative sample. Methods: We used self and proxy reports on aggressive behaviour in the younger birth cohort of the longitudinal Estonian Children Personality, Behaviour and Health Study collected at age 25, and earlier collected impulsivity and related data of both ECPBHS cohorts. Results: The TT homozygous males reported less aggressive behaviour in the Life History of Aggression interview at age 25. They also had significantly lower scores in Illinois Bully Scale peer reports, and less ADHD symptoms rated by teachers both at ages 9 and 15. The TT homozygotes of both sexes had the lowest Maladaptive Impulsivity at ages 18 and 25, and the highest Adaptive Impulsivity at age 25. The TT homozygotes also had low depressiveness and trait anxiety by age 25, and the odds ratio for the prevalence of anxiety disorders was 9.38 for the G-allele carriers. Limitations: The main limitation of the study is the naturally occurring low number of subjects with the TT genotype. Conclusions: Subjects with the TPH2 rs4570625 TT genotype, especially males, exhibit less aggression and a favourable impulsivity profile, and develop anxiety disorders by young adulthood less often.

Bidirectional association between Bell's palsy and anxiety disorders: A nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study,"Objective: Bell's palsy and anxiety disorders share numerous risk factors (e.g., immune response, ischemia, and psychological stress). However, there have been no studies on the bidirectional temporal association between the two illnesses. In this study, we used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to test the bidirectional association between Bell's palsy and anxiety disorders. We hypothesized that patients with Bell's palsy would have an increased risk of subsequent anxiety disorders later in life and that, conversely, those with anxiety disorders would have an increased likelihood of developing Bell's palsy later in life. Methods: We conducted two retrospective cohort studies using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Study 1 included 8070 patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders and 32,280 controls without anxiety disorders who were matched with sex, age, and enrollment date to analyze the following risk of Bell's palsy among both groups. Study 2 included 4980 patients with Bell's palsy and 19,920 controls without Bell's palsy who were matched with sex, age, and enrollment date to analyze the following risk of anxiety disorders among both groups. The patient records selected for the studies were dated between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2004. All subjects were observed until their outcomes of interest, death or December 31, 2009. Results: After adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, urbanization, and income, the hazard ratio (HR) for patients with anxiety disorders to contract Bell's palsy was 1.53 (95% CI, 1.21–1.94, P &lt; .001), and the HR for patients with Bell's palsy to develop an anxiety disorder was 1.59 (95% CI, 1.23–2.06, P &lt; .001). Conclusion: This study found a bidirectional temporal association between Bell's palsy and anxiety disorders. After one of these conditions develops, the morbidity rate for the other significantly increases. Additional studies are required to determine whether these two conditions share the same pathogenic mechanisms, and whether successfully treating one will reduce the morbidity rate for the other.

Using a hybrid subtyping model to capture patterns and dimensionality of depressive and anxiety symptomatology in the general population,"Background: Researchers have tried to identify more homogeneous subtypes of major depressive disorder (MDD) with latent class analyses (LCA). However, this approach does no justice to the dimensional nature of psychopathology. In addition, anxiety and functioning-levels have seldom been integrated in subtyping efforts. Therefore, this study used a hybrid discrete-dimensional approach to identify subgroups with shared patterns of depressive and anxiety symptomatology, while accounting for functioning-levels. Methods: The Comprehensive International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) 1.1 was used to assess previous-year depressive and anxiety symptoms in the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-1 (NEMESIS-1; n = 5583). The data were analyzed with factor analyses, LCA and hybrid mixed-measurement item response theory (MM-IRT) with and without functioning covariates. Finally, the classes’ predictors (measured one year earlier) and outcomes (measured two years later) were investigated. Results: A 3-class MM-IRT model with functioning covariates best described the data and consisted of a ‘healthy class’ (74.2%) and two symptomatic classes (‘sleep/energy’ [13.4%]; ‘mood/anhedonia’ [12.4%]). Factors including older age, urbanicity, higher severity and presence of 1-year MDD predicted membership of either symptomatic class vs. the healthy class. Both symptomatic classes showed poorer 2-year outcomes (i.e. disorders, poor functioning) than the healthy class. The odds of MDD after two years were especially increased in the mood/anhedonia class. Limitations: Symptoms were assessed for the past year whereas current functioning was assessed. Conclusions: Heterogeneity of depression and anxiety symptomatology are optimally captured by a hybrid discrete-dimensional subtyping model. Importantly, accounting for functioning-levels helps to capture clinically relevant interpersonal differences.

"Effects of subclinical depression, anxiety and somatization on brain structure in healthy subjects","Background: Dimensional approaches in highly prevalent psychiatric disorders like depression or anxiety could lead to a better understanding of pathogenesis and advantages in early detection and prevention. In an effort to better understand associations of brain structural variation across the depression/anxiety spectra, we investigated minor subclinical symptoms in a non-clinical healthy population. Methods: We studied 177 healthy subjects from the community, who underwent high-resolution T1-weighted 3T MRI and completed the symptom-checklist-90 (SCL-90-R). Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis with CAT12 software, we correlated SCL-90-R-subscales for depression, anxiety, and somatization with gray matter across the brain. Results: Significant positive gray matter correlations emerged across all three scales in different areas: the depression subscale correlated positively with gray matter in the Rolandic operculum, superior temporal gyrus (left) and postcentral gyrus (bilateral), the anxiety subscale correlated positively with middle temporal gyrus, Rolandic operculum, middle cingular gyrus and precuneus bilaterally, and the somatization subscale with left inferior prefrontal cortex. Somatization also showed negative correlations with cerebellar vermis and right supplementary motor area. Limitations: Our study is limited to VBM and does not include surface-based measures. It also only contains subjects with very small psychological distress by partly overlapping symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with a non-linear relationship between symptom severity and cortical volume in several brain areas involved in both emotion regulation as well as altered in clinically manifest depressive/anxiety disorders.

Irritability in ADHD: Associations with depression liability,"Background: Irritability and the new DSM-5 diagnostic category of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) have been conceptualised as related to mood disorder. Irritability is common in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but little is known about its association with depression risk in this group. This study aims to establish levels of irritability and prevalence of DMDD in a clinical sample of children with ADHD, and examine their association with anxiety, depression and family history of depression. Methods: The sample consisted of 696 children (mean age 10.9 years) with a diagnosis of ADHD, recruited from UK child psychiatry and paediatric clinics. Parents completed the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, a semi-structured diagnostic interview, about their child. This was used to establish prevalence of DMDD, anxiety disorder and depressive disorder, as well as obtain symptom scores for irritability, anxiety and depression. Questionnaires assessed current parental depression, and family history of depression. Result: Irritability was common, with 91% endorsing at least one irritable symptom. 3-month DMDD prevalence was 31%. Children with higher levels of irritability or DMDD were more likely to have comorbid symptoms of anxiety, depression and a family history of depression. Limitations: Results are based on a clinical sample, so may not be generalizable to children with ADHD in the general population. Conclusions: Irritability and DMDD were common, and were associated with markers of depression liability. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine the association between irritability and depression in youth with ADHD as they get older.

Sudarshan Kriya Yoga improves cardiac autonomic control in patients with anxiety-depression disorders,"Background: Several studies have demonstrated that adjuvant therapies as exercise and breathing training are effective in improving cardiac autonomic control (CAC) in patients with affective spectrum disorders. However, the effects of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) on autonomic function in this population is unknown. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that SKY training improves CAC and cardiorespiratory coupling in patients with anxiety and/or depression disorders. Methods: Forty-six patients with a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression disorders (DSM-IV) were consecutively enrolled and divided in two groups: 1) conventional therapy (Control) and 2) conventional therapy associated with SKY (Treatment) for 15 days. Anxiety and depression levels were determined using quantitative questionnaires. For the assessment of CAC and cardiorespiratory coupling, cardiorespiratory traces were analyzed using monovariate and bivariate autoregressive spectral analysis, respectively. Results: After 15-days, we observed a reduction of anxiety and depression levels only in Treatment group. Moreover, sympathetic modulation and CAC were significantly lower while parasympathetic modulation and cardiorespiratory coupling were significantly higher in the Treatment compared to Control group. Conclusions: Intensive breathing training using SKY approach improves anxiety and/or depressive disorders as well as CAC and cardiorespiratory coupling. These finding suggest that the SKY training may be a useful non-pharmacological intervention to improve symptoms and reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with anxiety/depression disorders.

Different functioning of prefrontal cortex predicts treatment response after a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment in patients with major depression,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is often resistant to treatment with usual approaches. Patients with MDD have shown hypofunction of the frontotemporal cortex in verbal fluency test (VFT)-related near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Methods: We examined whether the reactions to drug treatment in treatment-naive patients with MDD could be predicted by NIRS outcomes at the initial investigation. All subjects underwent psychological testing to determine levels of anxiety and depression. VFT was used to examine the functioning of the frontotemporal lobes. We administered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for 12 weeks. Subjects included 28 patients with MDD with response to SSRIs (Response group), 19 with no response (Non-Response group), and 63 age-, sex-, and education years-matched healthy controls (HC). Results: We found in the frontotemporal region that hemodynamic responses were significantly smaller in patients with Response and Non-Response groups than in HC before treatment. We also found in the medial frontal region that hemodynamic responses were significantly larger in patients with Response groups than in patients with Non-Response group before treatment. Patients with MDD scored significantly higher anxiety and depressive states than those in HC on several measures. The Response and Non-Response groups also had higher scores in future denial, threat prediction, self-denial, past denial, and interpersonal threat sections of Anxiety Cognition Scale (DACS). According to the stepwise regression analysis, one variable was determined as independent predictors of response: confusion (Post-POMS). Limitations: The number of patients and healthy controls was relatively small, and we will increase the number of participants in future studies. NIRS has reduced spatial resolution, which confuses the identification of the measurement position when using NIRS alone. Conclusion: Cognitive vulnerabilities are associated with predictors of SSRI treatment response. Different hemodynamic activities in the frontotemporal cortex predict response to SSRI treatment in MDD.

Psychophysiological correlates of emotion regulation training in adolescent anxiety: Evidence from the novel PIER task,"Background: Anxiety disorders are the leading cause of mental illness in adolescence. While anxious adolescents show impairments in emotion processing and deficits in emotion regulation, few studies have attempted to improve emotion regulation within these populations. Method: This study used a multi-method design to test a newly developed emotion regulation training aimed at improving insight into emotions and instructing cognitive reappraisal. The efficacy of cognitive reappraisal was investigated in 27 clinically anxious youth (Age: M = 12.36, SD = 2.59) and 43 healthy controls (Age: M = 13.07, SD = 2.19) using psychophysiological measures. Specifically, heart rate variability, pupil dilation, and visual fixations were recorded while youth had to up- or downregulate their emotions in response to affective pictures in the Psychophysiological Indicators of Emotion Regulation (PIER) task. Results: The novel training effectively improved self-reported emotion regulation and momentary anxiety in both groups. Moreover, initial group differences in emotional reactivity mostly disappeared when participants were instructed to apply emotion regulation in the task. However, pupil dilation data suggested that participants with anxiety disorders required more cognitive resources for the upregulation of negative affect to counteract this effect. Limitations: The relatively small sample size and large age range could hamper detection of additional group differences that may exist. Conclusions: The current study provides evidence that anxious youth can apply cognitive reappraisal to a similar extent as healthy adolescents after emotion regulation training but may need to exert more effort to do so. This training could be a valuable addition to current treatment programs.

The left middle temporal gyrus in the middle of an impaired social-affective communication network in social anxiety disorder,"Background: Previous studies on patients diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (SAD) reported changed patterns of the resting-state functional connectivity network (rs-FCN) between the prefrontal cortices and other prefrontal, amygdalar or striatal regions. Using a graph theory approach, this study explored the modularity-based community profile and patterns of inter-/intra-modular communication for the rs-FCN in SAD. Methods: In total, for 28 SAD patients and 27 healthy controls (HC), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired in resting-state and subjected to a graph theory analysis. Results: The within-module degree z-score for a hub region [out of a total of 10 hub regions ranked using the participation coefficient] named left middle temporal gyrus was impaired in SAD compared to HC, proportional to the severity of clinician-scored and patient-reported functional impairment in SAD. Limitations: Most of participants included in this study were undergraduate students in their early-to-mid 20's. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of functional communication from the left middle temporal gyrus with other opercular-insular-subcortical regions for better objective functioning and lesser subjective disability in SAD.

"Screening for anxiety, depression, and anxious depression in primary care: A field study for ICD-11 PHC","Background: In this field study of WHO's revised classification of mental disorders for primary care settings, the ICD-11 PHC, we tested the usefulness of two five-item screening scales for anxiety and depression to be administered in primary care settings. Methods: The study was conducted in primary care settings in four large middle-income countries. Primary care physicians (PCPs) referred individuals who they suspected might be psychologically distressed to the study. Screening scales as well as a structured diagnostic interview, the revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R), adapted for proposed decision rules in ICD-11 PHC, were administered to 1488 participants. Results: A score of 3 or more on one or both screening scale predicted 89.6% of above-threshold mood or anxiety disorder diagnoses on the CIS-R. Anxious depression was the most common CIS-R diagnosis among referred patients. However, there was an exact diagnostic match between the screening scales and the CIS-R in only 62.9% of those with high scores. Limitations: This study was confined to those in whom the PCP suspected psychological distress, so does not provide information about the prevalence of mental disorders in primary care settings. Conclusions: The two five-item screening scales for anxiety and depression provide a practical way for PCPs to evaluate the likelihood of mood and anxiety disorders without paper and pencil measures that are not feasible in many settings. These scales may provide substantially improved case detection as compared to current primary care practice and a realistic alternative to complex diagnostic algorithms used by specialist mental health professionals.

The relationship between childhood trauma and the severity of adulthood depression and anxiety symptoms in a clinical sample: The mediating role of cognitive emotion regulation strategies,"Background: Childhood trauma is an important factor in adverse mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate a hypothesized model describing a pathway of childhood trauma and its influence on psychiatric symptoms in patients with depressive disorder. In this model, childhood trauma was positively associated with current depression and anxiety symptoms, which were mediated by a cognitive emotional regulation strategy. Method: Patients with depressive disorder (n = 585, 266 men, 316 women) completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). We divided the cognitive emotion regulation strategies into adaptive and maladaptive strategies using a CERQ subscore. We employed structural equation modeling (SEM) and simple/multiple mediation analyses. Results: The indirect effect of maladaptive strategies was significant in the relationship between overall childhood trauma and depression/anxiety severity, whereas the mediation effect of adaptive strategies was limited to depressive symptoms. With respect to specific types of trauma, maladaptive strategies mediated the association between emotional abuse and current depression/anxiety, while the mediation effect of adaptive strategies was limited to emotional neglect. Limitations: This study's cross-sectional design does not allow establishment of causal relationships. Childhood trauma recall bias may be possible. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesized model in which childhood trauma is associated with adulthood depression/anxiety symptoms in clinical samples, and mediated by emotion regulation strategies. These results suggest that cognitive emotion dysregulation is an important factor affecting depression/anxiety symptoms in patients with childhood trauma.

Identifying women at risk for sustained postpartum anxiety,"Introduction: To describe the prevalence of sustained postpartum anxiety and to develop a multifactorial predictive model to assist in targeted screening procedures. Methods: In a population-based cohort in a health region near Vancouver, Canada, 522 mothers completed a mailed questionnaire at 1, 4, and 8 weeks postpartum measuring socio-demographic, biological, pregnancy-related, life stressor, social support, obstetric, and maternal adjustment factors. We undertook a sequential logistic regression analysis to develop a multifactorial predictive model of sustained postpartum anxiety, as measured by a State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score &gt; 40 at 1 week and/or 4 weeks, and 8 weeks postpartum. Results: The prevalence of sustained postpartum anxiety was 12.6% (95% CI 9.6–16.2). In the multivariable model, predictors of sustained anxiety in the postpartum period were perceived stress at 1 week (1 SD increase; aOR 3.74, 95% CI 2.17-6.44) and partner social support at 1 week (1 SD increase; aOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40–0.85). Depression symptomatology at 1 week, child care stress, and maternal self-esteem were non-significant. Limitations: Single women and women from ethnic minority backgrounds were underrepresented in the sample. Conclusions: A large proportion of women experience sustained postpartum anxiety. High perceived stress and low partner social support can be used to facilitate early identification of women likely to experience persistent anxiety in the postpartum period and suggest the need for urgent access to psychotherapeutic services for these women. These factors may also be potential targets for individual or couples therapy to treat postpartum anxiety.

Excess costs of social anxiety disorder in Germany,"Background: Social anxiety disorder is one of the most frequent mental disorders. It is often associated with mental comorbidities and causes a high economic burden. The aim of our analysis was to estimate the excess costs of patients with social anxiety disorder compared to persons without anxiety disorder in Germany. Methods: Excess costs of social anxiety disorder were determined by comparing two data sets. Patient data came from the SOPHO-NET study A1 ( n = 495), whereas data of persons without anxiety disorder originated from a representative phone survey ( n = 3213) of the general German population. Missing data were handled by “Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations”. Both data sets were matched using “Entropy Balancing”. Excess costs were calculated from a societal perspective for the year 2014 using general linear regression with a gamma distribution and log-link function. Analyses considered direct costs (in- and outpatient treatment, rehabilitation, and professional and informal care) and indirect costs due to absenteeism from work. Results: Total six-month excess costs amounted to 451€ (95% CI: 199€−703€). Excess costs were mainly caused by indirect excess costs due to absenteeism from work of 317€ (95% CI: 172€−461€), whereas direct excess costs amounted to 134€ (95% CI: 110€−159€). Limitations: Costs for medication, unemployment and disability pension was not evaluated. Conclusions: Social anxiety disorder was associated with statistically significant excess costs, in particular due to indirect costs. As patients in general are often unaware of their disorder or its severity, awareness should be strengthened. Prevention and early treatment might reduce long-term indirect costs.

Anxiety disorder among rheumatoid arthritis patients: Insights from real-life data,"Background: Psychiatric disorders occur in a considerable proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), often reflecting the difficulties of these patients in coping with a chronic debilitating disorder. Aim of the study: To evaluate the proportion of anxiety disorder in RA patients using a large database analysis. Methods: The study was designed as a case-control population-based study using data from the Clalit Health Services (CHS) database. Patients were defined as having RA or anxiety disorder when there was at least one documented diagnosis identified by the International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) from the medical records. The proportion of anxiety disorder was compared between RA patients and controls. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between RA and anxiety disorder in a multivariate analysis adjusted for age, gender and socioeconomic status (SES). Results: The study included 11,782 patients with RA and 57,973 age- and sex-frequency matched controls. The proportion of anxiety in RA patients was higher than in controls (7.1% vs 6.3%, p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, RA was found to be independently associated with anxiety (OR 1.11 [95%CI 1.03–1.20], p = 0.01). Our study has some shortcomings, as its cross-sectional nature does not allow to make inferences about a causal relationship between RA and anxiety. Conclusion: Our study confirms the higher proportion of anxiety in RA patients, especially young women with low SES. Physicians should be aware of such findings and, therefore, apply proper screening strategies.

"Anxiety and comorbid depression following traumatic brain injury in a community-based sample of young, middle-aged and older adults","Background: Anxiety is common following a traumatic brain injury (TBI), but who is most at risk, and to what extent, is not well understood. Methods: Longitudinal data from a randomly-selected community sample (Wave 1: 7397, Wave 2: 6621 and Wave 3: 6042) comprising three adult cohorts (young: 20–24 years of age, middle-aged: 40–44, older: 60–64), were analysed. The association between TBI history, anxiety and comorbid depression was assessed, controlling for age, sex, marital/employment status, medical conditions, recent life events, alcohol consumption, social support and physical activity. Results: Thirteen percent of the sample had sustained a TBI by Wave 3, 35% of whom had sustained multiple TBIs. Cross-sectional analyses revealed that clinically-significant anxiety was more common in people who had sustained a TBI. Longitudinal analyses demonstrated an increased risk of anxiety post-TBI, even after controlling for potential demographic, health and psychosocial confounds. Anxiety was more common than depression, although 10% of those with a TBI experienced comorbid anxiety/depression. Limitations: TBIs were not medically confirmed and anxiety and depression were only assessed every four years by self-report, rather than clinical interview. Sample attrition resulted in the retention of healthier individuals at each wave. Conclusions: TBIs are associated with a lifelong increased risk of experiencing clinically-significant anxiety, highlighting the chronic nature of TBI sequelae. Positive lifestyle changes (e.g., increasing physical activity, reducing alcohol consumption) may decrease the risk of anxiety problems in the early years after a TBI.

Is computerized psychoeducation sufficient to reduce anxiety sensitivity in an at-risk sample?: A randomized trial,"Background: Anxiety sensitivity (AS), or a fear of anxiety-related sensations, has become one of the most well researched risk factors for the development of psychopathology and comprises three subfactors: physical, cognitive, and social concerns. Fortunately, research has demonstrated brief protocols can successfully reduce AS, and in turn improve psychopathological symptoms. Computerized AS reduction protocols have combined psychoeducation with interoceptive exposure (IE), but they have not been dismantled to evaluate the effects of psychoeducation alone. Method: The current study sought to determine the efficacy of a brief single-session psychoeducation intervention for AS, compared to a control intervention, in a sample of at-risk individuals ( N = 54) with elevated AS cognitive concerns. Results: Individuals in the active condition displayed greater reductions in self-reported AS (β = .198, 95% CI [.065, .331]) and less fear reactivity (β = .278, 95% CI [.069, .487]) to the induction of AS cognitive-relevant sensations through a behavioral challenge compared to those in the control condition. Further, fear reactivity to the challenge was mediated by reductions in self-reported AS cognitive concerns. Limitations: Study limitations include use of an at-risk nonclinical student sample, lack of a long-term follow-up assessment, and inability to discern whether AS reductions due to CAST psychoeducation prevent future, or improve current, psychological symptoms. Conclusions: These results suggest that psychoeducation alone can produce significant AS reduction.

Perceived emotional social support in bereaved spouses mediates the relationship between anxiety and depression,"Background: Prior research has shown that anxiety symptoms predict later depression symptoms following bereavement. Nevertheless, no research has investigated mechanisms of the temporal relationship between anxiety and later depressive symptoms or examined the impact of depressive symptoms on later anxiety symptoms following bereavement. Methods: The current study examined perceived emotional social support as a possible mediator between anxiety and depressive symptoms in a bereaved sample of older adults ( N = 250). Anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured at Wave 1 (immediately after bereavement), social support was measured at Wave 2 (18 months after bereavement), and anxiety and depressive symptoms were also measured at Wave 3 (48 months after bereavement). Results: Using Bayesian structural equation models, when controlling for baseline depression, anxiety symptoms significantly positively predicted depressive symptoms 48 months later, Further, perceived emotional social support significantly mediated the relationship between anxiety symptoms and later depressive symptoms, such that anxiety symptoms significantly negatively predicted later emotional social support, and emotional social support significantly negatively predicted later depressive symptoms. Also, when controlling for baseline anxiety, depressive symptoms positively predicted anxiety symptoms 48 months later. However, low emotional social support failed to mediate this relationship. Conclusions: Low perceived emotional social support may be a mechanism by which anxiety symptoms predict depressive symptoms 48 months later for bereaved individuals.

A systematic review of adult attachment and social anxiety,"Background: Attachment has been implicated in the development of social anxiety. Our aim was to synthesise the extant literature exploring the role of adult attachment in these disorders. Method: Search terms relating to social anxiety and attachment were entered into MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Risk of bias of included studies was assessed using and adapted version of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality assessment tool. Eligible studies employed validated social anxiety and attachment assessments in adult clinical and analogue samples. The review included cross sectional, interventional and longitudinal research. Results: Of the 30 identified studies, 28 showed a positive association between attachment insecurity and social anxiety. This association was particularly strong when considering attachment anxiety. Cognitive variables and evolutionary behaviours were identified as potential mediators, concordant with psychological theory. Limitations: Due to a lack of longitudinal research, the direction of effect between attachment and social anxiety variables could not be inferred. There was substantial heterogeneity in the way that attachment was conceptualised and assessed across studies. Conclusions: The literature indicates that attachment style is associated with social anxiety. Clinicians may wish to consider attachment theory when working clinically with this population. In the future, it may be useful to target the processes that mediate the relationship between attachment and social anxiety.

Cost-effectiveness of interventions for treating anxiety disorders: A systematic review,"Background: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent mental disorders that constitute a major burden on patients and society. As a consequence, economic evaluations of the interventions have become increasingly important. However, no recent overview of these economic evaluations is currently available and the quality of the published economic evaluations has not yet been assessed. Therefore, the current study has two aims: to provide an overview of the evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of interventions for anxiety disorders, and to assess the quality of the studies identified. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, NHS-EED, and the CEA registry. We included full economic evaluations on interventions for all anxiety disorders published before April 2016, with no restrictions on study populations and comparators. Preventive interventions were excluded. Study characteristics and cost-effectiveness data were collected. The quality of the studies was appraised using the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria. Results: Forty-two out of 826 identified studies met the inclusion criteria. The studies were heterogeneous and the quality was variable. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) appeared to be cost-effective in comparison with the control conditions. Four out of five studies comparing psychological interventions with pharmacological interventions showed that psychological interventions were more cost-effective than pharmacotherapy. Limitations: Comparability was limited by heterogeneity in terms of interventions, study design, outcome and study quality. Conclusions: Forty-two studies reporting cost-effectiveness of interventions for anxiety disorders were identified. iCBT was cost-effective in comparison with the control conditions. Psychological interventions for anxiety disorders might be more cost-effective than pharmacological interventions.

"Effects of levomilnacipran ER on noradrenergic symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and functional impairment in adults with major depressive disorder: Post hoc analysis of 5 clinical trials","Objective: To evaluate the effects of levomilnacipran extended-release (LVM-ER; 40–120 mg/day) on noradrenergic (NA) and anxiety-related symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) and explore the relationship between these symptoms and functional impairment. Methods: Data were pooled from 5 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (N = 2598). Anxiety and NA Cluster scores were developed by adding selected item scores from the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD₁₇). A path analysis was conducted to estimate the direct effects of LVM-ER on functional impairment (Sheehan Disability Scale [SDS] total score) and the indirect effects through changes in NA and Anxiety Cluster scores. Results: Mean improvements from baseline in NA and Anxiety Cluster scores were significantly greater with LVM-ER versus placebo (both P &lt; 0.001), as were the response rates (≥ 50% score improvement): NA Cluster (44% vs 34%; odds ratio = 1.56; P &lt; 0.0001); Anxiety Cluster (39% vs 36%; odds ratio = 1.19; P = 0.041). Mean improvement in SDS total score was also significantly greater with LVM-ER versus placebo (−7.3 vs −5.6; P &lt; 0.0001). LVM-ER had an indirect effect on change in SDS total score that was mediated more strongly through NA Cluster score change (86%) than Anxiety Cluster score change (18%); the direct effect was negligible. Limitations: NA and Anxiety Cluster scores, developed based on the face validity of individual MADRS and HAMD₁₇ items, were not predefined as efficacy outcomes in any of the studies. Conclusion: In adults with MDD, LVM-ER indirectly improved functional impairment mainly through improvements in NA symptoms and less so via anxiety symptoms.

"Relationships between self-reported childhood traumatic experiences, attachment style, neuroticism and features of borderline personality disorders in patients with mood disorders","Background: Co-occurring borderline personality disorder (BPD) features have a marked impact on treatment of patients with mood disorders. Overall, high neuroticism, childhood traumatic experiences (TEs) and insecure attachment are plausible aetiological factors for BPD. However, their relationship with BPD features specifically among patients with mood disorders remains unclear. We investigated these relationships among unipolar and bipolar mood disorder patients. Methods: As part of the Helsinki University Psychiatric Consortium study, the McLean Screening Instrument (MSI), the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R), the Short Five (S5) and the Trauma and Distress Scale (TADS) were filled in by patients with mood disorders (n = 282) in psychiatric care. Correlation coefficients between total scores of scales and their dimensions were estimated, and multivariate regression (MRA) and mediation analyses were conducted. Results: Spearman's correlations were strong (rho = 0.58; p &lt; 0.001) between total scores of MSI and S5 Neuroticism and moderate (rho = 0.42; p &lt; 0.001) between MSI and TADS as well as between MSI and ECR-R Attachment Anxiety. In MRA, young age, S5 Neuroticism and TADS predicted scores of MSI (p &lt; 0.001). ECR-R Attachment Anxiety mediated 33% (CI = 17–53%) of the relationships between TADS and MSI. Limitations: Cross-sectional questionnaire study. Conclusions: We found moderately strong correlations between self-reported BPD features and concurrent high neuroticism, reported childhood traumatic experiences and Attachment Anxiety also among patients with mood disorders. Independent predictors for BPD features include young age, frequency of childhood traumatic experiences and high neuroticism. Insecure attachment may partially mediate the relationship between childhood traumatic experiences and borderline features among mood disorder patients.

Ultra-short screening instruments for major depressive episode and generalized anxiety disorder in epilepsy: The NDDIE-2 and the GAD-SI,"Background: Systematic screening is recommended for major depressive episode (MDE) with the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy NDDI-E, 6 items and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with the GAD 7 items in patients with epilepsy (PWE). Shorter versions of the NDDI-E and the GAD-7 could facilitate increased screening by busy clinicians and be more accessible to patients with mild cognitive and/or language impairments. Methods: The effectiveness of ultra-short versions of the NDDI-E (2 items) and the GAD-7 (the GAD-2, 2 items, and the GAD-SI with a single item) in comparison with the original versions were statistically tested using ROC analysis. Results: ROC analysis of the NDDIE-2 showed an AUC of 0.926 (p &lt; 0.001), a sensitivity of 81.82% and a specificity of 89.16%, without significant difference with the NDDI-E (z = 1.582, p = 0.11). ROC analysis of the GAD-SI showed an AUC of 0.872 (p &lt; 0.001), a sensitivity of 83.67% and a specificity of 82.29%, without significant difference with the GAD-7 (z = 1.281, p = 0.2). The GAD-2 showed poorer psychometric properties. Limitations: The limitation is the use of data from previously reported subjects in a single language version, the NDDIE-2 that lacks detection of dysphoric symptoms in comparison with the NDDIE-6 and the GAD-SI that exhibited a more than 10% lower sensitivity than the GAD-7. Conclusions: This study highlights the potential utility of the NDDIE-2 and the GAD-SI as ultra-short screening tools for MDE and GAD respectively in PWE. Further studies in a larger population, including multi-lingual versions, could be a valuable next step. However, the brevity and simplicity of this tool could be an advantage in PWE who present cognitive difficulties, especially attentional or language deficits.

"Psychometric evaluation of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener GAD-7, based on a large german general population sample","Background: The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scales GAD-7 and GAD-2 are instruments for the assessment of anxiety. The aims of this study are to test psychometric properties of these questionnaires, to provide normative values, and to investigate associations with sociodemographic factors, quality of life, psychological variables, and behavioral factors. Methods: A German community sample ( n = 9721) with an age range of 18–80 years was surveyed using the GAD-7 and several other questionnaires. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the unidimensionality and measurement invariance of the GAD-7 across age and gender. Females were more anxious than males (mean scores: M = 4.07 vs. M = 3.01; effect size: d = 0.33). There was no linear age trend. A total of 5.9% fulfilled the cut-off criterion of 10 and above. Anxiety was correlated with low quality of life, fatigue, low habitual optimism, physical complaints, sleep problems, low life satisfaction, low social support, low education, unemployment, and low income. Cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were also associated with heightened anxiety, especially in women. When comparing the GAD-7 (7 items) with the ultra-short GAD-2 (2 items), the GAD-7 instrument was superior to the GAD-2 regarding several psychometric criteria. Limitations: The response rate (33%) was low. Because of the cross-sectional character of the study, causal conclusions cannot be drawn. A further limitation is the lack of a gold standard for diagnosing anxiety. Conclusions: The GAD-7 can be recommended for use in clinical research and routine.

Modification of the medical exclusion criterion in DSM-5 social anxiety disorder: Comorbid obesity as an example,"Background: The DSM 5 modified the medical exclusion criterion from DSM-IV, which now allows for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (SAD) to be given if the fears are related only to the medical condition (e.g., obesity) yet cause significant impairment or distress. Methods: To examine this modification, the current study compared bariatric surgery candidates with DSM-IV SAD ( n = 135), modified SAD (clinically significant social fears related to obesity only; n = 40), and no history of Axis I disorders ( n = 616) on variables related to pre-surgical problematic eating behaviors, body image dissatisfaction, functional impairment, and other characteristics related to bariatric surgery. Participants were referred by their surgeon for a psychiatric evaluation as part of the clearance process, and completed a comprehensive, semi-structured diagnostic interview and self-report measures. Results: There were several differences between those with DSM-IV SAD and modified SAD compared to those with no disorder (e.g., on binge and emotional eating), but the two SAD groups did not differ from each other on any of the comparisons. Limitations: Results may not generalize to individuals suffering from obesity in the general population or those seeking other types of weight loss treatment. Because they were seeking psychiatric clearance, they also may have underreported symptoms/problems for fear that they would not get cleared. Conclusions: Overall, the modified SAD group more closely resembled the DSM-IV SAD group rather than the no disorder group, providing further support for diagnosing SAD even when the social fears are related to obesity only.

Parents' behavioral inhibition moderates association of preschoolers' BI with risk for age 9 anxiety disorders,"Background: Temperamental behavioral inhibition (BI) in children predicts later anxiety disorders. However, many children with BI do not develop anxiety disorders, suggesting the importance of identifying moderating factors. The current study examined whether parents’ history of BI moderates the associations between preschoolers’ BI and anxiety disorders at age 9. Methods: The sample was 392 children and their parents from the community. Child BI was measured at age 3 using observational (Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery; Lab-TAB) and parent report (Behavior Inhibition Questionnaire; BIQ) measures. In addition, both parents reported on their own history of childhood BI using the Retrospective Measure of Behavioral Inhibition (RMBI). When the children were 9 years old, a parent and the child were interviewed using the Kiddie Schedule for the Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia—Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL). Results: Parents’ reports of their own BI moderated the associations of both observed and parent-reported child BI at age 3 with children's anxiety disorders at age 9. Among children whose parents reported having had higher childhood BI, those who exhibited high BI at age 3 were more likely to meet criteria for anxiety disorders at age 9. Limitations: The major limitation is the use of a retrospective measure of parental BI. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that parents’ histories of childhood BI moderate the association between their young children's BI and subsequent anxiety disorders. Thus, parental BI appears to identify a subgroup of BI children at particularly high risk for developing anxiety disorders by late childhood.

Altered time course of amygdala activation during speech anticipation in social anxiety disorder,"Background: Exaggerated anticipatory anxiety is common in social anxiety disorder (SAD). Neuroimaging studies have revealed altered neural activity in response to social stimuli in SAD, but fewer studies have examined neural activity during anticipation of feared social stimuli in SAD. The current study examined the time course and magnitude of activity in threat processing brain regions during speech anticipation in socially anxious individuals and healthy controls (HC). Method: Participants (SAD n = 58; HC n = 16) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during which they completed a 90s control anticipation task and 90s speech anticipation task. Repeated measures multi-level modeling analyses were used to examine group differences in time course activity during speech vs. control anticipation for regions of interest, including bilateral amygdala, insula, ventral striatum, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Results: The time course of amygdala activity was more prolonged and less variable throughout speech anticipation in SAD participants compared to HCs, whereas the overall magnitude of amygdala response did not differ between groups. Magnitude and time course of activity was largely similar between groups across other regions of interest. Limitations: Analyses were restricted to regions of interest and task order was the same across participants due to the nature of deception instructions. Conclusions: Sustained amygdala time course during anticipation may uniquely reflect heightened detection of threat or deficits in emotion regulation in socially anxious individuals. Findings highlight the importance of examining temporal dynamics of amygdala responding.

A pilot study on predictors of brainstem raphe abnormality in patients with major depressive disorder,"Background: Hypo/anechogenicity of the brainstem raphe (BR) structures has been suggested as a possible transcranial parenchymal sonography (TCS) marker associated with depression. Aim: The aim of this study was to analyze possible association of the abnormal BR echogenicity in patients with major depression when compared to healthy controls, and to evaluate its clinical and genetic correlates. Methods: TCS was performed in 53 patients diagnosed as major depressive disorder (MDD) without psychotic symptoms and in 54 healthy matched controls. Results: The TCS detected BR abnormalities were significantly more frequent in MDD patients (35 out of 53; 66%) in comparison to matched controls (5 out of 56; 9%). The prevalence of short allele (s) homozygocity in the length polymorphism of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) was significantly higher in MDD patients relative to those with normal BR echogenicity. A stepwise statistical discriminant analysis revealed statistically significant separation between MDD patients with and without BR abnormalities groups based on the four predictors combined: the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale item 5 („ difficulty in concentration, poor memory “), presence of social phobia, s allele homozygocity of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, and presence of generalized anxiety disorder. Limitations: Cross-sectional design and heterogenous treatment of depressed patients. Conclusions: Reduced BR echogenicity in at least a subgroup of MDD patients may reflect a particular phenotype, characterized by more prevalent comorbid anxiety disorders, associated with particular genetic polymorphisms and neurotransmitter(s) deficits, most probably altered serotonergic mechanisms.

Preconception personality disorder and antenatal maternal mental health: A population-based cohort study,"Background: Prior anxiety and depression have been identified as risk factors for maternal perinatal mental health problems, but other preconception mental disorders have not been prospectively examined. This study investigated prospectively whether women with preconception personality disorder have increased rates of antenatal anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. Methods: 244 women in a population cohort were assessed for personality disorder at age 24 using the Standardised Assessment of Personality. Five to twelve years later, women were screened with the Clinical Interview Schedule, Revised Anxiety Subscale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale during the third trimester of 328 pregnancies. Results: Preconception personality disorder was associated with a three-fold increase in the odds of antenatal anxiety symptoms, which remained with adjustment for preconception background factors and preconception common mental disorder (adjusted OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.31–6.15). Preconception personality disorder was associated with doubled odds of antenatal depressive symptoms, however this was attenuated with adjustment for preconception background factors and preconception common mental disorder (adjusted OR 1.98, 95% CI 0.81–4.81). Limitations: Our findings are restricted to pregnant women aged 29–35 years. Anxiety and depression may have been under-identified because they were assessed at a single antenatal time point. Residual confounding of the associations by preconception common mental disorder at other time points may have occurred. Conclusions: Women with personality disorder are at heightened risk of anxiety symptoms in pregnancy, over and above risks associated with prior common mental disorder. This raises a possibility that pregnancy brings particular emotional challenges for women with personality disorders.

Treatment outcomes for inpatients with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder: An open comparison trial,"Background: The current case-control study compared rates of clinically significant and reliable change in psychopathology and global functioning, prevalence of clinical deterioration, and rates of symptom remission among adult patients with obsessive compulsive personality disorder OCPD (n = 52) and well-matched inpatients with any other personality disorder (n = 56) and no personality disorder (n = 53). Methods: Propensity score matching (PSM) was utilized to select patients matched on specific criteria present in the OCPD group. Multivariate analysis of variance models measured differences in admission functioning and RCI change across depression and anxiety severity, emotion dysregulation and suicidal ideation. Results: Patients diagnosed with OCPD admit to treatment with higher rates of depression, anxiety, difficulty with emotion regulation and non-acceptance of emotional experience than inpatient controls. Furthermore, OCPD patients respond to treatment at a similar rate to inpatient controls, but experience lower rates of anxiety remission upon discharge. Post-hoc analyses indicate individuals meeting stubbornness and rigidity (OCPD Criteria 8) were nine times more likely to report moderate to severe anxiety at point of discharge. Limitations: Limitations include a predominantly Caucasian, inpatient sample, use of self-report measures and a non-manualized treatment approach. Conclusions: Overall, OCPD inpatients benefit from an intensive multimodal psychiatric treatment, but experience more anxiety than non-PD patients upon discharge.

Etiologic specificity of waking cortisol: Links with maternal history of depression and anxiety in adolescent girls,"Background: Many previous studies have indicated that individuals who are depressed or at risk for depression are characterized by increased levels of morning cortisol and a greater cortisol awakening response (CAR). However, despite the high comorbidity between depressive and anxiety disorders, fewer studies have examined whether these diurnal cortisol abnormalities are also characteristic of anxiety or risk for anxiety. Methods: In the present study we examined cortisol in a community sample of 476 female adolescents and related it to maternal history of depression and/or anxiety disorders. Salivary cortisol was collected at waking, 30min post waking, and in the evening on three weekdays. Results: Contrary to prior results, offspring at risk for depression did not have increased morning cortisol or CAR. However, offspring at risk for anxiety disorders had elevated 30min cortisol and total cortisol produced throughout the day; this effect was primarily driven by offspring of mothers with panic disorder or agoraphobia. Additionally, levels of cortisol were highest among offspring of mothers with multiple anxiety diagnoses. Limitations: The study is limited to female adolescents and maternal diagnostic history. Additionally, some diagnoses could not be examined as a result of too few cases (e.g. GAD). Conclusions: Overall, these results underscore the importance of considering anxiety when examining the association of diurnal cortisol abnormalities with risk for psychopathology, as it may have influenced prior observations of elevated morning cortisol in depression.

Insomnia and suicide-related behaviors: A multi-study investigation of thwarted belongingness as a distinct explanatory factor,"Background: Insomnia is a robust correlate of suicidal ideation and behavior. Preliminary research has identified thwarted belongingness (c.f. social disconnection) as an explanatory link between insomnia and suicidal ideation. Objectives: This study replicates and extends previous findings using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs in four demographically diverse samples. Additionally, the specificity of thwarted belongingness was evaluated by testing anxiety as a rival mediator. Method: Self-report measures of insomnia symptoms, thwarted belongingness, suicidal ideation and behavior, and anxiety were administered in four adult samples: 469 undergraduate students, 352 psychiatric outpatients, 858 firefighters, and 217 primary care patients. Results: More severe insomnia was associated with more severe thwarted belongingness and suicidality. Thwarted belongingness significantly accounted for the association between insomnia and suicidality, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, beyond anxiety. Notably, findings supported the specificity of thwarted belongingness: anxiety did not significantly mediate the association between insomnia and suicidality, and insomnia did not mediate the relation between thwarted belongingness and suicidality. Limitations: This study relied solely on self-report measures. Future studies incorporating objective sleep measurements are needed. Conclusion: Findings underscore the utility of assessing and addressing sleep disturbances and social disconnection to reduce suicide risk.

Predictors of new-onset depressive disorders—Results from the longitudinal Finnish Health 2011 Study,"Background: Identifying risk factors for depression is important for understanding etiological mechanisms and targeting preventive efforts. No prior studies have compared risk factors of dysthymia and major depressive disorder (MDD) in a longitudinal setting. Methods: Predictors of new-onset MDD and dysthymia were examined in a longitudinal general population study (Health 2000 and 2011 Surveys, BRIF8901). 4057 persons free of depressive disorders at baseline were followed up for 11 years. DSM-IV MDD and dysthymia were diagnosed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: 126 persons (4.4%, 95%CI 3.6–5.2) were diagnosed with MDD or dysthymia at follow-up. Predictors of new-onset depressive disorders were younger age (adjusted OR 0.97, 95%CI 0.95–0.99 per year), female gender (aOR 1.46, 95%CI 1.01–2.12), multiple childhood adversities (aOR 1.76, 95%CI 1.10–2.83), low trust dimension of social capital (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.36–0.96 for high trust), baseline anxiety disorder (aOR 2.75, 95%CI 1.36–5.56), and baseline depressive symptoms (aOR 1.65, 95%CI 1.04–2.61 for moderate and aOR 2.49, 95%CI 1.20–5.17 for severe symptoms). Risk factors for MDD were younger age, female gender, anxiety disorder and depressive symptoms, whereas younger age, multiple childhood adversities, low trust, and having 1–2 somatic diseases predicted dysthymia. Limitations: We only had one follow-up point at eleven years, and did not collect information on the subjects’ health during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Persons with subclinical depressive symptoms, anxiety disorders, low trust, and multiple childhood adversities have a higher risk of depressive disorders. Predictors of MDD and dysthymia appear to differ. This information can be used to target preventive efforts and guide social policies.

The current authors read with great interest the article by Chen et al. about the risk of developing major depression and anxiety disorders among women with endometriosis, published on your prestigious Journal. The authors agree that the impact of endometriosis on mental health and emotional wellbeing of women is considerable and it is important to investigate the association between this disease and mood disorders. The authors take the opportunity to point out several elements which would allow the further realization of the results of the study by Chen et al. The authors strongly suggest for future studies to diagnose endometriosis according to international guidelines, to use validated scales to investigate the presence of mood disorders and, last but not least, to exclude other comorbidities which may influence the data analysis.

Pain experience in fibromyalgia syndrome: The role of alexithymia and psychological distress,"Background: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain syndrome with a high prevalence of alexithymia, a personality disposition that affects emotional self-awareness. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between alexithymia and pain, differentiating between the sensory and affective components of pain experience, in a sample of FM patients. Methods: One hundred and fifty-nine FM patients completed a battery of tests assessing pain experience, pain intensity, alexithymia and psychological distress. In order to characterize the clinical profile of alexithymic FM patients, alexithymic and non-alexithymic groups were compared on the different measures. Two regression analyses were performed on the total sample, in order to investigate the relationship between alexithymia and pain, controlling for psychological distress. Results: Alexithymic FM patients presented higher scores on all the clinical measures compared to non-alexithymic ones. Positive correlations were found between alexithymia and the affective, but not the sensory, dimension of pain experience variables. Regression analyses showed that alexithymia (difficulty identifying feelings factor) ceased to uniquely predict affective pain, after controlling for psychological distress, particularly anxiety. In addition, none of the alexithymia variables significantly explained pain intensity variance. Finally, a significant effect of anxiety in mediating the relationship between alexithymia and affective pain was found. Limitations: No longitudinal data were included. Conclusions: These findings show the presence of higher levels of pain and psychological distress in alexithymic vs. non-alexithymic FM patients, and a relevant association between alexithymia and the affective dimension of pain experience. Specifically, this relationship appears to be significantly mediated by anxiety.

Assessment of predictors of the impact of fibromyalgia on health-related quality of life 12 months after the end of an interdisciplinary treatment,"Objective: Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder with a range of comorbid symptoms, including anxiety. We aimed to prospectively identify predictors of the long-term impact of fibromyalgia on health-related quality of life after the end of an interdisciplinary intervention. Methods: 138 patients with fibromyalgia, selected from a hospital pain management unit, participated in a 6-week interdisciplinary treatment that combined coordinated psychological, medical, educational, and physiotherapeutic interventions. Participants completed the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at baseline and 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after the intervention. Multivariable generalized linear mixed models were developed, using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire score as a continuous variable. Results: Variables that were significant predictors of the long-term impact of fibromyalgia on health-related quality of life in patients who completed a 6-week interdisciplinary treatment were marital status, the number of concurrent conditions, years since the onset of pain, and symptoms of anxiety. In the longitudinal analysis, patients with symptoms of anxiety had lower rates of improvement than those without symptoms of anxiety. Discussion: Our results suggest that patients with lower level of anxiety have less impact on their HRQoL. The results also provide evidence that starting interventions as soon as possible is an important factor for improving health-related quality of life.

Reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire,"Background: The Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire (ERSQ) comprehensively assesses nine aspects of emotion regulation skills: awareness, clarity, sensation, understanding, compassionate self-support, modification, acceptance, tolerance, and readiness to confront. However, it is unknown about the levels of emotion regulation skills in various mental disorders, and its cross-cultural validity. We developed a Japanese version of the ERSQ, then examined its validity and reliability in clinical and non-clinical populations. Methods: In an Internet-based survey, 2684 participants (406 with MDD, 198 with PD, 116 with SAD, 66 with OCD, 636 with comorbid MDD and ≥ 1 anxiety disorder, and 99 with comorbid anxiety disorders; 1163 non-clinical sample) answered the ERSQ, diagnostic status, and measures of mindfulness, emotion regulation, behavioral activation, psychological distress, and life satisfaction. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) replicated the theoretical nine-factor structure of the original ERSQ. Higher-order factor analysis model assuming two second-order factors and nine first-order factors also showed adequate fit to the data, suggesting the factorial validity of the scale. Analyses of multi-group CFA indicated the equivalence of factor loadings across clinical and non-clinical subsamples. The levels of internal consistency and time stability were sufficient. Convergent validity of the scale was also confirmed for most of external criteria. Character on the emotion regulation skills for each diagnostic group was depicted. Limitations: Internet survey of samples with limited disorders, with self-reported diagnoses, may limit generalizability. Conclusions: The Japanese version of the ERSQ showed adequate reliability and validity.

Social stratification of general psychopathology trajectories and young adult social outcomes: A second-order growth mixture analysis over the early life course,"Background: Research has documented heterogeneous developmental trajectories of specific symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, in late childhood and adolescence. Few studies, however, have examined the heterogeneity of general psychopathology (GPP) trajectories considering symptoms of anxiety, depression, and hostility in adolescence simultaneously. Identifying antecedents for distinct trajectory groups of GPP, and their respective consequences, may provide insight into the etiological underpinnings of social antecedents of different symptoms and inform the targets and timing of intervention. Methods: European American target adolescents (N = 444, 53% female) evaluated three domain specific symptoms (i.e., symptoms of anxiety, depression, and hostility) as well as psychosocial risks and social consequences over 10 years (from 1990 [Wave 2] to 2001 [Wave 13]). First- and second-order growth mixture models (SOGMMs) were used to identify trajectories of GPP and specific symptoms from mid-adolescence through young adulthood, as well as their predictors and consequences. Results: A three-class model consisting of high and escalating (10.1%), high and decreasing (23.2%), and consistently low (66.7%) GPP emerged as the preferred solution. More predictors and outcomes were associated with membership in both the high and escalating and the high and declining classes of GPP compared to corresponding classes of the specific symptoms trajectories. Limitations: Self-reported information regarding three symptoms may be a source of bias within the current study. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that unified interventions and/or prevention efforts are needed to not only assess specific symptoms, but also to treat GPP in adolescence.

A worrying trend in social anxiety: To what degree are worry and its cognitive factors associated with youth social anxiety disorder?,"Background: Comorbidity between Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is extremely common. This study investigated whether factors commonly associated with GAD, including worry, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), positive and negative beliefs about worry (PBW, NBW), negative problem orientation (NPO) and cognitive avoidance (CA) were associated with SAD severity, symptoms and overall functioning. Method: Participants included 126 youth aged 8–17 years ( M = 11.29, SD = 2.67, Males n = 50) with a primary diagnosis of SAD. Participants and a parent underwent a diagnostic interview and completed questionnaires at pre- and 12-week post assessment, and 6-month follow-up. Correlations and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted. Results: Each of the cognitive variables, with the exception of PBW, was found to correlate with SAD symptoms, SAD severity and overall functioning. NPO emerged as an important predictor of SAD severity, self-reported ratings of SAD symptoms, and poorer levels of overall functioning. IU and worry also predicted self-rated SAD symptoms. Limitations: Measures were chosen on the basis of their sound psychometrics however some were yet to undergo rigorous testing with youth populations. The study design is cross-sectional, which restricts firm conclusions regarding causal and temporal associations between the variables. Conclusions: Findings from this study have implications for the specificity of GAD and SAD in youth. Further research is required to understand whether these cognitive variables play a maintaining role in youth SAD and the extent to which they might influence treatment.

Predictors of remission from generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder,"Background: The predictors of onset of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are well-characterized. However the factors that predict remission from these conditions are less clear, and the study of this area is further complicated by differing definitions of remission. Methods: Data come from the National Comorbidity Survey—Replication, and analysis was limited to respondents with a lifetime history of GAD (n = 621) or MDD (n = 1299) assessed by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Predictors of remission included demographic factors, adverse childhood events, family history, and clinical characteristics. Multiple definitions of remission were explored to account for residual symptoms. Results: Half (54.4%) of respondents with MDD and 41.1% of respondents with GAD experienced full remission. Older age and higher socioeconomic status were positively related to remission in a dose-response manner for both disorders. Adverse childhood experiences and family history of anxious/depressive symptoms were negatively associated with remission from MDD. Comorbid GAD was inversely associated with remission from MDD (Odds ratio (OR): 0.62, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.44–0.88), but comorbid MDD did not impact remission from GAD (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.64–1.35). With the exception of the influence of comorbidity, these associations were robust across definitions of remission. Limitations: Cross-sectional analysis and retrospective recall of onset of MDD/GAD. Conclusions: Many individuals with MDD or GAD will experience full remission. Some predictors appear to have a general association with remission from both disorders, while others are uniquely associated with remission from MDD.

Effects of cognitive behavioral therapy with relaxation vs. Imagery rescripting on test anxiety: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Test anxiety is a common condition in students, which may lead to impaired academic performance as well as to distress. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of two cognitive-behavioral interventions designed to reduce test anxiety. Test anxiety in the participants was diagnosed as social or specific phobia according to DSM-IV. Subsequently subjects were randomized to three groups: a moderated self-help group, which served as a control group, and two treatment groups, where either relaxation techniques or imagery rescripting were applied. Methods: Students suffering from test anxiety were recruited at two German universities ( n = 180). The randomized controlled design comprised three groups which received test anxiety treatment in weekly three-hour sessions over a period of five weeks. Treatment outcome was assessed with a test anxiety questionnaire, which was administered before and after treatment, as well as in a six-month follow-up. Results: A repeated-measures ANOVA for participants with complete data ( n = 59) revealed a significant reduction of test anxiety from baseline to six-month follow-up in all three treatment groups ( p &lt; .001). Limitations: Participants were included if they had a clinical diagnosis of test anxiety. The sample may therefore represent only more severe forms of text anxiety . Moreover, the sample size in this study was small, the numbers of participants per group differed, and treatment results were based on self-report. Due to the length of the treatment, an implementation of the group treatments used in this study might not be feasible in all settings. Conclusions: Group treatments constitute an effective method of treating test anxiety, e.g. in university settings. Imagery rescripting may particularly contribute to treatment efficacy.

"Psychometric properties of the Youth Anxiety Measure for DSM-5, Part I (YAM-5-I) in a community sample of Spanish-speaking adolescents","Background: Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders in adolescence. There is a need for brief screening tools to identify adolescents at risk for anxiety disorders. The Youth Anxiety Measure for DSM-5 has been recently developed to assess youths’ anxiety symptoms in terms of the current classification system. The goal of this study is to provide a first test of its psychometric properties in a community sample of adolescents in Spain. Methods: The sample consisted of 505 13- to 17-year-old adolescents who completed Part I of the YAM-5 (YAM-5-I), which measures symptoms of the major anxiety disorders. Results: Data indicated that the YAM-5-I displays appropriate internal consistency reliability. In addition, support was also found for the construct validity of the measure: most items loaded on a factor that represented the hypothesized anxiety syndromes, although it should also be noted that some items exhibited issues and therefore had to be discarded. Limitations: Cross-cultural and trans-national studies are needed to determine psychometric properties of scale across languages and cultures. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the YAM-5-I has satisfactory psychometric properties, which indicates that it can be used as a screening tool in Spanish-speaking adolescents from the general population.

Physical activity and anxiety: A perspective from the World Health Survey,"Background: Despite the known benefits of physical activity (PA) among people with anxiety, little is known about PA levels in people with anxiety at the population level. This study explored the global prevalence of anxiety and its association with PA. Methods: Cross-sectional, community-based data from the World Health Survey was analyzed. Prevalence of anxiety was estimated for 237,964 individuals (47 countries). PA was categorized as low, moderate, and high based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (short form). The association between PA and anxiety was assessed by multivariable logistic regression. Results: The overall global prevalence of anxiety was 11.4% (47 countries). Across 38 countries with available data on PA, 62.5%, 20.2%, and 17.3% of the sample engaged in high, moderate, and low levels of PA respectively. The prevalence of low physical activity in those with and without anxiety was 22.9% vs. 16.6% ( p &lt; 0.001) (38 countries, n = 184,920). In the pooled model adjusted for socio-demographics, depression, and country, individuals engaging in low PA (vs. high PA) had 1.32 (95% CI = 1.17–1.47) times higher odds for anxiety than those with high PA. Female sex, older age, lower education and wealth, and depression were also associated with low PA. At the individual country level, there was a significant positive association between low PA and anxiety in 17 of the 38 countries. Conclusion: Low PA levels are associated with increased prevalence of anxiety. There is a need for longitudinal research to establish the directionality of the relationships observed.

White matter correlates of anxiety sensitivity in panic disorder,"Background: Anxiety sensitivity (AS) refers to a fear of anxiety-related sensations and is a dispositional variable especially elevated in patients with panic disorder (PD). Although several functional imaging studies of AS in patients with PD have suggested the presence of altered neural activity in paralimbic areas such as the insula, no study has investigated white matter (WM) alterations in patients with PD in relation to AS. The objective of this study was to investigate the WM correlates of AS in patients with PD. Methods: One–hundred and twelve right-handed patients with PD and 48 healthy control (HC) subjects were enrolled in this study. The Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory-Revised (ASI-R), the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS), the Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire (APPQ), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered. Tract-based spatial statistics were used for diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging analysis. Results: Among the patients with PD, the ASI-R total scores were significantly correlated with the fractional anisotropy values of the WM regions near the insula, the splenium of the corpus callosum, the tapetum, the fornix/stria terminalis, the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule, the posterior thalamic radiation, the sagittal striatum, and the posterior corona radiata located in temporo-parieto-limbic regions and are involved in interoceptive processing (p &lt; 0.01; threshold-free cluster enhancement [TFCE]-corrected). These WM regions were also significantly correlated with the APPQ interoceptive avoidance subscale and BDI scores in patients with PD (p &lt; 0.01, TFCE-corrected). Correlation analysis among the HC subjects revealed no significant findings. Limitations: There has been no comparative study on the structural neural correlates of AS in PD. Conclusions: The current study suggests that the WM correlates of AS in patients with PD may be associated with the insula and the adjacent temporo-parieto-limbic WM regions, which may play important roles in interoceptive processing in the brain and in depression in PD.

Problematic smartphone use: A conceptual overview and systematic review of relations with anxiety and depression psychopathology,"Background: Research literature on problematic smartphone use, or smartphone addiction, has proliferated. However, relationships with existing categories of psychopathology are not well defined. We discuss the concept of problematic smartphone use, including possible causal pathways to such use. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the relationship between problematic use with psychopathology. Using scholarly bibliographic databases, we screened 117 total citations, resulting in 23 peer-reviewer papers examining statistical relations between standardized measures of problematic smartphone use/use severity and the severity of psychopathology. Results: Most papers examined problematic use in relation to depression, anxiety, chronic stress and/or low self-esteem. Across this literature, without statistically adjusting for other relevant variables, depression severity was consistently related to problematic smartphone use, demonstrating at least medium effect sizes. Anxiety was also consistently related to problem use, but with small effect sizes. Stress was somewhat consistently related, with small to medium effects. Self-esteem was inconsistently related, with small to medium effects when found. Statistically adjusting for other relevant variables yielded similar but somewhat smaller effects. Limitations: We only included correlational studies in our systematic review, but address the few relevant experimental studies also. Conclusions: We discuss causal explanations for relationships between problem smartphone use and psychopathology.

Development and validation of the Core Beliefs Questionnaire in a sample of individuals with social anxiety disorder,"Background: Prominent cognitive models of social anxiety have consistently emphasised the importance of beliefs about the self in the aetiology and maintenance of social anxiety. The present study sought to develop and validate a new measure of core beliefs about the self for SAD, the Core Beliefs Questionnaire (CBQ). Methods: Three versions of the CBQ were developed: a Trait version (fundamental absolute statements about the self), a Contingent version (statements about the self related to a specific social-evaluative situation), and an Other version (statements about how others view the self in social-evaluative situations generally). The psychometric features of the scales were examined in clinical ( n = 269) and non-clinical ( n = 67) samples. Results: Exploratory factor analysis yielded a one factor model for all three versions of the questionnaire. Total scores differentiated individuals with SAD from individuals without a psychiatric condition, and demonstrated excellent internal consistency. The three CBQ versions had positive associations with social anxiety while controlling for depression, although zero-order correlations indicated the Trait version was more strongly related to depression than social anxiety, the Contingent version was similarly related to depression and social anxiety, and the Other version was more strongly related to social anxiety than depression. Scores on all three versions of the CBQ reduced from pre- to post-treatment and this change predicted treatment outcome. Limitations: This is the first validation study of the CBQ. Conclusions: This study provides initial support for the reliability and validity of the CBQ.

"Gender-specific association between serotonin transporter polymorphisms ( &lt;i&gt;5-HTTLPR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;rs25531&lt;/i&gt;) and neuroticism, anxiety and depression in well-defined healthy Han Chinese","Background: A tri-allelic serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism ( 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 ) more effectively determines the levels of transcriptional efficacy than that with the bi-allelic 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in vitro. Both are reportedly associated with personality traits of negative emotionality, but with conflicting findings. One explanation for this is that a gender difference may play a role in genetic contribution. Here, we hypothesized that the tri-allelic genotype of the serotonin transporter is more closely linked to neuroticism, an anxiety- and depression-related trait, than the bi-allelic variation, particularly in a gender-dependent way. Methods: The genotypes of the 5-HTTLPR and rs25531 loci were determined in 1139 well-defined physically and mentally healthy Han Chinese (550 men, 589 women; mean age 38.3 ± 10.3 years). All participants completed the neuroticism measure of the short-form Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI). The levels of anxiety and depression were assessed by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), respectively. Results: A significant tri-allelic genotype-by-gender interaction effect was found in the MPI-neuroticism measure. S′S′ homozygotes were associated with higher neuroticism than L ′ allele carriers in men. Also, both the BAI and BDI scores were higher in the S′S′ homozygotic men. In the bi-allelic analyses, however, there was only an association between SS genotype and MPI-neuroticism in men. Limitations: Sub-analyses by gender-stratification may reduce the statistical power. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that gender differences exist in the genetic contributions of the serotonin transporter in human neuroticism, and anxiety/depression. Our data provide further support for rs25531, strengthening the effects of 5-HTTLPR .

Acquisition of CS-US contingencies during Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction in social anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder,"Background: Fear-based disorders, like social anxiety disorder (SAD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are characterized by an exaggerated fear response and avoidance to trigger cues, suggesting a transdiagnostic mechanism of psychopathology. Current theories suggest that abnormalities in conditioned fear is a primary contributor to the pathophysiology of these disorders. The primary goal of this study was to compare acquisition of conditioned stimulus (CS) and aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) contingencies during fear learning and extinction in individuals with SAD and PTSD. Methods: In a standard Pavlovian fear conditioning-extinction paradigm we measured subjective US expectancy ratings to different CSs in patients with SAD (n = 16) compared to patients with PTSD (n = 13) and healthy controls (n = 15) Results: Both patient groups (SAD, PTSD) acquired differential conditioning between a CS that predicted US (CS+) and a CS that never predicted the US (CS-), however, both groups reported an increased expectancy that the US would occur following the CS-. Additionally, the PTSD group overestimated that the US would occur in general. Neither patient group showed evidence of successful extinction of the CS+-US contingency nor differentiated their expectation of US occurrence between the CS+ and CS- during extinction learning. Limitations: Group sample sizes were small and we did not include a trauma-exposed group without PTSD Conclusions: Both SAD and PTSD generalize expectations of an aversive outcome across CSs, even when a CS never signals an aversive outcome and PTSD may tend to over-expect threat. Fear learning and extinction abnormalities may be a core feature underlying shared symptoms across fear-based disorders.

Factor analysis of temperament and personality traits in bipolar patients: Correlates with comorbidity and disorder severity,"Background: Temperament and personality traits have been suggested as endophenotypes for bipolar disorder based on several lines of evidence, including heritability. Previous work suggested an anxious-reactive factor identified across temperament and personality inventories that produced significant group discrimination and could potentially be useful in genetic analyses. We have attempted to further characterize this factor structure in a sample of bipolar patients. Methods: A sample of 1195 subjects with bipolar I disorder was evaluated, all with complete data available. Dimension reduction across two inventories identified 18 factors explaining 39% of the variance. Results: The two largest factors reflected affective instability and general anxiety/worry, respectively. Subsequent analyses of the clinical features associated with bipolar disorder revealed specificity for the factors in a predictable pattern. Cluster analysis of the factors identified a subgroup defined by a strong lack of general anxiety and low affective instability represented by the first two factors. The remaining subjects could be distinguished into two clusters by the presence of either more positive characteristics, including persistence/drive, spirituality, expressivity, and humor, or more negative characteristics of depression and anxiety. Limitations: These analyses involved bipolar I subjects only and must be extended to other bipolar spectrum diagnoses, unaffected relatives, and individuals at risk. Conclusions: These results suggest that temperament and personality measures access latent traits associated with important clinical features of bipolar disorder. By translating clinical variables into quantitative traits, we may identify subgroups of bipolar patients with distinct clinical profiles, thereby facilitating both individual treatment strategies and genetic analyses.

The direction of the relationship between symptoms of insomnia and psychiatric disorders in adolescents,"Background: This study assessed the direction of the relationship between symptoms of insomnia disorder, depression, various anxiety disorders and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in adolescents after controlling for age, gender, chronotype, and outcome variable at baseline. Methods: Data was collected in eight high schools in Adelaide, South Australia, at two time-points approximately 6 months apart. The study was completed by 318 and 255 high school students at baseline and follow-up, respectively, aged 12–18 (M = 14.96, SD = 1.34) in grades 7–11 at baseline. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to assess each relationship, the first model controlling for age, gender and chronotype, and the second controlling for outcome variable at baseline. Results: Insomnia symptoms predicted and were predicted by symptoms of each psychiatric disorder in model 1. In model 2, insomnia symptoms predicted symptoms of depression, and vice-versa. Symptoms of insomnia also predicted symptoms of separation anxiety disorder (SAD) once SAD, but not vice-versa, in model 2. Symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobia (SP) predicted symptoms of insomnia disorder in model 2, but not vice-versa. Insomnia symptoms were no longer related to symptoms of other anxiety disorders in model 2. Limitations: The use of self-report measures, and potential predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating or preventative factors were not assessed. Conclusions: Symptoms of insomnia disorder are bidirectionally related to depressive symptoms independent from baseline symptoms, and unidirectionally related to symptoms of OCD and SP where OCD and SP are independent risk-factors of the development of insomnia symptoms.

Social media use and anxiety in emerging adults,"Introduction: Social media use is central to the lives of emerging adults, but the implications of social media use on psychological adjustment are not well understood. The current study aimed to examine the impact of time spent using social media on anxiety symptoms and severity in emerging adults. Methods: Using a web-based recruitment technique, we collected survey information on social media use and anxiety symptoms and related impairment in a nationally representative sample of 563 emerging adults from the U.S. (18–22 years-old; 50.2% female; 63.3% Non-Hispanic White). Participants self-reported the amount of time they spent using various social media sites on an average day, and responded to anxiety questionnaires Results: Hierarchical regression revealed that more time spent using social media was significantly associated with greater symptoms of dispositional anxiety ( B = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.59–0.90, p &lt; 0.001), but was unrelated to recent anxiety-related impairment ( B = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.00–0.12, p = 0.051), controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and education level. Logistic regression also revealed that more daily social media use was significantly associated with a greater likelihood of participants scoring above the anxiety severity clinical cut-off indicating a probable anxiety disorder (AOR = 1.032, 95% CI = 1.004–1.062, p = 0.028). Limitations: Study limitations include the cross-sectional design and reliance on self-report questionnaires. Conclusions: Given the ubiquity of social media among emerging adults, who are also at high risk for anxiety disorders, the positive association between social media use and anxiety has important implications for clinicians. Gaining a more nuanced understanding of this relationship will help to inform novel approaches to anxiety treatment.

Trait anxiety mediates the effect of stress exposure on post-traumatic stress disorder and depression risk in cardiac surgery patients,"Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are common after cardiac surgery. Lifetime stress exposure and personality traits may influence the development of these psychiatric conditions. Methods: Self-reported rates of PTSD and depression and potential determinants (i.e., trait anxiety and stress exposure) were established 1.5 to 4 years after cardiac surgery. Data was available for 1125 out of 1244 (90.4%) participants. Multivariable linear regressions were conducted to investigate mediating and/or moderating effects of trait anxiety on the relationship between stress exposure, and PTSD and depression. Pre-planned subgroup analyses were performed for both sexes. Results: PTSD and depression symptoms were present in 10.2% and 13.1% of the participants, respectively. Trait anxiety was a full mediator of the association between stress exposure and depression in both the total cohort and female and male subgroups. Moreover, trait anxiety partially mediated the relationship between stress exposure and PTSD in the full cohort and the male subgroup, whereas trait anxiety fully mediated this relationship in female patients. Trait anxiety did not play a moderating role in the total patient sample, nor after stratification on gender. Limitations: The unequal distribution of male (78%) and female patients (22%) might limit the generalizability of our findings. Furthermore, risk factors were investigated retrospectively and with variable follow-up time. Conclusions: In cardiac surgery patients, trait anxiety was found to be an important mediator of postoperative PTSD and depression. Prospective research is necessary to verify whether these factors are reliable screening measures of individuals' vulnerability for psychopathology development after cardiac surgery.

Distress intolerance as a moderator of the relationship between daily stressors and affective symptoms: Tests of incremental and prospective relationships,"Background: Distress intolerance (DI) is conceptualized as an individual difference reflective of the ability to tolerate aversive psychological states. Although high DI has demonstrated cross-sectional associations with multiple forms of psychopathology, few studies have tested key facets of its theoretical conceptualization. Specifically, little research has been conducted on DI's theorized role as an incrementally valid prospective moderator of the relationship between daily stressful events and affective symptoms reflective of preoccupation with aversive internal (e.g., depression, worry) rather than external stimuli (e.g., social anxiety). Method: A non-clinical sample (N = 147; 77% female; M age = 19.32) in which high DI individuals were oversampled was recruited. Participants completed baseline measures of DI and trait negative affect followed by six diary entries over a two-week period in which participants reported on daily stressors, negative affect, worry, depressive, and social anxiety symptoms. Results: Hierarchical linear models revealed that DI positively predicted depressive and worry, but not social anxiety symptoms, independent of daily stressors and negative affect. Further, a significant interaction effect was found such that the positive association between daily stressor(s) occurrence and daily worry was significant at high, but not low DI, and a similar trend-level interaction effect was observed for depressive symptoms. The interaction for social anxiety symptoms was non-significant Limitations: Utilization of a non-clinical sample precludes generalization of results to clinical samples. Only self-reported DI was assessed, limiting conclusions to perceived as opposed to behaviorally-indexed DI. Conclusions: Results largely supported DI's theoretical conceptualization as an incrementally valid moderator of stress responding with relevance to particular affective symptoms.

Hyperfunction of left lateral prefrontal cortex and automatic thoughts in social anxiety disorder: A near-infrared spectroscopy study,"Background: Patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) experience unusual fear in normal social situations. The verbal fluency task (VFT) was administered while subjects were undergoing near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) scanning. The purpose of VFT was to examine the functions of the frontal and temporal lobes. Methods: Subjects included 145 drug-naïve patients with SAD and 152 healthy controls (HCs). All subjects underwent psychological testing to determine levels of anxiety and depression and to evaluate cognition. Results: The scores of patients with SAD indicated significantly higher anxiety and depressive states than those in HCs on several measures: Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Spielberger Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale (SASS). The patients with SAD also had higher scores on the future denial, threat prediction, self-denial, past denial, and interpersonal threat sections of the Depression and Anxiety Cognition Scale (DACS). NIRS scanning revealed hyperactivity in the left frontal cortex of patients with SAD. Threat prediction scores on DACS were negatively correlated with oxy-Hb responses in the right frontal cortex. Limitations: Further studies with a larger sample size are required to verify our findings. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate the different mechanisms of the right and left frontal cortex in situations of social anxiety disorder.

A meta-analysis of the efficacy of vortioxetine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and high levels of anxiety symptoms,"Background: Coexisting anxiety is common in major depressive disorder (MDD) and more difficult to treat than depression without anxiety. This analysis assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of vortioxetine in MDD patients with high levels of anxiety (baseline Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM-A] total score ≥ 20). Methods: Efficacy was assessed using an aggregated, study-level meta-analysis of 10 randomized, placebo-controlled, 6/8-week trials of vortioxetine 5–20 mg/day in adults (18–75 years), with a study in elderly patients (≥ 65 years) analyzed separately. Outcome measures included mean differences from placebo in change from baseline to endpoint (Δ) in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), HAM-A total, and HAM-A subscales. Safety and tolerability were assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Results: A total of 1497 (48.6%) vortioxetine-treated and 860 (49.1%) placebo-treated patients had baseline HAM-A ≥ 20. There were significant differences from placebo in MADRS (vortioxetine 5mg/day, n = 415, Δ−2.68, P = 0.005; 10 mg/day, n = 373, Δ−3.59, P &lt; 0.001; 20mg/day, n = 207, Δ−4.30, P = 0.005) and HAM-A total (5 mg/day, n = 419, Δ−1.64, P = 0.022; 10 mg/day, n = 373, Δ−2.04, P = 0.003; 20 mg/day, n = 207, Δ−2.19, P = 0.027). There were significantly greater improvements versus placebo on the HAM-A psychic subscale for all doses. The most common TEAEs (≥ 5.0%) were nausea, headache, dizziness, dry mouth, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, constipation, and vomiting. Incidence of serious TEAEs was 1.3% (placebo) and ≤ 1.3% (vortioxetine, across doses). Limitations: Study heterogeneity limits this analysis. Patients with baseline HAM-A ≥ 20 were not directly compared to baseline HAM-A &lt; 20 or total MDD population. Conclusions: Vortioxetine was efficacious in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with MDD and high levels of anxiety.

Effect of early trauma on the sleep quality of euthymic bipolar patients,"Objective: Poor quality of sleep is frequent in euthymic bipolar patients and conveys worse clinical outcomes. We investigated the features of euthymic bipolar patients associated with poor sleep quality, with a focus on the effect of childhood trauma. Method: 493 euthymic patients with DSM-IV-defined bipolar disorders were recruited in FondaMental Advanced Centers of Expertize for Bipolar Disorders (FACE-BD) between 2009 and 2014. Clinical variables were recorded. Subjective sleep quality and history of childhood trauma were respectively measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Results: Poor sleepers were older, less professionally active, had significantly higher anxiety levels, took more anxiolytic drugs and did endorse more suicide attempts and suicidal ideas than good sleepers after adjusting for anxiety levels and age. Emotional abuse was associated with poor sleep quality after adjustment for BMI, age, professional activity, and bipolar disorders (BD) type (OR = 1.83; 95% CI [1.30; 3.10]; p = 0.02). However, this association was lost after adjustment for anxiety levels, anxiolytic treatment and suicide ideation/attempts. Limitations: The main limitation was the type of sleep assessment, which only measured the subjective part of sleep complaints. Conclusion: A history of emotional abuse might underlie sleep problems in many bipolar patients but anxiety seems to act as a confounding factor in this relationship. New studies are needed to elucidate the role of childhood maltreatment on poor sleep among bipolar patients.

Self-help strategies for sub-threshold anxiety: A Delphi consensus study to find messages suitable for population-wide promotion,"Background: Many self-help strategies have been recommended for anxiety, but it is not clear which strategies are most effective and could be encouraged as part of an early intervention approach. This study used the Delphi expert consensus method to identify which strategies for mild (sub-threshold) anxiety are thought to be helpful and feasible to implement for individuals without professional assistance. Methods: Participants were an international sample of 51 clinicians/researchers and 32 consumer advocates with expertise in anxiety. The scientific and lay literature was systematically searched for strategies claimed to be effective for anxiety. Participants rated the likely helpfulness of each strategy in reducing sub-threshold anxiety (related to generalised anxiety, social anxiety, or non-specific anxiety symptoms) and the feasibility of implementation in an iterative process across three questionnaire rounds. Results: 66 out of 324 candidate strategies were endorsed by at least 80% of both consumers and clinicians/researchers as likely to be helpful, and 18 were judged as feasible to carry out. Endorsed strategies were most frequently related to cognitive strategies and other psychological methods, interpersonal strategies, reducing physical tension, and lifestyle strategies. Few strategies were endorsed that were related to diet, supplements, or complementary medicine. Limitations: Findings may not apply to other forms of mild anxiety related to panic attacks or specific phobias. Conclusions: This study contributes to the evidence-base on strategies that individuals can use to improve mild anxiety symptoms. Research is now required to evaluate whether promoting the strategies can help reduce the overall community burden from anxiety disorders.

The role of hazardous drinking reductions in predicting depression and anxiety symptom improvement among psychiatry patients: A longitudinal study,"Background: Co-occurrence of depression, anxiety, and hazardous drinking is high in clinical samples. Hazardous drinking can worsen depression and anxiety symptoms (and vice versa), yet less is known about whether reductions in hazardous drinking improve symptom outcomes. Methods: Three hundred and seven psychiatry outpatients were interviewed (baseline, 3-, 6-months) for hazardous drinking (drinking over recommended daily limits), depression (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7) as part of a hazardous drinking intervention trial. Longitudinal growth models tested associations between hazardous drinking and symptoms (and reciprocal effects between symptoms and hazardous drinking), adjusting for treatment effects. Results: At baseline, participants had moderate anxiety ( M = 10.81; SD = 10.82) and depressive symptoms ( M = 13.91; SD = 5.58); 60.0% consumed alcohol at hazardous drinking levels. Over 6-months, participants’ anxiety ( B = −3.03, p &lt; .001) and depressive symptoms ( B = −5.39, p &lt; .001) improved. Continued hazardous drinking led to slower anxiety ( B = 0.09, p = .005) and depressive symptom ( B = 0.10, p = .004) improvement; reductions in hazardous drinking led to faster anxiety ( B = −0.09, p = .010) and depressive ( B = −0.10, p = .015) symptom improvement. Neither anxiety ( B = 0.07, p = .066) nor depressive ( B = 0.05, p = .071) symptoms were associated with hazardous drinking outcomes. Limitations: Participants were psychiatry outpatients, limiting generalizability. Conclusions: Reducing hazardous drinking can improve depression and anxiety symptoms but continued hazardous use slows recovery for psychiatry patients. Hazardous drinking-focused interventions may be helpful in promoting symptom improvement in clinical populations.

Developmental risk factors in generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder,"Background: There is a lack of clarity regarding specific risk factors discriminating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) from panic disorder (PD). Goal: This study investigated whether GAD and PD could be discriminated through differences in developmental etiological factors including childhood parental loss/separation, psychological disorders, and maternal and paternal attachment. Method: Twenty people with adult generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), 20 with adult panic disorder (PD), 11 with adult comorbid GAD and PD, and 21 adult non-anxious controls completed diagnostic interviews to assess symptoms of mental disorders in adulthood and childhood. Participants also reported on parental attachment, loss and separation. Results: Childhood diagnoses of GAD and PD differentiated clinical groups from controls as well as from each other, suggesting greater likelihood for homotypic over heterotypic continuity. Compared to controls, specific phobia was associated with all three clinical groups, and childhood depression, social phobia, and PTSD were uniquely associated with adult GAD. Both maternal and paternal attachment also differentiated clinical groups from controls. However, higher levels of subscales reflecting maternal insecure avoidant attachment (e.g., no memory of early childhood experiences and balancing/forgiving current state of mind) emerged as more predictive of GAD relative to PD. There were no group differences in parental loss or separation. Conclusions: These results support differentiation of GAD and PD based on developmental risk factors. Recommendations for future research and implications of the findings for understanding the etiology and symptomatology of GAD and PD are discussed.

When social anxiety and depression go together: A population study of comorbidity and associated consequences,"Background: Despite several studies suggesting higher depression severity and dysfunction occurring in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) comorbid with social anxiety disorder (SAD), a clear understanding of the specific risks associated with this comorbidity is lacking. In this study we compared the disease characteristics and level of disability of individuals with MDD-SAD with other comorbidities between depression and anxiety. Methods: Data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) (N = 20,013) were used. Individuals were divided in four groups comparing MDD-SAD with MDD alone, as well as other comorbidities between MDD and one anxiety (MDD-1ANX) or more than two anxiety disorders (MDD ≥ 2ANX), with respect to several clinical, demographic, and functional characteristics. Results: MDD-SAD comorbidity in the general population occurred in younger people, particularly men, and seemed to have an earlier onset of MDD. Occupational and social dysfunction was similar between individuals with MDD-SAD and those with MDD-1ANX. However, individuals with MDD ≥ 2ANX had significantly higher severity as measured by suicidality as well as substance abuse and social and occupational dysfunction. SAD was the most prevalent comorbid anxiety in this group. Limitations: The findings of this study were derived from the cross-sectional data. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the particular risks associated with MDD-SAD are the early onset and likelihood of additional anxiety, leading to higher severity and disability levels. Clinicians should increase the screening and treatment of SAD and other anxiety disorders in individuals with MDD given the higher associated health risk and functional impairment.

Risk of incident cardiovascular events amongst individuals with anxiety and depression: A prospective cohort study in the east London primary care database,"Background: It is unknown how risk of myocardial infarction and stroke differ for patients with and without anxiety or depression, and whether this risk can be explained by demographics, medication use, cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this study is to quantify differences in risk of non-fatal MI or stroke among patients with anxiety or depression. Methods: Prospective cohort study examining risk of incident MI and stroke between March 2005 and March 2015 for 524,952 patients aged 30 and over from the east London primary care database for patients with anxiety or depression. Results: Amongst 21,811 individuals with depression at baseline, 1.2% had MI and 0.4% had stroke. Of 22,128 individuals with anxiety at baseline, 1.1% had MI and 0.3% had stroke. Depression was independently associated with both MI and stroke, whereas anxiety was associated with MI only before adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Antidepressant use increased risk for MI but not stroke. Mean age at first MI was lower in those with anxiety, while mean age at first stroke was lower in those with depression. Limitations: The study was limited to patients currently registered in the database and thus we did not have any patients that died during the course of follow-up. Conclusions: Patients with depression have increased risk of cardiovascular events. The finding of no increased cardiovascular risk in those with anxiety after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors is of clinical importance and highlights that the adequate control of traditional risk factors is the cornerstone of cardiovascular disease prevention. Targeting management of classical cardiovascular risk factors and evaluating the risks of antidepressant prescribing should be prioritized.

Investigating symptom domains of bipolar disorder for Spanish-speakers using the Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale,"Background: A Spanish language rating scale which assesses the range of bipolar disorder symptoms is needed. There are rating scales commonly used, however they do not address commonly expressed symptoms associated with bipolar disorder and have varied rating systems. There are also few comparisons of symptom severity between Spanish and English speaking patients, due to limitations in available rating scales. Methods: We conducted psychometric assessment of the Spanish language Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS) (N = 71) for persons with bipolar disorder, which assesses 5 domains: mania, depression, irritability, anxiety and psychosis. The Spanish BISS scores were then compared to the MADRS (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and the YMRS (Young Mania Rating Scale) as well as to BISS scores in an English speaking sample (N = 102) with bipolar disorder from the same geographic locations. Results: Chronbach's alphas for the Spanish BISS ranged from 0.6 to 0.93, with the psychosis domain displaying lower reliability. Correlations with the MADRS and YMRS were good and ranged from 0.70 to 0.88. The BISS differentiated well across mood states in English and Spanish versions, with mood state differentiated well using subscales and domains. For the irritability and anxiety domains, Spanish speaking participants had higher scores than English speakers across mood states. Females showed differences in symptom profiles compared to males. Limitations: The sample sizes in the Spanish speaking manic group were small. The Spanish BISS, tested here primarily in patients of Mexican ancestry, may require revision in other Spanish language populations. Conclusions: The Spanish BISS, a Spanish language symptom rating scale for bipolar disorder, demonstrates good reliability and validity. Clinical assessment in anxiety and irritability domains is particularly relevant in a Spanish speaking sample. Consistent with prior research, females report higher depression, irritability and anxiety scores irrespective of language spoken.

Heart rate variability and generalized anxiety disorder during laboratory-induced worry and aversive imagery,"Background: To date only a few published studies have examined the effect of disorder-relevant stressors on heart rate variability (HRV) in participants meeting a clinical diagnosis of GAD, with conflicting results. The primary aim of this study was to determine if GAD is associated with lower HRV at rest, and whether vagal regulation during task varies by type (i.e., baseline, anticipation, imagery, or worry). Methods: This study investigated resting cardiac vagal tone and vagal regulation in a sample of 40 participants with or without a validated diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). High-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) was used to index cardiac vagal activity. Results: GAD was associated with vagal withdrawal during both imagery and worry inductions, but no group differences in resting vagal tone or worry were observed. Limitations: Methodological limitations include inherent limits to generalizability of laboratory-based findings; specifically worry induction and cardiac reactivity to lab-based stressors. Conclusions: The results support the notion that GAD is associated with vagal withdrawal during active bouts of idiographic worry and imagery, and question the assumption that GAD is associated with low resting vagal tone. In light of polyvagal theory these findings provide additional support for the presence of emotion regulation deficits in GAD, and identify specific ANS processes that underlie GAD.

Different coping strategies amongst individuals with grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic traits,"Objective: This study explored the relationships between coping with stress responses and grandiose and vulnerable narcissist traits. Method: A community sample of 170 adults (113 female) participated in this study. A cross-sectional design was employed that utilized self-report measures of trait anxiety, social desirability, coping with stress responses, and pathological narcissism. Results: Regression models indicated that both grandiose and vulnerable narcissism traits are significantly associated with, in opposing directions, behavioural disengagement responses to stress when controlling for trait anxiety and social desirability. Vulnerable narcissism traits were significantly associated with the use of denial as coping with stress response when controlling for the same factors. Conclusion: These findings provide further evidence of the discriminant validity of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory and inform our understanding of the differences that grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic traits have on coping.

Anxiety disorders and falls among older adults,"Background: Falls are common among older adults and can lead to serious injuries, including fractures. We aimed to determine associations between anxiety disorders and falls in older adults. Methods: Participants were 487 men and 376 women aged ≥ 60 years enrolled in the Geelong Osteoporosis Study, Australia. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Non-patient edition (SCID-I/NP), lifetime history of anxiety disorders was determined. Falls were determined by self-report. In men, a falls-risk score (Elderly Falls Screening Test (EFST)) was also calculated. Results: Among fallers, 24 of 299 (8.0%) had a lifetime history of anxiety disorder compared to 36 of 634 (5.7%) non-fallers (p=0.014). Examination of the association between anxiety and falls suggested differential relationships for men and women. In men, following adjustment for psychotropic medications, mobility and blood pressure, lifetime anxiety disorder was associated with falling (OR 2.96; 95%CI 1.07–8.21) and with EFST score (OR 3.46; 95%CI 1.13–10.6). In women, an association between lifetime anxiety disorder and falls was explained by psychotropic medication use, poor mobility and socioeconomic status. Limitations: Sub-group analyses involving types of anxiety and anxiety disorders over the past 12-months were not performed due to power limitations. Conclusion: Although anxiety disorders were independently associated with a 3-fold increase in likelihood of reported falls and high falls risk among men, an independent association was not detected among women. These results may aid in prevention of falls through specific interventions aimed at reducing anxiety, particularly in men.

African-American representation in family and twin studies of mood and anxiety disorders: A systematic review,"Purpose: Mood and anxiety disorders are common and disabling psychiatric disorders with known heritable risk factors. But the extent to which their heritability and familial risks can be generalized across ethnic/racial groups is still largely unknown, but remains of considerable scientific and clinical interest. The main objective in this review was to evaluate African-American (AA) representation in family and twin studies of major mood and anxiety disorders. Method: We conducted key word-driven computerized searches in MEDLINE and PsycINFO and manual searches from reference lists of selected articles. Search parameters included family or twin studies, mood or anxiety disorders, and familial aggregation or heritability. US-based studies published from 1980 to 2015 were included. Results: The final selection yielded 209 studies, of which 88 did not report race/ethnicity or only reported Caucasian/white race. Of the remaining 121 studies, 66% did not include AAs, 24% included 1–10% AA, 8% included greater than 10% AA and 2 studies were exclusively AA. These trends were similar across study type, disorder and time periods spanning 35 years. Limitations: Small samples, including the large number of studies without race/ethnicity reports, limited detailed analyses of change across time by disorder and study type. Adoption studies were not included in this review. Conclusions: Underrepresentation of AAs in family and twin studies of affective disorders is substantial and can limit generalizability of established heritability and familial risk estimates across clinical and research settings. Additional twin and family studies focusing on AAs can be of benefit in closing this gap.

Social anxiety as a potential mediator of the association between attachment and depression,"Objective: The study represents a conceptual replication of the study by Eng et al. (2001) in a sample of adult patients diagnosed with social anxiety disorder as primary diagnosis. Methods: Two different attachment questionnaires (Bielefeld Questionnaire of Client Expectations (BQCE) and Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR-RD)) were applied to examine whether the effect of attachment on depression (measured by the BDI) is mediated by social anxiety (measured by the LSAS) in a cross-sectional study. Results: The data confirms such a mediation. The effect of attachment measured with the BQCE on depression was completely mediated, whereas the effect of both scales of the ECR-RD (attachment related avoidance and anxiety) on depression was only partially mediated by social anxiety disorder. Conclusion: The study supports the association of attachment, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms and the need to consider different perspectives on attachment.

Anxiety sensitivity and family accommodation in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background: Although anxiety sensitivity (AS) presents in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), it has received minimal empirical attention. There are postulated connections between AS and family accommodation, but this relationship has yet to be formally examined. Methods: The present study included 58 adults with OCD who completed a clinician-rated measure of OCD symptom severity, as well as self-report measures assessing AS, family variables, impairment, and co-occurring psychopathology. Results: Participants' AS moderately correlated with family accommodation, family functioning, and depression, while strongly correlating with anxiety symptoms. The Fear of Cognitive Dyscontrol AS subscale moderately correlated with multiple domains of functional impairment, and predicted family accommodation beyond the effects of OCD symptom severity. Family accommodation mediated the relationship between the Fear of Cognitive Dyscontrol AS subscale and functional impairment. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional in nature, limiting the ability to establish directionality and causation. The sample was also limited to adults with OCD and their own symptomology, necessitating further investigations of these constructs in pediatric samples and psychopathology in the caregivers/relatives. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of considering fears regarding the loss of mental control within the context of family accommodation in OCD when evaluating functional impairment.

"Patterns of separation anxiety symptoms amongst pregnant women in conflict-affected Timor-Leste: Associations with traumatic loss, family conflict, and intimate partner violence","Background: Adult separation anxiety (ASA) symptoms are prevalent amongst young women in low and middle-income countries and symptoms may be common in pregnancy. No studies have focused on defining distinctive patterns of ASA symptoms amongst pregnant women in these settings or possible associations with trauma exposure and ongoing stressors. Methods: In a consecutive sample of 1672 women attending antenatal clinics in Dili, Timor-Leste (96% response), we assessed traumatic events of conflict, ongoing adversity, intimate partner violence (IPV), ASA, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and severe psychological distress. Latent Class Analysis was used to identify classes of women based on their distinctive profiles of ASA symptoms, comparisons then being made with key covariates including trauma domains of conflict, intimate partner violence (IPV) and ongoing stressors. Results: LCA yielded three classes, comprising a core ASA (4%), a limited ASA (25%) and a low symptom class (61%). The core ASA class reported exposure to multiple traumatic losses and IPV and showed a pattern of comorbidity with PTSD; the limited ASA class predominantly reported exposure to ongoing stressors and was comorbid with severe psychological distress; the low symptom class reported relatively low levels of exposure to trauma and stressors. Limitations: The study is cross-sectional, cautioning against inferring causal inferences. Conclusions: The core ASA group may be in need of immediate intervention given the high rate of exposure to IPV amongst this class. A larger number of women experiencing a limited array of non-specific ASA symptoms may need assistance to address the immediate stressors of pregnancy.

Daily longitudinal self-monitoring of mood variability in bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder,"Background: Traditionally, assessment of psychiatric symptoms has been relying on their retrospective report to a trained interviewer. The emergence of smartphones facilitates passive sensor-based monitoring and active real-time monitoring through time-stamped prompts; however there are few validated self-report measures designed for this purpose. Methods: We introduce a novel, compact questionnaire, Mood Zoom (MZ), embedded in a customised smart-phone application. MZ asks participants to rate anxiety, elation, sadness, anger, irritability and energy on a 7-point Likert scale. For comparison, we used four standard clinical questionnaires administered to participants weekly to quantify mania (ASRM), depression (QIDS), anxiety (GAD-7), and quality of life (EQ-5D). We monitored 48 Bipolar Disorder (BD), 31 Borderline Personality Disorders (BPD) and 51 Healthy control (HC) participants to study longitudinal (median ± iqr: 313 ± 194 days) variation and differences of mood traits by exploring the data using diverse time-series tools. Results: MZ correlated well (|R| &gt; 0.5, p &lt; 0.0001 ) with QIDS, GAD-7, and EQ-5D. We found statistically strong (|R| &gt; 0.3, p &lt; 0.0001 ) differences in variability in all questionnaires for the three cohorts. Compared to HC, BD and BPD participants exhibit different trends and variability, and on average had higher self-reported scores in mania, depression, and anxiety, and lower quality of life. In particular, analysis of MZ variability can differentiate BD and BPD which was not hitherto possible using the weekly questionnaires. Limitations: All reported scores rely on self-assessment; there is a lack of ongoing clinical assessment by experts to validate the findings. Conclusions: MZ could be used for efficient, long-term, effective daily monitoring of mood instability in clinical psychiatric practice.

EEG beta and low gamma power correlates with inattention in patients with major depressive disorder,"Background: Inattention is a common feature of major depressive disorder (MDD). The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) power of a specific band and inattention severity in patients with MDD. Methods: EEG recordings of 73 patients with MDD were collected in during both eyes closed and eyes open conditions. Inattention was assessed by the inattention sub-scale of the Korean version of the Adult ADHD scale (K-AADHD). The severity of symptoms associated with depression and anxiety was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Multiple regression and Hayes mediation model were applied for the statistical analysis to verify the effects of clinical variables on inattention score. Results: The beta (12–30Hz) and low gamma (30–50Hz) powers in fronto-central regions were negatively correlated with inattention scores. Symptom severity scores strongly predicted inattention scores; in particular, the BDI accounted for 23.9% of the variance. In mediation analysis, BDI fully mediated the path of anxiety to inattention. Limitations: The medication effect and comorbidity in our participants were not fully controlled. A subjective assessment tool was hired to measure inattention. Conclusions: Beta and low gamma power of the fronto-central regions might be a reliable measure of attention deficits in patients with MDD, which in turn, seems to be related to the severity of subjective depressive symptoms. Further work is needed to confirm this finding on larger, drug and comorbidity-free samples, and to test the clinical utility.

Experimentally increasing sedentary behavior results in increased anxiety in an active young adult population,"Introduction: Knowledge regarding the effects of sedentary behavior on anxiety has resulted mainly from observational studies. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a free-living, sedentary behavior-inducing randomized controlled intervention on anxiety symptoms. Methods: Participants confirmed to be active (i.e., acquiring 150min/week of physical activity) via self-report and accelerometry were randomly assigned into a sedentary behavior intervention group (n = 26) or a control group (n = 13). For one week, the intervention group eliminated exercise and minimized steps to ≤ 5000 steps/day whereas the control group continued their normal physical activity levels. Both groups completed the Overall Anxiety Severity Impairment Scale (OASIS) pre- and post-intervention, with higher OASIS scores indicating worse overall anxiety. The intervention group resumed normal physical activity levels for one week post-intervention and then completed the survey once more. Results: A significant group x time interaction effect was observed (F(1,37) = 11.13; P = .002), with post-hoc contrast tests indicating increased OASIS scores in the intervention group in Visit 2 compared with Visit 1. That is, we observed an increase in anxiety levels when participants increased their sedentary behavior. OASIS scores significantly decreased from Visit 2 to Visit 3 ( P = .001) in the intervention group. Conclusion: A one-week sedentary behavior-inducing intervention has deleterious effects on anxiety in an active, young adult population. To prevent elevated anxiety levels among active individuals, consistent regular physical activity may be necessary. Clinicians treating inactive patients who have anxiety may recommend a physical activity program in addition to any other prescribed treatment.

Mental disorders in adults with congenital heart disease: Unmet needs and impact on quality of life,"Objective: In adult congenital heart disease (ACHD), mental health status and quality of life become important issues due to improved life expectancy. Current literature provides conflicting data regarding mental health status in ACHD. Furthermore, none of the studies so far compared prevalence rates with a matched control group. Methods: The prevalence of mental disorders was assessed in 150 ACHD using a structured interview, and compared to 12-months estimates of the general German population. Quality of life (QoL) was measured with World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument. Furthermore, we related the diagnostic results of widely used screening instruments for depression (Beck Depression Inventory-2; BDI-2; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) with clinical diagnoses, to receive optimal sensitivity and specificity values. Results: The prevalence of psychiatric disorders was significantly higher in ACHD than in the general population (48.0%; CI: 44.7–60.0 vs. 35.7%; CI: 33.5–37.9). Mood (30.7%; CI: 24.0–38.0 vs. 10.7%;CI:9.4–12.0) and anxiety disorders (28.0%; CI:22.0–36.7 vs. 16.8%; CI: 15.0–18.6) were the leading causes of psychiatric illness. Sixteen of 150 ACHD patients (10.7%) received specific treatment for psychiatric disorders before entering the study. Overall quality of life was independently and negatively associated with a diagnosis of major depression ( p &lt; 0.001), alcohol dependency ( p = 0.004), nicotine dependency ( p = 0.036), and NYHA class ( p = 0.007). Accuracy of the HADS-D and BDI-2 as screening instruments was moderate (AUC 0.60–0.81), depending on the cut-off score used. Conclusions: Psychiatric disorders, particularly mood and anxiety disorders are significantly more frequent in ACHD compared to the general population. However, these disorders are rarely diagnosed resulting in under treatment and loss of quality of life. Quality of life is independently associated with the existence of mood, anxiety and substance use disorders. When self-rating instruments (BDI-2, HADS) are used as screening instruments in ACHD care, lower cut-off values are recommended.

"The suitability of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Distress Thermometer and other instruments to screen for psychiatric disorders in both lung cancer patients and their partners","Background: Lung cancer patients and their partners report high rates of distress. Although distress is of importance, psychiatric disorders might be more important in terms of prognostic value and additional psychological treatment. This study examined the suitability of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Distress Thermometer (DT), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and State subscale of State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) to screen for psychiatric disorders in lung cancer patients and partners. Methods: A consecutive sample of lung cancer patients and partners completed the screening instruments. The Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV (SCID-I) was used to diagnose psychiatric axis I disorders. Results: In 144 patients, overall ability of HADS total score (HADS-T) screening for patients with psychiatric disorders was good, whereas DT appeared less suitable. In 98 partners, the performance of HADS-T was good. Although no instrument was successful in identifying psychiatric disorders, HADS-T came closest with a fair performance in patients and partners. Limitations: Several patients and partners declined participation because they perceived participation as too distressing. As decliners possibly have the highest rates of disorders, our findings might underestimate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders. A low prevalence negatively affects the positive predictive value and complicates efficient screening for psychiatric disorders. Conclusion: The HADS-T appears to be a suitable screening instrument for ruling out those lung cancer patients and partners without a psychiatric disorder. Regarding identifying those with a psychiatric disorder, HADS-T should be used to refer both patients and partners for further diagnostics and treatment to a psychiatrist/psychologist.

Adolescent stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression: Resilience explains and differentiates the relationships,"Background: Some adolescents exhibit resilience even in the face of high levels of stress exposure. Despite this relationship, studies that investigate explanations for how resilience interacts with risk to produce particular outcomes and why this is so are lacking. The effect of resilience across the relationship between stress and symptoms of anxiety and stress and symptoms of depression was tested to provide explanations for how resilience interacts with stress and symptoms of anxiety, and depression. Method: In a cross-sectional survey, 533 Ghanaian adolescents aged 13–17 years ( M = 15.25, SD = 1.52), comprising 290 girls and 237 boys completed the Resilience Scale for Adolescents, Adolescent Stress Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, and Short Mood Feeling Questionnaire. Mediation and moderation analyses were conducted. Results: The results indicated that resilience partially mediated the relationship between stress, and symptoms of anxiety, and depression. Effects of stress were negatively associated with resilience, and positively associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. In a differential moderator effect, resilience moderated the relationship between stress and symptoms of depression but not stress and symptoms of anxiety. Limitations: Although the findings in this study are novel, they do not answer questions about protective mechanisms or processes. Conclusions: Evidence that resilience did not have the same effect across stress, and symptoms of anxiety and depression may support resilience as a dynamic process model. Access to different levels of resilience shows that enhancing resilience while minimizing stress may improve psychiatric health in adolescents' general population.

The aetiology and maintenance of social anxiety disorder: A synthesis of complimentary theoretical models and formulation of a new integrated model,"Background: Within maintenance models of social anxiety disorder (SAD), a number of cognitive and behavioural factors that drive the persistence of SAD have been proposed. However, these maintenance models do not address how SAD develops, or the origins of the proposed maintaining factors. There are also models of the development of SAD that have been proposed independently from maintenance models. These models highlight multiple factors that contribute risk to the onset of SAD, but do not address how these aetiological factors may lead to the development of the maintaining factors associated with SAD. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify aetiological and maintenance models of SAD. We then united key factors identified in these models and formulated an integrated aetiological and maintenance (IAM) model of SAD. A systematic review of the literature was then conducted on the components of the IAM model. Results: A number of aetiological and maintaining factors were identified in models of SAD. These factors could be drawn together into the IAM model. On balance, there is empirical evidence for the association of each of the factors in the IAM model with social anxiety or SAD, providing preliminary support for the model. Limitations: There are relationships between components of the IAM model that require empirical attention. Future research will need to continue to test the IAM model. Conclusions: The IAM model provides a framework for future investigations into the development and persistence of SAD.

"A cross-sectional study of associations between casual partner, friend discrimination, social support and anxiety symptoms among Chinese transgender women","Anxiety symptoms are the prevalent mental disorders for transgender women. However, only a few studies are available pertaining to this problem among Chinese Transgender women. Chinese Transgender women are a vulnerable population which is exposed to discrimination and loss of social support due to their gender identity and transition. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with anxiety symptoms among Chinese transgender women. A cross-sectional study was performed by convenience sampling. This comprised of 209 Chinese transgender women in Shenyang, China. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess anxiety symptoms for these transgender women. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed to explore the associated factors of SAS. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms in Chinese transgender women was found to be 34.5%. Regression analyses indicated that SAS was associated with casual partnership, friend discrimination and social support in the final model. Sexual partnership and discrimination contributed the most to the model, R-square, accounting for 19.2% and 15.5% of the total variance respectively. Chinese transgender women showed considerably high level of anxiety symptoms. It was also found that they were exposed to significant transition challenges, such as high risk sexual partnership, excessive discrimination and a reduction in social support. Furthermore, anxiety symptoms was best predicted by the absence or presence of a casual partner, friend discrimination and social support rather than the disclosure of their gender identity, knowledge of HIV prevention and health service. Improvement of social support, reduction of friend discrimination and determination of the characteristics of risky sexual partnerships especially for the casual partner can help to attenuate anxiety symptoms and increase mental well-being for transgender women.

Anxiety disorders in postpartum women: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Evidence suggests that postpartum anxiety is relatively common among postpartum women. Anxiety meeting diagnostic criteria for a disorder represents anxiety at its most severe, distressing, and persistent, and thus it is most important to identify, understand, and treat. This paper describes a comprehensive systematic review of anxiety disorders among postpartum women, along with meta-analysis of prevalence. Methods: Findings are based on a thorough search of the literature, strict inclusion of only studies which utilized the gold standard of diagnostic interviews for anxiety disorder determination, and critical appraisal and review of included studies. A random effects meta-analysis was used to determine prevalence. Results: Fifty-eight studies were included in the review: 13 addressed prevalence, 5 incidence, 14 onset, 16 course, 13 correlates and risk factors, 15 outcomes, and 2 treatments for postpartum anxiety disorders. An estimated 8.5% of postpartum mothers experience one or more anxiety disorders. Limitations: Many limitations relate to the state of the current literature, including a small number of studies to answer specific research questions for each disorder, methodological limitations, and considerable heterogeneity across studies. Conclusions: Anxiety disorders are common among postpartum women. The review summarizes the current status of research on postpartum anxiety disorders and underscores the need for increased research to more accurately determine prevalence, understand course, identify risk factors and outcomes, and determine effective treatments. Greater clinical attention to these disorders is warranted to ameliorate the negative consequences of postpartum anxiety disorders on women and families.

The Worry Behaviors Inventory: Assessing the behavioral avoidance associated with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Understanding behavioral avoidance associated with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has implications for the classification, theoretical conceptualization, and clinical management of the disorder. This study describes the development and preliminary psychometric evaluation of a self-report measure of avoidant behaviors associated with GAD: the Worry Behaviors Inventory (WBI). Methods: The WBI was administered to treatment-seeking patients (N=1201). Convergent validity was assessed by correlating the WBI with measures of GAD symptom severity. Divergent validity was assessed by correlating the WBI with measures of general disability and measures of depression, social anxiety and panic disorder symptom severity. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor structure ( Safety Behaviors and Avoidance ). Internal reliability was acceptable for the 10-item WBI scale (α = .86), Safety Behaviors (α = .85) and Avoidance subscales (α = .75). Evidence of convergent, divergent, and discriminant validity is reported. WBI subscales demonstrated differential associations with measures of symptom severity. The Safety Behaviors subscale was more strongly associated with GAD symptoms than symptoms of other disorders, whereas the Avoidance subscale was as strongly correlated with GAD severity as it was with depression, social anxiety and panic disorder severity. Limitations: Structured diagnostic interviews were not conducted therefor validity analyses are limited to probable diagnoses based on self-report. The cross-sectional design precluded examination of the WBI's temporal stability and treatment sensitivity. Conclusions: Preliminary evidence supports the use of the WBI in research and clinical settings and may assist clinicians to identify behaviors that are theorized to maintain GAD and that can be targeted during psychological treatment.

Associations between poor subjective prenatal sleep quality and postnatal depression and anxiety symptoms,"Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common during pregnancy and the postnatal period. A risk factor for mood disorders is poor sleep quality. In this study we investigate the effects of poor subjective prenatal sleep quality on postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, independent of prenatal depression or anxiety, amongst pregnant women in the general population. Methods: We analysed data from a subset of women taking part in a prospective cohort study, Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes. The participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory between 26 and 28 weeks of pregnancy (Time 1) and at 3 months postpartum (Time 2), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at Time 1. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between subjective prenatal sleep quality and postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, while adjusting for prenatal depressive/anxiety symptoms and education. Results: Although borderline-high depressive/anxiety symptoms were the strongest predictors of postnatal depressive/anxiety, independent of this, poor subjective sleep quality during pregnancy was also associated with borderline-high postnatal depressive symptoms, but not with postnatal anxiety. Limitations: Sleep quality and prenatal/postnatal mood were derived from self-reported questionnaires, which may be more susceptible to bias. Conclusion: Although treatment of symptoms of prenatal depression and anxiety will be the most important for reducing postnatal depression and anxiety, in addition to that, future studies may explore treatments improving prenatal sleep quality, particularly for women with antenatal depressive symptoms.

Overweight during childhood and internalizing symptoms in early adolescence: The mediating role of peer victimization and the desire to be thinner,"Background: Overweight is associated with depression and anxiety among adults. It is unclear whether this association begins in childhood. Overweight among children is associated with a higher risk of peer victimization, and may mediate an association between overweight and internalizing symptoms. No study has tested this hypothesis in a longitudinal population-based sample using developmental trajectories of overweight in middle childhood. Methods: Data was drawn from the population-based Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. A three-group trajectory model of overweight development (6–12 years) was previously identified using a semi-parametric group-based approach (n = 1678): “early-onset” (11.0%), “late-onset” (16.6%) and “never overweight” (72.5%). Mediation models tested the link between overweight status and child-reported depression and anxiety at 13 years via peer victimization and body dissatisfaction. Results: Children on an early-onset overweight trajectory were at increased risk for both depression (B = .318, 95% CI = .141;.496) and anxiety (B = .262, 95% CI = .09;.44) at 13 years. These direct associations were mediated by peer victimization and subsequent desire to be thinner. Children on a late-onset childhood overweight trajectory were at increased risk for both depression (B = .332, 95% CI = .187;.477) and anxiety (B = .215; 95% CI = .072;.358) at 13 years, mediated by the desire to be thinner. Limitations: We were unable to control for previous levels of body dissatisfaction. Our measure of peer victimization was not specific to weight-based teasing. Conclusions: Overweight during middle childhood increases risk of early adolescence internalizing symptoms. Peer victimization and body dissatisfaction are partly responsible for this link.

Breastfeeding and mental health in adulthood: A birth cohort study in Brazil,"Background: Breastfeeding is negatively associate with behavioral and internalization problems, psychological stress, and depressive/anxiety symptoms. However, studies evaluating specific mental health disorders are scarce. We aimed to assess the association between breastfeeding and mental health outcomes in young adults. Methods: In 1982, hospital deliveries in Pelotas (Southern Brazil) were identified; liveborns were examined and their mothers interviewed (n = 5914). Information on breastfeeding was collected in early childhood. In 2012–13, at 30 years of age, we used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for the diagnosis of major depression (MD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD). In addition, we used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Self-reported Questionnaire (SRQ-20), to evaluate depressive symptoms severity and common mental disorders (CMD), respectively. We used multivariable regression models to evaluate the association between breastfeeding and mental health outcomes. Results: We evaluated 3657 individuals. Prevalence of CMD, MD, GAD and SAD was 24.3%, 7.9%, 12.7% and 3.6%, respectively. In multivariable models the odds of having a more severe case of depression (BDI-II) was smaller among those breastfed for 6 or more months (OR = 0.69 95%CI [0.53–0.89]). We observed a similar pattern for MD and CMD, however, confidence intervals included the reference. Limitations: We had no information on home environment characteristics during childhood. Lack of power and a small effect size could explain why we did not detect an association between breastfeeding and MD. Conclusion: Breastfeeding reduced the odds of having more severe depressive symptoms.

The association between comorbid anxiety disorders and the risk of stroke among patients with diabetes: An 11-year population-based retrospective cohort study,"Background: Diabetes and anxiety disorders are independent risk factors for stroke. However, it remains unclear whether the risk of stroke is higher among diabetic patients with comorbid anxiety than without comorbid anxiety. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the association between comorbid anxiety and the risk of stroke among patients with diabetes. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study. We used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan to identify a diabetes cohort with a new diagnosis of an anxiety disorder but without a history of stroke. The enrollment period was 2001–2006 with up to 11 years of follow-up data. Comorbid anxiety was defined by both a clinical diagnosis of the DSM-IV (ICD-9-CM) and prescriptions for anxiolytic medications. Propensity score matching was performed to balance the selected confounders between the anxiety-exposed group and anxiety non-exposed group. Cox-propositional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the association between comorbid anxiety and the risk of stroke. Results: Among patients with diabetes (N = 40,846), an estimated 5.8% (N = 2374) of patients had comorbid anxiety disorders. Diabetic patients with comorbid anxiety were significantly associated with a higher risk of stroke compared to patients without comorbid anxiety (hazard ratio: 1.33, 95% confidence interval: 1.02–1.72). Limitations: The severity of anxiety or diabetes could not be measured from the claims data. Residual confounding may still exist. Conclusion: A significantly elevated risk of stroke was observed in association with comorbid anxiety among patients with diabetes. Psychiatrists should consider routine screening for anxiety disorders to prevent a stroke event among patients with diabetes.

Psychometric properties of the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) among psychiatric outpatients,"Background: The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) is a brief, transdiagnostic measure used to assess anxiety severity and related interference. The OASIS has demonstrated strong psychometric properties in previous investigations, however, it has yet to be validated using a transdiagnostic clinician-rated measure. Methods: We evaluated the factor structure, convergent and discriminant validity, and illness severity cut-scores of the OASIS in a sample of outpatients (N = 202). Results: A confirmatory factor analysis indicated an unidimensional structure provided the best fit. The OASIS demonstrated good convergent validity and internal consistency. Using the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S), ROC curves showed OASIS scores of 6, 10 and 12 to indicate moderate, marked and severe illness severity, respectively. Conclusions: The OASIS is a unidimensional self-report measure with good convergent validity and data from the current study provide illness severity cut-scores.

Brain structural anomalies in borderline and avoidant personality disorder patients and their associations with disorder-specific symptoms,"Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) are characterized by hyper-reactivity to negatively-perceived interpersonal cues, yet they differ in degree of affective instability. Recent work has begun to elucidate the neural (structural and functional) and cognitive-behavioral underpinnings of BPD, although some initial studies of brain structure have reached divergent conclusions. AvPD, however, has been almost unexamined in the cognitive neuroscience literature. Methods: In the present study we investigated group differences among 29 BPD patients, 27 AvPD patients, and 29 healthy controls (HC) in structural brain volumes using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in five anatomically-defined regions of interest: amygdala, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We also examined the relationship between individual differences in brain structure and self-reported anxiety and affective instability in each group. Results: We observed reductions in MPFC and ACC volume in BPD relative to HC, with no significant difference among patient groups. No group differences in amygdala volume were found. However, BPD and AvPD patients each showed a positive relationship between right amygdala volume and state-related anxiety. By contrast, in HC there was an inverse relationship between MPFC volume and state and trait-related anxiety as well as between bilateral DLPFC volume and affective instability. Limitations: Current sample sizes did not permit examination of gender effects upon structure-symptom correlations. Conclusions: These results shed light on potentially protective, or compensatory, aspects of brain structure in these populations–namely, relatively reduced amygdala volume or relatively enhanced MPFC and DLPFC volume.

Suicidal ideation in youth with tic disorders,"Background: This study examined the incidence and clinical correlates of suicidal ideation (SI) in youth with tic disorders (TD). The independent contribution of tics, anxiety, depressive and externalizing symptoms on SI severity in youth with TD was assessed. Method: Participants were 75 treatment-seeking youth with a TD ( N = 75) aged 6–18. Participants completed diagnostic assessments, clinician-ratings, self- and parent-report measures of emotional functioning and the presence and/or severity of suicidal ideation. Results: Based on youth-report, 61% of youth endorsed at least some symptoms of SI, and 8% endorsed symptoms that exceeded the clinically significant cut-off. Parents reported SI in 11% of cases, with generally poor agreement between parent- and youth-report. Suicidal ideation correlated with higher anxiety, depressive and externalizing symptoms, affective lability, and with poorer distress tolerance and overall functioning. Anxiety, depressive and externalizing symptoms showed an independent relationship with SI. Tic severity was not associated with SI. Rather, higher tic severity was associated with an increase in anxiety symptoms, which in turn, was associated with greater SI severity. Limitations: Cross-sectional data limits causal conclusions. Diagnosis was based on unstructured assessments by expert clinicians, including consensus diagnosis, rather than structured clinical interviews. Conclusions: Around 8–11% of youth with TD experienced SI. Tic severity did not have any direct influence on SI, however the presence of comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms significantly increases this risk. Results suggest that it is psychiatric comorbidity, rather than tics themselves, that predispose youth with tic disorders to increased risk of suicidality.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms add risk to circadian rhythm sleep problems in depression and anxiety,"Background: Comorbid ADHD symptoms may partly account for circadian rhythm disturbances in depression and anxiety disorders. Methods: Self-reported sleep characteristics of 2090 participants in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were assessed using the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. We defined 3 groups: healthy controls (HC), persons with lifetime depression and/or anxiety disorders (LDA), and those with both LDA and high ADHD symptoms (LDA + ADHD), using the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale. Results: Sleep characteristics were least favorable in the LDA + ADHD group. Important group differences between LDA + ADHD, LDA and HC were found for extremely late chronotype (12% vs. 5% vs. 3%; p &lt; .001), sleep duration &lt; 6h (15% vs. 5% vs. 4%; p &lt; .001), and for an indication of the Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS; 16% vs. 8% vs. 5%; p &lt; .001). After adjustment for covariates, including depression and anxiety, presence of ADHD symptoms increased the odds ratio for late chronotype (OR = 2.6; p = .003), indication of DSPS (OR = 2.4; p = .002), and sleep duration &lt; 6h (OR = 2.7; p = .007). Limitations: ADHD conceptually overlaps with symptom presentation of depression and anxiety. We used a cross-sectional study design, and used self reported sleep characteristics. Conclusions: High ADHD symptoms were associated with an increased rate of circadian rhythm sleep disturbances in an already at-risk population of people with depression and/or anxiety disorders. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders, as often seen in ADHD are not entirely due to any comorbid depression and/or anxiety disorder. Adequate treatment of such sleep problems is needed and may prevent serious health conditions in the long term.

Perinatal anxiety disorder prevalence and incidence,"Background: Anxiety and related disorders (AD) disproportionately affect women, and are the most prevalent of all mental health conditions. The current research represents the first study of maternal postpartum AD prevalence in which all of the AD are assessed, and one of few studies of this type in which maternal prenatal AD incidence is assessed. Methods: A Canadian sample of pregnant women (N = 310) was recruited from a defined geographical area between November 2007 and November 2010. Participants were first administered postnatal mood and anxiety screening measures. Those who scored at or above cutoff on one or more of these measures were administered a diagnostic interview for depression and anxiety at approximately three months postpartum ( n = 115). Findings from the diagnostic interview were used to estimate the prevalence and incidence of mood and AD in pregnancy, as well as at and during the first three months postpartum. Period prevalence and incidence estimates were obtained retrospectively from interview data collected postnatally. Results: The prevalence of AD during pregnancy and the early postpartum period (15.8% and 17.1% respectively) exceeded that of depression (3.9% and 4.8% respectively). The prevalence of OCD in our sample exceeded that of OCD among adults aged 18–64. Parity was unrelated to AD prevalence. Slightly less than 5% of participants were comorbid for both AD, and depression. Limitations: This study is limited by a relatively small sample size for a prevalence study, and non-random sample selection. As only women who scored above cutoff on one or more screening measures were interviewed, prevalence estimates are conservative. Finally, prenatal prevalence estimates are based on retrospective report provided postpartum. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that, as a group, anxiety and related conditions affect a significant proportion of postpartum women, and are more prevalent than is postpartum depression.

The oral health of people with anxiety and depressive disorders—A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Many psychological disorders are associated with comorbid physical illness. There are less data on dental disease in common psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety in spite of risk factors in this population of diet, lifestyle or antidepressant-induced dry mouth. Methods: We undertook a systematic search for studies of the oral health of people with common psychological disorders including depression, anxiety and dental phobia. We searched MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE and article bibliographies. Results were compared with the general population. Outcomes included partial or total tooth-loss, periodontal disease, and dental decay measured through standardized measures such as the mean number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) or surfaces (DMFS). Results: There were 19 papers on depression and/or anxiety, and seven on dental phobia/anxiety (total n = 26). These covered 334,503 subjects. All the psychiatric diagnoses were associated with increased dental decay on both DMFT and DMFS scores, as well as greater tooth loss (OR = 1.22; 95%CI = 1.14–1.30). There was no association with periodontal disease, except for panic disorder. Limitations: Cross-sectional design of included studies, heterogeneity in some results, insufficient studies to test for publication bias. Conclusion: The increased focus on the physical health of psychiatric patients should encompass oral health including closer collaboration between dental and medical practitioners. Possible interventions include oral health assessment using standard checklists that can be completed by non-dental personnel, help with oral hygiene, management of iatrogenic dry mouth, and early dental referral. Mental health clinicians should also be aware of the oral consequences of inappropriate diet and psychotropic medication.

Transdiagnostic computerised cognitive behavioural therapy for depression and anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"An increasing number of computerised transdiagnostic cognitive behavioural therapy programs (TD-cCBT) have been developed in the past decade, but there are no meta-analyses to explore the efficacy of these programs, nor moderators of the effects. The current meta-analysis focused on studies evaluating TD-cCBT interventions to examine their effects on anxiety, depression and quality of life (QOL). Results from 17 RCTs showed computerised TD-cCBT outperformed control conditions on all outcome measures at post-treatment, with large effect sizes for depression ( g's = .84), and medium effect sizes for anxiety ( g = .78) and QOL ( g = .48). RCT quality was generally good, although heterogeneity was moderate to high. Further analyses revealed that studies comparing TD-cCBT to waitlist controls had the largest differences ( g = .93) compared to active ( g = .59) and usual care control groups ( g = .37) on anxiety outcomes, but there was no influence of control group subtype on depression outcomes. Treatment length, symptom target (mixed versus anxiety only), treatment design (standardised versus tailored), and therapist experience (students versus qualified therapists) did not influence the results. Preliminary evidence from 4 comparisons with disorder-specific treatments suggests transdiagnostic treatments are as effective for reducing anxiety, and there may be small but superior outcomes for TD-cCBT programs for reducing depression ( g = .21) and improving QOL ( g = .21) compared to disorder-specific cCBT. These findings show that TD-cCBT programs are efficacious, and have comparable effects to disorder-specific cCBT programs.

The structure and intensity of self-reported autonomic arousal symptoms across anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background: Heightened autonomic arousal symptoms (AAS) are assumed to be a central feature of anxiety disorders. However, it is unclear whether the magnitude and profile of AAS vary across anxiety disorders and whether heightened AAS characterises obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Aims: We sought to determine whether the intensity and structure of AAS varied across anxiety disorders and OCD. Method: A sample of 459 individuals with a primary anxiety disorder or OCD were administered the Symptom Checklist-90R. Nine items referring to prototypic AAS were included in a latent class analysis. Results: A 2-class solution (high and low AAS classes) best fitted the data. Participants comprising the high AAS class scored uniformly high across all assessed AAS symptoms. Older age and the presence of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder predicted membership in the high AAS class. No OCD symptom dimension was significantly associated with membership in the high AAS class. Limitation: AAS were assessed using a self-report measure and replication is needed using other methodologies. Conclusions: These findings suggest that OCD may be sufficiently distinct from anxiety disorders and do not support subtyping of anxiety disorders on the basis of the predominant type of AAS. Therapeutic approaches that target AAS might best be applied in the treatment of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

Vigilance-avoidance and disengagement are differentially associated with fear and avoidant behaviors in social anxiety,"Background: Individuals with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) often exhibit preferential attention for social threat, demonstrating abnormal orientation to threat (i.e., vigilance-avoidance) and/or difficulty disengaging from threat. However, no research has compared the relationship between attention indices (i.e., vigilance-avoidance, difficulty disengaging from threat) and characteristic features of the disorder such as fear during social situations (social fear) and avoidant behaviors (social avoidance). Method: To address this issue, seventy adults (19.29 ± 1.47 years, 33 females) were separated into low (n = 37) or high (n = 33) socially anxious groups using clinical cutoff scores on the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS). Participants in both groups completed a dot-probe task with congruent, incongruent, and neutral trials to obtain measures of vigilance-avoidance and difficulty disengaging. Using linear regression, we examined the associations each attention index shared with self-reported social fear and social avoidance. Results: Exclusively in the high anxious group, greater vigilance towards threat was associated with higher self-reported social fear, but not with social avoidance. However, difficulty disengaging was not associated with either social measure. In the low anxiety group, no relationships between attention indices and either social measure emerged. Limitations: Future research with clinical samples is necessary to replicate and extend these findings. The small sample size studied may have limited our ability to detect other smaller effects. Conclusions: Indices of attention bias may contribute differently to the etiology and maintenance of SAD, which offers important implications for novel treatments that target attention.

Negative perceptions of ageing predict the onset and persistence of depression and anxiety: Findings from a prospective analysis of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA),"Background: Although there is a growing literature on the adverse health outcomes related with negative ageing perceptions, studies on their association with mental disorders such as depression and anxiety are scarce. Thus, the aim of the current study was to prospectively assess the association between negative ageing perceptions and incident/persistent depression and anxiety using nationally representative data from Ireland. Methods: Data from two consecutive waves of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) were analysed. The analytical sample consisted of 6095 adults aged ≥ 50 years. Validated scales for negative ageing perceptions, depression, and anxiety were used. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between negative ageing perceptions at baseline and the onset and persistence of depression and anxiety at two-year follow up. Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, negative ageing perceptions at baseline predicted the new onset of depression and anxiety at follow-up. Among those with depression or anxiety at baseline, negative ageing perceptions also predicted the persistence of these conditions at follow-up. Limitations: Baseline data on negative ageing perceptions were used for the analysis and it is possible that scores could have changed over time. Conclusions: Addressing negative perceptions towards ageing by developing interventions that activate positive ageing perceptions, and target societal attitudes by means of policy change, public campaigns, and community education programmes, may shift social perceptions and reduce the burden of depression and anxiety among the elderly.

Maternal prenatal stress and infant emotional reactivity six months postpartum,"Background: Maternal prenatal stress has been related to infant negative affect. However, it is still unclear how different sources of maternal prenatal stress such as depressive, anxiety and pregnancy-specific anxiety symptoms are associated with reactivity outcomes. This study aimed to test the associations between different sources of maternal prenatal stress and the aspects of infant emotional reactivity at six months. Method: Our study population (n = 282) was drawn from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. Prenatal stress was measured by questionnaires on maternal depression, general anxiety and pregnancy-specific anxiety at three time points across pregnancy (gwk 14, 24, 34). Based on the symptom scores, the sample was divided into mothers with high stress during pregnancy (n = 110) and mothers with low stress during pregnancy (n = 172). Mother-reported infant emotional reactivity and its subscales were measured six months postpartum. Results: After controlling for background variables and maternal postnatal symptoms, overall negative emotional reactivity (β = 0.20, p &lt; 0.01), and its aspects fearfulness (β = 0.15, p = .057) and falling reactivity (β = −0.22, p &lt; 0.01), were predicted by only pregnancy-specific anxiety. No significant predictors were found for infant positive reactivity after adjusting for confounders. Limitations: Mother reports of both maternal symptoms and infant reactivity were used, which might increase the risk of reporting bias. Conclusions: The findings suggest that mothers experiencing stress should be provided intervention during pregnancy, and that screening should have a particular focus on pregnancy-related worries.

Taxonicity and network structure of generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder: An admixture analysis and complex network analysis,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 242 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2018-48747-023). In the methods section, the original description of the network estimation procedure should be changed to reflect that the glasso procedure was not used. An updated sentence is provided.] Background: Recent years have witnessed sustained efforts to delineate the nosology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), especially in light of its substantial comorbidity with major depressive disorder (MDD). Traditional diagnostic conceptualizations regard these disorders as categorically distinct; however, extant literature attests to appreciable similarities. The application of admixture analyses and complex network analyses has become more prevalent in recent years to investigate the presence of meaningful subgroups in mental disorders and to address qualitative similarity in network structure across disorders. To date, no studies have extended these analytic techniques to determine whether GAD and MDD constitute independent syndromes. The current study used a clinical sample comprising individuals diagnosed with primary GAD or primary MDD to examine potential subgroups and network structure using symptoms of each disorder as indicators. Methods: The current sample comprised 111 individuals who received primary diagnoses of either GAD or MDD and completed a battery of assessments related to anxiety and depression. Results: Results of the admixture analyses converged on a single class solution, suggesting that individuals with GAD derive from the same population as those with MDD. Furthermore, results of the complex network analyses did not reveal differences in centrality parameters across disorders, suggesting qualitative similarity. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of this study precludes conclusions about the temporal and causal dynamics of these disorders Conclusion: GAD and MDD exhibit robust similarities, as evidenced by the converging results of the admixture analyses and complex network analyses. This conclusion complements the findings of transdiagnostic research, which has identified common mechanisms underlying multiple emotional disorders.

Prevalence and risk factors for comorbid postpartum depressive symptomatology and anxiety,"Background: To date, little is known about the prevalence and risk factors for comorbid postpartum depression and anxiety. The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of comorbid depressive symptomatology and anxiety during the first 8 weeks postpartum and to identify risk factors. Methods: As part of a longitudinal study conducted in a health region near Vancouver, British Columbia, a sample of 522 women completed mailed questionnaires at 1, 4, and 8 weeks postpartum. The presence of comorbid postpartum depressive symptomatology and anxiety was defined as having an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of ≥10 and a State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-state anxiety score of ≥40 at the same time point. Risk factors associated with comorbidity were examined using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results: The prevalence of comorbid depressive symptomatology and anxiety was 13.1% during the first 8 weeks postpartum. In multivariable analysis, immigration within past 5 years (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 8.03, 95% CI 3.43–18.77), maternal vulnerable personality (AOR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.02–1.97 for 1 SD increase), child care stress (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.18–2.35 for 1 SD increase) and perceived stress (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI 2.01–4.47 for 1 SD increase) predicted a higher risk of comorbidity. Conversely, high breastfeeding self-efficacy (AOR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.49–0.88 for 1 SD increase), maternal self-esteem (AOR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.45–0.97 for 1 SD increase), and partner support (AOR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.55–0.98 for 1 SD increase) were associated with a lower risk of developing comorbidity. Limitation: In this study, women who were single or from non-Caucasian ethnic groups were underrepresented. Conclusions: Comorbid postpartum depressive symptomatology and anxiety is a common condition with little known about risk factors. Additional research is warranted to develop strategies to reliably identify women with this comorbid condition and to determine effective treatment options.

Validation of screening tools for depression and anxiety disorders in a primary care population with high HIV prevalence in Zimbabwe,"Background: In low income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa there are few validated tools to screen for common disabling mental disorders such as depression and general anxiety disorder (GAD). Objectives: We validated three screening tools: the Shona Symptom Questionnaire for common mental disorders (SSQ-14), the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7). The study participants were attendees at a primary health care clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe. Methods: Consecutive adults aged 18 and above attending the clinic were enrolled over a two-week period in September 2013. Trained research assistants administered the screening tools to eligible participants after obtaining written consent. Participants were then interviewed by one of four psychiatrists using the Structured Clinical Interview of the DSM-IV (SCID). Performance characteristics were calculated for each tool, against the SCID as the gold standard. Results: A total of 264 participants were enrolled, of whom 52 (20%) met the SCID criteria for depression alone, 97 (37%) for mixed depression and anxiety and 9 (3%) for anxiety alone. Of the 237 where HIV status was known, 165 (70%) were HIV positive. With the optimal cutoff of ≥9, the sensitivity and specificity for the SSQ-14 against a diagnosis of either depression and/or general anxiety were 84% (95%CI:78–89%) and 73% (95%CI:63–81%) respectively. Internal reliability was high (Cronbach α = 0.74). The optimal cutoff for PHQ-9 was ≥11, which provided a sensitivity of 85% (95%CI:78-90%) and specificity of 69% (95%CI:59–77%) against a SCID diagnosis of depression (Cronbach α = 0.86). The GAD-7 (optimal cutoff ≥10) had sensitivity and specificity of 89% (95%CI:81–94%) and 73% (95%CI:65–80%) respectively against a SCID diagnosis of GAD (Cronbach α = 0.87). Conclusion: Screening tools for depression and GAD had good performance characteristics in a primary health care population in Zimbabwe with a high prevalence of HIV.

Affective temperaments and suicidal ideation and behavior in mood and anxiety disorder patients,"Background: Clinical characteristics proposed to be associated with suicidal risk include affective temperament types. We tested this proposal with two methods in a large sample of subjects with mood and anxiety disorders. Methods: We assessed consecutive, consenting subjects clinically for affective temperament types and by TEMPS-A self-ratings for associations of temperament with suicidal ideation and acts, using standard bivariate methods, and multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Among 2561 subjects (major depressive, 1171; bipolar, 919, anxiety disorders, 471), temperament-types and TEMPS-A (39-item Italian version) subscale scores differed by risk of suicidal acts or ideation. Suicidal acts and ideation were most associated with cyclothymic and dysthymic, and less with hyperthymic temperaments. These associations were sustained by multivariate modeling that included diagnosis, age, sex, and diagnosis. Limitations: Not all subjects completed TEMPS-A self-ratings; clinical assessments of temperaments were not standardized, and long-term stability of temperament assessments was not tested. Conclusions: The findings support and extend associations of cyclothymic-dysthymic temperaments with suicidal acts and ideation, whereas hyperthymic temperament may be protective.

Longitudinal course of ante- and postpartum generalized anxiety symptoms and associated factors in West-African women from Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire,"Background: Little is known about the course of perinatal anxiety, particularly in low and middle income countries. This study aimed at examining trajectories of ante- and postpartum generalized anxiety symptoms in West-African women and their associations with mother and child characteristics. Methods: 778 women from Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana were investigated between 04/2010 and 03/2014. Anxiety symptoms were measured using the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) at three months antepartum and three, 12 and 24 months postpartum. Growth mixture modeling was applied to identify latent trajectory classes of anxiety. Multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate the associations of psychosocial, sociodemographic, obstetric and clinical characteristics with different trajectories. Results: Four distinct trajectories of anxiety were identified. The majority of women (79.8%) had consistent low anxiety symptoms, while 11.4% had elevated anxiety scores before and around childbirth that decreased gradually. 5.4% of women showed increasing anxiety symptoms over time. Few women (3.3%) had transient anxiety with elevated scores at three and 12 months postpartum. Risk factors for elevated anxiety levels around childbirth were antepartum depressive symptoms, higher levels of stress (economic, marital and social stress), lower child birth weight, and multiparity. Partner support was found to be protective. Limitations: Anxiety symptoms were assessed using a screening instrument and not through a formal diagnostic classification system. Some putative risk factors were not investigated, and some psychosocial factors were assessed retrospectively. Conclusion: The presence of different trajectories underline the importance of monitoring anxiety symptoms in pregnant women and in mothers with infants/toddlers.

Pregnancy-related anxiety: Evidence of distinct clinical significance from a prospective longitudinal study,"Background: Pregnancy-related anxiety (PrA) has attracted considerable research attention, but questions remain about its distinctiveness from conventional constructs and measures. In a high psychosocial risk, ethnically diverse sample, we examine the degree to which PrA is distinct from continuous and diagnostic measures of anxiety and worry in terms of longitudinal course, associations with psychosocial and perinatal risk, and prediction of postnatal mood disturbance. Methods: 345 women oversampled for prenatal anxiety and depression were selected from an urban obstetrics clinic serving a predominantly low-income, ethnically diverse population. PrA was assessed at 20 and 32 weeks gestation; anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed from questionnaire and from clinical interview at 20 and 32 weeks gestation and again at 2 and 6 months postnatally. Data relevant to psychosocial and obstetric risks were ascertained from interview, medical exam, and chart review. Results: Two distinct factors of PrA were identified, indexing specific concerns about the child's health and about the birth; these two PrA factors showed distinct longitudinal patterns in the prenatal period, and modest associations with general measures of anxiety and depression from questionnaire and clinical interview. PrA was also distinguished from conventional symptom measures in its associated features and prediction of birth weight and postnatal mood. Limitations: The sample was at high psychosocial risk and ethnically diverse; findings may not generalize to other samples. Conclusions: PrA can be distinguished from general measures of anxiety in pregnancy in terms of longitudinal course, associated features, and prediction to postnatal mood disturbance, and may warrant specific clinical attention.

The effectiveness of simple psychological and physical activity interventions for high prevalence mental health problems in young people: A factorial randomised controlled trial,"Background: The prevalence and burden of disease of depression and anxiety disorders in young people necessitates effective early intervention strategies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-intensity interventions (problem solving therapy (PST) and physical activity promotion) in young people (15–25 years) with mild-moderate depression and/or anxiety. Method: A 2 × 2 factorial randomised controlled trial (RCT) with factors of PST versus supportive counselling (control) and behavioural activation physical activity versus lifestyle psychoeducation (control). Help-seeking participants (n=176) were randomised to receive up to 6 manualised intervention sessions. Primary outcomes were post-intervention depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), anxiety symptoms (Beck Anxiety Inventory), and Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)). Trial registration ACTRN12608000550303. Results: Depression symptoms were significantly reduced in the physical activity group compared to psychoeducation (BDI-II: d = 0.41 (95% CI: 0.07–0.76); MADRS: d = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.13–0.82), but not post-intervention anxiety symptoms. PST was not superior to supportive counselling, nor were any interactions between interventions significant. Limitations: As self reported levels of physical activity did not significantly differ between baseline and end-point in those randomised to the physical activity intervention, it is unclear as to whether some form of physical activity not measured in the trial may have led to the difference in depression symptoms. Conclusions: PST was not superior to supportive counselling in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms in young people. Participants who received the physical activity intervention reported the greatest reduction in depression symptoms, however further research is required to establish the mechanism of action and to determine its effectiveness as an adjunct intervention in routine clinical practice.

Cluster randomised controlled trial of the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program in schools,"Background: Anxiety is a common mental health problem in youth. The current study aimed to test the effectiveness of an online self-directed anxiety prevention program in a school-based sample and to compare two methods of implementing an anxiety program in schools. Methods: A three-arm cluster stratified randomised controlled trial was conducted with 30 Australian schools. Each school was randomly assigned to receive: (1) externally-supported intervention, (2) teacher-supported intervention, or (3) wait-list control. All consenting students ( N = 1767) were invited to complete pre-intervention, post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-up questionnaires measuring generalised anxiety, social anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, depressive symptoms and mental wellbeing. Intervention participants completed the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program over 6 weeks. Results: At post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-up no significant differences were observed between the intervention and control conditions for generalised anxiety (Cohen's d = −0.14 to 0.15), social anxiety ( d = 0.04–0.23), anxiety sensitivity ( d = −0.07 to 0.07), depressive symptoms ( d = −0.05 to 0.04) or mental wellbeing ( d = −0.06 to −0.30). Limitations: The current study only included self-report measures that may have been influenced by situational factors or biases. Conclusions: The e-couch Anxiety and Worry program did not have a significant positive effect on participant mental health or wellbeing. The addition of a mental health education officer to support classroom teachers in the delivery of the program also had no effect on intervention outcomes. Future prevention research should look to develop briefer and more interactive interventions that are more engaging for youth.

Stress reactivity predicts symptom improvement in children with anxiety disorders,"Background: We examined the longitudinal associations of autonomic nervous system (ANS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis rest and reactivity measures with anxiety and depressive symptoms at one-year follow-up in children with anxiety disorders. Methods: In a clinical sample of 152 children with a primary DSM-IV anxiety disorder, aged 8 to 12 years, anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed with the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children and the Children's Depression Inventory at pre-treatment baseline and one year later, after treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy. At baseline, children participated in a 70 min stress task. Salivary cortisol was measured directly prior to and 20min post stress task. Skin conductance level (SCL), heart rate and high frequency heart rate variability (HRV) were continuously measured during rest and the stress task. To investigate if rest or reactivity measures predicted anxiety and depressive symptoms at one year follow-up, linear regression analyses were conducted for rest and reactivity measures of SCL, heart rate, HRV and cortisol separately. Results: Higher SCL reactivity predicted less decrease of anxiety symptoms at one-year follow-up. Cortisol reactivity showed a weak association with depressive symptoms at one-year follow-up: lower cortisol reactivity predicted less decrease in depressive symptoms. Limitations: Only self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms were used. However, all predictors were objective biological measures, hence there is no risk of shared method variance bias. Conclusions: These findings suggest that pre-treatment HPA and ANS responsiveness to stress are predictive biomarkers for a lack of symptom improvement in children with a clinical anxiety disorder.

"Insulin receptor sensitizer, dicholine succinate, prevents both Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) upregulation and affective changes induced by a high-cholesterol diet in mice","Background: High cholesterol intake in mice induces hepatic lipid dystrophy and inflammation, signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, and the up-regulation of brain and liver Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4). Here, we investigated whether dicholine succinate (DS), an insulin receptor sensitizer and mitochondrial complex II substrate would interact with these effects. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were given a 0.2%-cholesterol diet for 3 weeks, alone or along with oral DS administration, or a control feed. Outcomes included behavioral measures of anxiety/depression, and Tlr4 and peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-gamma coactivator-1b (PPARGC1b) expression. Results: 50mg/kg DS treatment for 3 weeks partially ameliorated the cholesterol-induced anxiety- and depressive-like changes. Mice were next treated at the higher dose (180 mg/kg), either for the 3-week period of dietary intervention, or for the last two weeks. Three-week DS administration normalized behaviors in the forced swim and O-maze tests and abolished the Tlr4 up-regulation in the brain and liver. The delayed, 2-week DS treatment had similar effects on Tlr4 expression and largely rescued the above-mentioned behaviors. Suppression of PPARGC1b, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, by the high cholesterol diet, was prevented with the 3-week administration, and markedly diminished by the a 2-week administration of DS. None of treatments prevented hepatic dystrophy and triglyceride accumulation. Limitations: Other conditions have to be tested to define possible limitations of reported effects of DS. Conclusions: DS treatment did not alter the patho-morphological substrates of NAFLD syndrome in mice, but ameliorated its molecular and behavioral consequences, likely by activating mitochondrial functions and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

Determinants of maternal antenatal state-anxiety in mid-pregnancy: Role of maternal feelings about the pregnancy,"Background: The current state of research into antenatal anxiety is lacking in a comprehensive understanding of determinants. This study aims to expand knowledge in this area, with the main objective being to determine potential determinants of maternal antenatal state-anxiety. Methods: Data used for this cross-sectional study were obtained from the Prenatal Health Project: a population cohort study of 2357 women in London, Ontario. 1992 women in their second trimester met inclusion criteria for this study. The primary hypothesis was that “feelings about the pregnancy” would be a determinant of antenatal state-anxiety after controlling for other potential covariates. The abbreviated version of the Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure state-anxiety. Univariate analyses and multiple linear regression were performed to identify variables predictive of state-anxiety. Results: Stress, feeling unsure/unhappy about the pregnancy and having low self-esteem, low mastery and low social support from one’s partner and family were statistically significant determinants of state-anxiety during the second trimester. In addition, anxiety was found to be inversely related to gestational age. Limitations: The two main limitations of the study were the use of a self-report screening tool (STAI) as the measure of anxious symptoms rather than a clinical diagnosis, and possible recall bias of feelings about the pregnancy. Conclusions: We concluded that how a woman feels about her pregnancy was a determinant of state-anxiety. This study contributes knowledge aiming to help women improve their mental health during pregnancy by identifying important determinants of state-anxiety.

An evolutionary perspective on the co-occurrence of social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder,"Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) commonly co-occurs with, and often precedes, Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). In this paper, we address the relationship between SAD and AUD by considering how natural selection left socially anxious individuals vulnerable to alcohol use, and by addressing the underlying mechanisms. We review research suggesting that social anxiety has evolved for the regulation of behaviors involved in reducing the likelihood or consequences of threats to social status. The management of potential threats to social standing is important considering that these threats can result in reduced cooperation or ostracism—and therefore to reduced access to coalitional partners, resources or mates. Alcohol exerts effects upon evolutionarily conserved emotion circuits, and can down-regulate or block anxiety (or may be expected to do so). As such, the ingestion of alcohol can artificially signal the absence or successful management of social threats. In turn, alcohol use may be reinforced in socially anxious people because of this reduction in subjective malaise, and because it facilitates social behaviors – particularly in individuals for whom the persistent avoidance of social situations poses its own threat (i.e., difficulty finding mates). Although the frequent co-occurrence of SAD and AUD is associated with poorer treatment outcomes than either condition alone, a richer understanding of the biological and psychosocial drives underlying susceptibility to alcohol use among socially anxious individuals may improve the efficacy of therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing or treating this comorbidity.

Barriers to access and participation in community mental health treatment for anxious children,"Background: Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among children in the United States; yet many children do not receive treatment due to barriers to treatment access and participation. This study examined common barriers to treatment access and participation among anxious children who participated in computer-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy. Differences in barriers reported by treatment completers/non-completers were examined, as was the association with sociodemographic characteristics, anxiety severity, and impairment. The impact of barriers on treatment response was assessed, as well as the relationship with treatment expectancy and satisfaction. Method: Barriers to access and participation, demographics, anxiety severity/impairment, treatment credibility and satisfaction were assessed among parents and children with anxiety ( N = 100; ages 7–13) who were enrolled in a community-based randomized clinical trial. Results: The most common access barrier was parents not knowing where or from whom to seek services (66%). Differences among completers and non-completers were related to stigma, confidentiality, and costs. The most common parent-reported barrier to participating was stress (32.4%) and child-reported barrier to participation was not having enough time to complete homework (22.1%). Of the sociodemographic, clinical and treatment characteristics, minority status, satisfaction, and treatment response were associated with barriers to treatment participation, although these associations varied by barriers related to treatment and external factors. Limitations: Cross sectional design and lack of well-established psychometric properties for barriers measures were limitations. Conclusion: Findings suggest that accessible, time-efficient, cost-effective service delivery methods that minimize stigma and maximize engagement when delivering evidence-based treatment for pediatric anxiety are needed.

Prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the primary health clinic attendees in Kuwait,"Background: A substantial proportion of primary clinic attendees suffer from psychiatric disorders and many of them are neither recognized nor adequately treated by primary clinic physicians. Objectives: To determine the point prevalence of, and identify risk factors for, depression, anxiety, and somatisation disorder in the primary health clinics in the country. Method: The Physical Health Questionnaires (PHQ-SADs), were administered to a randomized sample of 1046 primary clinic attendees in all the five governorates of the country over a 5-month period. The descriptive data were computed with chi-square tests while the association of demographic characteristics with psychiatric disorders was determined with the logistic regression test. Results: 42.7% of the our patients suffered from psychiatric disorders including depressive (22.9%), anxiety (17.7%), and somatization (33.4%) disorder. Comorbidity between the three disorders was found in 20.4% of the sample; 11% had two and 10.4% had all three disorders. The Kuwaiti nationals, female gender, older age group subjects and those with lower level of education were more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorder. Limitations: The inter-rater reliability may have affected the results as large number of physicians were responsible for administering the questionnaires. Moreover, the study did not include eating and substance-abuse disorders and the findings were limited to detection of somatization, depression, and anxiety disorders. Conclusions: In order to ensure timely provision of appropriate treatment, the primary care physicians need adequate information on different forms of presentation, and basic front line treatment, of the common mental disorders at the primary care level.

Diagnostic instability of recurrence and the impact on recurrence rates in depressive and anxiety disorders,"Background: Despite increasing evidence for the diagnostic instability between and within depressive and anxiety disorders, most studies report solely on the recurrence rates of the specific index disorders. Neglecting this evidence has an inherent risk of underestimating recurrence rates of depressive and anxiety disorders. This study investigates the impact of diagnostic instability of recurrence rates in depression and anxiety. Methods: Data were derived from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). The sample of 656 participants had a panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder or dysthymia, and a subsequent remission. Recurrence rates of index disorders (diagnostically stable recurrence) and newly arisen anxiety or depressive disorders (diagnostically unstable recurrence), were calculated over a 4-year follow-up period. Results: In anxiety disorders (n = 281), the recurrence rate is more than doubled, from 23.8% with a stable recurrence, to 54.8%, when diagnostically unstable recurrences are included. In depressive disorders (N = 173) the recurrence rate increases from 37.6% to 49.7%, and in comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders (N = 202) the diagnostically unstable recurrences increase from 54.0% to 66.3%. Limitations: Attrition during follow up may have biased the results; remission was defined as absence of symptoms for 1 month; very short-term remission and recurrence patterns were not assessed. Conclusions: Diagnostically unstable recurrences have a significant impact on recurrence rates, with the greatest instability for anxiety disorders. When only diagnostically stable recurrences are assessed, recurrence rates are highly underrated and provide biased estimates of the true course of these disorders.

Postpartum anxiety and adjustment disorders in parents of infants with very low birth weight: Cross-sectional results from a controlled multicentre cohort study,"Background: Both preterm delivery and survival rates of very low birth weight (VLBW: &lt;1500 g) infants are increasing. To date, the focus on studies about postpartum mental health after preterm birth has been on depression and on women. There is a paucity of research regarding prevalence, risks, and predictors of postpartum anxiety in parents after VLBW birth. Methods: Parents with VLBW infants and parents with term infants were recruited into the longitudinal HaFEn-study at the three largest centers of perinatal care in Hamburg, Germany. State anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory and anxiety and adjustment disorders with a clinical interview one month postpartum. Psychiatric lifetime diagnoses, social support, trait anxiety, stress during birth, socioeconomic status, risks during pregnancy, and mode of delivery were also evaluated. To examine predictors of postpartum state anxiety in both parents simultaneously a multiple random coefficient model was used. Results: 230 mothers and 173 fathers were included. The risk for minor/major anxiety symptoms and adjustment disorders was higher in parents with VLBW infants compared to the term group. The risk for anxiety disorders was not higher in parents with VLBW infants. The most important predictors for postpartum state anxiety were high trait anxiety, the birth of a VLBW infant, high stress during birth, and low social support. Limitations: Data reported here are cross-sectional. Thus, temporal relationships cannot be established. Conclusions: Our results emphasize the importance of early screening for postpartum anxiety in both parents with VLBW infants.

Pre-attentive dysfunction of musical processing in major depressive disorder: A mismatch negativity study,"Background: Deficits of pre-attentive information processing have been frequently found in patients with major depressive disorder, nevertheless the results are quite inconsistent due to clinical heterogeneity and methodological difference. Cognitive processing of music is a useful tool for investigating human cognition and its underlying brain mechanisms. Although general auditory processing and perception of musical sound are hampered in patients with MDD, whether the deficits in musical processing begin from pre-attentive stage is not well investigated yet. The present study aimed to investigate the MMN of musical sound in patients with MDD. Method: MMN responses to different musical features were compared in 20 patients with MDD and 20 age-matched healthy controls. The multi-feature paradigm was used to examine automatic change detection of six different musical sound features (pitch, timbre, location, intensity, slide, rhythm) in a complex musical context. Severity of depression and co-morbid anxiety were evaluated using the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (HRSD-17) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA). Results: MMNs were obtained with all deviants. The timbre-MMN was significantly larger in MDD patients than in healthy controls, while the other deviants (pitch, location, intensity, slide and rhythm) elicited similar MMN across groups. For MDD patients, the amplitudes and latencies of MMNs did not correlate with severity of depression or co-morbid anxiety. Limitations: The sample size in this study is relatively small. Conclusion: Patients with MDD do not perform at the same level as controls in automatic change detection of timbre. This dysfunction is considered to be a trait-dependent feature of MDD.

GROUPS 4 HEALTH: Evidence that a social-identity intervention that builds and strengthens social group membership improves mental health,"Background: Social isolation and disconnection have profound negative effects on mental health, but there are few, if any, theoretically-derived interventions that directly target this problem. We evaluate a new intervention, Groups 4 Health (G4H), a manualized 5-module psychological intervention that targets the development and maintenance of social group relationships to treat psychological distress arising from social isolation. Methods: G4H was tested using a non-randomized control design. The program was delivered to young adults presenting with social isolation and affective disturbance. Primary outcome measures assessed mental health (depression, general anxiety, social anxiety, and stress), well-being (life satisfaction, self-esteem) and social connectedness (loneliness, social functioning). Our secondary goal was to assess whether mechanisms of social identification were responsible for changes in outcomes. Results: G4H was found to significantly improve mental health, well-being, and social connectedness on all measures, both on program completion and 6-month follow-up. In line with social identity theorizing, analysis also showed that improvements in depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, and life satisfaction were underpinned by participants’ increased identification both with their G4H group and with multiple groups. Limitations: This study provides preliminary evidence of the potential value of G4H and its underlying mechanisms, but further examination is required in other populations to address issues of generalizability, and in randomized controlled trials to address its wider efficacy. Conclusions: Results of this pilot study confirm that G4H has the potential to reduce the negative health-related consequences of social disconnection. Future research will determine its utility in wider community contexts.

"Cannabis use, depression and anxiety: A 3-year prospective population-based study","Background: Whether or not cannabis use may increase the risk for depression and/or anxiety is not clear. For one thing, it has not been possible to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the direction of causality, i.e. whether cannabis use increases the risk for depression/anxiety or vice versa. This study aimed at examining possible associations between cannabis use, depression and anxiety, using all three measures as both exposure and outcome. Methods: Data were obtained from a longitudinal cohort study comprising 8598 Swedish men and women, aged 20–64, with a three-year-follow-up. Results: Adjusted for sex and age, cannabis use at baseline was associated with an increased relative risk (RR) for depression and anxiety at follow-up, with RR = 1.22 [1.06–1.42 Cl 95%] for depression and RR = 1.38 [1.26–1.50 Cl 95%] for anxiety. Adjusted for all confounders (alcohol and illicit drug use, education, family tension, place of upbringing), the associations were no longer statistically significant; RR = 0.99 [0.82–1.17 Cl 95%] for depression and RR = 1.09 [0.98–1.20 Cl 95%] for anxiety. Age-adjusted, reporting depression or anxiety at baseline increased the risk of cannabis onset at follow-up three years later; RR = 1.62 [1.28–2.03 CI 95%] and RR = 1.63 [1.28–2.08 CI 95%] respectively. However, adjusted for other illicit drug use the associations were no longer statistically significant. Limitations: Lack of information on frequency of cannabis use and of age of initiation of use. Conclusions: We found no longitudinal associations between cannabis use and incidence of depression/anxiety, or between depression/anxiety and later cannabis use onset.

Anxiety symptom interpretation: A potential mechanism explaining the cardiorespiratory fitness–anxiety relationship,"Background: Higher cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with lower trait anxiety, but research has not examined whether fitness is associated with state anxiety levels and the interpretation of these symptoms. The aim of this paper was to (1) reexamine the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and general anxiety and (2) examine anxiety intensity and perceptions of these symptoms prior to an acute psychological stress task. Methods: Participants ( N = 185; 81% female; M age = 18.04, SD=0.43 years) completed a 10-minute Paced Serial Addition Test. General anxiety was assessed using the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. Cognitive and somatic anxiety intensity and perceptions of symptoms was assessed immediately prior to the acute psychological stress task using the Immediate Anxiety Measures Scale. Cardiorespiratory fitness was calculated using a validated standardized formula. Results: Higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with lower levels of general anxiety. Path analysis supported a model whereby perceptions of anxiety symptoms mediated the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and levels of anxiety experienced during the stress task; results remained significant after adjusting for general anxiety levels. Specifically, higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness were positively associated with more positive perceptions of anxiety symptoms and lower levels of state anxiety. Limitations: A standard formula rather than maximal testing was used to assess cardiorespiratory fitness, self-report questionnaires were used to assess anxiety, and the study was cross-sectional in design. Conclusions: Results suggest a potential mechanism explaining how cardiorespiratory fitness can reduce anxiety levels.

Social anxiety is related to increased dwell time on socially threatening faces,"Background: Identification of reliable targets for therapeutic interventions is essential for developing evidence-based therapies. Threat-related attention bias has been implicated in the etiology and maintenance of social anxiety disorder. Extant response-time-based threat bias measures have demonstrated limited reliability and internal consistency. Here, we examined gaze patterns of socially anxious and nonanxious participants in relation to social threatening and neutral stimuli using an eye-tracking task, comprised of multiple threat and neutral stimuli, presented for an extended time-period. We tested the psychometric properties of this task with the hope to provide a solid stepping-stone for future treatment development. Methods: Eye gaze was tracked while participants freely viewed 60 different matrices comprised of eight disgusted and eight neutral facial expressions, presented for 6000 ms each. Gaze patterns on threat and neutral areas of interest (AOIs) of participants with SAD, high socially anxious students and nonanxious students were compared. Internal consistency and test–retest reliability were evaluated. Results: Participants did not differ on first-fixation variables. However, overall, socially anxious students and participants with SAD dwelled significantly longer on threat faces compared with nonanxious participants, with no difference between the anxious groups. Groups did not differ in overall dwell time on neutral faces. Internal consistency of total dwell time on threat and neutral AOIs was high and one-week test–retest reliability was acceptable. Limitations: Only disgusted facial expressions were used. Relative small sample size. Conclusion: Social anxiety is associated with increased dwell time on socially threatening stimuli, presenting a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

The association of an inability to form and maintain close relationships due to a medical condition with anxiety and depressive disorders,"Background: While low social support is a risk factor for mental illness, anxiety and depression's relationship with social impairment specifically resulting from a medical condition is poorly understood. We hypothesize that when a medical illness makes it difficult for people to form and maintain close relationships with others, they will be at increased risk for anxiety and depression. Methods: Two nationally representative surveys, the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication and National Latino and Asian American Study, included 6805 adults with at least one medical illness and information on social impairment attributed to a medical condition. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview evaluated a 12-month history of anxiety and depressive disorders. Results: 8.2% of our sample had at least moderate difficulty in forming and maintaining close relationships due to a medical condition. In bivariate analyses, younger age, Latino ethnicity, less education, worse financial status, more chronic illnesses, physical health and discomfort, and problems with mobility, home management, and self-care were associated with this social impairment. In multivariable analyses accounting for possible confounders, there was a dose-dependent relationship between social impairment and the prevalence of anxiety and depression. Limitations: Data are cross-sectional and our analyses are therefore unable to determine cause-and-effect relationships. Conclusions: Among adults with one or more medical conditions, social impairment attributed to medical illness was associated with a significantly greater odds of anxiety and depression. Further clarification of this relationship could inform more targeted, personalized interventions to prevent and/or alleviate mental illness in those with chronic medical conditions.

"Risk factors for fearful spells, panic attacks and panic disorder in a community cohort of adolescents and young adults","Background: Panic attacks (PA) and panic disorder (PD) as well as fearful spells only (FS-only, attacks of anxiety not meeting full criteria for PA or PD) increase the risk for various mental disorders. It is unclear so far whether FS-only, PA and PD share the same etiologies and risk factors. Methods: A representative community sample of adolescents and young adults ( n = 3021, aged 14–24 at baseline) was prospectively followed up over up to 10 years. Panic pathology and putative risk factors were assessed using the DSM-IV/M-CIDI and its embedded assessment modules and questionnaires. Results: In Cox regressions stratified by sex and age, female sex, parental anxiety and depression, behavioral inhibition, harm avoidance, lower coping-efficacy and parental rejection predicted the onset of FS-only, PA and PD (Hazard Ratios 1.2–3.0). Associations with other risk factors partially differed for FS-only, PA and PD and tended to be stronger for PA and PD than for FS-only. Limitations: No strictly prospective analytical approach was used. Time intervals between some risk factors and their retrospective assessment were relatively long. Conclusions: Findings suggest that FS-only, PA and PD are etiologically similar and represent qualitatively equal, albeit differently severe forms of panic pathology that lie on different points of the same fear-panic dimension.

Effects of smoking on perinatal depression and anxiety in mothers and fathers: A prospective cohort study,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 274 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2020-50418-159). In the original article, additional affiliation for co-author Heng-Kien Au was missing. The correction is given in the erratum.] Introduction: Considerable concern persists on tobacco use during perinatal periods. No study has simultaneously investigated the longitudinal association of paternal smoking with maternal and paternal depressive and anxiety symptoms during perinatal periods. Methods: In this prospective study, 533 couples (pregnant women and their husbands) completed 5 self-report instruments from early pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. Generalized estimating equations were used for the analyses. Results: We found that fathers who smoked in the mother’s presence had higher depressive (regression coefficient = 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3–1.8) and anxiety symptoms (3.0, 95% CI = 1.2–4.7) during perinatal periods compared with nonsmoking fathers. Paternal smoking in the mother’s presence also increased maternal disturbances, especially for depression during pregnancy (1.2, 95% CI = 0.1–2.3) and anxiety during the postpartum period (3.4, 95% CI = 0.6–6.3). No significant association was found between paternal smoking but not in the mother’s presence and maternal emotional disturbances. Paternal smoking but not in the mother’s presence affected only paternal anxiety, especially in the postpartum period (regression coefficient 2.7, 95% CI 0.7–4.7) compared with nonsmokers. Limitations: Self-report measures were used. The effects of maternal smoking could not be estimated because of the small sample of pregnant women who disclosed their smoking status. Conclusions: These findings imply a necessity to combine strategies for smoking cessation with interventions for affective disturbances in fathers. We also stress the importance of at least restricting the father’s smoking in the presence of the pregnant wife during perinatal periods if smoking cessation is tentatively unattainable.

An investigation of the role of intolerance of uncertainty in hoarding symptoms,"Background: Hoarding disorder (HD) is a common, debilitating mental illness and public health burden. Understanding the factors that contribute to hoarding is critical for identifying treatment targets. As a relatively new diagnostic entity, this research remains in its initial stages. Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is thought to be a vulnerability factor for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and may also be relevant to HD. We investigated the possible association between IU and hoarding in two sets of analyses. Method: First, we administered self-report measures of IU and hoarding symptoms to unscreened undergraduate students ( N = 456) and used regressions to probe their association controlling for relevant covariates. Second, in a clinical sample, we compared IU across groups of patients with HD ( N = 26), GAD ( N = 26), OCD ( N = 51), other anxiety disorders ( N = 91) and healthy controls ( N = 29). Results: In the student sample, IU predicted hoarding symptoms above and beyond relevant covariates, including hoarding-related beliefs. In the clinical sample, HD patients evidenced greater IU relative to healthy individuals and the mixed anxiety group, and comparable levels of IU to the GAD and OCD groups. Limitations: This study relied exclusively on self-report questionnaires and a cross-sectional design. Conclusions: IU is associated with hoarding behavior and, as we discuss, conceptual models might benefit from the study of IU as a potentially contributing factor. Directions for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2016
"""Anxiety symptoms are linked to new-onset suicidal ideation after six months of follow-up in outpatients with major depressive disorder"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Anxiety symptoms are linked to new-onset suicidal ideation after six months of follow-up in outpatients with major depressive disorder"" by Ji Hyun Baek, Jung Yoon Heo, Maurizio Fava, David Mischoulon, Andrew Nierenberg, Jin Pyo Hong, Sungwon Roh and Hong Jin Jeon ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2015[Nov][15], Vol 187, 183-187). In the original article, there were errors in Tables 1, 2, and 3. The corrected tables are provided in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-45810-028). Background: Suicide risk evaluation is one of the most challenging assessments of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Initial risk evaluation might be insufficient in predicting emergence of suicidal ideation during the maintenance period. We aimed to elucidate factors associated with emergence or persistence of suicidal ideation 6 months after initiation of outpatient treatment in patients with MDD. Methods: A total of 300 participants with MDD defined by DSM-IV-TR criteria underwent face-to-face interview at baseline and follow-up phone interview at 6 months later. Severity of depression, suicidal ideation, and anxiety were evaluated. Results: Among participants who did not report any suicidal idea at baseline, 10.9% reported suicidal ideation during the 6-month phone interview, while 28.4% of participants who reported suicidal ideation at baseline reported suicidal ideation during the phone interview. No significant difference in remission rate of depression was observed between the groups, but subjects without suicidal ideation at baseline had a higher rate of symptom improvement at the 6-month phone interview. After controlling for age, sex, baseline severity of suicide risk and depression and lifetime history of suicide attempts, emergence of suicidal ideation was significantly associated with anxiety level at baseline ( t = 2.127, p = 0.039) and severity of depression symptoms at 6 month ( t = –3.028, p = 0.004); persistence of suicidal ideation was associated with severity of depression symptoms at 6 month ( t = –4.962, p &lt; 0.001). Limitation: Follow-up evaluation was done by phone interview. Conclusion: Anxiety at baseline needs to be carefully evaluated in assessing suicide risk of patients with MDD.

"Employment status, employment functioning, and barriers to employment among VA primary care patients","Background: Prior research found lower employment rates among working-aged patients who use the VA than among non-Veterans or Veterans who do not use the VA, with the lowest reported employment rates among VA patients with mental disorders. This study assessed employment status, employment functioning, and barriers to employment among VA patients treated in primary care settings, and examined how depression and anxiety were associated with these outcomes. Methods: The sample included 287 VA patients treated in primary care in a large Midwestern VA Medical Center. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted examining associations between socio-demographic and clinical predictors of six employment domains, including: employment status, job search self-efficacy, work performance, concerns about job loss among employed Veterans, and employment barriers and likelihood of job seeking among not employed Veterans. Results: 54% of respondents were employed, 36% were not employed, and 10% were economically inactive. In adjusted analyses, participants with depression or anxiety (43%) were less likely to be employed, had lower job search self-efficacy, had lower levels of work performance, and reported more employment barriers. Depression and anxiety were not associated with perceived likelihood of job loss among employed or likelihood of job seeking among not employed. Limitations: Single VA primary care clinic; cross-sectional study. Discussion: Employment rates are low among working-aged VA primary care patients, particularly those with mental health conditions. Offering primary care interventions to patients that address mental health issues, job search self-efficacy, and work performance may be important in improving health, work, and economic outcomes.

Predictors of depression recovery in HIV-infected individuals managed through measurement-based care in infectious disease clinics,"Background: Treatment of comorbid chronic disease, such as depression, in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) increasingly falls to HIV treatment providers. Guidance in who will best respond to depression treatment and which patient-centered symptoms are best to target is limited. Methods: Bivariable analyses were used to calculate hazard ratios for associations between baseline demographic, mental health-related, and HIV-related factors on time to first depression remission among PLWHA enrolled in a randomized trial of measurement-based antidepressant management. Time-updated factors also were analyzed at time of antidepressant (AD) initiation/adjustment and 8 weeks post AD initiation/adjustment. Results: Baseline comorbid depression and anxiety; comorbid depression, anxiety and substance abuse; and generalized anxiety disorder predicted a slower time to first remission. Being on ART but non-adherent, having panic disorder, having a history of a major depressive episode, or having been in HIV care for &gt;10 years prior to study initiation predicted a faster time to first remission. Sleep difficulty or fatigue at the time of AD initiation/adjustment predicted a slower time to remission. In non-remitters at 8 weeks post AD initiation/adjustment, sleep difficulty, anxiety, and fatigue each predicted a slower time to remission. Limitations: Remission was determined by PHQ-9 scores, not diagnostic criteria. The results may apply only to depression recovery in this particular model of treatment. We conducted only exploratory analyses to determine magnitude of effects. Conclusions: Baseline comorbid anxiety with or without substance abuse predicts slower time to depression remission among PLWHA treated in HIV clinics. Targeting anxiety or fatigue at the time of AD initiation/adjustment or sleep difficulty, anxiety, and fatigue at 8 weeks post AD initiation/adjustment could shorten time to depression remission in this model.

Manifestations of overarousal account for the association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation,"Background: Recent evidence suggests an association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation. Cognitive anxiety sensitivity has also been implicated as a precursor to various forms of overarousal. These manifestations of overarousal (i.e., agitation, insomnia, nightmares, and anger) may account for the association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation. Methods: In Study 1, undergraduate students selectively sampled for recent suicidal ideation completed all measures online. In Study 2, clinical outpatients completed all measures prior to their initial intake appointments at a psychology clinic. Results: Study 1 demonstrated that agitation and insomnia individually and jointly accounted for the association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation, controlling for general anxiety and demographic variables. Study 2 replicated and extended these findings, such that, controlling for demographics, general anxiety, and physical and social anxiety sensitivity, agitation and anger each independently and together accounted for the association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation, whereas insomnia and nightmares did not. Limitations: This study utilized a cross-sectional design and self-report measures in both samples as well as a sample of undergraduate students in Study 1. Conclusions: Together, these findings suggest that agitation and anger may explain the previously established relationship between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation. Targeting cognitive anxiety sensitivity in treatment may in turn reduce these forms of overarousal and thereby suicide risk.

Childhood maltreatment and comorbid anxiety in people with bipolar disorder,"Background: Comorbid anxiety disorders and a history of childhood maltreatment are important determinants of outcome in bipolar disorder, but the relationship between these two factors is unclear. Methods: In 174 outpatients with bipolar disorder, we assessed history of childhood maltreatment with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and lifetime diagnosis of anxiety disorders with the M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric Interview. We used ordinary logistic regressions to test associations between childhood maltreatment and the number of comorbid anxiety disorders, controlling for age, sex and the type of bipolar disorder. Results: Ninety (51.7%) participants had no anxiety disorder, 50 (28.7%) had one anxiety disorder and 34 (19.5%) had two or more anxiety disorders. Childhood maltreatment, indexed by a higher CTQ total score, was associated with more lifetime anxiety disorders (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.01 to 2.14; p = 0.04). Of the CTQ subscales, emotional abuse (OR=1.68; 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.49; p = 0.01) and physical abuse (OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.02 to 2.01; p = 0.04) were associated with anxiety disorders. Of the anxiety disorders, panic disorder was most strongly associated with childhood maltreatment (OR = 2.27; 95% CI = 1.28 to 4.02; p = 0.01). Limitations: The study is limited by a moderate sample size and the retrospective assessment of childhood maltreatment. Conclusions: Exposure to maltreatment in childhood is associated with comorbid anxiety disorders among individuals living with bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder with comorbid anxiety may constitute a separate aetiological type with a greater contribution of early environment.

Investigation of the cognitive variables associated with worry in children with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and their parents,"Background: Intolerance of uncertainty (IU), negative beliefs about worry (NBW), positive beliefs about worry (PBW), negative problem orientation (NPO) and cognitive avoidance (CA) have been found to be integral in the conceptualisation of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults, yet they have rarely been investigated in children with GAD. This study sought to determine (a) whether IU, NBW, PBW, NPO and CA differ between children diagnosed with GAD and non-anxious children and (b) to examine whether IU, NBW, PBW, NPO and CA differ between parents of children diagnosed with GAD and parents of children without an anxiety disorder. Methods: Participants were 50 children (aged 7–12 years), plus one of their parents. The 25 GAD children and 25 non-anxious children were matched on age and gender. Parents and children completed clinical diagnostic interviews, as well as a battery of questionnaires measuring worry, IU, NBW, PBW, NPO and CA. Results: Children with GAD endorsed significantly higher levels of worry, IU, NBW, NPO and CA, but not PBW compared to non-anxious children. Parents of children with GAD did not differ from parents of non-anxious children on any of the variables. Limitations: The study was limited by it's use of modified adult measures for some variables and a lack of heterogeneity in the sample. Conclusions: The cognitive variables of IU, NBW, NPO and CA may also be important in the conceptualisation and treatment of GAD in children as they are in adults.

The structure of negative emotional states in a postpartum inpatient sample,"Background: Depression and anxiety disorders exhibit comorbidity, and the same relationships have been observed in postpartum samples. The tripartite model posits that anxiety and depression overlap due to shared and unique symptom components. The present study tested whether a one-factor model, or a three-factor model consistent with the tripartite model, provided a better fit to anxiety and depression symptoms in a postpartum sample. Methods: The sample consisted of 663 postpartum psychiatric inpatients who completed self-reported questionnaires assessing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that a three-factor model consistent with the tripartite model provided a good fit to anxiety/depression data. This model consisted of three factors: positive affect, negative affect, and autonomic arousal. Positive affect was related to depressive diagnoses and negatively related to anxiety diagnoses; autonomic arousal was related to anxiety diagnoses; and negative affect was uniquely related to mixed anxiety–depressive diagnoses. Limitations: The sample consisted of postpartum psychiatric inpatients and the generalisability of results to other postpartum samples is not known. Conclusions: Postpartum anxiety and depression appear to be characterised by three differentiable symptom clusters. Postpartum anxiety, depression, and mixed anxiety–depressive diagnoses are differentially associated with these symptom clusters. These findings suggest that the tripartite model may be useful in guiding assessment, differentiation, and treatment of postpartum emotional disorders.

Lifetime costs of perinatal anxiety and depression,"Background: Anxiety and depression are common among women during pregnancy and the year after birth. The consequences, both for the women themselves and for their children, can be considerable and last for many years. This study focuses on the economic consequences, aiming to estimate the total costs and health-related quality of life losses over the lifetime of mothers and their children. Method: A pathway or decision modelling approach was employed, based on data from previous studies. Systematic and pragmatic literature reviews were conducted to identify evidence of impacts of perinatal anxiety and depression on mothers and their children. Results: The present value of total lifetime costs of perinatal depression (anxiety) was £75,728 (£34,811) per woman with condition. If prevalence estimates were applied the respective cost of perinatal anxiety and depression combined was about £8500 per woman giving birth; for the United Kingdom, the aggregated costs were £6.6 billion. The majority of the costs related to adverse impacts on children and almost a fifth were borne by the public sector. Limitations: The method was exploratory in nature, based on a diverse range of literature and encountered important data gaps. Conclusions: Findings suggest the need to allocate more resources to support women with perinatal mental illness. More research is required to understand the type of interventions that can reduce long-term negative effects for both mothers and offspring.

Identifying the women at risk of antenatal anxiety and depression: A systematic review,"Background: Pregnancy is a time of increased vulnerability for the development of anxiety and depression. This systematic review aims to identify the main risk factors involved in the onset of antenatal anxiety and depression. Methods: A systematic literature analysis was conducted, using PubMed, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Library. Original papers were included if they were written in English and published between 1st January 2003 and 31st August 2015, while literature reviews and meta-analyses were consulted regardless of publication date. A final number of 97 papers were selected. Results: The most relevant factors associated with antenatal depression or anxiety were: lack of partner or of social support; history of abuse or of domestic violence; personal history of mental illness; unplanned or unwanted pregnancy; adverse events in life and high perceived stress; present/past pregnancy complications; and pregnancy loss. Limitations: The review does not include a meta-analysis, which may have added additional information about the differential impact of each risk factor. Moreover, it does not specifically examine factors that may influence different types of anxiety disorders, or the recurrence or persistence of depression or anxiety from pregnancy to the postpartum period. Conclusions: The results show the complex aetiology of antenatal depression and anxiety. The administration of a screening tool to identify women at risk of anxiety and depression during pregnancy should be universal practice in order to promote the long-term wellbeing of mothers and babies, and the knowledge of specific risk factors may help creating such screening tool targeting women at higher risk.

Prevalence of antipsychotic prescriptions among patients with anxiety disorders treated in inpatient and outpatient psychiatric settings,"Background: An increasing number of prescribers are using antipsychotics for treatment of anxiety disorders, despite lack of FDA-approved indications and mixed efficacy results from clinical trials. The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence of antipsychotics prescription in psychiatric inpatients and outpatients with anxiety disorders. Methods: This is a retrospective study of de-identified data from patients with a DSMIV-TR anxiety disorder diagnosis in an academic psychiatric setting in 2013. The final cohort of patients, after exclusion of bipolar/psychotic comorbidity, includes 1699 patients. Logistic regression models were used to explore associations between antipsychotic prescription and patient characteristics. Results: Among non-psychotic/non-bipolar patients with anxiety disorder, 53.6% of inpatients and 16.6% of outpatients received antipsychotic medication. Rates varied with the disorder. Outpatients with post-traumatic stress disorder (OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.66–3.01) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.86–4.19) received antipsychotic prescriptions more often than those without these diagnoses. Comorbidity with depression was common while comorbidity with borderline personality disorder was rare; both increased odds of receiving prescription of antipsychotics (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.16–2.12 for depression; OR: 2.63, 95% CI 1.42–4.88 for borderline personality disorder, respectively). Additionally, age was significantly associated with increased odds of being on an antipsychotic. Quetiapine and aripripazole were the most prescribed antipsychotics and very few patients received rescue medication for extrapyramidal symptoms. Limitations: Lack of specific indications for the psychotropic prescriptions. Conclusions: A substantial percentage of patients with anxiety disorders are prescribed antipsychotics, especially among inpatients. This practice may reflect the severity of the anxiety disorder or the high prevalence of comorbidity. Based on frequency of rescue medication prescription, treatment seemed well tolerated for extra-pyramidal neurological side-effects.

Longitudinal effects of dysfunctional perfectionism and avoidant personality style on postpartum mental disorders: Pathways through antepartum depression and anxiety,"Background: There is first evidence that some personality characteristics raise the risk of postpartum depression (PPD). The present longitudinal study investigates whether dysfunctional perfectionism and avoidant personality style predict PPD, postpartum anxiety (PPA) and bonding impairment (BI) directly or indirectly through antepartum anxiety (APA) and antepartum depression (APD). Methods: Pregnant women were recruited in two obstetric departments in Germany. The assessment occurred at two measurement time points: In the third trimester of pregnancy ( N = 297) and twelve weeks postpartum ( N = 266). Six questionnaires were administered during pregnancy: perfectionism, personality styles, anxiety, and depression. Postpartum, data on PPA, PPD and BI were collected. We conducted two path analyses in order to examine direct and indirect effects of the two personality characteristics on postpartum disorders. Results: Testing for direct effects of dysfunctional perfectionism and avoidant personality style on PPD, PPA, and BI did not yield significant results. Instead, significant indirect effects were found: PPD, PPA, and BI were influenced indirectly by dysfunctional perfectionism and avoidant personality style via APD and APA. This model explained high portions of the variance of PPD, PPA, and impaired bonding. Each of the two personality characteristics explained a unique part of the outcome measures. The influence on BI was mediated by PPD. APD affected PPD and PPA more strongly than APA. Limitation: Path models with manifest (observed) variables may lead to measurement errors. Self-rating questionnaires may raise the problem of social desirability. Conclusion: Dysfunctional perfectionism and avoidant personality style are significant risk factors for PPD, PPA, and BI.

Impact of childhood emotional abuse on neocortical neurometabolites and complex emotional processing in patients with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: The rostral prefrontal cortex (RPFC) is involved in reflective thought processes such as self-knowledge and person perception.We hypothesized that childhood emotional abuse, which is disruptive of emotional regulation, would differentially impact neurometabolite concentrations of the RPFC, and related neocortical areas, in adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) versus healthy controls. Methods: GAD patients ( n = 16; females = 11) and medically healthy volunteers ( n = 16; F = 10) were assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), specifically the emotional abuse category. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging examined 3 regions of interest (ROI) from the most rostral slice from the Duyn et al. (1993) multivoxel imaging modality: rostral prefrontal cortex (BA 10,9), premotor cortex (BA 6,8) and secondary somatosensory and associated parietal cortex (BA 5,7). Metabolites included N -acetyl-aspartate, creatine, and choline. Results: GAD patients reported higher emotional abuse scores versus controls. An omnibus general linear model including 3 ROI, 3 metabolites, and laterality as dependent variables revealed a significant diagnosis by CTQ emotional abuse score interactive effect. In controls, all 3 ROI for all 3 metabolites on both sides demonstrated a significant inverse relationship with emotional abuse scores; none were significant in GAD patients. Limitations: A major limitation is the uneven distribution of emotional abuse scores between the controls and GAD patients, with GAD patients reporting higher scores. Conclusion: Unlike controls, GAD patients appear compromised in forming a molecular representation reflective of magnitude of childhood emotional abuse. The neurometabolites in GAD patients appear non-aligned to childhood emotional abuse, suggesting potential consequences for normative “theory of mind” processes and emotional function in certain anxiety disorders.

A systematic review of the factor structure and reliability of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale,"Background: The Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS) is a widely used instrument for assessing symptoms of anxiety disorders among children and adolescents. Previous studies have demonstrated its good reliability for children and adolescents from different backgrounds. However, remarkable variability in the reliability of the SCAS across studies and inconsistent results regarding its factor structure has been found. Methods: The present study aims to examine the SCAS factor structure by means of a systematic review with narrative synthesis, the mean reliability of the SCAS by means of a meta-analysis, and the influence of the moderators on the SCAS reliability. Databases employed to collect the studies included Scholar Google, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus since 1997. Results: Twenty-nine and 32 studies, which examined the factor structure and the internal consistency of the SCAS, respectively, were included. The SCAS was found to have strong internal consistency, influenced by different moderators. The systematic review demonstrated that the original six-factor model was supported by most studies. Limitations: Factorial invariance studies (across age, gender, country) and test–retest reliability of the SCAS were not examined in this study. Conclusions: It is concluded that the SCAS is a reliable instrument for cross-cultural use, and it is suggested that the original six-factor model is appropriate for cross-cultural application.

Acceptance and commitment therapy—Do we know enough? Cumulative and sequential meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials,"Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has accrued a substantial evidence base. Recent systematic and meta-analytic reviews suggest that ACT is effective compared to control conditions. However, these reviews appraise the efficacy of ACT across a broad range of presenting problems, rather than addressing specific common mental health difficulties. Focussing on depression and anxiety we performed a meta-analysis of trials of ACT.We incorporated sequential meta-analysis (SMA) techniques to critically appraise the sufficiency of the existing evidence base. Findings suggest that ACT demonstrates at least moderate group and pre-post effects for symptom reductions for both anxiety and depression. However using SMA findings are more qualified. There is currently insufficient evidence to confidently conclude that ACT for anxiety is efficacious when compared to active control conditions or as primary treatment for anxiety. Similarly, using SMA, there is currently insufficient evidence to suggest a moderate efficacy of ACT for depression compared to active control conditions. To stimulate further research we offer specific estimates of additional numbers of participants required to reach sufficiency to help inform future studies. We also discuss the appropriate strategies for future research into ACT for anxiety given the current evidence suggests no differential efficacy of ACT in the treatment of anxiety compared to active control conditions.

The relationship between anxiety disorders and dimensional representations of DSM-IV personality disorders: A co-twin control study,"Background: There is substantial comorbidity between personality disorders (PDs) and anxiety disorders (ADs). Sharing of familial risk factors possibly explains the co-occurrence, but direct causal relationships between the disorders may also exist. Methods: 2801 persons from 1391 twin pairs from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health Twin Panel were assessed for all DSM-IV PDs and ADs. Bivariate Poisson-regression analyses were performed to assess whether PDs predicted ADs at three different levels: All PDs combined, PDs combined within DSM-IV-clusters and each individual PD separately. Next, bivariate co-twin control analyses were executed within monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. A similar analytic strategy was employed in multivariate models including PDs as independent variables. Results: PDs predicted ADs at all levels of analysis in bivariate regression models. Bivariate co-twin control analyses demonstrated an increased risk of ADs in all PDs combined, all PD-clusters and in schizotypal, paranoid, borderline, antisocial, avoidant and dependent PD. In the multivariate regression model, all PD-clusters and schizotypal, borderline, avoidant and obsessive-compulsive PD predicted ADs. Only borderline and avoidant PD predicted ADs in the multivariate co-twin control analysis. Limitations: Over-adjustment may explain the results from the multivariate analyses. The cross-sectional study design hampers causal inference. Conclusions: Comorbidity between ADs and PDs can be largely accounted for by shared familial risk factors. However, the results are also consistent with a direct causal relationship partly explaining the cooccurrence. Our results indicate specific environmental factors for comorbidity of ADs and borderline and avoidant PDs that are not shared with other PDs.

Positive mental health in outpatients with affective disorders: Associations with life satisfaction and general functioning,"Background: Positive mental health (PMH) is an integral and essential component of health that encompasses emotional, psychological and social well-being. The Keyes' two continua model of mental health and illness posits that mental health status is not merely the absence of mental health problems, and it can be enhanced regardless of a diagnosis of mental illness. The present study hypothesized that mentally ill patients with higher levels of PMH would be associated with better life satisfaction and general functioning. Methods: 218 outpatients with affective disorders at a tertiary psychiatric hospital were recruited and administered the multidimensional Positive Mental Health instrument, which was validated and developed in Singapore to measure PMH. Depression and anxiety severity were also assessed. Associations of positive mental health with life satisfaction and general functioning were investigated in linear regression models. Results: PMH scores varied largely within patients with depressive and anxiety disorders but did not differ statistically across the two diagnoses, except for emotional support. PMH was associated with both life satisfaction and general functioning with little evidence of confounding by sociodemographic and clinical status. Limitations: The cross-sectional design of the study could not examine causal relationships. Findings may be restrictive to treatment-seeking population with specific affective disorders. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence to support the notion that a good mental health state is not simply the absence of a mental disorder. Mentally ill patients can also have high levels of PMH that possibly have a moderating or mediating effect on the relationship between patients' clinical symptoms and life satisfaction or general functioning.

Cognitive distortions mediate depression and affective response to social acceptance and rejection,"Background: The emotional context insensitivity (ECI) hypothesis suggests individuals with depression have blunted affective responses to both positive and negative events.We tested ECI in a social context to examine how depression relates to affective responses to social acceptance and rejection outcomes. Furthermore, we aimed to identify cognitive mechanisms linking depression with affective response to social feedback. Finally, we tested whether these processes are similar for social anxiety. Method: 90 participants (age 18–26 years; 53 women) completed the two-visit Chatroom task. At Visit 1 they rated their expectations about being liked by 60 peers. At Visit 2 they completed self-reports of depressive and social anxiety symptoms, and of cognitive flexibility, then received acceptance or rejection feedback from each peer and rated their affective response. Results: Greater depressive symptoms related to negative expectancy bias, lower cognitive flexibility, and less positive affective response to acceptance, but did not relate to rejection. Negative expectations and cognitive flexibility mediated the relationship between depressive symptoms and affective response for acceptance; only negative expectations mediated rejection responses. These cognitive mechanisms were not related to social anxiety. Limitations: A community sample was used to assess depression. Rumination and current mood state were omitted as potential predictors of affective response. Conclusions: Findings support the ECI framework. Depression but not social anxiety interferes with positive and negative affect through cognitively mediated dampening of emotional response to social acceptance and rejection. Emotion regulation strategies in depression therapy can target social flexibility to improve alignment of affective reactions to social outcomes.

Low stability of diagnostic classifications of anxiety disorders over time: A six-year follow-up of the NESDA study,"Background: Stability of diagnosis was listed as an important predictive validator for maintaining separate diagnostic classifications in DSM-5. The aim of this study is to examine the longitudinal stability of anxiety disorder diagnoses, and the difference in stability between subjects with a chronic versus a nonchronic course. Methods: Longitudinal data of 447 subjects with a current pure anxiety disorder diagnosis at baseline from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used. At baseline, 2-, 4-, and 6-year followup mental disorders were assessed and numbers (and percentages) of transitions from one anxiety disorder diagnosis to another were determined for each anxiety disorder diagnosis separately and for subjects with a chronic (i.e. one or more anxiety disorder at every follow-up assessment) and a nonchronic course. Results: Transition percentages were high in all anxiety disorder diagnoses, ranging from 21.1% for social anxiety disorder to 46.3% for panic disorder with agoraphobia at six years of follow-up. Transition numbers were higher in the chronic than in the non-chronic course group ( p = 0.01). Limitations: Due to the 2 year sample frequency, the number of subjects with a chronic course may have been overestimated as intermittent recovery periods may have been missed. Conclusions: These data indicate that anxiety disorder diagnoses are not stable over time. The validity of the different anxiety disorder categories is not supported by these longitudinal patterns, which may be interpreted as support for a more pronounced dimensional approach to the classification of anxiety disorders.

Longitudinal relationship between Personal and Social Performance (PSP) and anxiety symptoms in schizophrenia,"Background: We aimed to examine the longitudinal relationship between the personal and social functioning and anxiety symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. For this purpose, we confirmed the validity of the anxiety subscale of the Symptom-Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) and then applied the latent growth modeling method for longitudinal causal relationships. Methods: Five hundred and seventy-eight patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were evaluated and 369 patients were included in the study at baseline. After conducting Rasch model analyses for the validation of the anxiety subscale in the SCL-90-R, we applied latent growth model to determine the causal relationship between the PSP and the anxiety symptoms. Results: The validity of the anxiety subscale of the SCL-90-R was confirmed based on the Rasch rating model, where the criteria for Infit, Outfit, item difficulty, and point-measure correlations were satisfied. The results from the latent growth model showed that the intercept and slope (rate of change) of the PSP negatively predicted the slope of anxiety symptoms along the longitudinal trajectory. Together with previous studies examining the predictive role of anxiety symptoms on quality of life, our longitudinal findings lend evidence for bidirectional effects between quality of life and anxiety symptoms. The transactional nature of the relationship between anxiety symptoms and quality of life warrant further investigation using a longitudinal cross-lagged design. Conclusion: The anxiety subscale of the SCL-90-R may be utilized by clinicians and researcher to make inferences about quality of life in addition to assessing anxiety symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

The relationship between challenging parenting behaviour and childhood anxiety disorders,"Background: This research investigates the relationship between challenging parenting behaviour and childhood anxiety disorders proposed by Bögels and Phares (2008). Challenging parenting behaviour involves the playful encouragement of children to go beyond their own limits, and may decrease children's risk for anxiety (Bögels and Phares, 2008). Method: Parents ( n = 164 mothers and 144 fathers) of 164 children aged between 3.4 and 4.8 years participated in the current study. A multi-method, multi-informant assessment of anxiety was used, incorporating data from diagnostic interviews as well as questionnaire measures. Parents completed self-report measures of their parenting behaviour ( n = 147 mothers and 138 fathers) and anxiety ( n = 154 mothers and 143 fathers). Mothers reported on their child's anxiety via questionnaire as well as diagnostic interview ( n = 156 and 164 respectively). Of these children, 74 met criteria for an anxiety disorder and 90 did not. Results: Fathers engaged in challenging parenting behaviour more often than mothers. Both mothers' and fathers' challenging parenting behaviour was associated with lower report of child anxiety symptoms. However, only mothers' challenging parenting behaviour was found to predict child clinical anxiety diagnosis. Limitations: Shared method variance from mothers confined the interpretation of these results. Moreover, due to study design, it is not possible to delineate cause and effect. Conclusions: The finding with respect to maternal challenging parenting behaviour was not anticipated, prompting replication of these results. Future research should investigate the role of challenging parenting behaviour by both caregivers as this may have implications for parenting interventions for anxious children.

Re-experiencing phenomena following a disaster: The long-term predictive role of intrusion symptoms in the development of post-trauma depression and anxiety,"Background: Contention in the literature regarding the diagnostic utility of intrusion symptoms highlights that they have high sensitivity but low specificity in predicting PTSD. They are highly prevalent following a range of traumatic events, and across a range of disorders. The prevalence of intrusion symptoms in the absence of PTSD suggests their relevance to the development of other psychopathology. Therefore, the predictive role of intrusion symptoms for other post-trauma psychopathology was examined using data from an epidemiological, longitudinal sample of adults recruited in childhood. Method: From 5 phases of data collection for this sample, these analyses focused on the 20 year and 28 year follow-ups ( n = 583). Lifetime exposure to trauma was assessed using a modified set of 10 Criterion- A events from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), with PTSD assessed in reference to a self-nominated worst lifetime event, and other DSM-IV disorder also assessed using the CIDI. Results: Results showed that the presence of intrusion symptoms without PTSD at the 20 year follow-up was predictive of increased risk at 28 years for depressive but not anxiety disorders. Limitations: There was limited psychopathology in the sample, reducing the power to examine many individual disorders. Furthermore, trauma history and psychiatric symptoms were retrospectively reported, introducing the possibility of recall bias. Conclusion: Together the findings suggest that intrusion symptoms may play an aetiological role in the development and/or maintenance of disorders other than PTSD.

The identification of symptom-based subtypes of depression: A nationally representative cohort study,"Background: In recent years, researchers have used various techniques to elucidate the heterogeneity in depressive symptoms. This study seeks to resolve the extent to which variations in depression reflect qualitative differences between symptom categories and/or quantitative differences in severity. Methods: Data were used from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2, a nationally representative face-to-face survey of the adult general population. In a subsample of respondents with a lifetime key symptom of depression at baseline and who participated in the first two waves ( n = 1388), symptom profiles at baseline were based on symptoms reported during their worst lifetime depressive episode. Depressive symptoms and DSM-IV diagnoses were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Three latent variable techniques (latent class analysis, factor analysis, factor mixture modelling) were used to identify the best subtyping model. Results: A latent class analysis, adjusted for local dependence between weight change and appetite change, described the data best and resulted in four distinct depressive subtypes: severe depression with anxiety (28.0%), moderate depression with anxiety (29.3%), moderate depression without anxiety (23.6%) and mild depression (19.0%). These classes showed corresponding clinical correlates at baseline and corresponding course and outcome indicators at follow-up (i.e., class severity was linked to lifetime mental disorders at baseline, and service use for mental health problems and current disability at followup). Limitations: Although the sample was representative of the population on most parameters, the findings are not generalisable to the most severely affected depressed patients. Conclusions: Depression could best be described in terms of both qualitative differences between symptom categories and quantitative differences in severity. In particular anxiety was a distinguishing feature within moderate depression. This study stresses the central position anxiety occupies in the concept of depression.

Subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampal volumes in depressed youth: The role of comorbidity and age,"Objectives: Many studies have reported that adults with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) have smaller hippocampal volumes than control participants. The data are more variable in youth with MDD, where findings have been inconsistent and the effects of factors such as age and co-morbidity have not been systematically examined. This study therefore assessed hippocampus and subgenual anterior cingulate (sgACC) morphometry in 168 youth, aged 12–25, with or without MDD and comorbid anxiety. Methods: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and clinical assessments were obtained from 80 participants with MDD (36 with comorbid anxiety disorder) and 88 age-matched control participants. Results: Participants with MDD had smaller right hippocampi than controls ( p = .013). Older depressed participants (20.1–25 years) had smaller hippocampal volumes than younger ones (&lt; 20.1 years; p = .05); this age effect was not apparent in controls ( p = .46). Depression scores, indexed by the HAMD17, correlated with hippocampal volumes in older depressed youth. Depressed participants with comorbid anxiety had smaller sgACC, but not hippocampal, volumes than those without anxiety ( p = .042). Limitations: Longitudinal, versus cross-sectional, studies can most optimally assess the influence of depression on neurodevelopmental profiles. Though our participants were largely treatment-naïve or in their first week of pharmacotherapy, a handful had extensive treatment histories; thus, treatment history may have influenced brain morphometry. Conclusions: Age effects were apparent when hippocampal volumes of older and younger participants with MDD were compared; such differences were not apparent in healthy participants. Comorbid anxiety was associated with decreased sgACC volumes suggesting delayed or altered neurodevelopment in a key emotion regulation region.

Prevalence and course of anxiety disorders (and symptom levels) in men across the perinatal period: A systematic review,"Background: Men's experiences of anxiety within the perinatal period can adversely impact themselves, their partner and infant. However, we know little about the prevalence and course of men's anxiety across the perinatal period. The current review is one of the first to systematically review the published literature. Methods: Five databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane, SCOPUS, and Web of Science) were searched to identify relevant papers published prior to April 2015. The literature search identified articles with data for expectant fathers (prenatal period) and/or fathers of an infant aged between 0 and 1 (postnatal period). The following data were extracted: (a) anxiety disorder prevalence (diagnostic clinical interviews), (b) ‘high’ anxiety symptom prevalence (above thresholds/cut-points on anxiety symptom scales) and (c) mean anxiety levels (anxiety symptom scales). Initially, 537 unique papers were identified. Subsequently, 43 papers met criteria for inclusion in the review. Results: Prevalence rates for ‘any’ anxiety disorder (as defined by either diagnostic clinical interviews or above cut-points on symptom scales) ranged between 4.1% and 16.0% during the prenatal period and 2.4–18.0% during the postnatal period. The data reviewed suggest the course of anxiety across the perinatal period is fairly stable with potential decreases postpartum. Limitations: Wide variation in study measurement and methodology makes synthesis of individual findings difficult. Anxiety is highly comorbid with depression, and thus measures of mixed anxiety/depression might better capture the overall burden of mental illness. Conclusions: Anxiety disorders are common for men during the perinatal period. Both partners should be included in discussions and interventions focused on obstetric care and parent mental health during the perinatal period.

"Emotion dysregulation, psychological inflexibility, and shame as explanatory factors between neuroticism and depression","Background: The association between neuroticism and depression is well documented. However, neuroticism is a general risk factor associated with many forms of psychopathology, such as anxiety, eating, and personality disorders. Past research has suggested that other factors may mediate the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms of particular disorders. Methods: Self-report questionnaires measuring neuroticism, emotion dysregulation, psychological inflexibility, shame, and symptoms of depression were administered to 105 inpatient adolescents (aged 12–17). The current study examined three factors (emotion dysregulation difficulties, psychological inflexibility, and shame) as concurrent mediators of the neuroticism/depression association. Results: Neuroticism was significantly associated with depression, as expected. Neuroticism was also associated with emotion dysregulation and psychological inflexibility, which, in combination, fully mediated the association between neuroticism and depression. Shame was not significantly associated with neuroticism or depression, when controlling for anxiety, externalizing, sex, and age. Follow-up analyses examined six sub-factors of emotion dysregulation as multiple mediators of the neuroticism/ depression association. Goal directed behavior, lack of emotion regulation strategies, and impulse control were significant mediators, controlling for the other three emotion dysregulation sub-factors. Limitations: The study is limited by the cross sectional design, sample size, and self-report measurement. Conclusions: Despite limitations, this study demonstrated that the link between neuroticism and depression is explained by both emotion dysregulation and psychological inflexibility and that specific emotion dysregulation facets may be at play in adolescent depression.

The cost-effectiveness of short-term and long-term psychotherapy in the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders during a 5-year follow-up,"Both short-term and long-term psychotherapies are used extensively in treating different mental disorders, but there have been practically no attempts to compare their cost-effectiveness. The aim of this study, which is part of the Helsinki Psychotherapy Study, is to assess the cost-effectiveness of two short-term therapies compared to that of a long-term therapy. In this study 326 outpatients suffering from mood or anxiety disorder were randomized to solution-focused therapy (SFT), short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (SPP) or to long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (LPP). Psychiatric symptoms and working ability were assessed at baseline and then 4–9 times during a 5-year follow-up using eight widely used measures including e.g. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Symptom Check List, anxiety scale (SCL-90-Anx), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), Symptom Check List, Global Severity Index (SCL-90-GSI), and the Work-subscale (SAS-Work) of the Social Adjustment Scale (SAS-SR). Both direct and indirect costs were measured. During the 5-year follow-up period statistically significant improvements were observed in all health indicators in all therapy groups. At first the recovery was faster in the short-term therapy groups than in the LPP group, but taking the whole follow-up period into account, the effectiveness of the LPP was somewhat greater than that of the short-term therapies. Especially the direct costs were, however, much higher in the LPP group than in the short-term therapy groups. Thus the long-term therapy can hardly be regarded as cost-effective compared to short-term therapies when patients are randomized to the therapy groups.

Risk of developing major depression and anxiety disorders among women with endometriosis: A longitudinal follow-up study,"Backgrounds: Several cross-sectional studies suggested a link between endometriosis and mood disorders. However, the temporal association between endometriosis and mood disorders (depression and anxiety disorders) is still unclear. Methods: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 10,439 women with endometriosis and 10,439 (1:1) age-/sex-matched controls between 1998 and 2009 were enrolled, and followed up to the end of 2011. Those who developed depression or anxiety disorders during the followup were identified. Results: Women with endometriosis had an increased risk of developing major depression (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.24–1.97), any depressive disorder (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.25–1.65), and anxiety disorders (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.22–1.70) in later life compared to those without endometriosis. Stratified by age group, women with endometriosis aged &lt; 40 years and those aged ≧ 40 years were both prone to developing major depression (HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.15–1.99; HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.09–2.62), any depressive disorder (HR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.21–1.69; HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.13–1.56), and anxiety disorders (HR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.14–1.71; HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.15–2.04). Limitation: the incidence of depression and anxiety disorders may be underestimated since only those who sought medical consultation and help would be enrolled in our study. Conclusion: Endometriosis was associated with an elevated likelihood of developing depression and anxiety disorders. Further studies may be required to investigate the underlying pathophysiology between endometriosis and both depression and anxiety disorders.

Clinical management of perinatal anxiety disorders: A systematic review,"Background: In the last few decades, there has been a growing interest in anxiety disorders (AnxD) in the perinatal period. Although AnxD are diagnosed in 4–39% of pregnant women and in up to 16% of women after delivery, evidence on their clinical management is limited. Methods: A systematic review was conducted on pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of AnxD in the perinatal period. Relevant papers published from January 1st 2015 were identified searching the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. Results: 18 articles met inclusion criteria. Selected studies supported the use of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD) and specific phobia both in pregnancy and postpartum. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) led to significant OCD and PD improvement both in pregnancy and postpartum with no side effects for the babies. In the largest clinical sample to date, 65% of postpartum patients who entered the open-label trial of fluvoxamine (up to 300 mg/day) experienced a 30% or greater decrease in the total score of the Yale–Brown Obsessive– Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). During pregnancy, SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) led to remission of panic symptoms and healthy outcomes for the babies. Limitations: Study design, mostly case reports, and enrolment of subjects mainly from outpatient specialty units might have limited community-wide generalisability. Conclusions: Keeping in mind the scantiness and heterogeneity of the available literature, the best interpretation of the available evidence appears to be that CBT should be the first treatment offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women with AnxD. However SSRIs can represent a first line treatment strategy, and not exclusively in cases where AnxD is refractory to CBT.

Predicting the transition from anxiety to depressive symptoms in early adolescence: Negative anxiety response style as a moderator of sequential comorbidity,"Background: Anxiety often precedes depression. The anxiety response styles theory of comorbidity suggests anxious individuals with a tendency to ruminate or make hopeless attributions about anxiety symptoms (negative anxiety response styles [NARS]) are more vulnerable to subsequent depressive symptoms. However, this theory has never been tested in adolescence, when the anxiety-depression transition may frequently occur, or using an extended (one-year) follow-up period. Method: 128 early adolescent girls ( M = 12.39 years) participated with caregivers in a one-year longitudinal study. At baseline and follow-up, participants completed diagnostic interviews and self-report measures assessing child NARS and brooding rumination. Results: T1 NARS predicted longitudinal elevations in depressive symptoms and increased associations between T1 anxiety and T2 depressive symptoms. Limitations: This study examines anxiety and depression comorbidity using a community sample. The sample is relatively low on sociodemographic diversity. Conclusions: Results support the anxiety response styles theory, with potential implications for early identification of anxious youth at risk for later development of comorbid depression.

Comorbidity variation in patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder according to symptom dimensions: Results from a large multicentre clinical sample,"Background: Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) has a heterogeneous and complex phenomenological picture, characterized by different symptom dimensions and comorbid psychiatric disorders, which frequently co-occur or are replaced by others over the illness course. To date, very few studies have investigated the associations between specific OCD symptom dimensions and comorbid disorders. Methods: Cross-sectional, multicenter clinical study with 1001 well-characterized OCD patients recruited within the Brazilian Research Consortium on Obsessive–Compulsive and Related Disorders. The primary instruments were the Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (DY-BOCS) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. Bivariate analyses between symptom dimensions and comorbidities were followed by logistic regression. Results: The most common comorbidities among participants (56.8% females) were major depression (56.4%), social phobia (34.6%), generalized anxiety disorder (34.3%), and specific phobia (31.4%). The aggressive dimension was independently associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), separation anxiety disorder, any impulse-control disorder and skin picking; the sexual-religious dimension was associated with mood disorders, panic disorder/agoraphobia, social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, non-paraphilic sexual disorder, any somatoform disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and tic disorders; the contamination-cleaning dimension was related to hypochondriasis; and the hoarding dimension was associated with depressive disorders, specific phobia, PTSD, impulse control disorders (compulsive buying, skin picking, internet use), ADHD and tic disorders. The symmetry-ordering dimension was not independently associated with any comorbidity. Limitations: Cross-sectional design; participants from only tertiary mental health services; personality disorders not investigated. Conclusions: Different OCD dimensions presented some specific associations with comorbid disorders, which may influence treatment seeking behaviors and response, and be suggestive of different underlying pathogenic mechanisms.

"Evaluation of Computerized Adaptive Tests (CATs) for longitudinal monitoring of depression, anxiety, and stress reactions","Background: Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) based on Item Response Theory, (IRT) offers an efficient way for accurate measurement of patient reported outcomes. The efficiency lies within a minimal response burden and a high measurement precision over a broad measurement range. The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the responsiveness of CATs measuring anxiety, depression, and stress reaction to standard static self-assessment tools. Methods: Longitudinal data of n = 595 psychosomatic inpatients were analyzed for evaluating retest-reliability and sensitivity to change of the CATs compared to static measures (GAD-7, PHQ-9, and PSQ) using correlational and ANOVA statistics. The study hypothesized that CATs are at least as retest-reliable and as sensitive to change as static tools. Results: The three CATs show a low burden for patients, administering on average 5–7 (±2–6SD) items with similar retest-reliability compared to the static tools applied (A-CAT: r = .78 vs. GAD-7: r = .75, D-CAT: r = .71 vs. PHQ-9: r = .75, S-CAT: r = .80 vs. PSQ worries scale: r = .80). The CATs were overall as sensitive to change as the static tools (Cohen's d ranged between .19 and .69). Limitations: This is a monocenter, observational, longitudinal study without external clinical criteria; thus generalization to other settings may be limited. Conclusions: The tested CATs belong to the first generation of CATs being used in daily routine for more than a decade. They are as retest reliable and sensitive to change as static tools. Newer CATs may provide further practical advantages.

Association of asthma and anxiety: A nationwide population-based study in Taiwan,"Background: Few studies have investigated the bidirectional relationship between asthma and anxiety; we sought to investigate asthma and anxiety in a large national sample. Methods: Cases were identified from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database with a new primary diagnosis of asthma (ICD-9:493) aged more than 15 years between 2000 and 2007. Case status required the presence of any inpatient diagnosis of asthma and/or at least one year diagnosis of asthma in outpatient service. These 22,797 cases were compared to 22,797 sex-, age-, residence- and insurance premium-matched controls and both groups were followed until the end of 2008 for instances of anxiety, defined as ICD-9 codes 300.0, 300.01, 300.02, 300.2, 300.21, 300.23, 300.3. Competing risk adjusted Cox regression analyses were applied, adjusting for sex, age, residence, insurance premium, prednisone use, Charlson comorbidity index, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression disorder, and hospital admission days for any disorder. The effect of asthma on the risk of panic disorder and the effect of anxiety disorder on the risk of later asthma were also examined as competing risk adjusted Cox regression analyses Results: Of the 45,594 subjects, 2792 were ascertained as having anxiety during a mean (SD) follow-up period of 5.3 (2.5) years. Asthma, females, older age, rural residence, depression disorder, and prednisone use were independent risks on anxiety in the fully adjusted model. Anxiety, older age, rural residence, and prednisone use were independent risks on asthma in the fully adjusted model. Limitations: The severity of asthma and anxiety disorder, the duration of prednisone treatment and adherence, stressful life events, smoking, family history and relationship were not evaluated. Conclusions: Bidirectional relationship between asthma and anxiety disorder was confirmed in this population, in dependent of a number of potential confounding factors.

"Sociodemographic, pregnancy, obstetric, and postnatal predictors of postpartum stress, anxiety and depression in new mothers","Background: The purpose of this paper was to evaluate relationships between sociodemographic, pregnancy, obstetric, and postnatal variables and postpartum depression, anxiety and stress levels in new mothers. Method: One-hundred-thirty-nine women completed the baseline questionnaire and 105 completed the follow-up questionnaire at 4–6 months postpartum. Sociodemographic and pregnancy factors were assessed at baseline, birth and postnatal factors were assessed at time 2, and depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed at both time points. Results: Caesarean delivery was associated with high postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Child sleep problems was related to depression, child health problems were related to anxiety, more SLE related to high stress, and maternal sleep problems were related to PPD. However, the results became non-significant after controlling for antenatal distress levels. Finally, women who underwent caesarean delivery had higher antenatal stress, anxiety, and depression levels, relative to women who did not undergo the procedure. Conclusion: Psychological stress and distress tended to persist in the women from the third-trimester of pregnancy to 4–6 months postpartum. It tended to occur in the context of caesarean delivery, maternal sleep problems, child's health and sleep problems, and stressful life-events.

Sex differences in the shared genetics of dimensions of self-reported depression and anxiety,"Background: The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms and their comorbidity varies between males and females for reasons still unknown. This study aims to test whether differences between males and females in self-reported symptoms and their covariation are caused by variations in the magnitude of genetic and environmental factors. Methods: 750 monozygotic and dizygotic healthy twin pairs (18–60 years; M = 39.77 years) participated in the TWIN-E project. Univariate and multivariate genetic modelling was undertaken using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-42). Results: Additive genetics and unique environment contributed to self-reported depression (heritability, h ²: 34%), anxiety ( h ²: 30%) and stress ( h ²: 34%) scores in univariate models, and to the common latent factor ( h ²: 39%) in the multivariate model. No sex differences in magnitude of estimates for DASS-42 scores were found in the univariate model. However when considering correlated depression and anxiety symptomatology only shared genetic factors between depression and anxiety contributed to depression scores in males, but both specific and shared genetic factors contributed to depression scores in females. Limitations: The results are limited to the sample of healthy, community, adult, same sex twin pairs who participated in the study. Conclusions: Differences in males and females in genetic aetiology of self-reported dimensions of depression are only apparent when taking into consideration the covariation with self-reported anxiety. This difference is highlighted by the finding that both common and specific genetic factors contribute to self-reported depression in females but not males. This novel finding may help explain the increased incidence of depression symptoms in females.

A preliminary investigation of a novel training to target cognitive biases towards negative social stimuli in Anorexia Nervosa,"Background: Patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) experience high levels of social difficulties and anxiety. These problems might be underpinned by negatively biased processing of social stimuli. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of using a novel Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) training to target information processing biases in patients with AN. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with AN completed a baseline and end of intervention assessment of mood and social appraisals. The CBM training consisted of 5 sessions and included an attentional probe task to train attention towards positive social stimuli and an ambiguous scenarios task to train benign or neutral interpretations of ambiguous social scenarios. Results: At baseline patients displayed an attention and interpretation bias towards negative social stimuli. At the end of intervention there was a medium sized increase in attention to positive faces and fewer negative interpretations of ambiguous social stimuli. There were also lower levels of anxiety and higher levels of self-compassion in response to a judgemental video clip. Limitations: The lack of a control group is the main limitation to this preliminary study as the changes obtained may have resulted from non-specific aspects of the inpatient treatment. Conclusions: A novel CBM training is associated with more positive processing of social information in AN. It would be of interest to test the hypothesis that reducing cognitive biases towards social stimuli impacts on wider features of an eating disorder.

Transdiagnostic mechanisms in depression and anxiety: The role of rumination and attentional control,"Background: Deficits in attentional control have been hypothesized to cause rumination, suggesting that the relationships between attentional control and clinical symptoms may be mediated in part by rumination. However, to date, no clinical study has examined these constructs transdiagnostically in a path analysis model. Methods: Fifty-one adults presenting for treatment completed measures of self-reported attentional control, rumination, and depression and anxiety symptoms. A bias-corrected path analysis-based approach was employed to test whether indirect (i.e., mediating) effects of rumination were significantly associated with the direct effects of attentional control on depression and anxiety symptoms. Separate models for depression and anxiety symptoms were tested along with reverse models using attentional control as a proposed mediator. Results: The relationship between attentional control and clinical symptomatology (i.e., both depression and anxiety symptoms) was mediated by rumination. Poor attentional control was associated with more rumination and consequently more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. The reverse relationship (i.e., attentional control mediating the relationship between rumination and depression or anxiety symptoms) was not significant. Limitations: Study design did not allow testing of temporal precedence for the mediation models. All constructs were assessed via self-report. Conclusions: Attentional control appears to impact depression and anxiety symptoms through rumination. The pathway between poor attentional control and emotion dysregulation via rumination suggests that interventions targeting attentional control may decrease maladaptive ruminative processes, leading to improved emotion regulation and reduced clinical symptomatology. Future studies should examine the stability of this mediational relationship over time (and in the face of targeted interventions).

Parental responsibility beliefs: Associations with parental anxiety and behaviours in the context of childhood anxiety disorders,"Background: High levels of parental anxiety are associated with poor treatment outcomes for children with anxiety disorders. Associated parental cognitions and behaviours have been implicated as impediments to successful treatment. We examined the association between parental responsibility beliefs, maternal anxiety and parenting behaviours in the context of childhood anxiety disorders. Methods: Anxious and non-anxious mothers of 7–12 year old children with a current anxiety disorder reported their parental responsibility beliefs using a questionnaire measure. Parental behaviours towards their child during a stressor task were measured. Results: Parents with a current anxiety disorder reported a greater sense of responsibility for their child's actions and wellbeing than parents who scored within the normal range for anxiety. Furthermore, higher parental responsibility was associated with more intrusive and less warm behaviours in parent–child interactions and there was an indirect effect between maternal anxiety and maternal intrusive behaviours via parental responsibility beliefs. Limitations: The sample was limited to a treatment-seeking, relatively high socio-economic population and only mothers were included so replication with more diverse groups is needed. The use of a range of stressor tasks may have allowed for a more comprehensive assessment of parental behaviours. Conclusions: The findings suggest that parental anxiety disorder is associated with an elevated sense of parental responsibility and may promote parental behaviours likely to inhibit optimum child treatment outcomes. Parental responsibility beliefs may therefore be important to target in child anxiety treatments in the context of parental anxiety disorders.

Interpretation of ambiguity: Differences between children and adolescents with and without an anxiety disorder,"Background: Theory and treatment of anxiety disorders in young people are commonly based on the premise that interpretation biases found in anxious adults are also found in children and adolescents. Although there is some evidence that this may be the case, studies have not typically taken age into account, which is surprising given the normative changes in cognition that occur throughout childhood. The aim of the current study was to identify whether associations between anxiety disorder status and interpretation biases differed in children and adolescents. Methods: The responses of children (7–10 years) and adolescents (13–16 years) with and without anxiety disorders ( n = 120) were compared on an ambiguous scenarios task. Results: Children and adolescents with an anxiety disorder showed significantly higher levels of threat interpretation and avoidant strategies than non-anxious children and adolescents. However, age significantly moderated the effect of anxiety disorder status on interpretation of ambiguity, in that adolescents with anxiety disorders showed significantly higher levels of threat interpretation and associated negative emotion than non-anxious adolescents, but a similar relationship was not observed among children. Conclusions: The findings suggest that theoretical accounts of interpretation biases in anxiety disorders in children and adolescents should distinguish between different developmental periods. For both ages, treatment that targets behavioral avoidance appears warranted. However, while adolescents are likely to benefit from treatment that addresses interpretation biases, there may be limited benefit for children under the age of ten.

Associations of maternal and paternal antenatal mood with offspring anxiety disorder at age 18 years,"Objective: Maternal antenatal depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of childhood behavioural and emotional problems in offspring; it remains unclear to what extent this is due to a maternal biological impact on foetal development. Here, we compare associations between maternal and paternal antenatal depression and anxiety with offspring anxiety disorders, thus controlling for some genetic and shared environmental factors. Methods: We used data from the ALSPAC population cohort including measures of antenatal parental depression and anxiety. At 18 years, offspring completed the CIS-R interview, yielding diagnoses for anxiety disorders. Results were adjusted for confounding variables including parental postnatal depression and anxiety. Results: Children of women with antenatal depression (18 weeks gestation), had an increased risk of anxiety disorders at 18 years of age (11.1% vs. 6.2%; adj. OR 1.75 (1.19, 2.58); p = 0.01). Children of women with antenatal anxiety had increased risk of co-morbid anxiety and depression (adj. OR 1.39 (1.06, 1.82); p = 0.02). No such associations were found with paternal antenatal depression or anxiety. Limitations: There was a high attrition rate from the original cohort to the CIS-R completion at 18 years postpartum. Parental mood was only assessed together at one time point during the antenatal period. Conclusions: The differences in the association between maternal and paternal mood during pregnancy and child outcomes supports the hypothesis that foetal programming may account, at least in part, for this association. We highlight the potential opportunity for preventative intervention by optimising antenatal mental health.

Self-reported stigma and symptoms of anxiety and depression in people with intellectual disabilities: Findings from a cross sectional study in England,"Background: No studies have investigated the relationship between self-reported stigma and multiple health outcomes in people with intellectual disabilities (ID). The association between self-reported stigma and symptoms of anxiety and depression (psychological distress), quality of life, service utilisation and adherence to treatment were examined. Method: Cross sectional study of 229 participants with ID (without mental illness) recruited from 12 centres in England. Results: Self-reported stigma was positively associated with psychological distress, and number of contacts with services, particularly contact with community intellectual disability services and the police, and negatively associated with quality of life. It was not associated with adherence to treatment. Self-reported stigma was also associated with refusal of at least one service in the last six months. The relationship between stigma and quality of life and stigma and service use were mediated by psychological distress. Limitations: The Cross-sectional design of this study prevents inferences being made about the direction of causality. IQ was not formally assessed but was based on clinical data. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that stigma may contribute to poor psychological health in people with ID, may be a burden on services due to higher service utilisation but may also prevent people from accessing appropriate services. Services should consider screening people at risk of psychological distress due to stigmatising treatment and provide appropriate support. There is an urgent need to develop evidence-based interventions to reduce societal stigma against people with ID and to reduce the impact of stigma when it is experienced by individuals with ID.

Long-term effects of cognitive therapy on biological rhythms and depressive symptoms: A randomized clinical trial,"Objective: To evaluate the effect of cognitive therapy on biological rhythm and depressive and anxious symptoms in a twelve-month follow-up period. In addition, correlations between the reduction of depression and anxiety symptoms and the regulation of biological rhythm were observed. Methods: This was a randomized clinical trial with young adults from 18 to 29 years of age who were diagnosed with depression. Two models of psychotherapy were used: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Narrative Cognitive Therapy (NCT). Biological rhythm was assessed with the Biological Rhythm Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN). Severity of depressive and anxious symptoms was assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), respectively. The sample included 97 patients who were divided within the protocols of psychotherapy. Results: There was a significant reduction in depressive and anxious symptoms ( p &lt; 0.001) and an increase on regulation of biological rhythm ( p &lt; 0.05) at the twelve-month follow-up. Moreover, we showed a positive correlation between the reduction of depressive symptoms and regulation of biological rhythm ( r = 0.638; p &lt; 0.001) and between the reduction of anxious symptoms and regulation of biological rhythm ( r = 0.438; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Both models showed that cognitive therapy was effective on the reduction of depressive and anxious symptoms and on the regulation of biological rhythm at a twelve-month follow-up evaluation. This study highlights the association between biological rhythm and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Limitation: We did not assess genetic, hormonal or neurochemical factors and we did not include patients under pharmaceutical treatment or those with severe symptomatology.

Anxiety symptoms are linked to new-onset suicidal ideation after six months of follow-up in outpatients with major depressive disorder,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 193 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2016-06001-028). In the original article, there were errors in Tables 1, 2, and 3. The corrected tables are provided in the erratum.] Background: Suicide risk evaluation is one of the most challenging assessments of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Initial risk evaluation might be insufficient in predicting emergence of suicidal ideation during the maintenance period. We aimed to elucidate factors associated with emergence or persistence of suicidal ideation 6 months after initiation of outpatient treatment in patients with MDD. Methods: A total of 300 participants with MDD defined by DSM-IV-TR criteria underwent face-to-face interview at baseline and follow-up phone interview at 6 months later. Severity of depression, suicidal ideation, and anxiety were evaluated. Results: Among participants who did not report any suicidal idea at baseline, 10.9% reported suicidal ideation during the 6-month phone interview, while 28.4% of participants who reported suicidal ideation at baseline reported suicidal ideation during the phone interview. No significant difference in remission rate of depression was observed between the groups, but subjects without suicidal ideation at baseline had a higher rate of symptom improvement at the 6-month phone interview. After controlling for age, sex, baseline severity of suicide risk and depression and lifetime history of suicide attempts, emergence of suicidal ideation was significantly associated with anxiety level at baseline ( t = 2.127, p = 0.039) and severity of depression symptoms at 6 month ( t = –3.028, p = 0.004); persistence of suicidal ideation was associated with severity of depression symptoms at 6 month ( t = –4.962, p &lt; 0.001). Limitation: Follow-up evaluation was done by phone interview. Conclusion: Anxiety at baseline needs to be carefully evaluated in assessing suicide risk of patients with MDD.

Self-images in the present and future: Role of affect and the bipolar phenotype,"Background: Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (BPSD) is associated with changes in self-related processing and affect, yet the relationship between self-image and affect in the BPSD phenotype is unclear. Methods: 47 young adults were assessed for hypomanic experiences (BPSD phenotype) using the Mood Disorders Questionnaire. Current and future self-images (e.g. I am… I will be…) were generated and rated for emotional valence, stability, and (for future self-images only) certainty. The relationship between self-image ratings and measures of affect (depression, anxiety and mania) were analysed in relation to the BPSD phenotype. Results: The presence of the BPSD phenotype significantly moderated the relationship between (1) affect and stability ratings for negative self-images, and (2) affect and certainty ratings for positive future self-images. Higher positivity ratings for current self-images were associated with lower depression and anxiety scores. Limitations: This was a non-clinical group of young adults sampled for hypomanic experiences, which limits the extension of the work to clinical levels of psychopathology. This study cannot address the causal relationships between affect, self-images, and BPSD. Future work should use clinical samples and experimental mood manipulation designs. Conclusions: BPSD phenotype can shape the relationship between affect and current and future self-images. This finding will guide future clinical research to elucidate BPSD vulnerability mechanisms and, consequently, the development of early interventions.

Psychometric properties and factor structure of the General Health Questionnaire as a screening tool for anxiety and depressive symptoms in a multi-national study of young adults,"Background: Globally, common psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) is a widely used questionnaire for screening or detecting common psychiatric disorders. The purpose of this study was to examine the reliability, construct validity and factor structure of the GHQ-12 in a large sample of African, Asian and South American young adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 9077 undergraduate students from Chile, Ethiopia, Peru and Thailand. Students aged 18–35 years were invited to complete a self-administered questionnaire that collected information about lifestyle, demographics, and GHQ-12. In each country, the construct validity and factorial structures of the GHQ-12 questionnaire were tested through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA). Results: Overall the GHQ-12 items showed good internal consistency across all countries as reflected by the Cronbach's alpha: Chile (0.86), Ethiopia (0.83), Peru (0.85), and Thailand (0.82). Results from EFA showed that the GHQ-12 had a two-factor solution in Chile, Ethiopia and Thailand, although a three-factor solution was found in Peru. These findings were corroborated by CFA. Indicators of goodness of fit, comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root mean squared residual, were all in acceptable ranges across study sites. The CFI values for Chile, Ethiopia, Peru and Thailand were 0.964, 0.951, 0.949, and 0.931, respectively. The corresponding RMSEA values were 0.051, 0.050, 0.059, and 0.059. Conclusion: Overall, we documented cross-cultural comparability of the GHQ-12 for assessing common psychiatric disorders such as symptoms of depressive and anxiety disorders among young adults. Although the GHQ-12 is typically used as single-factor questionnaire, the results of our EFA and CFA revealed the multi- dimensionality of the scale. Future studies are needed to further evaluate the specific cut points for assessing each component within the multiple factors.

Obesity and anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum: A systematic review,"Background: Obesity and anxiety during the perinatal period are common and associated with poor health outcomes for the mother and the child. Despite the well-documented health risks of both pregnancy obesity and anxiety, associations between the two have rarely been explored. With this review we aim to provide a systematic overview of the current state of evidence concerning associations between ante- and postnatal anxiety and pregnancy obesity, excessive gestational weight gain, and postpartum weight retention. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, and PsychINFO. Results: 13 Records matched our inclusion criteria. Five out of seven studies focusing on pregnancy obesity and anxiety suggest a positive association with ante- or postnatal anxiety. Surprisingly, no study examined anxiety disorders according to DSM and it remains unknown whether anxiety symptomatology reaches clinical relevance. Results from a small number of life-style intervention studies ( n = 3) suggest that interventions could benefit from a stronger focus on mental health. There were not enough studies on associations between excessive gestational weight gain ( n = 2) or postpartum weight retention ( n = 3) and anxiety making it difficult to draw conclusions about possible associations. Limitation: The number of included studies is rather small and studies were included irrespective of the study quality which might limit the generalizability of the results. Conclusions: The majority of the included studies suggest that obese pregnant women might constitute a subgroup that is especially vulnerable for comorbid anxiety and in need of targeted psychological support. However, further high-quality studies, particularly including anxiety disorders, are needed.

5 Hz Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to left prefrontal cortex for major depression,"Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to left prefrontal cortex at 10 Hz is the most commonly utilized protocol for major depressive disorder (MDD). Published data suggests that left sided 5 Hz rTMS may be efficacious and well tolerated. Objective: We analyzed outcomes in a naturalistic cohort of MDD patients who could not tolerate 10 Hz rTMS and were routinely switched to 5 Hz. We hypothesized that the efficacy of 5 Hz rTMS would be equivalent to 10 Hz. Methods: Records were reviewed for patients ( n = 98) who received 15 or more acute rTMS treatments. The sample was split based upon the frequency (10 or 5 Hz) at which the majority of treatments were delivered. The Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS-SR) and 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to evaluate outcomes. Results: Baseline IDS-SR was higher in the 5 Hz ( n = 27) than in the 10 Hz ( n = 71) group ( p &lt; .05), as was frequency of comorbid anxiety ( p = .002). Depression outcomes did not differ between groups, and there were no differences in response or remission rates (all p &gt; .1). Statistical power was sufficient to detect small group differences ( d = .26). Limitations: Open-label data in a naturalistic setting. Conclusion: Outcomes associated with 5 Hz rTMS did not differ from 10 Hz, despite higher baseline depressive symptom severity and anxiety in 5 Hz patients. 5Hz stimulation may be an alternative treatment option for patients unable to tolerate 10 Hz rTMS.

BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and plasma levels in Chinese Han population with obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Anxiety disorders are a category of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear, which include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) used to be categorized as anxiety disorder in DSM-IV. However OCD was no longer included in anxiety disorders and came into its own category titled as Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (OCRD) in DSM-5. It will be interesting to explore is there any different biological characteristics between OCD and anxiety disorders. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was a potential candidate gene in both OCD and GAD. The results of genetic association studies between BDNF and OCD have been inconsistent. BDNF plasma/serum levels in OCD have been found lower than those in healthy controls. However the heritable reason of the lowered BDNF levels was not well elucidated. The amount of studies about BDNF and GAD were relatively small. The aims of this study were to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphism Val66Met of BDNF was associated with OCD and GAD, to examine BDNF plasma levels in OCD and GAD, and to explore whether Val66Met variation influences BDNF plasma levels. Methods: We genotyped Val66Met variation in 148 OCD patients, 108 GAD patients and 99 healthy controls. Within the same sample, BDNF plasma levels were determined in 113 OCD patients, 102 GAD patients and 63 healthy controls. Results: Val66Met variation was not associated with OCD or GAD. BDNF plasma levels in OCD and GAD patients were significant lower than those in healthy controls. Val66Met variation had no influence on BDNF plasma levels. No difference was found between OCD and GAD. Results do not change no matter taking OCD and GAD as one group or separated two. Limitations: First, the sample size for genotyping was relatively small, which leaded to a low statistical power of the genetic part in this study. Second, we genotyped just one SNP in BDNF gene. Third, parts of the participants did not be assayed for BDNF plasma levels. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that BDNF is involved in the pathophysiology of mental disorders, not only OCD but also GAD. OCD and GAD patients both show lower BDNF plasma levels compared to healthy controls. The BDNF plasma levels are not associated with Val66Met variation.

Threat to democracy: Physical and mental health impact of democracy movement in Hong Kong,"Background: This study examined the prevalence and critical predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms and self-rated health, following the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. Methods: Random digit dialing recruited a population-representative sample of 1208 Chinese Hong Kong citizens (mean age = 46.89 years; 63% female) in the first two weeks of February 2015. Respondents gave their informed consent and reported personal, social, and economic resource loss since the Umbrella Movement (Conservation of Resources-Evaluation), current anxiety symptoms (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and self-rated health (1 = very good , 4 = very bad ). Results: A total of 47.35% (95% CI = 44.55, 50.17) respondents reported moderate/severe anxiety symptoms and 14.4% (95% CI = 12.54, 16.50) reported moderate/severe depressive symptoms; 9.11% (95% CI = 7.61, 10.86) reported “poor” or “very poor” health. Multivariable regressions revealed that personal and social resource loss was associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms and greater odds of “very poor” health (adjusted odds ratios/incidence rate ratios = 5–102%), independent of lower education level and income and being unmarried. Limitations: This study was cross-sectional in nature and thus could not determine causality from the associations between resource loss and outcome variables. Second, the telephone survey relied on self-reports; response bias and social desirability could influence respondents' answers and discount data validity. Third, potential confounders such as preexisting mental and physical health issues and concurrent predictors like exposure to the Umbrella Movement were not assessed. Conclusions: This is one of the first studies following any recent political movement (e.g., The Arab Spring) to quantify distress and the associated correlates of distress among affected citizens. Perceived psychosocial resource losses were critical predictors of poor outcomes.

Detecting the severity of perinatal anxiety with the Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale (PASS),"Background: The Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale (PASS; Somerville et al., 2014) reliably identifies perinatal women at risk of problematic anxiety when a clinical cut-off score of 26 is used. This study aimed to identify a severity continuum of anxiety symptoms with the PASS to enhance screening, treatment and research for perinatal anxiety. Methods: Antenatal and postnatal women ( n = 410) recruited from the antenatal clinics and mental health services at an obstetric hospital completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Spielberg State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI), and the PASS. The women referred to mental health services were assessed to determine anxiety diagnoses via a diagnostic interview conducted by an experienced mental health professional from the Department of Psychological Medicine—King Edward Memorial Hospital. Three normative groups for the PASS, namely minimal anxiety, mild–moderate anxiety, and severe anxiety , were identified based on the severity of anxiety indicated on the standardised scales and anxiety diagnoses. Results: Two cut-off points for the normative groups were calculated using the Jacobson–Truax method (Jacobson and Truax, 1991) resulting in three severity ranges: ‘minimal anxiety’; ‘mild–moderate anxiety’; and ‘severe anxiety’. Limitations: The most frequent diagnoses in the study sample were adjustment disorder, mixed anxiety and depression, generalised anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. This may limit the generalisability of the severity range results to other anxiety diagnoses including obsessive compulsive disorder and specific phobia. Conclusions: Severity ranges for the PASS add value to having a clinically validated cut-off score in the detection and monitoring of problematic perinatal anxiety. The PASS can now be used to identify risk of an anxiety disorder and the severity ranges can indicate developing risk for early referrals for further assessments, prioritisation of access to resources and tracking of clinically significant deterioration, improvement or stability in anxiety over time.

Depression symptoms during pregnancy: Evidence from &lt;i&gt;Growing Up in New Zealand&lt;/i&gt;,"Background: Depression during pregnancy has significant implications for pregnancy outcomes and maternal and child health. There is a need to identify which family, physical and mental health factors are associated with depression during pregnancy. Methods: An ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of 5664 pregnant women living in New Zealand completed a face-to-face interview during the third trimester. Antenatal depression (AD) symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Maternal demographic, physical and mental health, and family and relationship characteristics were measured. The association between symptoms of AD and maternal characteristics was determined using multiple logistic regression. Results: 11.9% of the participating women had EPDS scores (13+) that indicated probable AD. When considering sociodemographic predictors of AD symptoms, we found that women from non-European ethnicities, specifically Pacific Islander, Asian and other, were more likely to suffer from AD symptoms. Greater perceived stress during pregnancy and a diagnosis of anxiety both before and during pregnancy were also associated with greater odds of having AD according to the EPDS. Limitations: The women were in their third trimester of pregnancy at the interview. Therefore, we cannot discount the possibility of recall bias for questions relating to pre-pregnancy status or early-pregnancy behaviours. Conclusions: AD is prevalent amongst New Zealand women. Ethnicity, perceived stress and anxiety are particularly associated with a greater likelihood of depression during pregnancy. Further attention to supporting maternal mental health status in the antenatal period is required.

Explicit verbal memory impairments associated with brain functional deficits and morphological alterations in patients with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with brain function and morphological alterations. This study investigated explicit verbal memory impairment in patients with GAD in terms of brain functional deficits in combination with morphologic changes. Methods: Seventeen patients with GAD and 17 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and education level underwent high-resolution T1-weighted MRI and fMR imaging at 3 T during explicit verbal memory tasks with emotionally neutral and anxiety-inducing words. Results: In response to the neutral words, the patients showed significantly lower activities in the regions of the hippocampus (Hip), middle cingulate gyrus (MCG), putamen (Pu) and head of the caudate nucleus (HCd) compared with healthy controls. In response to the anxiety-inducing words, the patients showed significantly higher activities in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and precentral gyrus. However, they showed lower activities in the Hip, MCG, Pu and HCd. In addition, patients with GAD showed a significant reduction in gray matter volumes, especially in the regions of the Hip, midbrain, thalamus, insula and superior temporal gyrus, compared with healthy controls. Limitations: This study examined a small sample sizes in each of the groups, and there was no consideration of a medication effect on brain activity and volume changes. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for the association between brain functional deficits and morphometric alterations in an explicit verbal memory task for patients with GAD. This finding is helpful for understanding explicit verbal memory impairment in connection with GAD symptoms.

"Examination of the interrelations between the factors of PTSD, major depression, and generalized anxiety disorder in a heterogeneous trauma-exposed sample using DSM 5 criteria","Exposure to traumatic events places individuals at high risk for multiple psychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The high rates of comorbidity among these conditions merit evaluation in order to improve diagnosis and treatment approaches. The current study evaluated the association between PTSD, MDD, and GAD factors as presented in the DSM 5. 602 trauma-exposed individuals who experienced an event that met Criterion A for the DSM 5 PTSD diagnosis were recruited through Amazon.com, Inc.'s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to complete an assessment of the impact of stressful events on their lives. High interrelations were detected among the 4 PTSD factors, 2 MDD factors that corresponded to somatic and affective symptoms, and the single GAD factor. The affective factor of MDD was most strongly related to the emotional numbing factor of PTSD, whereas the somatic factor of MDD was most strongly related to the hyperarousal factor of PTSD. The GAD factor was most strongly related to the hyperarousal factor of PTSD, relative to the other PTSD factors. The strength of the interrelations between factors of the three disorders is largely a function of the overlap in symptoms and calls into question the uniqueness of negative affective symptoms of PTSD, MDD and GAD. Results suggest that improved understanding of the trauma reaction requires a focus on the unique presentation of each individual and assessment of multiple disorders.

Adolescent coping profiles differentiate reports of depression and anxiety symptoms,"The purpose of the study was to identify groups of adolescents based on their reported use of different coping strategies and compare levels of depression and anxiety symptoms across the groups. Tenth and eleventh grade public school students ( N = 982; 51% girls; 66% Caucasian; M age = 16.04, SD = 0.73) completed a battery of self-report measures that assessed their use of different coping strategies, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Latent profile analysis (LPA) classified the participants into four distinct groups based on their responses on subscales of the COPE inventory (Carver et al., 1989). Groups differed in amount of coping with participants in each group showing relative preference for engaging in certain strategies over others. Disengaged copers reported the lowest amounts of coping with a preference for avoidance strategies. Independent copers reported moderate levels of coping with relatively less use of support-seeking. Social support-seeking copers and active copers reported the highest levels of coping with a particular preference for support-seeking strategies. The independent copers reported the lowest levels of depressive symptoms compared to the three other groups. The Social Support Seeking and Active Coping Groups reported the highest levels of anxiety. Although distinct coping profiles were observed, findings showed that adolescents between the ages of 14 and 16 engage in multiple coping strategies and are more likely to vary in their amount of coping than in their use of specific strategies.

Correlates of residual fatigue in patients with major depressive disorder: The role of psychotropic medication,"Objective: Fatigue is not only a core symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD), but also a common residual symptom. We determined the sociodemographic, clinical, and pharmacologic factors that were associated with fatigue in patients with remission or partial remission of MDD. Methods: Data was derived from a randomized controlled trial of acupuncture in 137 MDD patients with residual symptoms. Fatigue was measured by Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20). Self-report and clinician-rated scales were used to assess psychopathology. 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS₁₇) score ≤7 denoted MDD remission. Results: Participants’ average HDRS₁₇ score was 10.5; 29.2% were in remission. The average MFI-20 score was 71.8; 83.2% had severe fatigue, defined as MFI-20 score ≥60. Fifty-two of 137 participants (38%) were using sedating psychotropic medications. Antidepressant dosage ranged from 1–90mg fluoxetine equivalent and sedatives/hypnotics from 1–60 mg diazepam equivalent. There were significant correlations between MFI-20 score and HDRS₁₇ depression and anxiety subscores, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) depression and anxiety subscores, and Pain Catastrophizing Scale score, but insomnia and daytime sleepiness, sociodemographics, current medical conditions, and psychotropic medication use were not significant correlates. Upon multiple regression, HADS and HDRS₁₇ depression scores independently predicted MFI-20 score. In remission and partial remission subgroups, HADS depression score was an independent predictor. Limitation: Participants were recruited from specialty psychiatric units; hence the findings may not be applicable in non-specialized settings. Conclusion: Fatigue was predicted by depression severity in remitted or partially remitted MDD. Psychotropic medication and higher dosage were not associated with greater fatigue.

Life Adaptation Skills Training (LAST) for persons with depression: A randomized controlled study,"Bakground: To investigate the efficacy of the “Life Adaptation Skills Training (LAST)” program for persons with depression. Methods: Sixty-eight subjects with depressive disorder were recruited from psychiatric outpatient clinics in Taipei city and were randomly assigned to either an intervention group ( N = 33), or a control group ( N = 35). The intervention group received 24-sessions of the LAST program, as well as phone contact mainly related to support for a total of 24 times. The control group only received phone contact 24 times. The primary outcome measure utilized was the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF-Taiwan version. Secondary outcome measures included the Occupational self-assessment, the Mastery scale, the Social support questionnaire, the Beck anxiety inventory, the Beck depression inventory-II, and the Beck scale for suicide ideation. The mixed-effects linear model was applied to analyze the incremental efficacy of the LAST program, and the partial eta squared (η p ²) was used to examine the within- and between- group effect size. Results: The subjects who participated in the LAST program showed significant incremental improvements with moderate to large between-group effect sizes on their level of anxiety (−5.45 ± 2.34, p &lt; 0.05; η p ² = 0.083) and level of suicidal ideation (−3.09 ± 1.11, p &lt; 0.01; η p ² = 0.157) when compared to the control group. The reduction of suicidal ideations had a maintenance effect for three months after the end of intervention (−3.44 ± 1.09, p &lt; 0.01), with moderate between-group effect sizes (η p ²=0.101). Both groups showed significant improvement on overall QOL, overall health, physical QOL, psychological QOL, level of anxiety, and level of depression. The within-group effect sizes achieved large effects in the intervention group (η p ² = 0.328–0.544), and were larger than that of the control group. Limitations: A small sample size in the study, a high dropout rate, lower compliance rates for the intervention group, and lacking of true control group. Conclusions: The occupation-based LAST program, which focuses on lifestyle rearrangement and coping skills enhancement, could significantly improve the level of anxiety and suicidal ideations for persons with depression.

Suggestibility as a predictor of response to antidepressants: A preliminary prospective trial,"Background: The growing awareness that so many do not respond adequately to antidepressant (AD) pharmacotherapy has sparked research seeking to characterize those who do. While the pharmacological mechanisms of AD treatment have been extensively evaluated, much remains unknown about the placebo component of the response to medication. This study examined the association between suggestibility levels and response to ADs amongst depressed patients. Methods: Twenty unipolar depression outpatients, recruited before starting AD monotherapy, received clear, standardized instructions that the therapeutic effects of AD, though not side effects, would require 2–4 weeks. At baseline (T1), 1 week (T2), and 1 month (T3), participants were evaluated for depressive symptoms, using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 items (HAM-D); for anxiety by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A); for side effects by the Antidepressant Side Effect Checklist (ASEC); and for suggestibility, using the Multidimensional Iowa Suggestibility Scale (MISS). Results: High levels of baseline suggestibility were associated with less improvement in depression level and more side-effects during the first week. In accordance with our hypothesis the more suggestible patients improved more between T2 and T3. No significant correlations were found between baseline suggestibility levels and change in anxiety. Limitations: Small sample size and a self-report questionnaire assessing suggestibility were limitations. Conclusion: This study offers a potentially new and clinically useful approach to understanding and predicting who will respond to AD treatment. Suggestibility seems to play a role, presumably by shaping expectation, in response to AD treatment. We hope that this avenue will be further explored.

Evaluation of affective temperament and anxiety–depression levels of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome,"Background: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are reported to experience depressive episodes at a higher rate than healthy controls (HC). Affective temperament features are psychiatric markers that may help to predict and identify vulnerability to depression in women with PCOS. Our aim was to evaluate the affective temperaments of women with PCOS and to investigate the association with depression and anxiety levels and laboratory variables in comparison with HC. Methods: The study included 71 women with PCOS and 50 HC. Hormonal evaluations were performed for women with PCOS. Physical examination, clinical history, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and TEMPS-A were performed for all subjects. Differences between groups were evaluated using Student's t -tests and Mann–Whitney U tests. Correlations and logistic regression tests were performed. Results: All temperament subtype scores, except hyperthymic, and HADS anxiety, depression, and total scores were significantly higher in patients with PCOS compared to HC. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between BMI and irritable temperament, and insulin and HADS depression scores in patients with PCOS. Additionally, hirsutism score and menstrual irregularity were correlated with HADS depression, anxiety and total scores in PCOS patients. In logistic regression analysis, depression was not affected by PCOS, hirsutism score or menstrual irregularity. However, HADS anxiety score was associated with hirsutism score. Conclusions: Our study is the first to evaluate the affective temperament features of women with PCOS. Consequently, establishing affective temperament properties for women with PCOS may help clinicians predict those patients with PCOS who are at risk for depressive and anxiety disorders.

"Influence of anxiety symptoms on improvement of neurocognitive functions in patients with major depressive disorder: A 12-week, multicenter, randomized trial of tianeptine versus escitalopram, the CAMPION study","Background: Previous research has reported evidence that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) show anxiety symptoms and neurocognitive impairments. However, the influence of anxiety on neurocognitive function in MDD patients during antidepressant treatment is unclear. Method: MDD patients ( n = 164) completed a 12-week, multicenter, randomized trial assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either tianeptine or escitalopram. Changes of anxiety symptoms were assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), self-rated subjective cognitive impairment on memory and concentration, the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Continuous Performance Test (CPT), Verbal Learning Test (VLT), and Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) were assessed every 4 weeks. Results: During 12 weeks of treatment, decrease in the HAM-A score was significantly associated with improvement of subjective cognitive impairments on memory ( p &lt; 0.001) and concentration ( p &lt; 0.001), and objective measures on delayed memory ( p = 0.006) and reasoning ability ( p = 0.002), after adjusting for covariates such as baseline HAM-A scores, time, sex, age, education years and assigned medication using the Mixed effects and Generalized Estimated Equation model analysis. However, the other cognitive outcome variables, immediate memory, commission error, and MMSE, which showed significant improvement through 12-week study period, showed no significant association with improvement of anxiety. Conclusion: Improvement of anxiety symptoms was significantly associated with improvement in subjective and objective neurocognitive functions such as delayed memory and reasoning ability in elderly MDD patients during antidepressant treatment, but not significantly associated with improvement of immediate memory and commission error.

"Anti-anxiety efficacy of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga in general anxiety disorder: A multicomponent, yoga based, breath intervention program for patients suffering from generalized anxiety disorder with or without comorbidities","Background: Surdashan Kriya Yoga (SKY) is a procedure that in various studies, has shown evidences of efficacy in alleviating Depression and Anxiety disorders, but in Europe and USA it has not been studied yet on a Caucasian population as an adjunct therapy for psychiatric Disorders. Methods: The study involved a sample of consenting women and men ( n = 69) who received SKY therapy for a six-month time period. They were assessed at recruitment, after two weeks, after three months and after six months using Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HRSA), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (ZSAS), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS) and Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90). Results: All the analyses have shown that SKY therapy significantly reduces the scores of Anxiety and Depression. This is plain, especially after the initial SKY treatment, which is followed by a long plateau phase that seems to verge on no Anxiety/Depression scores. It was found that SKY effects lead to a significant convergence between the self-assessment (Zung Self-Rating Scale) and hetero-assessment (Hamilton Rating Scale). Limitations: The study should be replicated on a larger clinical sample in a controlled trial to learn more about the effectiveness of SKY Protocol. Conclusions: Participation in SKY adjunct therapy ten days intense workshop and follow-ups, coupled with daily individual and independent practice of a simplified protocol of breathing techniques (30min), can lead to significant reduction in levels of Anxiety and Depression.

"A meta-analysis of perceptions of defeat and entrapment in depression, anxiety problems, posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicidality","Background: There is a burgeoning literature examining perceptions of being defeated or trapped in different psychiatric disorders. The disorders most frequently examined to date are depression, anxiety problems, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidality. Aims: To quantify the size and consistency of perceptions of defeat and entrapment in depression, anxiety problems, PTSD and suicidality, test for differences across psychiatric disorders, and examine potential moderators and publication bias. Method: Random-effects meta-analyses based on Pearson's correlation coefficient r. Results: Forty studies were included in the meta-analysis ( n = 10,072). Perceptions of defeat and entrapment were strong (around r = 0.60) and similar in size across all four psychiatric disorders. Perceptions of defeat were particularly strong in depression ( r = 0.73). There was no between-study heterogeneity; therefore moderator analyses were conducted in an exploratory fashion. There was no evidence of publication bias. Limitations: Analyses were cross-sectional, which precludes establishing temporal precedence or causality. Some of the meta-analyses were based on relatively small numbers of effect sizes, which may limit their generalisability. Conclusions: Perceptions of defeat and entrapment are clinically important in depression, anxiety problems, PTSD, and suicidality. Similar-sized, strong relationships across four different psychiatric disorders could suggest that perceptions of defeat and entrapment are transdiagnostic constructs. The results suggest that clinicians and researchers need to become more aware of perceptions of defeat and entrapment.

Frontal cortex absolute beta power measurement in Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia patients,"Panic disorder patients are hypervigilant to danger cues and highly sensitive to unpredictable aversive events, what leads to anticipatory anxiety, that is one key component of the disorder maintenance. Prefrontal cortex seems to be involved in these processes and beta band activity may be related to the involvement of top-down processing, whose function is supposed to be disrupted in pathological anxiety. The objective of this study was to measure frontal absolute beta-power (ABP) with qEEG in panic disorder and agoraphobia (PDA) patients compared to healthy controls. Methods: qEEG data were acquired while participants (24 PDA patients and 21 controls) watched a computer simulation (CS), consisting of moments classified as “high anxiety” (HAM) and “low anxiety” (LAM). qEEG data were also acquired during two rest conditions, before and after the computer simulation display. The statistical analysis was performed by means of a repeated measure analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) and ABP was the dependent variable of interest. The main hypothesis was that a higher ABP in PDA patients would be found related to controls. Moreover, in HAM the ABP would be different than in LAM. Results: the main finding was an interaction between the moment and group for the electrodes F7, F8, Fp1 and Fp2. We observed a higher ABP in PDA patients when compared to controls while watching the CS. The higher beta-power in the frontal cortex for the PDA group may reflect a state of high excitability, together with anticipatory anxiety and maintenance of hypervigilant cognitive state. Conclusions: our results suggest a possible deficiency in top-down processing reflected by a higher ABP in the PDA group while watching the CS and they highlight the recruitment of prefrontal regions during the exposure to anxiogenic stimuli. Limitations: the small sample, the wide age range of participants and the use of psychotropic medications by most of the PDA patients.

"Effectiveness of a stepped care intervention for anxiety and depression in people with diabetes, asthma or COPD in primary care: A randomized controlled trial","Background: Depression and anxiety are common in people with a chronic somatic disease. Although guidelines recommend stepped care, the effectiveness of this approach has not been evaluated in people with diabetes, asthma, or COPD in primary care. Methods: 3559 People were sent screening questionnaires (41% response). Of 286 persons with anxiety and/or depression (Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire, GAD-7, cut-off ≥ 8 and/or Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9, cut-off ≥ 7), 46 were randomized into the intervention (stepped care and monitoring of symptoms; n = 23) or control (usual care) group ( n = 23). Main outcomes were symptoms of anxiety and depression after the 12-months intervention and six months post intervention. Analysis of covariance was first adjusted for condition and baseline GAD-7/PHQ-9 scores and additionally for age, sex and education. Results: The intervention group had a significantly lower level of anxiety symptoms at the end of the program (GAD-7 6 ± 6 vs. 9 ± 6; Cohen's d = 0.61). This effect was still present six months post intervention. The effect on depression was statistically significant in the first model (PHQ-9 6 ± 4 vs. 9 ± 6; p = 0.035), but not in the fully adjusted model ( p = 0.099), despite a large effect size ( d = 0.63). At six months post intervention there was no statistically significant difference in symptoms of depression between the two groups although the difference in symptoms was still clinically significant (Cohen's d = 0.61). Limitations: Many people were screened, but relatively few participated in the randomized controlled trial. Conclusions: Stepped care with monitoring resulted in a lower level of symptoms of anxiety and depression in people with a chronic condition.

Anxiety sensitivity and intolerance of uncertainty as potential risk factors for cyberchondria: A replication and extension examining dimensions of each construct,"Background: Preliminary findings suggest that anxiety sensitivity (AS) and intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may confer vulnerability for cyberchondria, defined as repeated internet searches for medical information that exacerbates health anxiety. Prior studies are limited because it remains unclear whether specific AS or IU dimensions differentially relate to certain cyberchondria dimensions. Methods: The present study examined associations among AS, IU, and cyberchondria dimensions using a sample of community adults ( N = 578) located in the United States. Results: As predicted, physical AS and inhibitory IU were the only AS or IU dimensions to share unique associations with the distress cyberchondria dimension after controlling for the overlap among the AS dimensions, IU dimensions, and health anxiety. Cognitive AS and social AS unexpectedly evidenced unique associations with cyberchondria dimensions. Limitations: The results are limited by the cross-sectional study design and use of a community, rather than clinical, sample. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that specific AS and IU dimensions may confer vulnerability to certain cyberchondria dimensions. Further clarifying associations among AS, IU, and cyberchondria may lead to improvements in our conceptualization and, ultimately, treatment of cyberchondria.

Music therapy as an adjunct to standard treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder and co-morbid anxiety and depression: A randomized clinical trial,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 222 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2017-32817-009). In the original article, the author Shahrzad's name has been changed to Melina. The correct identification is Melina Shiranibidabadi and email address: Melinashirani@miau.ac.ir.] Background: Previous studies have highlighted the potential therapeutic benefits of music therapy as an adjunct to standard care, in a variety of psychiatric ailments including mood and anxiety disorders. However, the role of music in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) have not been investigated to date. Methods: In a single-center, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial (NCT02314195) 30 patients with OCD were randomly assigned to standard treatment (pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavior therapy) plus 12 sessions of individual music therapy ( n = 15) or standard treatment only ( n = 15) for one month. Maudsley Obsessive–Compulsive Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-Short Form were administered baseline and after one month. Results: Thirty patients completed the study. Music therapy resulted in a greater decrease in total obsessive score (post-intervention score: music therapy + standard treatment: 12.4 ± 1.9 vs standard treatment only: 15.1 ± 1.7, p &lt; 0.001, effect size = 56.7%). For subtypes, significant between-group differences were identified for checking ( p = 0.004), and slowness ( p = 0.019), but not for washing or responsibility. Music therapy was significantly more effective in reducing anxiety (post-intervention score: music therapy+standard treatment: 16.9 ± 7.4 vs standard treatment only: 22.9 ± 4.6, p &lt; 0.001, effect size = 47.0%), and depressive symptoms (post-intervention score: music therapy+standard treatment: 10.8 ± 3.8 vs standard treatment: 17.1 ± 3.7, p &lt; 0.001, effect size = 47.0%). Limitations: Inclusion of a small sample size, lack of blinding due to the nature of the intervention, short duration of follow-up. Conclusion: In patients with OCD, music therapy, as an adjunct to standard care, seems to be effective in reducing obsessions, as well as co-morbid anxiety and depressive symptoms.

The relationship between depression and generalized anxiety during intensive psychological and pharmacological treatment,"Background: In the present study we examined the relationship between depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety symptoms during intensive cognitive-behavioral and pharmacological treatment. Method: Individuals ( n = 157) with major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 83), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 29) and their combination ( n = 45) who attended an intensive partial hospital treatment program, completed daily self-report measures of depression and generalized anxiety. Treatment included empirically-based cognitive-behavioral interventions in both individual and group format, as well as pharmacotherapy. Results: Multilevel linear modeling indicated that for all diagnostic groups, changes in depressive symptoms led to changes in generalized anxiety symptoms to a greater extent than vice versa during treatment. Moreover, changes in depressive symptoms fully mediated changes in generalized anxiety symptoms, whereas changes in generalized anxiety symptoms only partially mediated the changes in depressive symptoms. Limitations: Partial hospital setting. Conclusions: Our results suggest that depressive symptoms may play a prominent role in the process of change in both MDD and GAD. This has implications for the classification of GAD as well as for choosing early treatment targets for individuals with comorbid MDD and GAD.

Out of the blue: Untangling the association between impulsivity and planning in self-harm,"Background: Planned and unplanned acts of self-harm may have distinct clinical and psychological correlates. Trait impulsivity is one factor that might be expected to determine whether self-harm is planned. Research so far has focussed on suicide attempts and little is known about how individuals engaging in planned and unplanned acts of self-harm differ. The aim of the current study was to examine how individuals who report planned self-harm, unplanned self-harm, and no self-harm differ in terms of impulsivity and affective symptoms (depression, anxiety, and activated mood). Method: An online survey of University students ( n = 1350) was undertaken including measures of impulsivity, affective symptoms and self-harm. Analyses made use of a multinomial logistic regression model with affective and cognitive forms of impulsivity estimated as latent variables. Results: Trait affective impulsivity, but not cognitive, was a general risk factor for whether self-harm occurred. There was no evidence of differences between planned and unplanned self-harm. Affective symptoms of depression and anxiety mediated the relationship between affective impulsivity and self-harm. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional, relied on a student sample which may not generalise to other populations. Conclusions: Trait affective impulsivity is associated with self-harm but it appears to be mediated by depression and anxiety symptoms. The exact relationships between trait affective impulsivity, depression, anxiety and self-harm require further longitudinal research in clinical populations but might lead to improved risk assessment and new therapeutic approaches to self-harm.

The validity of the symptom checklist depression and anxiety subscales: A general population study in Sweden,"Background: The Symptom Checklist (SCL) is used as a screening tool in patient settings, but is also used as a diagnostic proxy for depression and anxiety in public health surveys. However, there are few validation studies based on general population samples. This study aims to validate the SCL subscales for depression and anxiety in a general population sample in Stockholm, Sweden. Methods: We used a stratified random sample answering first a postal questionnaire covering SCL ( n = 8613) and then a semi-structured psychiatric interview based using Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, n = 881). Agreement between SCL depression (SCL-DEP) and anxiety (SCL-ANX) scales and their respective DSM-IV disorder was examined by ROC analysis. Discriminant analysis was performed with factor analysis on the SCL depression and anxiety items. The SCL-DEP scale was also compared with the ability of the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) in detecting depressive disorders. Results: A factor analysis with two factors differentiated the two subscales, with some cross loading items. The SCL-DEP and ANX subscales agreement with depression and anxiety disorders was good. SCL-DEP MDI performed better in detecting DSM-IV depression. Limitations: The questionnaire only included the SCL depression, anxiety and hostility subscales and not the full SCL-90. Also, no other anxiety scale was available for comparison. Conclusion: We conclude that depression and anxiety subscales are suitable instrument for proxies of depression and anxiety disorder in public health surveys.

Methods: This study employed the Delphi methodology to establish expert consensus on parenting strategies that are important for preventing depression or anxiety disorders in children aged 5–11 years. A literature search identified 289 recommendations for parents. These were presented to a panel of 44 international experts over three survey rounds, who rated their preventive importance. Results: 171 strategies were endorsed as important or essential for preventing childhood depression or anxiety disorders by ≥90% of the panel. These were written into a parenting guidelines document, with 11 subheadings: Establish and maintain a good relationship with your child, Be involved and support increasing autonomy, Encourage supportive relationships, Establish family rules and consequences, Encourage good health habits, Minimise conflict in the home, Help your child to manage emotions, Help your child to set goals and solve problems, Support your child when something is bothering them, Help your child to manage anxiety, and Encourage professional help seeking when needed. Limitations: This study relied on experts from Western countries; hence the strategies identified may not be relevant for all ethnic groups. Conclusions: This study produced new parenting guidelines that are supported by research evidence and/or international experts, which can now be promoted in Western English-speaking communities to help parents protect their children from depression and anxiety disorders.

Recent trends in the incidence of anxiety and prescription of anxiolytics and hypnotics in children and young people: An e-cohort study,"Background: Little is known regarding the recognition of anxiety in children and young people (CYP) in primary care. This study examined trends in the presentation, recognition and recording of anxiety and of anxiolytic and hypnotic prescriptions for CYP in primary care. Method: A population-based retrospective electronic cohort of individuals aged 6–18 years between 2003 and 2011 within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank primary care database was created. Incidence rates were calculated using person years at risk (PYAR) as a denominator accounting for deprivation, age and gender. Results: We identified a cohort of 311,343 registered individuals providing a total of 1,546,489 person years of follow up. The incidence of anxiety symptoms more than tripled over the study period (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) = 3.55, 95% CI 2.65–4.77) whilst that of diagnosis has remained stable. Anxiolytic/hypnotic prescriptions for the cohort as a whole did not change significantly over time; however there was a significant increase in anxiolytic prescriptions for the 15–18 year age group (IRR 1.62, 95% CI 1.30–2.02). Limitations: There was a lack of reliable information regarding other interventions available or received at a primary, secondary or tertiary level such as psychological treatments. Conclusions: There appears to be a preference over time for the recording of general symptoms over diagnosis for anxiety in CYP. The increase in anxiolytic prescriptions for 15–18 year olds is discrepant with current prescribing guidelines. Specific guidance is required for the assessment and management of CYP presenting with anxiety to primary care, particularly older adolescents.

Mental disorders in motherhood according to prepregnancy BMI and pregnancy-related weight changes—A Danish cohort study,"Background: Previous studies have shown an association between prepregnancy BMI and postpartum depression, but little is known about this association beyond one year postpartum and the influence of postpartum weight retention (PPWR). Methods: We used data from 70355 mothers from the Danish National Birth Cohort to estimate the associations between maternal prepregnancy BMI and PPWR, respectively, and incident depression/anxiety disorders until six years postpartum. Outcome was depression or anxiety diagnosed clinically or filling a prescription for an antidepressant. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Follow-up started at the day of delivery. For the analysis regarding PPWR, follow-up started six months postpartum. Results: Underweight, overweight and obesity were associated with depression and/or anxiety disorders when compared to normal-weight, though the associations were attenuated after adjustments (HR 1.24 [95% CI 1.06–1.45], 1.05 [95% CI 0.96–1.15] and 1.07 [95% CI 0.95–1.21] for underweight, overweight and obese, respectively). Compared to mothers who had returned to their prepregnancy BMI, risk of depression/anxiety disorders was increased for mothers, who from prepregnancy to 6 months postpartum experienced either weight loss &gt;1 BMI unit (HR 1.19 [95% CI 1.06–1.25]), weight gain of 2–3 BMI units (HR 1.23 [95% CI 1.08–1.40]), or weight gain of ≥3 BMI units (HR 1.21 [95% CI 1.05–1.40]). Limitation: Causal direction and mechanisms behind the associations are largely unknown. Conclusions: Low prepregnancy body weight and postpartum weight gain or loss are associated with occurrence of depression and anxiety disorders.

Outcomes associated with anxiety and depression among men who have sex with men in Estonia,"Background: Evidence supports that gay, lesbian, and transgender populations are at increased risk for mental health problems. The current study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and related factors among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Estonia. This is the only known study of its type in the Eastern European region. Methods: In 2013, an Internet-based survey was conducted among men who have sex with men, collecting data on socio-demographics, sexuality, drug and alcohol use, mental health, suicidality, and internalized homonegativity. Results: 265 MSM completed the questionnaire (median age 31 years, 90% Estonian, 71% from the capital; 73% employed full-time, 42% with at least college education; 44% in a steady relationship; 72% gay, 23% bisexual; 23% reported illegal drug use in the last 12 months). One third met criteria for problem drinking and depressive symptoms with one quarter for anxiety symptoms. Suicidality was 44% reported lifetime suicidal thoughts and 11% with at least one suicide attempt. Limitations: The study instruments, EST-Q and CAGE, only measure symptoms and are not diagnostic tests. A non-random sample which could possibly include persons with easier internet access. Self-reported data and cross-sectional study design are prone to issues with recall bias and temporality. Conclusions: With demonstrated high rates of anxiety, depression, drinking, and drug use among MSM which is consistent with similar studies in Western countries, further research could help determine effective MSM focused interventions to address the broad spectrum of issues among MSM.

Posttraumatic and depressive symptoms in β-endorphin dynamics,"A disturbed beta-endorphin system can be a part of the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression allostasis. Study subjects ( N = 392) included those with PTSD and/or (stress-induced) depression, and healthy controls with and without traumas. The aim of the study was to examine the network of relations centered around plasma beta-endorphin. The network included anxiety (as a personality trait), traumatic events, pain, aggressiveness, depressive symptoms, and three clusters of PTSD symptoms: intrusions, avoidance, and hyperarousal. Beta-endorphin was represented by individual mean from 13 time points (BEmean), reflecting the total amount of the peripherally secreted hormone, and the coefficient of variation (BEvar), calculated as the ratio of standard deviation to the mean, reflecting the hormone's dynamics. BEvar correlated with all other variables, BEmean had no correlations. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine all interrelations (including their directions) of BEvar and the state/trait variables in the context of their entirety. The model revealed that hyperarousal and anxiety were the only direct agents of peripheral beta-endorphin fluctuations, mediating the effects of other variables. Traumatic events and intrusions act on BEvar via hyperarousal, while depressive symptoms, avoidance, and pain act via anxiety. Hyperarousal should be emphasized as the main agent not only because its effect on BEvar is larger than that of anxiety, but also because it increases anxiety itself (via avoidance and pain). All influences on BEvar are positive and they indicate long-term (sensitizing) effects (as opposed to direct stimulation, for example, by acute pain, anger, etc.). Relations apart from beta-endorphin are also discussed.

Sexual dysfunction in arterial hypertension women: The role of depression and anxiety,"Introduction: Although high blood pressure is known to be associated with sexual dysfunction, this phenomenon has been little studied in females and has received little intervention in clinical practice. Objective: To identify the presence of sexual dysfunction, considering the different possible domains and to evaluate its relationship with the presence of symptoms of anxiety and depression in women with arterial hypertension. Methodology: One hundred fifty seven women (from 56.4 years) with a diagnosis of arterial hypertension were evaluated with media through the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: High rates of sexual dysfunction were detected in the women evaluated, and this dysfunction was in all domains as follows: desire (68.2%), excitement (68.2%), lubrication (41.1%), orgasm (55.4%), satisfaction (66.42%) and pain (56.1%). Elevated rates of symptoms of anxiety (43.3%) and depression (26.8%) were also found in our sample. Nevertheless, in the present study, such symptoms showed no relationship with sexual dysfunction levels for any of the domains assessed. Conclusion: Hypertensive patients exhibit an elevated presence of sexual dysfunction, as well as anxious and depressive symptoms. Although the literature on female sexuality indicates influences of these symptoms on sexual functions, this study did not identify such a relationship in the studied population. Sexuality is an important element in patient quality of life, and a broad understanding of female sexual function is fundamental for good follow-up in these patients.

"Negative affectivity, depression, and anxiety: Does rumination mediate the links?","Background: Negative affectivity (NA) is thought to be a vulnerability factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; however, the mechanism through which this process takes place is yet to be fully ascertained. Rumination, a negative thought process, however, is believed a likely candidate in the association between NA and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Moreover, a thought-provoking advance in the understanding of rumination is the identification of a two-factor structure, with ‘brooding’ and ‘reflection’ as its subtypes. Thus, the present study sought to clarify the meditational effects of brooding and reflection in the relationships between NA and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Method: Self-report questionnaires tapping rumination, NA, and symptoms of depression and anxiety were administered to a sample of 77 psychiatric patients aged 30–40. Results: In line with study expectations, brooding, reflection, NA, anxiety, and depressive symptoms correlated substantially with each other. Both, brooding and reflection completely mediated the association between NA and depressive symptoms; however, the relationship between NA and anxiety was not mediated by either brooding or reflection. Limitations: The current study is limited in terms of its cross sectional nature, sample size, sample selection, and methods of assessment. Conclusions: Despite these limitations, the present study demonstrated that a temperamental construct NA significantly predicts brooding and reflection and these in turn predict depressive symptoms but not anxiety. Thus, NA, a temperamental construct, may be more related to anxiety rather than depression.

Oxidative stress and depressive symptoms in older adults: A magnetic resonance spectroscopy study,"Major depression is common in older adults and associated with greater health care utilisation and increased risk of poor health outcomes. Oxidative stress may be implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and can be measured via the neurometabolite glutathione using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). This study aimed to examine the relationship between glutathione concentration and depressive symptom severity in older adults ‘at-risk’ of depression. In total, fifty-eight older adults considered ‘at-risk’ of depression (DEP) and 12 controls underwent 1H-MRS, medical and neuropsychological assessments. Glutathione was measured in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and calculated as a ratio to creatine. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Compared to controls, DEP patients had increased glutathione/creatine ratios in the ACC ( t = 2.7, p = 0.012). In turn, these increased ratios were associated with greater depressive symptoms ( r = 0.28, p = 0.038), and poorer performance on a verbal learning task ( r = -0.28, p = 0.040). In conclusion, depressive symptoms in older people are associated with increased glutathione in the ACC. Oxidative stress may be pathophysiologically linked to illness development and may represent an early compensatory response. Further research examining the utility of glutathione as a marker for depressive symptoms and cognitive decline is now required.

An admixture analysis of age of onset in agoraphobia,"Background: Age of onset is an important epidemiological indicator in characterizing disorders' subtypes according to demographic, clinical and psychosocial determinants. While investigated in various psychiatric conditions, age of onset and related characteristics in agoraphobia have yet to be examined. In light of the new diagnostic status in the DSM-5 edition of agoraphobia as independent from panic disorder, research on agoraphobia as a stand-alone disorder is needed. Methods: Admixture analysis was used to determine the best-fitting model for the observed ages at onset of 507 agoraphobia patients participating in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (age range 18–65). Associations between agoraphobia age of onset and different demographic, clinical and psychosocial determinants were examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Admixture analyses identified two distributions of age of onset, with 27 as the cutoff age (≤ 27; early onset, &gt; 27; late onset). Early onset agoraphobia was only independently associated with family history of anxiety disorders ( p &lt; 0.01) Limitations: Age of onset was assessed retrospectively, and analyses were based on cross-sectional data. Conclusion: The best distinguishing age of onset cutoff of agoraphobia was found to be 27. Early onset agoraphobia might constitute of a familial subtype. As opposed to other psychiatric disorders, early onset in agoraphobia does not indicate for increased clinical severity and/or disability.

Veteran exposure to suicide: Prevalence and correlates,"Background: The aim of this study was to determine rates and consequences of suicide exposure in a veteran population and variables related to psychiatric morbidity. Methods: 931 veterans from a random digit dial survey conducted July 2012–June 2013 in the Commonwealth of Kentucky was utilized to examine associations between suicide exposure and depression and anxiety. For those with lifetime suicide exposure, perceptions of closeness to the decedent and additional traumatic death exposure were also examined. Results: Almost half of veterans (47.1%, n = 434) reported lifetime exposure to suicide. Suicide-exposed individuals were almost twice as likely to have diagnosable depression (OR = 1.92, CI = 1.31–2.8) and more than twice as likely to have diagnosable anxiety (OR = 2.37, CI = 1.55–3.61). Suicide-exposed were also more likely than non-exposed to report suicide ideation (9.9% vs. 4.3%). Perceived closeness to decedent increased the odds of depression (OR = 1.38, CI = 1.12–1.69), anxiety (OR = 1.51, CI = 1.21–1.89) and PTSD (OR = 1.65, CI = 1.27–2.16) and more than doubled the odds of Prolonged Grief (OR = 2.47, CI = 1.60–3.83). A model examined time sequence of suicide and traumatic death exposure. Experiencing a suicide exposure first and subsequent traumatic death exposure in their military career almost quadrupled the odds of suicide ideation (OR = 3.56, p = .01, CI = 1.34–9.46). Limitations: Major study limitations include use of only one US state and random digit dial response rate. Conclusions: Suicide exposure confers psychiatric risks in veterans. Perceptions of closeness to decedents, which may extend beyond familial lines, may heighten these risks in the suicide exposed. Multiple exposures to suicide and traumatic death may lead to significant suicide risk.

"The association of relationship quality and social networks with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among older married adults: Findings from a cross-sectional analysis of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA)","Background: Important associations have been found between social relationships and various mental health outcomes. However, limited data exists for these associations among older adults especially in terms of relationship quality in partnerships. This study aimed to examine the associations of positive and negative partner interactions and social networks with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. Methods: Nationally-representative, cross-sectional data of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) was analyzed. The analytical sample consisted of 4988 community dwelling adults aged &gt; 50 years in spouse/partner relationships. Information on sociodemographics and social relationships were assessed using standard questions. Validated scales for depression and anxiety, and a single-item question for suicidal ideation were used to assess mental health outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between social relationships and depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Results: After adjusting for confounders, negative partner interactions were significantly associated with increased likelihood of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, while positive partner interactions were significantly and inversely related to anxiety and suicidal ideation. Higher levels of social integration were significantly associated with lower odds for depression. Limitations: Given the cross-sectional nature of the research, no firm conclusions can be made in terms of directions of causality. Conclusion: By assessing the available social network of older adults, as well as the areas in their social relationships that need to be addressed, it may be possible for practitioners and policy makers to maximize the benefits of network integration and minimize the potentially harmful aspects of social relationships, thereby improving overall mental health and emotional well-being.

Changes in major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders in the national French working population between 2006 and 2010,"Background: This study aimed at assessing the changes in mental disorders in the French working population between 2006 and 2010, using nationally representative prospective data and a structured diagnostic interview for major depressive episode (MDE) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and also at exploring the differential changes in mental disorders according to age, origin, occupation, public/private sector, self-employed/employee status and work contract. Methods: The data came from the prospective national representative Santé et Itinéraire Professionnel (SIP) survey, including a sample of 5600 French workers interviewed in 2006 and 2010. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to measure MDE and GAD. Analyses were performed using weighted generalized estimation equations, and were stratified by gender. Results: No changes in MDE and GAD were observed for both genders among the working population. No differential changes were observed, except one: the prevalence of GAD increased among women working in the public sector while there was no change among women in the private sector. Limitations: Two data collections over a 4-year period may not capture the effects of the crisis on mental disorders properly. Conclusion: No changes in mental disorders between 2006 and 2010 were found but the increase in the prevalence of anxiety among women in the public sector may be of particular interest for prevention policies. High levels of social protection in France might contribute to explain these non-significant results.

Long-term work disability and absenteeism in anxiety and depressive disorders,"Background: This longitudinal study aims to compare long-term work disability and absenteeism between anxiety and depressive disorders focusing on the effects of different course trajectories (remission, recurrence and chronic course) and specific symptom dimensions (anxiety arousal, avoidance behaviour and depressive mood). Methods: We included healthy controls, subjects with a history of—and current anxiety and/or depressive disorders with a paid job ( n =1632). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to diagnose anxiety and depressive disorders and to assess course trajectories at baseline, over 2 and 4 years. The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II and the Health and Labour Questionnaire Short Form were used to measure work disability and absenteeism. Symptom dimensions were measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Fear Questionnaire and the Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology. Results: A history of—and current anxiety and/or depressive disorders were associated with increasing work disability and absenteeism over 4 years, compared to healthy controls. Long-term work disability and absenteeism were most prominent in comorbid anxiety–depressive disorder, followed by depressive disorders, and lowest in anxiety disorders. A chronic course, anxiety arousal and depressive mood were strong predictors for long-term work disability while baseline psychiatric status, a chronic course and depressive mood were strong predictors for long-term work absenteeism. Limitations: Results cannot be generalized to other anxiety disorders, such as obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and specific phobias. Self-reported measures of work disability and absenteeism were used. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that depressive syndromes and symptoms have more impact on future work disability and absenteeism than anxiety, implying that prevention of depression is of major importance.

Modifiable partner factors associated with perinatal depression and anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Perinatal distress is a significant public health problem that adversely impacts the individual and their family. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify factors that partners can modify to protect each other from developing perinatal depression and anxiety. Method: In accordance with the PRISMA statement, we reviewed the risk and protective factors associated with perinatal depression and anxiety symptoms that partners can potentially modify without professional assistance (PROSPERO reference CRD42014007524). Participants were new or expectant parents aged 16 years or older. The partner factors were sub-grouped into themes (e.g., instrumental support) based on a content analysis of the scale items and measure descriptions. A series of meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the pooled effect sizes of associations. Results: We included 120 publications, reporting 245 associations with depression and 44 with anxiety. Partner factors with sound evidence that they protect against both perinatal depression and anxiety are: emotional closeness and global support. Partner factors with a sound evidence base for depression only are communication, conflict, emotional and instrumental support, and relationship satisfaction. Limitations: This review is limited by the lack of generalizability to single parents and the inability to systematically review moderators and mediators, or control for baseline symptoms. Conclusion: The findings suggest that future prevention programs targeting perinatal depression and anxiety should aim to enhance relationship satisfaction, communication, and emotional closeness, facilitate instrumental and emotional support, and minimize conflict between partners.

Risk of developing major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders among adolescents and adults with atopic dermatitis: A nationwide longitudinal study,"Background: Previous cross-sectional studies have suggested a comorbid association between atopic dermatitis (AD) and depressive disorder as well as anxiety disorders, but the temporal relationship was not determined. Methods: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 8208 AD patients aged 12 and older without psychiatric history and age-/sex-matched (1:1) controls between 1998 and 2008 were enrolled in our study and followed to the end of 2011. Subjects who developed major depression, any depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders during the follow-up were identified. Results: The Cox regression analysis after adjusting for demographic data and atopic comorbidities demonstrated that patients with AD had an elevated risk of developing major depression (hazard ratio [HR]: 6.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.64–11.84), any depressive disorder (HR: 5.44, 95% CI: 3.99–7.44), and anxiety disorders (HR: 3.57, 95% CI: 2.55–4.98). Stratified by age group, both adolescents and adults with AD were prone to developing major depression (HR: 4.26, 95% CI: 1.39–13.13; HR: 7.56, 95% CI: 3.75–15.23), any depressive disorder (HR: 4.38, 95% CI: 2.09–9.18; HR: 5.66, 95% CI: 4.01–7.99), and anxiety disorders (HR: 5.40, 95% CI: 2.02–14.39; HR: 3.36, 95% CI: 2.38–4.80). Conclusions: AD in both adolescence and adulthood increased the risk of developing major depression, any depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders in later life. Further studies would be required to clarify the possible underlying mechanism between AD and depression as well as anxiety disorders.

Faith-adapted psychological therapies for depression and anxiety: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Incorporating faith (religious or spiritual) perspectives into psychological treatments has attracted significant interest in recent years. However, previous suggestion that good psychiatric care should include spiritual components has provoked controversy. To try to address ongoing uncertainty in this field we present a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of faith-based adaptations of bona fide psychological therapies for depression or anxiety. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials were performed. Results: The literature search yielded 2274 citations of which 16 studies were eligible for inclusion. All studies used cognitive or cognitive behavioural models as the basis for their faith-adapted treatment (F-CBT). We identified statistically significant benefits of using F-CBT. However, quality assessment using the Cochrane risk of bias tool revealed methodological limitations that reduce the apparent strength of these findings. Limitations: Whilst the effect sizes identified here were statistically significant, there were relatively a few relevant RCTs available, and those included were typically small and susceptible to significant biases. Biases associated with researcher or therapist allegiance were identified as a particular concern. Conclusions: Despite some suggestion that faith-adapted CBT may out-perform both standard CBT and control conditions (waiting list or “treatment as usual”), the effect sizes identified in this meta-analysis must be considered in the light of the substantial methodological limitations that affect the primary research data. Before firm recommendations about the value of faith-adapted treatments can be made, further large-scale, rigorously performed trials are required.

The relationship between sleep and postpartum mental disorders: A systematic review,"Background: Postpartum mental disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, psychosis) are serious conditions that affect approximately 10–15% of women after childbirth, and up to 40% of women at risk for these disorders. Research reveals an association between poor sleep quality/quantity and symptoms of anxiety, depression and psychosis. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence for the relationship between sleep and postpartum mental disorders. Methods: Searches included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews—Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and EBSCOHost CINAHL through June 30, 2014. Manual searching was performed on reference lists of included articles. Published primary research in any language was included. Results: There were 3187 unique titles/abstracts and 44 full-text articles reviewed. Thirty-one studies were included. Evidence was found for the impact of self-reported poor sleep during pregnancy and the postpartum on the development of postpartum depression, with not enough evidence for either postpartum anxiety or psychosis. The evidence for objectively assessed sleep and the development of postpartum disorders was mixed. Among the 31 studies included, 1 was strong, 13 were moderate and 17 were weak. Limitations: Research design, method of assessment, timing of assessment, recruitment strategies, representative adequacy of the samples and inclusion/exclusion criteria all varied widely. Many studies did not use tools validated for the perinatal population and had small sample sizes without power analysis. Conclusions: Sleep interventions represent a potential low-cost, non-pharmacological prevention and treatment strategy for postpartum mental illness. Further high-quality research is needed on this topic area.

Pregnancy anxiety: A systematic review of current scales,"Background: Depression in pregnancy is a serious health issue; however, anxiety in pregnancy, with a reported higher prevalence, may also be a serious issue. Anxiety symptoms in pregnancy can relate to several anxiety types, such as general anxiety, anxiety disorders, and pregnancy-related anxiety (PrA), anxiety characterised by pregnancy specific fears and worries. Awareness of these distinctions however, is not always widespread. Both general anxiety and PrA are associated with maternal negative outcomes (e.g. increased nausea) however; PrA is more often associated with negative outcomes for the child (e.g. preterm birth). Furthermore, PrA is potentially a risk factor for postnatal depression with assessment of PrA potentially affording important intervention opportunities. Currently several different instruments are used for PrA however their psychometric properties are unclear. To our knowledge a review of current instruments and their psychometric properties is lacking, this paper aims to fill that gap. Methods: Studies, which assessed PrA, published between 1983 and 2013 in peer-reviewed journals, were identified. Results: Sixty studies were identified after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, and classified as: pregnancy-related anxiety specific, scales for other constructs, sub scales of another instrument and general anxiety scales. Each scale's strengths and limitations were discussed. Limitations: Our findings may be limited by restricting our review to peer-reviewed journals. This was done however as we sought to identify scales with good psychometric properties. Conclusions: Currently no scales are available for pregnancy-related anxiety with sound theoretical and psychometric properties. Clinically the need for such a scale is highlighted by the potential intervention opportunities this may afford. Future research should be directed towards the development of such a scale.

Brief Culturally adapted CBT (CaCBT) for depression: A randomized controlled trial from Pakistan,"Objectives: To determine the efficacy of brief Culturally adapted CBT (CaCBT) for depression when added to Treatment As usual (TAU)—delivered by trained therapists using a manual compared with alone TAU. Methods: This was an assessor-blinded, randomised controlled clinical trial. Participants with a diagnosis of depression, attending psychiatry departments of three teaching hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan, were included in the study. We screened a total of 280 patients and randomly allocated 137 of them to CaCBT plus Treatment As Usual (TAU) [Treatment group] or to TAU alone [Control group]. Assessments were completed at baseline, at 3 months and at 9 months after baseline. Reduction in depression score (Hospital Anxiety and Depression-Depression Subscale) at 3 months was primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures included anxiety scores (Hospital Anxiety and Depression-Anxiety Subscale), somatic symptoms (Bradford Somatic Inventory), disability (Brief Disability Questionnaire) and satisfaction with the treatment. Findings: A total of 69 participants were randomised to Treatment group and 68 to Control group. Participants in Treatment group showed statistically significant improvement in depression ( p = 0.000), anxiety ( p = 0.000), somatic symptoms ( p = 0.005) and disability ( p = 0.000). This effect was sustained at 9 months after baseline (Except for disability). Participants in Treatment group also reported higher satisfaction with treatment compared with those in Control group. Conclusion: Brief CaCBT can be effective in improving depressive symptoms, when compared with treatment as usual. This is the first report of a trial of Culturally adapted CBT from South Asia and further studies are needed to generalise these findings.

Long-lasting effects of affective disorders and childhood trauma on dispositional optimism,"Background: Dispositional optimism, a personality trait characterized by generalized positive expectations towards the future, is thought to remain rather stable over time. It is however largely unknown to what extent affective disorders and its risk factors affect dispositional optimism. Methods: We examined the association between (lifetime) affective disorders and childhood trauma with dispositional optimism in a sample of 2104 subjects (aged 18–65 years) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Dispositional optimism was measured with the Life Orientation Test Revised (LOT-R). Diagnoses of depressive and anxiety disorders were based on the Composite Interview diagnostic Instrument (CIDI).Childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Interview (CTI) and life-events with the List of Threatening Events Questionnaire (LTQ). Results: The 2104 participants were on average 46.0 (SD 13.1) years old and 65.8% were female. Multivariate analyses showed that dispositional optimism was inversely associated with current affective disorders (depression: B = −1.089 and anxiety: B = −1.066, both p &lt; 0.001), but also with remitted affective disorders (depression: B = −0.822 and anxiety: B = −0.558, both p &lt; 0.001) and severity of depression ( B = −4.230; p&lt;0.001). A history of childhood emotional maltreatment ( B = −0.905, p &lt; 0.001) was related to lower optimism, whilst positive life-events were associated with higher levels of optimism ( B = 0.235, p &gt; 0.001). Limitations: The cross-sectional design hampers inferences about causality. Conclusion: Lower levels of dispositional optimism are associated with stage of affective disorders, even after remission, and a history of childhood emotional maltreatment. Identification of the risk factors contributes to understand fluctuations in dispositional optimism.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder in racial and ethnic minorities: A case of nativity and contextual factors,"Background: Minorities comprise more than one third of the U.S., and research on the correlates and causes of depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses have yielded mixed results in minority groups necessitating an understanding of causes and correlates of health. Thus, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the relationship between minority status, contextual factors, and lifetime Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Methods: Logistic regression models were implemented, comparing immigrants to their American-born counterparts as well as to American-born Whites. Results: Foreign-born Afro-Caribbeans exhibited lower rates of lifetime GAD. A lower percentage of foreign-born minorities met the criteria for GAD as compared to their American-born counterparts, and all racial and ethnic groups met the criteria for lifetime GAD at a lower rate as compared to American-born Whites. Discussion: By using theory proactively and including contextual factors, this multi-faceted approach to health disparities research yielded findings which both supported historic beliefs but created opportunities for supplemental research looking at immigrants and GAD. Key findings were that health lifestyle choices and exposure to discrimination significantly affected the chance of having GAD. Nativity was protective; however, its effect was ameliorated by exposure to discrimination or engagement in alcohol abuse. Thus, this study offers practical insight into environmental factors for clinicians caring for racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed with GAD.

Risk factors and course patterns of anxiety and depressive disorders during pregnancy and after delivery: A prospective-longitudinal study,"Background: Peripartum anxiety and depressive disorders are associated with adverse consequences for mother and child. Thus, it is important to examine risk factors, correlates and course patterns of anxiety and depressive disorders during pregnancy and after delivery. Methods: In the prospective-longitudinal Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) Study, n = 306 expectant mothers were recruited from gynaecological outpatient settings in Germany and completed up to seven waves of assessment from early pregnancy until 16 months postpartum. Anxiety and depressive disorders and potential risk factors/correlates were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women (CIDI-V), medical records and additional questionnaires. Results: Although peripartum anxiety and depressive disorders appeared to be persistent in some women, others reported major changes with heterogeneous courses and shifts between diagnoses and contents. There was a considerable amount of incident disorders. Strongest predictors for peripartum anxiety and depressive disorders were anxiety and depressive disorders prior to pregnancy, but psychosocial (e.g. maternal education), individual (e.g. low self-esteem), and interpersonal (e.g. partnership satisfaction, social support) factors were also related. Limitation: Knowing the aims of the study, some participants may have been more encouraged to report particular symptoms, but if so, this points to the importance of a comprehensive assessment in perinatal care. Conclusion: Peripartum time is a sensitive period for a considerable incidence or persistence/recurrence of anxiety and depressive disorders albeit the course may be rather heterogeneous. Interventional studies are needed to examine whether an alteration of associated factors could help to prevent peripartum anxiety and depressive disorders.

"Parental factors associated with childhood anxiety, depression, and internalizing problems: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: There is a burgeoning and varied literature examining the associations between parental factors and depression or anxiety disorders in children. However, there is hitherto no systematic review of this complex literature with a focus on the 5–11 years age range, when there is a steep increase in onset of these disorders. Furthermore, to facilitate the application of the evidence in prevention, a focus on modifiable factors is required. Methods: Employing the PRISMA method, we conducted a systematic review of parental factors associated with anxiety, depression, and internalizing problems in children which parents can potentially modify. Results: We identified 141 articles altogether, with 53 examining anxiety, 50 examining depression, and 70 examining internalizing outcomes. Stouffer's method of combining p -values was used to determine whether associations between variables were reliable, and meta-analyses were conducted with a subset of eligible studies to estimate the mean effect sizes of associations between each parental factor and outcome. Limitations: Limitations include sacrificing micro-level detail for a macro-level synthesis of the literature, the lack of generalizability across cultures, and the inability to conduct a meta-analysis on all included studies. Conclusions: Parental factors with a sound evidence base indicating increased risk for both depression and internalizing problems include more inter-parental conflict and aversiveness; and for internalizing outcomes additionally, they include less warmth and more abusive parenting and over-involvement. No sound evidence linking any parental factor with anxiety outcomes was found.

A working memory training to decrease rumination in depressed and anxious individuals: A double-blind randomized controlled trial,"Background: Rumination is one of the hallmark characteristics of both anxiety disorders and depression, and has been linked to deficient executive functioning, particularly working memory (WM). Previous findings show that working memory capacity can be increased through training. Methods: The current study explored whether an adaptive stand-alone WM training could increase WMC and consequently reduce rumination, anxiety and depression by means of a double-blind randomized controlled trial in a sample of 98 patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Results: No positive effect of training on WMC was found. In addition, the results show that a WM training was not associated with a reduction of rumination, depression, nor anxiety. Limitations: The high drop-out rate in both groups (20.11% from pre- to post-training) and the overrepresentation of men and use of anti-depressants in the placebo group might have influenced the results. Furthermore, expectations and perceptions about the training might have interacted with performance on WM tasks. Conclusions: Overall, results show that a stand-alone WM training in patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression does not result in reduced rumination nor in reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. We discuss potential explanations for these findings.

The efficacy and pattern of use of a computer-assisted programme for the treatment of anxiety: A naturalistic study using mixed methods in primary care in Spain,"Background: Naturalistic studies to assess the efficacy and pattern of use of computer-delivered psychotherapy programmes in real daily clinical conditions are infrequent. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders, and many of them do not receive adequate management, especially in primary care settings. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of an internet-delivered programme for anxiety in primary care. Methods: Multicentre, naturalistic study. Patients with generalised anxiety disorder were recruited ( N = 229). The generalised anxiety disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) was the only outcome measured. Qualitative methods were used to analyse patient–therapist interactions. Results: Only 13.5% of patients completed the programme. Analysis per intent-to-treat using Last Observation Carried Forward showed a significant GAD-7 decrease post-treatment (−2.17: SD = 4.77; p = 0.001) (Cohen's d = 0.43) with a correlation between the number of sessions and decrease in anxiety (Rho = −0.34, p = 0.001). The analysis per protocol showed significantly decreased GAD-7 (−4.13; SD = 6.82; p = 0.002) ( d = 0.80). Withdrawal was related to low programme friendliness, lack of a partner, and higher education. Only 17.47% of the patients consulted their therapists. Facilitators were patient demand for information and sufficient time. Barriers were lack of motivation and lack of connection with the programme. Limitations: The main limitations of this study included the use of an open trial design, the lack of follow-up, and the inclusion of only one outcome (GAD-7). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study with computer-delivered psychotherapy (CDP) on GAD. CDP for anxiety is efficacious in naturalistic environments. Specific facilitators and barriers should be considered.

Psychometric evaluation of the Overall Anxiety Severity And Impairment Scale (OASIS) in individuals seeking outpatient specialty treatment for anxiety-related disorders,"Background: Comorbidity among anxiety-related diagnoses is common, highlighting the need for brief, meaningful measures of anxiety that cut across diagnoses. Methods: The current study examined the psychometric properties of one such measure, the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) (Norman et al., 2006), in a naturalistic sample of individuals seeking treatment at an outpatient anxiety treatment center. We examined the measure's structure, convergent validity, and potential effects of respondent gender. Using ROC analysis, we estimated an optimal cut-score for determining presence of an anxiety disorder in this sample. Finally, we examined the responsiveness of the OASIS to clinical change and calculated a reliable change index. Results: We found strong psychometric properties of the OASIS. A unitary factor structure with correlated residuals on the first two items provided the best fit to the data. A cut-score of eight best distinguished the presence of an anxiety-related diagnosis. In measurement invariance analyses, we found evidence that men and women respond similarly to the measure. In addition, we found that change in the OASIS was correlated with change in other measures, and we estimated that a four-point change in the OASIS can be considered clinically reliable. Limitations: Sample characteristics may limit generalizability. Diagnoses were established by clinicians using a semi-structured interview that, while based upon DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, has not been psychometrically evaluated. Conclusion: The results provide support for the use of the OASIS in specialty treatment for anxiety-related diagnoses and further highlight the strengths of this measure in clinical practice and research settings.

Treatment-as-usual (TAU) is anything but usual: A meta-analysis of CBT versus TAU for anxiety and depression,"Objectives: There were three aims of this study, the first was to examine the efficacy of CBT versus treatment-as-usual (TAU) in the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders, the second was to examine how TAU is defined in TAU control groups for those disorders, and the third was to explore whether the type of TAU condition influences the estimate of effects of CBT. Method: A systematic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and CINAHL was conducted. Results: 48 studies of CBT for depressive or anxiety disorders ( n = 6926) that specified that their control group received TAU were identified. Most ( n = 45/48) provided an explanation of the TAU group however there was significant heterogeneity amongst TAU conditions. The meta-analysis showed medium effects favoring CBT over TAU for both anxiety ( g = 0.69, 95% CI 0.47–0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 1318) and depression ( g = 0.70, 95% CI 0.49–0.90, p &lt; 0.001, n = 5054), with differential effects observed across TAU conditions. Conclusions: CBT is superior to TAU and the size of the effect of CBT compared to TAU depends on the nature of the TAU condition. The term TAU is used in different ways and should be more precisely described. The four key details to be reported can be thought of as “who, what, how many, and any additional treatments?” (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2015
Autonomic arousal in childhood anxiety disorders: Associations with state anxiety and social anxiety disorder,"Background: Psychophysiological theories suggest that individuals with anxiety disorders may evidence inflexibility in their autonomic activity at rest and when responding to stressors. In addition, theories of social anxiety disorder, in particular, highlight the importance of physical symptoms. Research on autonomic activity in childhood (social) anxiety disorders, however, is scarce and has produced inconsistent findings, possibly because of methodological limitations. Method: The present study aimed to account for limitations of previous studies and measured respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and heart rate (HR) using Actiheart heart rate monitors and software (Version 4) during rest and in response to a social and a non-social stressor in 60 anxious (30 socially anxious and 30 ‘other’ anxious), and 30 nonanxious sex-and age-matched 7–12 year olds. In addition, the effect of state anxiety during the tasks was explored. Results: No group differences at rest or in response to stress were found. Importantly, however, with increases in state anxiety, all children, regardless of their anxiety diagnoses showed less autonomic responding (i.e., less change in HR and RSA from baseline in response to task) and took longer to recover once the stressor had passed. Limitations: This study focused primarily on parasympathetic arousal and lacked measures of sympathetic arousal. Conclusion: The findings suggest that childhood anxiety disorders may not be characterized by inflexible autonomic responding, and that previous findings to the contrary may have been the result of differences in subjective anxiety between anxious and nonanxious groups during the tasks, rather than a function of chronic autonomic dysregulation.

Protective benefits of mindfulness in emergency room personnel,"Background: Recent meta-analyses have found that mindfulness practice may reduce anxiety and depression in clinical populations and there is growing evidence that mindfulness may also improve well-being and quality of care in health professionals. This study examined whether mindfulness protects against the impact of work-related stress on mental health and burnout in emergency room (ER) nurses. Methods: ER nurses ( N = 50) were recruited from an urban teaching hospital in Switzerland and completed a survey on work-related stressors, mindfulness, burnout, depression, and anxiety. Results: The most frequently reported work-related stressor was interpersonal conflict. Nurses working more consecutive days since last taking time off were at greater risk for depression and those reporting more work-related interpersonal conflicts were at greater risk for burnout. Mindfulness was associated with reduced anxiety, depression, and burnout. Mindfulness was a significant predictor of anxiety, depression, and burnout and moderated the impact of work-related stressors on mental health and burnout. Limitations: The sample is limited to nurses and results need to be replicated in other groups (e.g., medical staff or ambulance workers). We assessed clinical symptoms with questionnaires and it would be desirable to repeat this assessment with clinical diagnostic interviews. Conclusions: The findings have implications for stress management in ER nurses and health professionals working in comparable settings (e.g., urgent care). The robust associations between mindfulness and multiple indices of psychological well-being suggest that ER staff exposed to high levels of occupational stress may benefit from mindfulness practice to increase resistance to mental health problems and burnout.

Group metacognitive therapy for repetitive negative thinking in primary and non-primary generalized anxiety disorder: An effectiveness trial,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common and highly comorbid anxiety disorder characterized by repetitive negative thinking (RNT). Treatment trials tend to exclude individuals with non-primary GAD, despite this being a common presentation in real world clinics. RNT is also associated with multiple emotional disorders, suggesting that it should be targeted regardless of the primary disorder. This study evaluated the acceptability and effectiveness of brief group metacognitive therapy (MCT) for primary or non-primary GAD within a community clinic. Methods: Patients referred to a specialist community clinic attended six, two-hour weekly sessions plus a one-month follow-up ( N = 52). Measures of metacognitive beliefs, RNT, symptoms, positive and negative affect, and quality of life were completed at the first, last, and follow-up sessions. Results: Attrition was low and large intent-to-treat effects were observed on most outcomes, particularly for negative metacognitive beliefs and RNT. Treatment gains increased further to follow-up. Benchmarking comparisons demonstrated that outcomes compared favorably to longer disorder-specific protocols for primary GAD. Limitations: No control group or independent assessment of protocol adherence. Conclusions: Brief metacognitive therapy is an acceptable and powerful treatment for patients with primary or non-primary GAD.

Anxiety sensitivity and intolerance of uncertainty as potential risk factors for cyberchondria,"Background: Online medical information seeking has become an increasingly common behavior. Despite the benefits of easily accessible medical information on the Internet, researchers have identified a vicious cycle of increased physical health concerns and online medical information seeking known as “cyberchondria”. Despite proposed theoretical models of cyberchondria, there is a dearth of research investigating risk factors for the development of cyberchondria. Two potential risk factors are anxiety sensitivity (AS) and intolerance of uncertainty (IU). Methods: The current study investigated the relationships among AS, IU, and cyberchondria in a large community sample. Participants ( N = 526) completed self-report questionnaires via online crowdsourcing. Results: Structural equation models utilizing latent variables revealed a significant unique positive relationship between AS, as well as the IU Inhibitory lower-order factor, and cyberchondria, controlling for the effects of health anxiety. Additionally, results revealed a significant unique relationship between the IU Inhibitory factor and mistrust of medical professionals, a proposed cyberchondria-relevant construct. Limitations: The cross-sectional data in the current study do not offer a true test of AS and IU as risk factors. However, establishing these unique relationships is an important step forward in the literature. Conclusions: The results of the current study suggest the potential importance of both AS and IU in the development of cyberchondria. Future research is needed to establish the temporal precedence of elevated AS and/or IU to determine if they are true risk factors or simply correlates of cyberchondria.

"Pathological jealousy: Romantic relationship characteristics, emotional and personality aspects, and social adjustment","Background: The aim of this study was to identify romantic relationship characteristics, emotional and personality aspects and social adjustment in subjects with pathological jealousy (PJ) and to compare them to control group. Methods: The participants, 32 individuals with PJ and 31 healthy volunteers completed measures of jealousy intensity, attachment type, love and relationship styles, personality, impulsivity, aggressiveness and social adjustment. Socio-demographic profiles were also obtained. Results: Participants with PJ were significantly older than the control group, but no other important socio-demographic differences were observed. Participants with PJ were significantly more jealous and were predominately categorized with anxious-ambivalent attachment type, and Mania love style. They presented with elevated novelty seeking and harm avoidance, low self-directedness and cooperativeness, high levels of impulsivity and trait anxiety, and poor social adjustment. Multivariate analysis showed that jealousy intensity and trait anxiety were the variables that best distinguished participants with PJ from the control group. Limitations: This study was limited by the cross-sectional design and relatively small sample size. Conclusions: PJ presents a particular pattern of attachment, love style, and personality structure, and deserves further attention as a specific potential disorder of the romantic bonding.

Anxiety comorbidity in bipolar spectrum disorders: The mediational role of perfectionism in prospective depressive symptoms,"Background: Bipolar spectrum disorders (BSDs) are highly comorbid with anxiety, which is associated with an extended duration and exacerbation of depressive symptoms. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms are not known. This study examined the role of maladaptive cognitive styles in the co-occurrence of BSDs and anxiety disorders and prediction of depressive symptoms. Methods: Participants included 141 young adults (69.6% female, mean age = 20.24, SD = 2.11), in one of three groups: a BSD group (bipolar II, cyclothymia, n = 48), a comorbid BSD/anxiety group ( n = 50), and a demographically-matched healthy control group ( n = 43), who were followed prospectively. Participants completed the Cognitive Style Questionnaire (CSQ), Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ), Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS), Sociotropy Autonomy Scale (SAS), Halberstadt Mania Inventory (HMI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at the initial assessment. One year later, participants completed the BDI and HMI again to assess severity of depressive and hypomanic/manic symptoms. Results: A multivariate analysis of co-variance (MANCOVA) revealed significant differences between the three groups on their DAS Perfectionism, DEQ Dependency, DEQ Self-Criticism, CSQ Negative, SAS Autonomy, and Time 2 BDI scores, with the BSD/anxiety group scoring higher than the BSD only group on all measures except the CSQ. Preacher and Hayes' (2008) bootstrapping method was used to test for mediational effects of the significant cognitive style measures on depressive symptoms at follow-up. The 95% confidence intervals for the indirect effect of group on follow-up depressive symptoms through DAS Perfectionism did not include zero, indicating the presence of a significant mediating relationship for perfectionism. Limitations: This study only used two waves of data; three waves of data would allow one to investigate the full causal effect of one variable on another. Further, a comorbid anxiety diagnosis consisted of any anxiety disorder. Further research should separate groups by their specific anxiety diagnoses; this could afford a more complete understanding of the effect of types of anxiety on prospective depressive symptoms. Conclusions: After taking into account initial levels of depressive and hypomanic/manic symptoms, we found that those with BSD/anxiety comorbidity experienced more severe depressive symptoms, but not more severe hypomanic/manic symptoms. Further, their more severe prospective depressive symptoms are explained by a perfectionistic cognitive style.

Operating characteristics of depression and anxiety disorder phenotype dimensions and trait neuroticism: A theoretical examination of the fear and distress disorders from the Netherlands study of depression and anxiety,"Background: The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of anhedonic depression and anxious arousal to detect the distress- (major depression, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder) and fear-disorder clusters (i.e. panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia) have not been reported in a large sample. Methods: A sample of 2981 persons underwent structured psychiatric interview; n = 652 were without lifetime depression and anxiety disorder history. Participants also completed a neuroticism scale (Revised NEO Five Factor Inventory [NEO-FFI]), and the 30-item short adaptation of the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (MASQ-D30) measuring anhedonic depression, anxious arousal and general distress. Maximal sensitivity and specificity was determined by the Youden Index and the area-under-the-curve (AUC) in ROC analysis. Results: A total of 2624 completed all measures (age M = 42.4 years ± 13.1, 1760 females [67.1%]), including 1060 (40.4%) persons who met criteria for a distress-disorder, and 973 (37.1%) who met criteria for a fear-disorder. The general distress dimension provided the highest ROC values in the detection of the distress-disorders (AUC = .814, sensitivity = 71.95%, specificity = 76.34%, positive predictive value = 67.33, negative predictive value = 80.07). None of the measures provided suitable operating characteristics in the detection of the fear-disorders with specificity values &lt;75%. Limitations: Over sampling of depression and anxiety disorders may lead to inflated positive- and negative predictive values. Conclusions: The MASQ-D30 general distress dimension showed clinically suitable operating characteristics in the detection of distress-disorders. Neither neuroticism nor the MASQ-D30 dimensions provided suitable operating characteristics in the detection of the fear-disorders.

Frequency-dependent alterations in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in social anxiety disorder,"Background: Recent studies on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have found an abnormal temporal correlation between low-frequency oscillations (LFO) in social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, alterations in the amplitudes of these LFO remain unclear. Methods: This study included 20 SAD patients and 20 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired using a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence, and the amplitudes of LFO were investigated using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) approach. Two frequency bands (slow-5: 0.01–0.027 Hz; slow-4: 0.027–0.073 Hz) were analyzed. Results: Significant differences in ALFF were observed between the two bands in widespread regions including the postcentral gyrus, precentral gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, putamen, and insula. Compared with the healthy controls, the SAD patients showed lower ALFF in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), MPFC, superior temporal gyrus, and insula but higher ALFF in the middle occipital gyrus. Furthermore, we found that the SAD patients had reduced ALFF in the MPFC in the slow-5 band. Limitation: The small sample size may decrease the statistical power of the results. Conclusions: SAD patients had frequency-dependent alteration in intrinsic brain activity. This finding may provide insights into the understanding of the pathophysiology of SAD.

"Comorbidity in pediatric bipolar disorder: Prevalence, clinical impact, etiology and treatment","Background: Research on pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) is providing a plethora of empirical findings regarding its comorbidity. We addressed this question through a systematic review concerning the prevalence, clinical impact, etiology and treatment of main comorbid disorders involved. Method: A comprehensive database search was performed from 1990 to August 2014. Overall, 167 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Results: Bipolar youth tend to suffer from comorbid disorders, with highest weighted mean prevalence rate arising from anxiety disorders (54%), followed by attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (48%), disruptive behavior disorders (31%), and substance use disorders (SUD) (31%). Furthermore, evidence indicates that ADHD and anxiety disorders negatively affect the symptomatology, neurocognitive profile, clinical course and the global functioning of PBD. Likewise, several theories have been posited to explain comorbidity rates in PBD, specifically common risk factors, one disorder being a risk factor for the other and nosological artefacts. Lastly, randomized controlled trials highlight a stronger therapeutic response to stimulants and atomoxetine (vs. placebo) as adjunctive interventions for comorbid ADHD symptoms. In addition, research focused on the treatment of other comorbid disorders postulates some benefits from mood stabilizers and/or SGA. Limitations: Epidemiologic follow-up studies are needed to avoid the risk of nosological artefacts. Likewise, more research is needed on pervasive developmental disorders and anxiety disorders, especially regarding their etiology and treatment. Conclusions: Psychiatric comorbidity is highly prevalent and is associated with a deleterious clinical effect on pediatric bipolarity. Different etiological pathways may explain the presence of these comorbid disorders among bipolar youth. Standardized treatments are providing ongoing data regarding their effectiveness for these comorbidities among bipolar youth.

Premature termination from psychotherapy and internalizing psychopathology: The role of demoralization,"Background: Some research suggests that higher levels of depression and anxiety-related symptoms at intake are associated with premature termination from psychotherapy, but findings are mixed. However, theoretical and measurement considerations—introduced by a common mood factor—might complicate literature synthesis. Tellegen (1985) demonstrated that demoralization causes multicollinearity between measures of depression and anxiety, and other lines of research have converged to indicate that this construct is an important non-specific factor to consider when assessing mood pathology. Methods: We utilized a sample of 557 community mental health center outpatients (188 males, 265 females; 80% Caucasian) with an average age of 32.2 years ( SD = 10.2). We used self-report indicators to model latent low positive emotionality and negative emotionality constructs, which are temperament markers of core depressive and anxiety symptoms. We further specified a latent demoralization bifactor from these indicators. Results: As hypothesized, the bifactor model yielded significantly better fit than competing one-factor and two-factor models. Furthermore, the bifactor was substantially correlated with a demoralization measure ( r = .96). As expected, low positive emotionality and negative emotionality were significant predictors of therapist ratings of premature termination. Though demoralization was a non-significant predictor, the structural paths from the other two internalizing constructs markedly increased in the bifactor model relative to the two-factor model. Limitations: Replications with other, more diverse clinical populations using multi-method indicators of premature termination are needed. Conclusions: This research indicates that after accounting for demoralization patients presenting with core mood disorder symptoms are at substantially increased risk for premature termination.

"Correlates of comorbid depression, anxiety and helplessness with obsessive–compulsive disorder in Chinese adolescents","Objectives: Youth with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) are at risk of experiencing comorbid psychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety. Studies of Chinese adolescents with OCD are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of depression, anxiety, and helplessness with the occurrence of OCD in Chinese adolescents. Methods: This study consisted of two stages. The first stage used a cross-sectional design involving a stratified clustered non-clinical sample of 3174 secondary school students. A clinical interview procedure was then employed to diagnose OCD in students who had a Leyton ‘yes’ score of 15 or above. The second phase used a case-control study design to examine the relationship of OCD to depression, anxiety and helplessness in a matched sample of 288 adolescents with clinically diagnosed OCD and 246 students without OCD. Results: Helplessness, depression and anxiety scores were directly associated with the probability of OCD caseness. Canonical correlation analysis indicated that the OCD correlated significantly with depression, anxiety, and helplessness. Cluster analysis further indicated that the degree of the OCD is also associated with severity of depression and anxiety, and the level of helplessness. Conclusion: These findings suggest that depression, anxiety and helplessness are important correlates of OCD in Chinese adolescents. Future studies using longitudinal and prospective designs are required to confirm these relationships as causal.

"Depression, anxiety and stress among pregnant migraineurs in a pacific-northwest cohort","Background: The co-occurrence of migraine and unipolar psychiatric disorders has been well documented in non-pregnant populations, however little is known in pregnant populations. Methods: A cohort of 1321 women was interviewed during the first trimester of pregnancy. At the time of interview lifetime migraine status was ascertained using International Classification of Headache Disorders diagnostic criteria (ICHD-II). Information regarding unipolar depression, anxiety and stress during pregnancy was collected using the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Module-9 (PHQ-9), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21-item Short Form (DASS-21). Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of migraine and mood disorders during pregnancy. Results: Approximately 28.2% ( N = 372) were classified as having a lifetime history of migraine; among migraineurs 122 were classified as migraineurs with aura and 250 as migraineurs without aura. Compared with non-migraineurs, migraineurs were associated with 1.60-fold increased odds of depression as measured by a PHQ-9 score ≥ 10 (AOR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.12–2.31). Overall, migraine with aura was more strongly associated with depression than was migraine without aura. Migraineurs, as compared with non-migraineurs, also had higher odds of mood disorders as measured by the DASS-21. Conclusions: The comorbidity of mood and migraine disorders in pregnant populations supports the need for integrated mental and physical clinical evaluation, increased vigilance, and treatment of patients with such disorders.

Elevated amygdala activity during reappraisal anticipation predicts anxiety in avoidant personality disorder,"Background: Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by pervasive anxiety, fear of criticism, disapproval, and rejection, particularly in anticipation of exposure to social situations. An important but underexplored question concerns whether anxiety in avoidant patients is associated with an impaired ability to engage emotion regulatory strategies in anticipation of and during appraisal of negative social stimuli. Methods: We examined the use of an adaptive emotion regulation strategy, cognitive reappraisal, in avoidant patients. In addition to assessing individual differences in state and trait anxiety levels, self-reported affect as well as measures of neural activity were compared between 17 avoidant patients and 21 healthy control participants both in anticipation of and during performance of a reappraisal task. Results: Avoidant patients showed greater state and trait-related anxiety relative to healthy participants. In addition, relative to healthy participants, avoidant patients showed pronounced amygdala hyper-reactivity during reappraisal anticipation, and this hyper-reactivity effect was positively associated with increasing self-reported anxiety levels. Limitations: Our finding of exaggerated amygdala activity during reappraisal anticipation could reflect anxiety about the impending need to reappraise, anxiety about the certainty of an upcoming negative image, or anxiety relating to anticipated scrutiny of task responses by the experimenters. While we believe that all of these possibilities are consistent with the phenomenology of avoidant personality disorder, future research may clarify this ambiguity. Conclusions: These results suggest that amygdala reactivity in anticipation of receiving negative social information may represent a key component of the neural mechanisms underlying the heightened anxiety present in avoidant patients.

Maternal anxiety and neural responses to infant faces,"Background: Women may be especially vulnerable to anxiety during the postpartum period and early infancy. However, little is known regarding the potential impact of maternal anxiety on the neural processing of infant-relevant information. Methods: In this ERP study, 47 recent mothers viewed neutral and distressed infant faces, concurrent with EEG collection. We examined the N170 as a perceptual marker of face processing and the late positive potential (LPP) as an index of engagement with stimulus processing. Mothers also completed the Spielberger State–Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results: While the N170 was unaffected by infant affect and anxiety levels, the LPP was greater in amplitude for distressed vs. neutral faces. Moreover, the degree of LPP amplitude elicited by neutral infant faces was positively correlated with state anxiety. There were no associations between anxiety and the LPP elicited by distressed infant faces. Limitations: We employed self-report measures of state and trait anxiety symptomatology and including diagnostic classification of anxiety disorders will be important in future research. Conclusions: These results indicate that recent mothers with higher levels of state anxiety may be more engaged with processing neutral infant cues.

Diagnostic accuracy and adequacy of treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders: A comparison of primary care and specialized care patients,"Background: Clinical diagnosis of depressive and anxiety disorders has poor sensitivity, and treatment is often not guideline-concordant. This longitudinal study aims to compare diagnostic validity and treatment adequacy in primary care (PC) and specialized care (SC), to assess associated risk factors, and to evaluate their impact on clinical outcome at one-month and three-month follow-ups. Methods: Two hundred twelve patients with depressive and anxious symptoms were recruited from 3 PC and 1 SC centers in Barcelona, Spain. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated comparing medical records' diagnoses with a reference (MINI interview). Adequate treatment was defined according to clinical guidelines. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations with risk factors. Impact on outcome was assessed with MANOVA models. Results: Valid diagnosis of depression was more frequent in patients attending SC. Sensitivity for depression was 0.75 in SC and 0.49 in PC (adjusted OR = 17.34, 95% CI = 4.73–63.61). Detection of anxious comorbidity in depressed patients was low (50%) in SC. Treatment adequacy of depressive disorders was higher in SC than in PC (94.4% vs. 80.6%, adjusted OR = 8.11, 95% CI = 1.39–47.34). Depression severity was associated with valid diagnosis. Limitations: Only four disorders (major depression, dysthymia, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder) were evaluated with the MINI interview in a convenience clinical sample. Treatment dosage was unavailable. Conclusions: Our results suggest that GPs need tools to improve detection of depression and its severity. Psychiatrists should enhance recognition of anxious comorbidity. Evaluation of the impact on outcome deserves further research.

Listening to the heart: A meta-analysis of cognitive behavior therapy impact on the heart rate of patients with anxiety disorders,"Introduction: The future of psychotherapy relies on the dialog with the basic science, being the identification of psychotherapeutifc biomarkers of efficacy a core necessity. Heart rate (HR) is one of the most studied psychophysiological parameters in anxiety disorders. Methods: To investigate the impact of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) on the HR of patients with anxiety disorders, we conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review. Electronic searches were conducted in the ISI/Web of Knowledge, PsychINFO and PubMed/MEDLINE for studies which evaluated HR at least once before and after CBT. Keywords related to anxiety disorders, HR and CBT were used in the search. Results: 474 studies, of which 47 were selected for the systematic review and 8 for the meta-analysis, were identified. The results provide evidence that CBT significantly decreases the HR of posttraumatic stress disorder patients. In social phobia, obsessive–compulsive disorder and acute stress disorder, the results point in the same direction, although it is still early to attribute the decrease in HR to CBT. In specific phobias, traditional exposure therapy showed greater effect size than exposure with distractors or without psycho-education. Limitations: Most of the randomized trials have not been conducted in accordance with rigorous methodological quality criteria. Conclusions: Standardization in the methods used and in treatment protocols, as well as investigations in groups of patients with low physiological reactivity, are necessary in order to reach better conclusions. Notwithstanding these limitations, HR is beginning to emerge as a potential biomarker of efficacy in anxiety disorders.

Differences in prescribing patterns for anxiety and depression between General Internal Medicine and Family Medicine,"Introduction: Depression and anxiety are routinely managed by physicians in Family Medicine (FM) or General Internal Medicine (GIM). Because FM requires more behavioral health training than GIM, we sought to determine if prescribing patterns for patients with anxiety, depression, or both differed between FM vs. GIM providers. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, patient data and provider type were obtained from 2008 to 2013 electronic medical record patient data registry ( n = 27,225 (FM = 10,994, GIM = 16,231)) Prescription orders were modeled for specific benzodiazepines and antidepressants and by drug class. Covariates included gender, age, race, marital status and comorbidity index. Separate logistic regression models were computed, before and after adjusting for covariates, to estimate the odds of FM vs. GIM providers prescribing benzodiazepine or antidepressant medication to patients with anxiety, depression, and both disorders. Results: After adjusting for covariates, patients with anxiety alone, depression alone, and both had significantly greater odds of receiving an antidepressant (OR = 2.08;95%CI:1.46–2.96, OR = 2.13;95%CI:1.48–3.06, and OR = 2.26;95%CI:1.09–4.66, respectively) if treated by FM vs. GIM. Benzodiazepine prescription did not differ by physician type. Limitations: It is not known if results will generalize to other regions of the United States. Conclusions: Patients with anxiety, depression, and both seen by FM providers, as compared to GIM providers, are more likely to receive antidepressant medications. Further investigation into the determinants of these differences is warranted. Under-treatment in GIM may result in less advantageous outcomes.

"The effect of aphasia upon personality traits, depression and anxiety among stroke patients","Background: Post-stroke patients with aphasia have higher levels of psychological distress. We aimed to find the relation between post-stroke aphasia and depression, anxiety and personality traits. Methods: One month after stroke, 61 consecutive patients with stroke were included in this study. Thirty post-stroke patients with aphasia and 31 patients without aphasia. We used the following scales a clinical-friendly: Aphasic test, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Hamilton anxiety and Beck Depression Inventory. Results: Depression and anxiety were more prominent among patients with aphasia than stroke without aphasia. Psychosis was more prominent among post-stroke patients with aphasia. Limitations: Our results may not exclusively exclude pre-morbid personality traits. Conclusions: Our study highlights the growing need to develop community rehabilitation services in the developing world, which address both physical and psychological morbidity.

Elucidating the transdiagnostic dimensional structure of trauma-related psychopathology: Findings from VA cooperative study 504—Risperidone treatment for military service related chronic post traumatic stress disorder,"Background: Three of the most common trauma-related mental disorders—posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)—are highly comorbid and share common transdiagnostic symptom dimensions of threat (i.e., fear) and loss (i.e., dysphoria) symptomatology. However, empirical evaluation of the dimensional structure of component aspects of these disorders is lacking. Methods: Using structured clinical interview data from U.S. military veterans with chronic military-related PTSD, we evaluated the transdiagnostic dimensional structure of PTSD, MDD, and GAD symptoms. We then examined the relationship between the best-fitting transdiagnostic model of these symptoms, and measures of physical and mental functioning, and life satisfaction and well-being. Results: Exploratory factor analysis revealed that a 3-factor transdiagnostic model comprised of loss (i.e., dysphoria), threat (i.e., anxious arousal, re-experiencing, and avoidance symptoms), and somatic anxiety (i.e., physiological manifestations of anxiety) symptoms provided the best representation of trauma-related PTSD, MDD, and GAD symptoms. Somatic anxiety symptoms were independently associated with physical functioning, while loss symptoms were independently associated with mental functioning and life satisfaction and well-being. Limitations: Evaluation of study aims in a relatively homogeneous sample of veterans with chronic, military-related PTSD. Conclusions: Results of this study suggest that a 3-factor transdiagnostic model best characterizes the dimensional structure of PTSD, MDD, and GAD symptoms in military veterans with chronic military-related PTSD. This model evidenced external validity in demonstrating differential associations with measures of physical and mental functioning, and life satisfaction and well-being. Results provide support for emerging contemporary models of psychopathology, which emphasize transdiagnostic and dimensional conceptualizations of mental disorders. Such models may have utility in understanding the functional status of trauma survivors.

Social communication deficits: Specific associations with Social Anxiety Disorder,"Background: Social communication deficits are prevalent amongst children with anxiety disorders; however whether they are over-represented specifically among children with Social Anxiety Disorder has not been examined. This study set out to examine social communication deficits among children with Social Anxiety Disorder in comparison to children with other forms of anxiety disorder. Methods: Parents of 404 children with a diagnosed anxiety disorder completed the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ; Rutter, M., Bailey, A., Lord, C., 2003. The Social Communication Questionnaire – Manual. Western Psychological Services, Los Angeles, CA). Children with a diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder ( n = 262) and anxious children without Social Anxiety Disorder ( n = 142) were compared on SCQ total and subscale scores and the frequency of participants scoring above clinical cut-offs. Results: Children with Social Anxiety Disorder scored significantly higher than anxious children without Social Anxiety Disorder on the SCQ total ( t (352) = 4.85, p &lt; .001, d = .55, r = .27), Reciprocal Social Interaction ( t (351) = 4.73, p &lt; .001, d = .55, r = .27), communication ( t (344) = 3.62, p &lt; .001, d = .43, r = .21) and repetitive, restrictive and stereotyped behaviors subscales ( t (353) = 3.15, p = .002, d = .37, r = .18). Furthermore, children with Social Anxiety Disorder were three times more likely to score above clinical cut-offs. Limitations: The participants were a relatively affluent group of predominantly non-minority status. The social communication difficulties measure relied on parental report which could be influenced by extraneous factors. Conclusions: Treatments for Social Anxiety Disorder may benefit from a specific focus on developing social communication skills. Future research using objective assessments of underlying social communication skills is required.

Generalized anxiety in community-dwelling elderly: Prevalence and clinical characteristics,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic and disabling disorder with a low rate of full remission. As it is commonly assumed that cases in the elderly principally represent the continuing chronic course of early onset illness, there has been little research into the clinical characteristics, including comorbid psychiatric and physical conditions, which may be specific to older people. Methods: Lifetime GAD and psychiatric comorbidity were diagnosed in 1974 community-dwelling elderly people aged 65 or over using a standardized psychiatric examination, the MINI, based on DSM-IV criteria. Multivariate regression analyses were adjusted for socio-demographic, lifestyle, biological, and clinical variables, as well as adverse life events. Results: The lifetime prevalence of GAD was 11% (95% CI = 9.6–12.4%) of whom 24.6% reported a late onset with a first episode after 50 years of age. The 6-month current prevalence was 4.6% (95% CI = 3.7–5.5%). Most of the prevalent cases were recurrent but only 36.3% were receiving treatment. Fourteen percent were comorbid with major depression and 34% with phobia but their associated factors differed. The factors associated with pure GAD were being female, having cognitive impairment, lower body mass index, reporting low affective support during childhood, taking a high number of somatic medications independently of other mental health factors, e.g. psychotropic medication use, major depression, and phobia. Limitations: The study is limited by cross-sectional design. Conclusions: Our data indicate that GAD prevalence is high in elderly people with a late-life onset of GAD in 25% of cases. GAD in the elderly is not just a severity marker of depression and is clinically distinct from phobia, the other major anxiety disorder of the elderly.

A Dutch version of the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS): Psychometric properties and validation,"Background: The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) is a 5-item self-report measure that can be used to assess the impact of any anxiety disorder or multiple anxiety disorders. Prior US investigations have shown the OASIS to be a reliable and valid measure. To date the OASIS has not been validated for use in a Dutch sample of anxiety disordered patients. Methods: The present study assessed the psychometric properties of a Dutch version of the OASIS in a clinical sample of anxiety patients. Latent structure, internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity, and cutoff score analyses were conducted. Results were compared to those obtained from a clinical sample of patients with psychiatric diagnoses other than anxiety disorders. Results: Principal component analysis supported a unidimensional structure. The five OASIS items loaded strongly on a single factor (eigenvalue = 3.682, loadings = .80–.89) which accounted for 73.65% of the variance, and had a high degree of internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 91). OASIS scores demonstrated robust correlations with other measures of anxiety, neuroticism and general distress. Correlations with unrelated constructs were weak. Mean score (8.46) and cutoff score of the Dutch sample of anxiety patients were lower than scores previously found in American samples. A cutoff score of 5 correctly classified 82.5% of this sample as having an anxiety disorder diagnosis or not. An improvement of 4 points is indicative of a clinically significant change. Limitations: This study mainly relied on self-report measures in order to assess validity. Other types of measures should be used in future studies. Conclusions: The Dutch version of the OASIS showed good reliability and validity. Its brevity and sound psychometric properties make it a good instrument for screening and assessment purposes in the field of anxiety disorders.

"Transgenerational transmission of trauma in families of Holocaust survivors: The consequences of extreme family functioning on resilience, Sense of Coherence, anxiety and depression","Background: The psychological transmission of the noxious effects of a major trauma from one generation to the next remains unclear. The present study aims to identify possible mechanisms explaining this transmission among families of Holocaust Survivors (HS). We hypothesized that the high level of depressive and anxiety disorders (DAD) among HS impairs family systems, which results in damaging coping strategies of their children (CHS) yielding a higher level of DAD. Methods: 49 CHS completed the Resilience Scale for Adults, the Hopkins Symptom Check List-25, the 13-Item Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale, and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scale. We test a mediation model with Family types as the predictor; coping strategies (i.e. Resilience or SOC) as the mediator; and DAD as the outcome variable. Results: Results confirm that the CHS' family types are more often damaged than in general population. Moreover, growing in a damaged family seems to impede development of coping strategies and, therefore, enhances the occurrence of DAD. Limitations: The present investigation is correlational and should be confirmed by other prospective investigations. Conclusions: At a theoretical level we propose a mechanism of transmission of the noxious effects of a major trauma from one generation to the next through family structure and coping strategies. At a clinical level, our results suggest to investigate the occurrence of trauma among parents of patients consulting for DAD and to reinforce their coping strategies.

"The relationship between internalizing psychopathology and suicidality, treatment seeking, and disability in the Australian population","Background: Recent evidence has emerged suggesting that multiple mood and anxiety disorders may be better assessed using a single dimension representing internalizing liability. The current study seeks to demonstrate the validity and utility of internalizing liability when accounting for suicidality, treatment seeking, and disability over and above any disorder specific relationship. Methods: Data were from the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. A model containing a single factor was fit to the data as a means of explaining the shared relationship across seven DSM-IV mood and anxiety disorders. The shared and specific relationships between lifetime and past 12 months internalizing and mental health consultations, suicidality, and disability were examined using Multiple Indicators, Multiple Causes models. Results: General levels of latent internalizing were significantly related to all covariates of interest across both lifetime and past 12 months diagnoses. Models that included the specific relationship between various internalizing disorders and the clinical correlates failed to significantly improve model fit over and above a model that already included the general relationship between latent internalizing and the covariates. Limitations: Limitations include the use of cross-sectional data and diagnostic assessments based on self-report lay-administered interviews. Conclusions: The overall internalizing latent variable sufficiently explains the majority of the relationship between multiple mood and anxiety disorders and suicidality, treatment seeking, and disability. Researchers should focus on investigating the shared or common components across all mood and anxiety disorders particularly with respect to individuals presenting with higher rates of suicidality, treatment seeking behavior, and disability.

Neurostructural impact of co-occurring anxiety in pediatric patients with major depressive disorder: A voxel-based morphometry study,"Background: Depressive and anxiety disorders are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions in children and adolescents and commonly present occur together. Co-occurring depression and anxiety is associated with increased functional impairment and suicidality compared to depression alone. Despite this, little is known regarding the neurostructural differences between anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder (MDD). Moreover, the neurophysiologic impact of the presence of anxiety in adolescents with MDD is unknown. Methods: Using voxel-based morphometry, gray matter volumes were compared among adolescents with MDD (and no co-morbid anxiety disorders, n = 14), adolescents with MDD and co-morbid anxiety (“anxious depression,” n = 12), and healthy comparison subjects ( n = 41). Results: Patients with anxious depression exhibited decreased gray matter volumes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) compared to patients with MDD alone. Compared to healthy subjects, adolescents with anxious depression had increased gray matter volumes in the pre- and post-central gyri. Limitations: The current sample size was small and precluded an analysis of multiple covariates which may influence GMV. Conclusions: Gray matter deficits in the DLPFC in youth with anxious depression compared to patients with MDD and no co-occurring anxiety may reflect the more severe psychopathology in these patients. Additionally, the distinct gray matter fingerprints of MDD and anxious depression (compared to healthy subjects) suggest differing neurophysiologic substrates for these conditions, though the etiology and longitudinal trajectory of the differences remain to be determined.

Rating scales in general practice depression: Psychometric analyses of the Clinical Interview for Depression and the Hamilton Rating Scale,"Background: Our objective was to investigate to what extent the Clinical Interview for Depression (CID) used in the general practice setting covers clinically valid subscales (depression, anxiety, and apathy) which can measure outcome of antidepressant therapy as well as identifying subsyndromes within major depressive disorder. The CID was compared to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D₁₇). Methods: 146 patients from a previous study in general practice with the CID were investigated. The item response theory model established by Rasch was used to investigate the scalability (a scale's psychometric adequacy) of the subscales, and principal component analysis was used to identify subsyndromes with the symptoms of major depression according to DSM-5 or ICD-10. Results: Whereas the HAM-D₁₇ was found not to have an acceptable scalability, the three brief CID subscales for depression (six items), anxiety (five items), and apathy (five items) all had an acceptable scalability. Within the major depressive symptoms, principal component analysis identified the CID items of hypersomnia, increased appetite or weight gain as defining the subsyndrome of atypical depression. In total 29 patients (approximately 20%) had an atypical depression. Limitations: The samples were derived from a single study and were all rated by a single rater. Conclusion: The CID contains subscales of depression, anxiety, and apathy with an acceptable scalability for use in general practice. A subsyndrome of atypical depression is also a useful identifier in the treatment of depressed patients in general practice.

Cognitive tolerability following successful long term treatment of major depression and anxiety disorders with SSRi antidepressants,"Background: The present study aims to evaluate cognitive tolerability profile of SSRIs in long-term treatment. The secondary aim is to explore differences of side effects profile between patients with major depression (MD) and anxiety disorders (AD). Methods: Sixty-seven consecutive patients, successfully treated with SSRIs in monotherapy for at least six months for MD or AD, were assessed for side effects, with a special focus on cognition. Results: Over 20% of MD and AD patients in long term treatment with SSRIs reported cognitive symptoms including fatigue, inattentiveness, lack of concentration, memory impairment and apathy. Recall memory impairment, attention deficit and somnolence were most frequently rated as moderate or severe. There were no significant differences in SSRI cognitive side effects profile between MD and AD patients. Limitations: Subjective measure of cognitive functioning, limited sample size, lack of a control group. Conclusions: A large proportion of depressed and anxious patients treated successfully with SSRIs for over six months reported cognitive, affective, motivational symptoms. These symptoms are likely to represent SSRI side effects rather than residual depressive symptomatology.

"The prevalence and correlates of depression, anxiety, and stress in a sample of college students","Background: Over the past four years, the Franciscan University Counseling Center has reported a 231% increase in yearly visits, as well as a 173% increase in total yearly clients. This trend has been observed at many universities as mental health issues pose significant problems for many college students. The objective of this study was to investigate potential correlates of depression, anxiety, and stress in a sample of college students. Methods: The final analyzed sample consisted of 374 undergraduate students between the ages of 18 and 24 attending Franciscan University, Steubenville, Ohio. Subjects completed a survey consisting of demographic questions, a section instructing participants to rate the level of concern associated with challenges pertinent to daily life (e.g. academics, family, sleep), and the 21 question version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21). Results: The results indicated that the top three concerns were academic performance, pressure to succeed, and post-graduation plans. Demographically, the most stressed, anxious, and depressed students were transfers, upperclassmen, and those living off-campus. Conclusions: With the propensity for mental health issues to hinder the success of college students, it is vital that colleges continually evaluate the mental health of their students and tailor treatment programs to specifically target their needs.

Validity and clinical interpretability of Overall Anxiety Severity And Impairment Scale (OASIS),"Background: The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale is a brief generic measure for anxiety that encompasses frequency and intensity as well as behavioral and functional aspects of anxiety. This study was conducted to elucidate aspects of reliability, validity, and interpretability, such as equivalence of factor loadings across non-clinical and clinical populations, convergence and discriminance of related variables, and performance of detecting diagnostic and medical status of anxiety disorders. Methods: Non-clinical and clinical Japanese populations were taken from a panelist pool registered with an internet survey company (total n = 2830; 619 panic disorder, 576 for social anxiety disorder, 645 for obsessive-compulsive disorder, a 619 for major depressive disorder, and 371 for non-disorder panelists). Conventional measures of anxiety, depression, mental health and measures for discriminant validity were administered in addition to OASIS. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated good fit to data for the one-factor model of OASIS. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis showed the equivalence of the factor loadings between those of non-clinical and clinical subsamples. The OASIS reliability was confirmed by internal consistency and test–retest coefficients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed that OASIS and conventional anxiety measures have fair performance for detecting diagnostic and medical status as anxiety disorders. Limitations: Participants were limited to a Japanese population of people who had registered themselves at an internet survey company. Conclusions: Along with useful information to interpret OASIS, the results suggest the reliability and validity of OASIS in Japanese populations. These results also suggest cross-cultural validity.

Psychometric properties of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale in antepartum women from Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire,"Background: To explore the psychometric properties of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) in West African pregnant women. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, the GAD-7, the PHQ-9 (depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire) and the WHO-DAS II (12-item World Health Organization Disability Scale) were administered to n=647 Ivorian and n=395 Ghanaian antepartum women with low-risk pregnancies (third trimester; gestational age range: 28–40 weeks) in 2010–2011. Statistical analyses combined classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). Results: Cronbach's α was close to acceptable (α=.69 in Côte d’Ivoire; α=.67 in Ghana). Construct validity was demonstrated by correlations between the GAD-7 and both the PHQ-9 and the WHO-DAS II. Results regarding factorial validity were ambiguous: confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses indicated that the data fit the unidimensionality assumption; however, the explained variance was low. IRT methods suggested excellent item infit and outfit measures. Yet, residual principal component analyses showed a lack of unidimensionality. Rasch analyses revealed that the response options were not used as intended. Item-person-fit was not optimal since the items did not discriminate well on the range of the latent construct where most of the women drawn from the general population were located. Limitations: Both samples were somewhat homogenous regarding gestational age and urban residence; test–retest reliability was not investigated. Conclusion: The GAD-7 met the requirements of CTT. However, applying the stricter criteria of IRT suggested areas for potential improvements. Cross-cultural adaption and a dichotomized response format might ameliorate the GAD-7 for the use in sub-Saharan countries.

Prevention of anxiety and depression in Chinese: A randomized clinical trial testing the effectiveness of a stepped care program in primary care,"Background: Despite empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of collaborative stepped care program (SCP) in Western countries, such programs have not been evaluated in the east, which has a different services system structure and cultural nuances in seeking help for mental illness. Furthermore, only a few studies have used SCP for depression and anxiety prevention. We conducted a trial to test its effectiveness in preventing major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder among primary care patients with subthreshold depression and/or anxiety in Hong Kong. Methods: Subthreshold depression and/or anxiety patients were randomized into the SCP group (n=121) or care as usual (CAU) group (n=119). The SCP included watchful waiting, telephone counseling, problem solving therapy, and family doctor treatment within one year. The primary outcome was the onset of major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder in 15 months. The secondary outcomes were depressive and anxiety symptoms, quality of life and time absent from work due to any illness. Results: Survival analysis showed no differences between the SCP and CAU groups (the cumulative probability of onset at 15 month was 23.1% in the SCP group and 20.5% in the CAU group; Hazard Ratio=1.62; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.82–3.18; p=0.16). No significant differences were found in secondary outcomes. Limitations: Sample size might not have been large enough. Conclusions: SCP did not show beneficial effect on depression/anxiety prevention compared with CAU in Hong Kong primary care. As a large majority of patients improved overtime without any intervention, we are not able to exclude the possibility that the intervention might be effective. Future studies would need to have a larger sample size and conduct on patients with more severe symptoms or perform a second screening.

Responses to threat-related emotionality (i.e., the contrast of fear and angry vs. happy faces) were assessed at pretreatment and again following 10 sessions of CBT in the GAD group and a comparable waiting period in the HC group. Results: At pretreatment, GAD participants displayed blunted responses in the amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate to the happy face-processing comparison condition, and greater amygdalo–insular connectivity. CBT was associated with attenuated amygdalar and subgenual anterior cingulate activation to fear/angry faces and heightened insular responses to the happy face comparison condition, but had no apparent effects on connectivity. Pre-treatment abnormalities and treatment-related changes were not associated with symptoms of worry. Limitations: There was no active control condition (e.g., treatment waitlist) for comparison of treatment effects. Conclusions: Taken together, these results provide evidence for a dual-process psychotherapeutic model of neural systems changes in GAD in which cingulo-amygdalar reactivity to threat-cues is attenuated while insular responses to positive facial emotions are potentiated. Future work is needed to determine the clinical implications of these changes and their specificity to CBT.

A clinically useful self-report measure of the DSM-5 mixed features specifier of major depressive disorder,"Background: To acknowledge the clinical significance of manic features in depressed patients, DSM-5 included criteria for a mixed features specifier for major depressive disorder (MDD). In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project we modified our previously published depression scale to include a subscale assessing the DSM-5 mixed features specifier. Methods: More than 1100 psychiatric outpatients with MDD or bipolar disorder completed the Clinically Useful Depression Outcome Scale (CUDOS) supplemented with questions for the DSM-5 mixed features specifier (CUDOS-M). To examine discriminant and convergent validity the patients were rated on clinician severity indices of depression, anxiety, agitation, and irritability. Discriminant and convergent validity was further examined in a subset of patients who completed other self-report symptom severity scales. Test–retest reliability was examined in a subset who completed the CUDOS-M twice. We compared CUDOS-M scores in patients with MDD, bipolar depression, and hypomania. Results: The CUDOS-M subscale had high internal consistency and test–retest reliability, was more highly correlated with another self-report measure of mania than with measures of depression, anxiety, substance use problems, eating disorders, and anger, and was more highly correlated with clinician severity ratings of agitation and irritability than anxiety and depression. CUDOS-M scores were significantly higher in hypomanic patients than depressed patients, and patients with bipolar depression than patients with MDD. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional, thus we did not examine whether the CUDOS-M detects emerging mixed symptoms when depressed patients are followed over time. Also, while we examined the correlation between the CUDOS-M and clinician ratings of agitation and irritability, we did not examine the association with a clinician measure of manic symptomatology such as the Young Mania Rating Scale Conclusions: In the present study of a large sample of psychiatric outpatients, the CUDOS-M was a reliable and valid measure of the DSM-5 mixed features specifier for MDD.

Clinical risk factors for bipolar disorders: A systematic review of prospective studies,"Background: Early phases and suspected precursor states of bipolar disorder are not well characterized. We evaluate the prevalence, duration, clinical features and predictive value of non-affective psychopathology as clinical risk factors for bipolar disorder in prospective studies. Methods: We screened PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase, SCOPUS, and ISI-Web of Science databases from inception up to January 31, 2014, following PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and searched: bipolar disorder AND [antecedent⁎ OR predict⁎ OR prodrom⁎ OR prospect⁎ OR risk⁎] AND [diagnosis OR development]. We included only English language reports on prospective, longitudinal studies with two structured clinical assessments (intake and follow-up); no DSM intake diagnosis of bipolar-I or -II; diagnostic outcome was bipolar-I or -II. Details of study design, risk factors, and predictive value were tabulated. Results: We found 16 published reports meeting selection criteria, with varying study design. Despite heterogeneity in methods, findings across studies were consistent. Clinical risk factors of bipolar disorder were early-onset panic attacks and disorder, separation anxiety and generalized anxiety disorders, conduct symptoms and disorder, ADHD, impulsivity and criminal behavior. Limitations: Since risk factors identified in some prospective studies are predictive of other conditions besides bipolar disorder, these preliminary findings require replication, and their sensitivity, specificity and predictive value need to be assessed. Conclusions: Clinical risk factors for bipolar disorder typically arise years prior to syndromal onset, include anxiety and behavioral disorders with unclear sensitivity and specificity. Prospectively identified clinical risk factors for bipolar disorder are consistent with retrospective and family-risk studies. Combining clinical risk factors with precursors and family-risk may improve early identification and timely and appropriate treatment of bipolar disorder.

Resilience to affective disorders: A comparative validation of two resilience scales,"Background: Resilience to affective disorders in rehabilitating patients or in individuals with a severe disability is of special research interest. However, there is no gold standard for measuring resilience. We aimed to test the accuracy of the Dutch translation of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRSnl) and of the Resilience Scale (RSnl) in recognizing rehabilitating patients without anxiety and depression, and to determine the reliability and construct validity of both scales. Methods: A within-subjects longitudinal study with six assessments, each one week apart. Forty residents of a nursing home rehabilitating unit were interviewed to assess resilience (BRSnl and RSnl), optimism and pessimism (LOT-R), depression and anxiety (HADS), positive and negative affect (PANAS), and pain (VAS). Results: Receiver operating characteristic analyses for recognizing the absence of depression and anxiety (HADS-score≤7) revealed better accuracy (P=0.038) for the BRSnl (AUC=0.84; p&lt;0.0001) than for the RSnl (AUC=0.68; P=0.017). The scales correlated moderately at baseline (r s=0.35; p=0.026), and at four-week follow-up (r s=0.50; p=0.004). The RSnl was positively associated with positive outcomes (optimism and positive affect), and the BRSnl positively with positive outcomes, and negatively with negative outcomes (pessimism, anxiety and negative affect). The RSnl showed a better four-week test–retest reliability (ICC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.97) than the BRSnl (0.66; 95% CI, 0.29 to.83). Limitations: Short study duration, a relatively small sample. Conclusion: The BRSnl showed better performance in detecting people without depression and anxiety than the RSnl, and performed better on construct validity.

Risk factors for the onset of panic and generalised anxiety disorders in the general adult population: A systematic review of cohort studies,"Background: We aimed to assess available evidence on risk factors associated with the onset of panic disorder (PD) and/or generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in cohort studies in the general adult population. Methods: Systematic review using MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase. Search terms included panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, cohort studies and risk factors. Results: We finally selected 21 studies, involving 163,366 persons with a median follow-up of 5 years. 1) Sociodemographic factors: PD was associated with age, female gender, and few economic resources. GAD was associated with age, non-Hispanics and Blacks, being divorced or widowed, and few economic resources. 2) Psychosocial factors: PD was associated with smoking and alcohol problems. GAD was associated with stressful life events in childhood and adulthood, and personality. 3) Physical and mental health factors: PD was associated with the number of physical diseases suffered and the joint hypermobility syndrome. PD was also associated with a parental history of mental disorders, as well as with other anxiety disorders and other mental health problems in the person affected. GAD was associated with a parental history of mental disorders, as well as with other anxiety disorders and other mental health problems in the person affected, plus already having received psychiatric care. Limitations: Few studies examined the same risk factors. Conclusions: Sociodemographic, psychosocial and mental–physical health risk factors were determinant for the onset of PD and GAD in the general adult population. These findings could be useful for developing preventive interventions in PD and GAD.

Are there depression and anxiety genetic markers and mutations? A systematic review,"Background: Genetic factors may encourage or even cause the occurrence of mood disorders such as anxiety and/or depression. However, despite the significant amount of work and sophisticated technology is not fully elucidated which genes or regions of nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, or which types of genetic changes, alone or in combination, can represent reliable genetic markers of anxiety and/or depression. Objective: To identify whether there are genetic changes that can cause depression or anxiety and if there are genetic markers that can be used to detect these changes. Methods: A systematic review of 01.01.2004 to 03.28.2014 was held by VHL (Virtual Health Library). The search was performed with the descriptors 'anxiety', 'depression', “mutation” and “genetic markers'. The selected articles were indexed in MEDLINE. The information pertinent to the study was selected, categorized and analyzed. Of the 374 articles found, 29 met the eligibility criteria. Results: FMR1 gene polymorphisms, dopaminergic (DAT, DRD, COMT), serotonin (5-HTTLPR, HTR1A, HTR2A), interleukins, MCR1, HCN (potassium channel), neurorregulinas, GABAergic (GABA, GAD, DBI) DBI, GABA (Gabra) receptors and GAD genes (GAD1, GAD2) appear to contribute to generate condition of depression or anxiety like. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA in 124pb allele of D2S2944 in ofil 1 and 2 loci of chromosomes 4 and 7, respectively, and the chromosomes 8p, 17p and 15q appear to be associated with the origin of depression or anxiety. Conclusion: Some studies show only associations with one of the disorders, mainly anxiety. Few have shown association with both simultaneously. Other studies showed specific association of gender, or even specific ethnic groups. It was noticed, controversies over certain markers. Interesting results were observed in combination of changes, especially in cases of SNPs, indicating that perhaps this is the most appropriate way to find reliable markers.

"Exploring mechanisms of change: The relationships between cognitions, symptoms, and quality of life over the course of group cognitive-behaviour therapy","Background: This study aimed to explain how quality of life changes during psychotherapy, using a cognitive-behavioural theoretical framework, and examined whether changes in symptoms or changes in cognitions were more influential with regard to quality of life change. Three different hypotheses were tested that might explain the mechanisms by which quality of life changes during group cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) for anxiety and depression. Methods: 127 outpatients with anxiety and/or depression enrolled in a four-week group CBT programme participated. Measures of anxiety and depression symptoms, cognitive change, and quality of life were administered at baseline and post-treatment. Baseline to post-treatment change scores were calculated and entered into multiple regression analyses. Results: Reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms were related to increases in quality of life, whereas cognitive changes were not consistently related to changes in quality of life. Limitations: The main limitation was that the study's design was not able to assess whether changes in cognitions or symptoms preceded changes in quality of life, as all variables were measured at the same two points in time. Conclusions: These results provided evidence that quality of life changes as a result of or, simultaneously with, symptom change. It appears that group CBT does not improve quality of life through strategies designed to change patients' cognitions.

Insomnia before and after treatment for anxiety and depression,"Background: Insomnia increases the likelihood of developing a mood or anxiety disorder. Moreover, symptoms of anxiety and depression, such as worry and rumination, contribute to insomnia. Given these relationships, there is a need to delineate how these disorders respond to treatment when they are comorbid. Methods: 266 individuals presenting for anxiety and/or depression symptoms participated in this study in which symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, depression, disability, and sleep length were assessed. 102 of these patients were treated with internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for anxiety and/or depression and 61 completed the treatment. Pre- to post-treatment symptom changes were examined in this subset. Results: Insomnia, as measured by the Insomnia Severity Index, was evident in 40% of the patients. Individuals with insomnia reported more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression than individuals without insomnia. iCBT focused on anxiety and/or depression was associated with reductions in symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and disability. Total sleep time did not change over treatment. Limitations: As the data were collected in routine care, there was no control group and no longer term follow-up assessment. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of insomnia across anxiety and depressive disorders. They further demonstrate that treatment for anxiety and/or depression appears to improve comorbid insomnia symptoms, though may be ineffective in changing sleep duration.

"A comparative analysis of personality pathology profiles among patients with pure depressive-, pure anxiety-, and pure somatoform disorders","Background: Depressive-, anxiety-, and somatoform disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders. The assessment of comorbid personality pathology or traits in these disorders is relevant, because it can lead to the exacerbation of them or to poorer remission rates. To date, no research findings have been published on the comparison of these three prevalent patient groups with regard to comorbid dimensional personality pathology. Methods: Data of participants (18–60 years) came from a web-based Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) programme. The present study used baseline data and was designed to compare personality pathology profiles between three separate outpatient groups: pure anxiety disorders (n=1633), pure depressive disorders ( n = 1794), and pure somatoform disorders ( n = 479). Personality pathology was measured with the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Short Form (DAPP-SF). Results: The pure depressive disorder group, in comparison to the other two disorder groups, exhibited the worst psychopathological and functional health image and most personality pathology. In the pure anxiety disorder group, the highest mean was found for the personality trait Anxiousness; and in the pure depressive disorder group for the traits Identity problems, Affective lability, Anxiousness, and Restricted expression. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the study limits the conclusions that can be drawn. Conclusions: The assessment of comorbid personality pathology in depressive-, anxiety-, somatoform disorders is clinically relevant, whether a patient has a personality disorder or not. This way, treatment could partly be focused on specific personality traits that may be counterproductive for treatment outcome, especially in depressive disorders.

Attention bias modification (ABM) as a treatment for child and adolescent anxiety: A systematic review,"Background: Attention Bias Modification (ABM) is a novel computer based treatment for anxiety disorders. It has been proposed as an efficient, accessible psychological therapy and is based on cognitive theories of attention. The present review sought to investigate the efficacy of ABM as a potential treatment for child and adolescent anxiety. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted, using three main databases, PsycINFO, Embase and Medline, to identify original research articles which measured the effect of ABM on anxiety levels in children and/or adolescents. Results: Ten articles met the inclusion criteria and of these 10, three were randomised control trials. A lack of standardisation in relation to the treatment protocol was observed; nonetheless the identified studies generally provided evidence for the efficacy of ABM as an anxiety treatment. Limitations: Due to the nature of the studies found, a statistical meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusions: ABM seems to be a promising, novel treatment for child and/or adolescent anxiety disorders with merits over lengthier, talking based therapies. However, more rigorous research trials are needed to clarify the mechanisms behind ABM and establish effective, standardised treatment protocols.

Evaluation of an online psychoeducation intervention to promote mental health help seeking attitudes and intentions among young adults: Randomised controlled trial,"Background: Research has consistently identified a disparity between the prevalence of mental health concerns among young adults and their rates of formal help seeking. However, a few randomised controlled trials have identified effective interventions for increasing formal help seeking among young adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief online psychoeducational intervention, targeting depression, anxiety and suicide stigma, for increasing positive attitudes towards help seeking and increasing help seeking intentions among young adults. Method: The study followed a single-blind parallel group randomized controlled trial design with 67 young adult (18–25 years) Australian participants, assigned to receive online psychoeducation ( n = 33) or online attention-matched control information (n=34) over 3 weeks. Participants in the experimental group received information on depression, anxiety, and suicide. The control group received information unrelated to mental health. Primary outcome measures were mental health literacy, mental illness stigma, attitudes toward professional help seeking and intentions to seek help. Secondary outcome variables were symptomology, satisfaction and adherence. Results: Significant between-group differences were found for the pre- to post-test, including increased anxiety literacy (Cohen's d = 0.65), decreased depression stigma ( d = 0.53), and increased help seeking attitudes and intentions for the experimental group ( d = 0.58 and d=0.53, respectively). Limitations: Due to the small sample size and homogenous nature of the sample, generalisations should be made with caution. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the utility and effectiveness of a brief online psychoeducation intervention for promoting help seeking among young adults.

Secondhand smoke exposure across the life course and the risk of adult-onset depression and anxiety disorder,"Introduction: The aim of this paper was to investigate the association between childhood and adulthood exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) and depression, panic attack, and generalized anxiety disorder among adults in the United States over a 10-year period. Methods: Data were drawn from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) Waves 1 and 2 (N=2053). Self-reported childhood and adulthood SHS exposure at Wave 1 (1994) was examined in relation to incident depression, panic attack, and generalized anxiety disorder 10 years later at Wave 2 (2005). Results: Childhood SHS alone was not associated with mood and anxiety disorders in adulthood. Exposure to SHS in both childhood and adulthood was associated with increased depression and panic attack in adulthood. These associations did not appear to be due to confounding. Limitations: SHS exposure was measured via self-report; biological data confirming exposure were not collected. More objective measures of SHS exposure are needed in future studies. Conclusions: In summary, persistent exposure to SHS across the life course may be associated with increased risk of depression and panic attacks. Our results are consistent with prior findings and extend earlier results by showing a relationship between SHS exposure and mental health problems over time. Replication with biological measures of SHS over time is a necessary next step toward better understanding the pathways explaining these relationships.

Are childhood trauma exposures predictive of anxiety sensitivity in school attending youth?,"Background: Stressful life events in adolescents have been found to be longitudinally associated with higher anxiety sensitivity (AS). A question that has not been addressed is whether AS in adolescence is associated with different childhood adversity exposures. Methods: School attending adolescents (n=1149) completed measures of anxiety sensitivity (CASI), trait anxiety (STAI-T), childhood trauma (CTQ), depression (CES-DC), alcohol (AUDIT) and drug use (DUDIT), and resilience (CD-RISC) and coping orientation (A-COPE). Results: There was no significant gender difference in childhood trauma exposure, resilience levels or coping orientation. Gender differences were evident in terms of AS, trait anxiety, depression, alcohol and drug use. Depression, trait anxiety and alcohol use mediated the relationship between the amount of childhood trauma and AS and played a role in the relationship between certain childhood trauma types and AS. Neither resilience nor coping orientation had a moderating effect on the relationship between the amount of childhood trauma and AS. Limitations: Cross-sectional study, over- or under-reporting of data due to use of self-report instruments, and use of a retrospective measure of childhood trauma (CTQ) that is subject to recall bias. Conclusions: Girls are at greater risk than boys for early onset anxiety disorders as girls have higher rates of AS, trait anxiety and depression despite the same rates of childhood trauma, coping orientation and resilience. Our findings, in the context of childhood trauma, underscore the influence of depression, trait anxiety and alcohol use as risk factors for the development of AS in youth.

The impact of anxious symptoms in the remission of depressive symptoms in a clinical trial for depression: Follow-up of six months,"Background: Studies show high comorbidity between anxiety disorder and depression. Little is known regarding how anxiety symptoms affect prognosis in depression treatment, suggesting the importance of studying the impact of anxiety symptoms in the treatment of depression. We evaluated the impact of anxiety symptoms in the remission of depressive symptoms after brief psychotherapies for depression. Methods: This randomized clinical trial of 18–29-year-old adults included individuals who met the diagnostic criteria for depression as assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD); anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). The protocols of psychotherapy used were: Cognitive Narrative Psychotherapy (CNP) and Cognitive Behavioral Psychotherapy (CBP). Both treatments included seven sessions. At the end of the treatment and six-month follow-up, an evaluation was made with the HRSD and HARS. The sample included 97 patients divided between the protocols of psychotherapy. Results: There was a significant, positive, moderate correlation between the severity of anxiety symptoms at baseline and the remission of depressive symptoms at post-intervention ( r = 0.38 p &lt;0.001) as well as a significant, positive, low correlation at follow up ( r = 0.20 p = 0.049). We found remission of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms after brief psychotherapies, and the remission persisted at follow up. Limitation: We did not evaluate the diagnosis of anxiety disorders. Conclusion: The severity of anxiety symptoms did not compromise the treatment focused primarily on depressive symptoms.

This is wrong, it should be Table 2. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-23424-003). Background: Depression and anxiety are particularly common among individuals living in long-term care facilities. Therefore, access to a valid and reliable measure of anxiety and depression among nursing home patients is highly warranted. Aim: To investigate the dimensionality, reliability and construct validity of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) in a cognitively intact nursing home population. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected from two samples; 429 cognitively intact nursing home patients participated, representing 74 different Norwegian nursing homes. Confirmative factor analyses and correlations with selected constructs were used. Results: The two-factor model provided a good fit in Sample1, revealing a poorer fit in Sample2. Good-acceptable measurement reliability was demonstrated, and construct validity was supported. Limitations: Using listwise deletion the sample sizes were 227 and 187, for Sample1 and Sample2, respectively. Greater sample sizes would have strengthen the statistical power in the tests. The researchers visited the participants to help fill in the questionnaires; this might have introduced some bias into the respondents' reporting. The 14 HADS items were part of greater questionnaires. Thus, frail, older NH patients might have tired during the interview causing a possible bias. Conclusion: Low reliability for depression was disclosed, mainly resulting from three items appearing to be inappropriate indicators for depression in this population. Further research is needed exploring which items might perform as more reliably indicators for depression among nursing home patients.

"Integrating video-feedback and cognitive preparation, social skills training and behavioural activation in a cognitive behavioural therapy in the treatment of childhood anxiety","Background: The present study examined the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic prevention programme, Super Skills for Life (SSL), in children with anxiety problems. SSL is based on the principles of cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT), behavioural activation, social skills training, and uses video-feedback and cognitive preparation as part of the treatment. Methods: Participants were 61 primary school children, aged 8–10 years, who were referred by their teachers as having significant anxiety problems. Children were video-recorded during a 2-min speech task in sessions 1 and 8, and during a social interaction task. All the children completed measures of anxiety symptoms, social skills, and self-esteem before and after participating in the 8-week SSL and at the 6-months follow-up assessment. Results: Anxiety symptoms were significantly reduced at post-test and follow-up assessments. SSL also had a positive effect on hyperactivity, conduct, and peer problems although it took longer for these effects to occur. Behavioural indicators of anxiety during the 2-min speech task decreased, indicating that the independent raters observed behavioural change in the children from pre-treatment to follow-up. Boys had higher overall behavioural anxiety during the 2-min speech task at all three assessment periods, specifically showing higher lip contortions and leg movement than girls. Limitations: The present study used an open clinical trial design, had small sample size, and did not use structured diagnostic interview schedules to assess anxiety disorders. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary empirical support for the effectiveness of SSL in children with anxiety problems.

Children and adolescents referred for treatment of anxiety disorders: Differences in clinical characteristics,"Background: Reports of the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders are typically based on community populations or from clinical samples with exclusion criterion applied. Little is known about the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents routinely referred for treatment for anxiety disorders. Furthermore, children and adolescents are typically treated as one homogeneous group although they may differ in ways that are clinically meaningful. Methods: A consecutive series of children ( n = 100, aged 6–12 years) and adolescents ( n = 100, aged 13–18 years), referred to a routine clinical service, were assessed for anxiety and comorbid disorders, school refusal and parental symptoms of psychopathology. Results: Children with a primary anxiety disorder were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with separation anxiety disorder than adolescents. Adolescents with a primary anxiety disorder had significantly higher self and clinician rated anxiety symptoms and had more frequent primary diagnoses of social anxiety disorder, diagnoses and symptoms of mood disorders, and irregular school attendance. Limitations: Childhood and adolescence were considered categorically as distinct, developmental periods; in reality changes would be unlikely to occur in such a discrete manner. Conclusions: The finding that children and adolescents with anxiety disorders have distinct clinical characteristics has clear implications for treatment. Simply adapting treatments designed for children to make the materials more ‘adolescent-friendly’ is unlikely to sufficiently meet the needs of adolescents.

A systematic review of fMRI studies in generalized anxiety disorder: Evaluating its neural and cognitive basis,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a prevalent anxiety disorder, but its neurobiological basis has been poorly studied. A few cognitive models have been proposed for understanding GAD development and maintenance. The aim of this study is to review functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI) studies conducted with GAD patients and evaluate if they support and underpin the theoretical cognitive models proposed for this anxiety disorder. Methods: A literature systematic review was undertaken in PubMed and ISI databases with no time limits. Results: From the studies included in this review, 10 explored the “emotional dysregulation model”, showing, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) hypofunction and deficient top-down control system during emotion regulation tasks, despite conflicting techniques and results. Only one study explored the “conditioned fear overgeneralization theory”, other the “intolerance of uncertainty model” and two studies were unspecific (worry induction tasks). Between those, there were 4 studies evaluating pre- and post-treatment with antidepressants or “mindfulness”. Limitations: The studies' methodologies differ between one another making it difficult to identify a common finding. Conclusion: Emotion dysregulation seems to be an important cognitive dysfunction in GAD patients and fMRI studies suggest that it is related to PFC and ACC hypofunction as well as a deficient cortex–amygdala functional connectivity.

A long-term follow-up of clinical response and regional cerebral blood flow changes in depressed patients treated with ECT,"Background: Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most potent therapy. We investigated the clinical response and regional cerebral blood flow changes in depressed in patients treated with (ECT) in a repeated longitudinal study. Method: Forty-nine patients (21 men and 28 women) with a mean age 61 years underwent ECT. Forty-one patients grading improvement after the initial ECT-series (responder group) were compared with eight, grading no improvement (non-responder group). The patients underwent neuropsychiatric ratings, measure of clinical response (defined as ≥50% reduction of pre-treatment depression score) and measure of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Results: The responder group had an initial 60–82%, and the non-responder group a 30–64% clinical response throughout the follow-up. The non-responder group showed more reported depression ( p = .003), and vegetative anxiety ( p = .024), with a generally higher left temporal rCBF ( p = .045). Limitations: The retrospective approach and the small sample-size. Conclusion: Patients with no subjective improvement after ECT had lesser objective clinical response, more sustained reported depression with anxiety features, and higher left temporal rCBF.

As a result, the purpose of this study was to examine the association of objectively-measured visual acuity with depression and anxiety (and panic disorder) among a national sample of young- and middle-age U.S. adults (20–39 years). Methods: Using data from the 2003–2004 NHANES ( n = 602), the presence of anxiety, depression, and panic disorders was assessed from a diagnostic interview. Visual acuity was assessed from a vision exam using the Nidek Auto Lensmeter Model (LM-990A) and expressed as LogMAR units. Results: After adjusting for age, gender, race-ethnicity, body mass index, mean arterial pressure, cotinine, diabetes, and physical activity, visual acuity was not associated with panic disorder ( p = 0.71) or depression disorder ( p = 0.20), but for every 0.1 LogMAR unit change in vision, participants had a 14% (OR = 1.14; p = 0.04) higher odds of having an anxiety disorder. Limitations: The main limitation of this study was the cross-sectional design. Conclusion: Young- and middle-age U.S. adults with worse visual function are at increased odds of having an anxiety disorder. Strategies to prevent and treat anxiety among those with worse visual function are needed.

Situational panic attacks in social anxiety disorder,"Background: Panic attacks (PAs) are common in many psychiatric disorders other than panic disorder, especially social anxiety disorder (SAD). PAs have been associated with increased severity, comorbidity, and impairment in many disorders; therefore, PAs can now be used as a descriptive specifier across all DSM-5 disorders. However, the clinical implications of PAs in SAD remain unclear. Methods: The aim of the present investigation was to examine demographic and clinical characteristics associated with SAD-related situational panic attacks in a large, representative epidemiological sample of individuals with SAD ( N = 1138). We compared individuals with SAD who did and did not endorse situational PAs in terms of demographic factors, fear/avoidance of social situations, distress, impairment, and diagnostic comorbidity. Results: Being male, black, Asian, or over 65 years old was associated with a decreased likelihood of experiencing situational PAs, whereas being unemployed was associated with an increased likelihood. Individuals with situational PAs also exhibited greater fear and avoidance of social situations, impairment, coping-oriented substance use, treatment utilization, and concurrent and longitudinal psychiatric comorbidity. Limitations: Consistent with most epidemiologic studies, the information collected relied on self-report, and not all participants were available for both waves of assessment. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that SAD-related situational PAs are associated with more severe and complex presentations of SAD. Implications for the assessment and treatment of SAD, as well as for the use of PAs as a descriptive specifier for SAD, are discussed.

Disability in anxiety disorders,"Background: This study compares disability levels between different anxiety disorders and healthy controls. We further investigate the role of anxiety arousal and avoidance behaviour in disability, and whether differences in these symptom patterns contribute to disability differences between anxiety disorders. Methods: Data were from 1826 subjects from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). The Composite Interview Diagnostic Instrument was used to diagnose anxiety disorders. The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II was used to measure disability in six domains (cognition, mobility, selfcare, social interaction, life activities, participation). Severity of anxiety arousal and avoidance behaviour symptoms was measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Fear Questionnaire. Results: All anxiety disorders were associated with higher disability. Disability was generally highest in multiple anxiety disorder (e.g. mean disability in cognition = 33.7) and social anxiety disorder (mean = 32.7), followed by generalized anxiety disorder (mean = 27.2) and panic disorder with agoraphobia (mean = 26.3), and lowest in panic disorder without agoraphobia (mean = 22.1). Anxiety arousal was more associated with disability in life activities ( B = 8.5, p &lt; 0.001) and participation ( B = 9.9, p &lt; 0.001) whereas avoidance behaviour was more associated with disability in cognition ( B = 7.4, p &lt; 0.001) and social interaction ( B = 8.6, p &lt; 0.001). Different disability patterns between anxiety disorders were not completely explained by anxiety arousal and avoidance behaviour. Limitations: The cross-sectional study design precludes any causal interpretations. In order to examine the full range of comorbidity among anxiety, a greater range of anxiety disorders would have been preferable. Conclusions: Disability is highest in social anxiety disorder and multiple anxiety disorder. Both anxiety arousal and avoidance behaviour are associated with higher disability levels but do not fully explain the differences across anxiety disorders.

Teasing apart low mindfulness: Differentiating deficits in mindfulness and in psychological flexibility in predicting symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and depression,"Background: This research investigated the differential ability of three components of low mindfulness to uniquely predict symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression, while controlling for psychological inflexibility, a construct conceptually related to low mindfulness. Also examined was the meditational role of several mindfulness facets in the relationship between psychological inflexibility and symptoms of each disorder. Methods: Using a clinical sample ( n = 153) containing mostly patients with GAD or depression diagnoses, we conducted hierarchical multiple regression analyses and mediation analyses to determine unique relationships. Results: Whereas deficits in adopting a non-reactive perspective exhibited incremental validity beyond psychological inflexibility in predicting symptoms of GAD, deficits in acting with awareness did so in predicting symptoms of depression. Results of mediation analyses corroborated this pattern, as the relationships psychological inflexibility exhibited with symptoms of GAD and of depression were mediated by non-reactivity and acting with awareness, respectively. Limitations: The cross-sectional design of this study precludes causal interpretations of the mediation models. Conclusion: Findings corroborate the following conclusions: (i) the lack of present oriented awareness experienced by individuals with symptoms of depression is not completely accounted for by psychological inflexibility nor by symptoms of GAD; (ii) the reactive approach to automatic thoughts adopted by those with symptoms of GAD is not completely accounted for by psychological inflexibility nor by symptoms of depression. These conclusions suggest that it would be profitable for mindfulness-based therapies to concentrate on these specific mindfulness deficits to ameliorate the severity of GAD and depression.

Impact of comorbid anxiety disorders and obsessive–compulsive disorder on 24-month clinical outcomes of bipolar I disorder,"Background: This study investigated the impact of comorbid obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and four anxiety disorders [panic disorder (PD), agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder (SAD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)] on the clinical outcomes of bipolar disorder. Methods: This study analysed data of 174 patients with bipolar I disorder who participated in the prospective observational study. Participants were assessed every 3 months for 24 months. The primary outcome measure was the achievement of symptomatic remission, defined by a total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) of ≤ 12 and a total score on the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21) of ≤ 8. Results: Comorbidity was associated with decreased likelihood of remission. However, the impact of individual disorders on outcome differed according to clinical and treatment situations. Most comorbid anxiety disorders and OCD had a negative effect on remission during the first year of evaluation, as measured by the HAMD-21, and in patients taking a conventional mood stabilizer alone. However, the association with poorer outcome was observed only for a few specific comorbid disorders in the second year (GAD and OCD), as measured by YMRS-defined remission (OCD), and in patients with olanzapine therapy (GAD and OCD). Limitations: Follow-up evaluation of comorbid disorders was lacking. Conclusions: Comorbid anxiety disorders and OCD negatively influenced the clinical course of bipolar disorder. Specifically, OCD had a consistently negative impact on the outcome of bipolar I disorder regardless of clinical situation. Effective strategies for the control of these comorbidities are required to achieve better treatment outcomes.

Effectiveness of transdiagnostic Internet cognitive behavioural treatment for mixed anxiety and depression in primary care,"Background: Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural treatment (iCBT) has been shown to be effective for the combined treatment of depression and anxiety in randomised controlled trials. The degree to which these findings generalise to patients in primary care awaits further investigation. Methods: Using an open-trial design, we investigated adherence to, and effectiveness of a 6-lesson therapist-assisted iCBT program for mixed anxiety and depression for patients ( n = 707) who completed the program under the supervision of primary care clinicians (general practitioners, psychologists and other allied health professionals). Primary outcome measures were the PHQ-9 (depression), GAD-7 (generalised anxiety), K-10 (distress), WHODAS-II (disability), mini-SPIN (social anxiety) and panic disorder severity scale self-report version (PDSS). Results: Adherence to the iCBT program was modest (47.3%), but within-subjects effect sizes ranged from medium (0.51 for PDSS) to large (1.20 for PHQ-9). Limitations: The lack of control group, limited post-treatment data due to drop-out, and short follow-up period. Conclusions: iCBT is an effective treatment for mixed depression and anxiety when delivered in primary care settings. Methods to increase adherence are needed to optimise the benefits to patients.

"The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale—Dimensionality, reliability and construct validity among cognitively intact nursing home patients","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 167 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2014-32537-033). In the original article, there were some errors the corrections are present in the erratum.] Background: Depression and anxiety are particularly common among individuals living in long-term care facilities. Therefore, access to a valid and reliable measure of anxiety and depression among nursing home patients is highly warranted. Aim: To investigate the dimensionality, reliability and construct validity of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) in a cognitively intact nursing home population. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected from two samples; 429 cognitively intact nursing home patients participated, representing 74 different Norwegian nursing homes. Confirmative factor analyses and correlations with selected constructs were used. Results: The two-factor model provided a good fit in Sample1, revealing a poorer fit in Sample2. Good-acceptable measurement reliability was demonstrated, and construct validity was supported. Limitations: Using listwise deletion the sample sizes were 227 and 187, for Sample1 and Sample2, respectively. Greater sample sizes would have strengthen the statistical power in the tests. The researchers visited the participants to help fill in the questionnaires; this might have introduced some bias into the respondents' reporting. The 14 HADS items were part of greater questionnaires. Thus, frail, older NH patients might have tired during the interview causing a possible bias. Conclusion: Low reliability for depression was disclosed, mainly resulting from three items appearing to be inappropriate indicators for depression in this population. Further research is needed exploring which items might perform as more reliably indicators for depression among nursing home patients.

The costs of social anxiety disorder: The role of symptom severity and comorbidities,"Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with low direct costs compared to other anxiety disorders while indirect costs tend to be high. Mental comorbidities have been identified to increase costs, but the role of symptom severity is still vague. The objective of this study was to determine the costs of SAD, and to explore the impact of symptoms and comorbidities on direct and indirect costs. Methods: Baseline data, collected within the SOPHO-NET multi-centre treatment study ( N = 495), were used. Costs were calculated based on health care utilization and lost productivity. Symptom severity was measured with the Liebowitz-Social-Anxiety-Scale; comorbidities were included as covariates. Results: Total 6-month costs were accrued to €4802; 23% being direct costs. While there was no significant association with SAD symptom severity for direct costs, costs of absenteeism increased with symptom severity in those with costs &gt; 0; comorbid affective disorders and eating disorders had an additional effect. Self-rated productivity was lower with more pronounced symptoms even after controlling for comorbidities. Limitations: As the study was based on a clinical sample total costs were considered, rather than net costs of SAD and no population costs could be calculated. Discussion: The burden associated with lost productivity was considerable while costs of healthcare utilization were rather low as most patients had not sought for treatment before. Efforts to identify patients with SAD earlier and to provide adequate treatment should be further increased. Mental comorbidities should be addressed as well, since they account for a large part of indirect costs associated with SAD.

"Observing nonreactively: A conditional process model linking mindfulness facets, cognitive emotion regulation strategies, and depression and anxiety symptoms","Background: Mindfulness-based interventions for depression and anxiety emphasize the importance of observing present moment experience, but observing has often been positively related to anxiety and unrelated to depression symptoms. The current study sought to better understand the conditions and mechanism through which observing relates to symptoms by examining six conditional process models in which (1) nonreactivity moderates the direct effect of observing on symptoms of anxiety and depression symptoms and (2) nonreactivity moderates the indirect effect of observing on anxiety and depression via cognitive emotion regulation strategies (i.e. rumination, worry, and reappraisal). Methods: A clinical sample of 189 adults with anxiety and depressive disorders completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Ruminative Responses Scale, and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Results: Conditional process models showed that nonreactivity significantly moderated the direct effect of observing on symptoms of depression, but not anxiety. Additionally, nonreactivity significantly moderated the indirect effect of observing on symptoms of depression through rumination and reappraisal, but not worry. For anxiety, nonreactivity significantly moderated the indirect effect of observing on symptoms through worry and rumination, but not reappraisal. Limitations: Causal interpretations of results are limited. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the relationship between observing and symptoms of depression and anxiety depends on the capacity to observe nonreactively, which may influence symptoms directly and indirectly through cognitive emotion regulation strategies. Findings raise important implications for tailoring mindfulness-based treatments for anxiety and depression symptoms.

Anxiety and depression among haematological cancer patients attending treatment centres: Prevalence and predictors,"Background: This study aimed to: (1) estimate the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among haematological cancer patients attending treatment centres; and (2) explore the demographic, disease and treatment characteristics associated with anxiety and/or depression. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with outpatients from three haematology clinics in Australia. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of haematological cancer were approached by a research assistant while waiting for their appointment and invited to participate in the survey. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and self-reported demographic, disease and treatment characteristics. Results: Questionnaires from 304 participants were returned. Twenty-seven percent of patients reported anxiety and 17% reported depression. Specifically, 15% reported anxiety without depression, 5% reported depression without anxiety, and 12% reported comorbid anxiety and depression. Participants who had to relocate to receive treatment had almost three times the odds of reporting anxiety and/or depression compared to those who did not have to move. Former smokers also had significantly higher odds of reporting anxiety and/or depression. Limitations: The HADS is likely to have produced some false positives and false negatives when compared with gold standard structured clinical interviews for assessing psychological morbidity. Conclusions: Approximately 20% of haematological cancer patients attending outpatient clinics may experience clinically significant levels of anxiety and/or depression. Providing additional tailored support to patients who have had to relocate for treatment, and to former smokers, may help to reduce anxiety and depression among these subgroups.

A clinical trial of cranial electrotherapy stimulation for anxiety and comorbid depression,"Background: Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders and are usually treated with medication and/or psychotherapy. When anxiety disorders are accompanied with comorbid depression, this further complicates the treatment process. Medication compliance is a common problem due to adverse side effects and new and effective treatments that have minimal side effects are needed for the treatment of anxiety and depression. This study used a randomized, double-blind, sham controlled design to examine the effectiveness of CES as a treatment for anxiety disorders and comorbid depression in a primary care setting. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01533415. Methods: One hundred and fifteen participants, age 18 years and over, with a primary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder were enrolled from February 2012 to December 2012 The Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale₁₇ (HAM-D₁₇) were used for baseline and outcome measures at weeks one, three, and five. Response to treatment was defined as a reduction of ≥50% or more on these measures. Results: Analysis of covariance revealed a significant difference between the active CES group and the sham CES group on anxiety ( p = 0.001, d = 0.94) and on depression ( p = 0.001, d = 0.78) from baseline to endpoint of study in favor of the active CES group. Conclusions: CES significantly decreases anxiety and comorbid depression. Subjects reported no adverse events during the study.

"Somatic, but not cognitive, symptoms of anxiety predict lower levels of physical activity in panic disorder patients","Background: Anxiety disorders have gathered much attention as possible risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), possibly mediated by an unhealthy lifestyle (e.g. low physical activity). However, prospective studies on anxiety disorders and CVD show conflicting results. A possible explanation is that somatic symptoms of anxiety may have a more specific cardiovascular effect than cognitive symptoms across different anxiety disorders. The present study investigated the association between cognitive and somatic symptoms of anxiety and physical activity (PA) in a sample of panic disorder (PD) outpatients. Methods: One-hundred and two outpatients with a lifetime diagnosis of PD from a previously studied cohort were contacted. Patients were evaluated throughout the MINI, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). After performing a multivariate regression analysis, groups were divided into high and low somatic anxiety. Results: Patients with high somatic anxiety showed a significantly higher prevalence of low level of PA as compared to those with low somatic anxiety (62.5 versus 34.3%; χ² = 5.33; df = 1; P = .021). Somatic symptoms of anxiety remained the only important predictors of low level of PA (odds ratio [ OR ] 2.81; 95% CI 1.00–7.90; p = .050) in the multivariate model. Limitations: The main limitations of the present study are the cross-sectional design and the small sample size. Conclusions: Results support specific effects of somatic symptoms of anxiety on risk for low level of PA, which might explain inconsistent results regarding CVD risk in the literature.

Neural response to reward anticipation in those with depression with and without panic disorder,"Background: One of the hallmark features of major depressive disorder (MDD) is reduced reward anticipation. There have been mixed findings in the literature as to whether reward anticipation deficits in MDD are related to diminished mesolimbic activation and/or enhanced dorsal anterior cingulate activation (dACC). One of the reasons for these mixed findings is that these studies have typically not addressed the role of comorbid anxiety, a class of disorders which frequently co-occur with depression and have a common neurobiology. Methods: The aim of the current study was to examine group differences in neural responses to reward anticipation in 40 adults with either: (1) current MDD with no lifetime diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (MDD-only), (2) current MDD with comorbid panic disorder (MDD-PD), or (3) no lifetime diagnosis of psychopathology. All participants completed a passive slot machine task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. Results: Analyses indicated that there were no group differences in activation of mesolimbic reward regions; however, the MDD-only group exhibited greater dACC activation during the anticipation of rewards compared with the healthy controls and the comorbid MDD-PD group (who did not differ from each other). Limitations: The sample size was small which limits generalizability. Conclusions: These findings provide preliminary support for the role of hyperactive dACC functioning in reduced reward anticipation in MDD. They also indicate that comorbid anxiety may alter the association between MDD and neural responding to reward anticipation.

Anxiety disorders in adolescents and psychosocial outcomes at age 30,"Background: Anxiety disorders are associated with adverse psychosocial functioning, and are predictive of a wide range of psychiatric disorders in adulthood. Objective: The present study examined the associations between anxiety disorders during childhood and adolescence and psychosocial outcomes at age 30, and sought to address the extent to which psychopathology after age 19 mediated these relations. Method: Eight hundred and sixteen participants from a large community sample were interviewed twice during adolescence, at age 24, and at age 30. They completed self-report measures of psychosocial functioning and semi-structured diagnostic interviews during adolescence and young adulthood. Results: Adolescent anxiety predicted poor total adjustment, poor adjustment at work, poor family relationships, problems with the family unit, less life satisfaction, poor coping skills, and more chronic stress. Adolescent anxiety predicted, substance (SUD), alcohol abuse/dependence (AUD), and anxiety in adulthood. No adult psychopathology mediated the relationship between childhood anxiety disorders and psychosocial outcomes at age 30. Adult, SUD, AUD and anxiety mediated the association between adolescent anxiety and most domains of psychosocial functioning at age 30. Limitations: The participants are ethically and geographically homogenous, and changes in the diagnostic criteria and the interview schedules across the assessment periods. Conclusion: Adolescent anxiety, compared to childhood anxiety, is associated with more adverse psychosocial outcomes at age 30. Adolescent anxiety affects negative outcomes at age 30 directly and through adult anxiety, SUD and AUD.

Social anxiety in first-episode psychosis: The role of childhood trauma and adult attachment,"Background: Social anxiety is among the most prevalent affective disturbances among people with psychosis. The developmental pathways associated with its emergence in psychosis, however, remain unclear. The aim of this study is to identify the developmental risk factors associated with social anxiety disorder in first-episode psychosis and to investigate whether social anxiety in psychosis and non-psychosis is associated with similar or different adult attachment styles. Method: This is a cross-sectional study. A sample of individuals with social anxiety disorder (with or without psychosis) was compared with a sample with psychosis only and healthy controls on childhood trauma, dysfunctional parenting and adult attachment. Results: Childhood trauma and dysfunctional parenting ( p &lt; 0.05) were significantly elevated in people with social anxiety (with or without psychosis) compared to those with psychosis only and healthy controls. There were no differences in childhood trauma and dysfunctional parenting between socially anxious people with and without psychosis. Higher levels of insecure adult attachment ( x ²₁ = 38.5, p &lt; 0.01) were reported in the social anxiety group (with or without psychosis) compared to the psychosis only and healthy controls. Childhood adversities were not associated with insecure adult attachment in people with social anxiety (with or without psychosis). Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study we cannot infer causal relationships between early risk factors, including childhood trauma and dysfunctional parenting, and social anxiety. Also, the use of self-report measures of attachment could be subject to biases. Conclusion: Shared developmental risk factors are implicated in the emergence of affective disorders in psychosis and non-psychosis. Social anxiety in psychosis is associated with insecurity in adult attachments which does not arise a result of adverse developmental pathways. Understanding the bio-psycho-social risk factors for affective dysregulation in psychosis could inform psychological interventions about the role of developmental anomaly and trauma in the emergence of affective dysregulation in psychosis.

The effect of comorbid major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder on cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) commonly co-occur in individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD), yet whether these comorbidities influence the outcomes of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD is unclear. Methods: The present study examined the degree to which individuals with SAD and comorbid MDD (SAD + MDD; n = 76), comorbid BD (SAD + BD; n = 19), a comorbid anxiety disorder (SAD + ANX; n = 27), or no comorbid diagnoses (SAD + NCO; n = 41) benefitted from CBT for SAD. Individuals were screened using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and then completed the Social Phobia Inventory and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales before and after 12-weeks of group CBT for SAD. Results: At pretreatment the SAD + MDD and SAD + BD groups reported higher social anxiety symptoms than the SAD + ANX and SAD + NCO groups. All groups reported large and significant improvement in social anxiety with CBT. However, at posttreatment the SAD + MDD and SAD + BD groups continued to have higher social anxiety symptoms than the SAD + NCO group, and the SAD + ANX group did not differ in social anxiety symptoms from any group. The sample also showed small and statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms with CBT for SAD. Limitations: Information about medication was not collected in the present study, and we did not assess the long-term effects of CBT. Conclusion: Our results suggest that CBT for SAD is an effective treatment even in the presence of comorbid mood disorders in the short-term, although extending the course of treatment may be helpful for this population and should be investigated in future research.

Increased fear-potentiated startle in major depressive disorder patients with lifetime history of suicide attempt,"Background: Suicide is a common reason for psychiatric emergency and morbidity, with few effective treatments. Anxiety symptoms have emerged as potential modifiable risk factors in the time before a suicide attempt, but few studies have been conducted using laboratory measures of fear and anxiety. We operationally defined fear and anxiety as increased startle reactivity during anticipation of predictable (fear-potentiated startle) and unpredictable (anxiety-potentiated startle) shock. We hypothesized that a lifetime history of suicide attempt (as compared to history of no suicide attempt) would be associated with increased fear-potentiated startle. Methods: A post-hoc analysis of fear- and anxiety-potentiated startle was conducted in 28 medication-free patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) divided according to suicide attempt history. Results: The magnitude of fear-potentiated startle was increased in depressed patients with lifetime suicide attempts compared to those without a lifetime history of suicide attempt ( F (1,26) = 5.629, p = .025). There was no difference in anxiety-potentiated startle by suicide attempt history. Limitations: This is a post-hoc analysis of previously analyzed patient data from a study of depressed inpatients. Further replication of the finding with a larger patient sample is indicated. Conclusions: Increased fear-potentiated startle in suicide attempters suggests the role of amygdala in depressed patients with a suicide attempt history. Findings highlight the importance of anxiety symptoms in the treatment of patients at increased suicide risk.

Comparative performance of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale for screening antepartum depression,"Objective: We sought to evaluate the psychometric properties of two widely used screening scales: the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) among pregnant Peruvian women. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1517 women receiving prenatal care from February 2012 to March 2013. A structured interview was used to collect data using PHQ-9 and EPDS. We examined reliability, construct and concurrent validity between two scales using internal consistency indices, factor structures, correlations, and Cohen's kappa. Results: Both scales had good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha &gt; 0.8). Correlation between PHQ-9 and EPDS scores was fair (rho = 0.52). Based on exploratory factor analysis (EFA), both scales yielded a two-factor structure. EFA including all items from PHQ-9 and EPDS yielded four factors, namely, “somatization”, “depression and suicidal ideation”, “anxiety and depression”, and “anhedonia”. The agreement between the two scales was generally fair at different cutoff scores with the highest Cohen's kappa being 0.46. Conclusions: Both the PHQ-9 and EPDS are reliable and valid scales for antepartum depression assessment. The PHQ-9 captures somatic symptoms, while EPDS detects depressive symptoms comorbid with anxiety during early pregnancy. Our findings suggest simultaneous administration of both scales may improve identification of antepartum depressive disorders in clinical settings.

Association between family history of mood disorders and clinical characteristics of bipolar disorder: Results from the Brazilian bipolar research network,"Objectives: To compare clinical characteristics of bipolar disorder (BD) in patients with and without a family history of mood disorders (FHMD) in a large sample from the Brazilian Research Network of Bipolar Disorders. Methods: Four-hundred eighty-eight DSM-IV BD patients participating in the Brazilian Research Network of Bipolar Disorders were included. Participants were divided between those with FHMD ( n = 230) and without FHMD ( n = 258). We compared these two groups on demographic and clinical variables and performed a logistic regression to identify which variables were most strongly associated with positive family history of mood disorders. Results: BD patients with FHMD presented with significantly higher lifetime prevalence of any anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, substance abuse, and were more likely to present history of suicide attempts, family history of suicide attempts and suicide, and more psychiatric hospitalizations than BD patients without FHMD. Logistic regression showed that the variables most strongly associated with a positive FHMD were any comorbid anxiety disorder, comorbid substance abuse, and family history of suicide. Limitations: Cross-sectional study and verification of FHMD by indirect information. Conclusion: BD patients with FHMD differ from BD patients without FHMD in rates of comorbid anxiety disorder and substance abuse, number of hospitalizations and suicide attempts. As FHMD is routinely assessed in clinical practice, these findings may help to identify patients at risk for particular manifestations of BD and may point to a common, genetically determined neurobiological substrate that increases the risk of conditions such as comorbidities and suicidality in BD patients.

"Why are anxiety and depressive symptoms comorbid in youth? A multi-wave, longitudinal examination of competing etiological models","Background: The present study sought to clarify the development of comorbid emotional distress by comparing different explanations for how youth develop anxiety and depressive symptoms. Specifically, we introduced the diathesis-anxiety approach (whether cognitive vulnerabilities interact with anxiety symptoms), and compared it to a causal model (anxiety symptoms predicting depressive symptoms), and a correlated liabilities model (whether cognitive vulnerabilities interacted with stressors to predict both anxiety and depressive symptoms) to examine which model best explained the relation between depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth. Methods: 678 3rd ( n = 208), 6th ( n = 245), and 9th ( n = 225) grade girls ( n = 380) and boys ( n = 298) completed self-report measures at baseline assessing cognitive vulnerabilities (rumination and self-criticism), stressors, depressive and anxiety symptoms. Every 3 months over the next 18 months, youth completed follow-up measures of symptoms and stressors. Results: While limited support was found for a causal (p &gt; 0.10) or correlated-liability model ( p &gt; 0.05) for comorbidity, findings did support a diathesis-anxiety approach for both self-criticism ( t (2494) = 3.36, p &lt; 0.001) and rumination ( t (2505) = 2.40, p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: The present study's findings are based on self-report measure and makes inferences concerning comorbidity with a community sample. Conclusions: These results may help clarify past research concerning comorbidity by introducing a diathesis-anxiety approach as a viable model to understand which youth are most at-risk for developing comorbid emotional distress.

"Psychometric validation of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) subscales for depression, anxiety, and interpersonal sensitivity","Background: The psychometric validity of many subscales of the 90-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) remains largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the ""Hamilton-subscales"" for depression (SCL-D₁₆), anxiety (SCL-A₁₄), their 6-item core-measures (SCL-D₆ and SCL-A₆), the anxiety symptom scale (SCL-ASS8) and the interpersonal sensitivity scale (IPS5). Methods: The psychometric properties of the SCL-D₁₆, SCL-A₁₄, SCL-D₆, SCL-A₆, SCL-ASS₈, and the IPS5 were evaluated based on SCL-90 ratings from 850 day patients from a Danish psychiatric day hospital. The factor structure of the SCL-D16 and the SCL-A14 was investigated by means of principal component analysis (PCA) and the unidimensionality of all scales was estimated by Mokken analysis. Finally, the discriminant validity of the scales, i.e. their ability to distinguish between patients with various diagnoses, was tested. Results: The PCA of the SCL-D₁₆ and the SCL-A₁₄ separated the core depression items from the arousal items on the SCL-D16 and the psychic anxiety items from the somatic anxiety items on the SCL-A₁₄. According to the Mokken analyses, only the SCL-D₆, the SCL-ASS₈ and the IPS₅ were unidimensional. Interestingly, the same three scales displayed discriminant validity for depression, anxiety disorders and personality disorders, respectively. Limitations: The study is based on data from Denmark. This may limit the validity of the results. Conclusions: Three unidimensional SCL-90 subscales were identified. Using these scales it is possible to perform a psychometrically valid evaluation of psychiatric patients regarding the severity of depression (HAM-D6), specific anxiety (SCL-ASS8) and interpersonal sensitivity (IPS5).

Maternal anxiety during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies,"Background: Previous studies concerning the association between maternal anxiety during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes have provided controversial findings. Methods: In this systematic review, a meta-analysis was utilized to investigate the association between maternal anxiety and preterm birth (PTB) and/or low birth weight (LBW). Literature was searched until June 2013. Only prospective cohort studies that reported data on maternal anxiety during pregnancy with PTB and/or LBW were included. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed or random effects models depending on the size of heterogeneity. Results: Twelve studies totaling 17,304 pregnant women reported PTB data; and six studies totaling 4948 pregnant women reported LBW data. Maternal anxiety during pregnancy was associated with significant increased risk of PTB (pooled RR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.33–1.70) and LBW (pooled RR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.32 –2.33). Limitations: Potential moderators could not be adequately considered due to insufficient information. In addition, the effects of different types of anxiety disorder on the risk of these adverse birth outcomes could not be investigated. Conclusions: The results suggested that maternal anxiety during pregnancy was positively related to an increased risk of PTB and LBW. Healthcare providers should give close attention to anxiety in pregnant women and provide appropriate mental health support in order to improve outcomes for both mothers and infants.

The impact of lifestyle factors on the 2-year course of depressive and/or anxiety disorders,"Background: Although depressed and anxious patients often show an unhealthy lifestyle, much is still unclear about its impact on the natural course of disorders. This study will examine whether physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption predicted the 2-year course of depressive and/or anxiety disorders. Methods: In a large sample of depressed and/or anxious patients ( n = 1275), we examined whether baseline physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption independently predicted the course of disorders at 2-year follow-up. The persistence of DSM-IV depressive and/or anxiety disorders (primary outcome) and the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms (secondary outcomes) were considered. Confounding effects of baseline severity of psychopathology, sociodemographics, somatic health indicators and treatment factors were taken into account. Results: The persistence of disorders was significantly increased in patients with low physical activity (61.2%), but not moderate physical activity (54.4%), compared to patients with high physical activity (49.2%). This association remained significant after adjustment for baseline severity of psychopathology, other lifestyle factors (smoking and alcohol consumption), sociodemographics, somatic health indicators and treatment factors. Similar results were found for the course of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Neither smoking nor alcohol consumption was related to the course of depressive and/or anxiety disorders. Limitations: Assessments of lifestyle factors were based on self-report and may be subject to recall and social desirability bias. Conclusions: Low physical activity, but not heavy smoking or alcohol consumption, was a strong and independent risk factor of an unfavorable course of depressive and/or anxiety disorders and may be an important therapeutic target in treatment.

"Neural structures, functioning and connectivity in Generalized Anxiety Disorder and interaction with neuroendocrine systems: A systematic review","Background: Research on the neurobiological basis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) has considerably expanded in recent years. However, many studies investigated different domains and used different methods and paradigms. Therefore, this review aims to integrate the findings to date and to identify the core correlates of neurobiological underpinnings of GAD discovered so far. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of original papers investigating neural correlates, connectivity, or structural changes as well as reporting changes in the serotonergic system, noradrenergic system and cortisol levels in DSM-IV-defined GAD samples until December 2013. Results: Studies have identified abnormal amygdala and prefrontal cortex activation in patients and decreased functional connectivity between these areas. Furthermore, studies showed increased gray matter volume and decreased structural connectivity between these structures. Neuroendocrine findings are less consistent, but increased reactivity of the noradrenergic system and perpetuations in the cortisol secretion have been reported. Limitations: Only studies on DSM-IV defined Generalized Anxiety Disorder which employed a group comparison were included. Conclusions: Current research suggests a distinct set of neurobiological alterations in Generalized Anxiety Disorder. However, future research on the interaction between these structures and systems and on the specificity of these findings in relation to other mental disorders is urgently needed.

Escalation to major depressive disorder among adolescents with subthreshold depressive symptoms: Evidence of distinct subgroups at risk,"Background: The presence of subthreshold depressive symptoms (SubD) in adolescence is associated with high prospective risk of developing Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Little is known about variables that predict escalation from SubD to MDD. This study used a longitudinal prospective design in a community sample of adolescents to identify combinations of risk factors that predicted escalation from SubD to MDD. Methods: Classification tree analysis was used to identify combinations of risk factors that improved the sensitivity and specificity of prediction of MDD onset among 424 adolescents with a lifetime history of SubD. Results: Of the 424, 144 developed MDD during the follow-up period. Evidence for multiple subgroups was found: among adolescents with poor friend support, the highest risk of escalation was among participants with lifetime histories of an anxiety or substance use disorder. Among adolescents with high friend support, those reporting multiple major life events in the past year or with a history of an anxiety disorder were at highest risk of escalation. Limitations: Study findings may not inform prevention efforts for individuals who first develop SubD during adulthood. This study did not examine the temporal ordering of predictors involved in escalation from SubD to MDD. Conclusions: Adolescents with a history of SubD were at highest risk of escalation to MDD in the presence of poor friend support and an anxiety or substance use disorder, or in the presence of better friend support, multiple major life events, and an anxiety disorder. Findings may inform case identification approaches for adolescent depression prevention programs.

"The prevalence, clinical correlates and structure of phobic fears in Han Chinese women with recurrent major depression","Background: Phobic fears are common in the general population and among individuals with major depression (MD). We know little about the prevalence, clinical correlates, and structure of phobic fears in Chinese women with MD. Methods: We assessed 22 phobic fears in 6017 Han Chinese women with MD. We used exploratory factor analysis to examine the structure of these phobic fears. We examined the relationship between individual phobic fears and the severity of MD, neuroticism, comorbid panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymia using logistic regression models. Results: The frequency of phobic fears ranged from 3.0% (eating in public) to 36.0% (snakes). Phobic fears were significantly associated with more severe MD, high neuroticism, and co-morbid panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymia. Our factor analysis suggested four underlying subgroups of phobic fears which differed in their clinical correlates, severity and patterns of comorbidity. Limitations: Data were collected retrospectively through interview and recall bias may have affected the results. Conclusions: Phobic fears are correlated with comorbid MD and more severe MD. These phobic fears clearly subdivide into four subgroups that differ meaningfully from each other.

Structure of the DSM-5 generalized anxiety disorder criteria among a large community sample of worriers,"Background: There is growing empirical and clinical consensus that many psychiatric disorders are continuous in nature. The DSM-5 however makes a categorical distinction between subthreshold and threshold cases of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). This study tested the a priori assumption that the DSM-5 criteria identify a break in psychopathology between subthreshold and threshold cases of GAD. Methods: Respondents of the 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Well Being who self-identified as worriers were selected for analyses ( n = 1738). The GAD criteria were assessed using the World Mental Health version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Item response, latent class and factor mixture models were estimated to assess the structure of the GAD criteria. Results: The relative fit of the latent variable models suggested that a single continuous factor explains the way that worriers endorse the GAD criteria. However, the similar psychometric properties of the GAD criteria suggested that the GAD criteria impose a relatively finite threshold over this dimension of severity. Limitations: Although these structural analyses did not identify a break in psychopathology between subthreshold and threshold cases of GAD based on the way that respondents endorsed the DSM-5 criteria, it is possible that structural analyses of risk factors and other clinical correlates of GAD may identify such a break in the future. Conclusions: These data suggest that the DSM-5 GAD criteria lend themselves to making both categorical decisions about cases as well as being indices of a continuum of severity.

Risk factors for Panic Disorder in pregnancy: A cohort study,"Background: The study investigates the prevalence of Panic Disorder (PD) with or without comorbid Major (MD) or Minor Depressive (md) disorder during pregnancy and focuses its attention on the different pattern of risk factors in these two subgroups in a sample of women attending two Centres for Prenatal Care of the Public Health Service. Methods: Two-hundred and seventy-seven pregnant women were assessed monthly throughout the whole pregnancy period using the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) for the screening of PD and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for the evaluation of severity of anxious and depressive symptoms. Results: Twenty-one women (7.5%) were diagnosed as affected by PD, of whom 12 (57.1%) showed MD or md comorbidity. The development of PD without depressive comorbidity is predicted by a history of previous episodes of Anxiety Disorders while the development of PD plus depressive comorbidity is predicted by a history of previous depressive episodes and by the lack of familiar support. Limitations: Given the small sample size of our anxious and depressed women, the present data need to be verified by using larger samples. Conclusions: The frequent association between PD and MD or md, the analysis of risk factors and of temporal relationship strongly suggests that the panic-depressive comorbidity might represent in fact depressive disorders with intense anxiety symptoms. These findings raise the question if the PD-depressive association is a true comorbidity or reveals the anxious symptomatology of a depressive disorder (MD or md).

Gender differences in major depressive disorder: Results from the Netherlands study of depression and anxiety,"Background: Although an overall gender difference in prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) has been well established, several questions concerning gender differences in the clinical manifestation of depression remain. This study aims to identify gender differences in psychopathology, treatment, and public health consequences in patients with MDD. Methods: Baseline data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) were used, including 1115 participants (364 men, 751 women, mean age 41 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of current MDD. Characteristics studied included symptom profiles, comorbidity, treatment, and public health consequences. Results: Women reported a younger age of onset of single (27.8 years vs. 31.6 years; p = 0.001) and recurrent MDD (24.8 years vs. 27.6 years; p = 0.014), a higher comorbidity of panic disorder with agoraphobia (24.9% vs. 17.3%; p = 0.006) and life-time overall anxiety disorder (77.6% vs. 71.4%; p = 0.029) than men. More men than women suffered from comorbid alcohol dependence or abuse (48.1% vs. 24.5%; p &lt; 0.001). An increased prevalence of atypical depression in women (24.6% vs. 17.3%; p = 0.009) was found. Women were treated more frequently by an alternative caretaker (20.6% vs. 14.8%; p = 0.025), men more often in mental health care organizations (61.0% vs. 53.7%; p = 0.025). No gender differences in frequency of medication use or counseling were found. Limitations: Cross sectional design. Conclusions: Main gender differences in the clinical presentation of MDD concerned a younger age of onset, higher anxiety and lower alcohol use comorbidity and higher prevalence of atypical depression in women. These differences were accompanied by differences in health care use.

Measuring depression with a well-being index: Further evidence for the validity of the WHO Well-Being Index (WHO-5) as a measure of the severity of depression,"Background: In recent years, the WHO Wellbeing Index (WHO-5) has been used as a screening measure for depression. Nevertheless, research on the validity of this measure in the context of clinical depression is sparse. Questions: The aim of the present study was to investigate the measurement invariance of the WHO-5 across depressed and non-depressed individuals, as well as the shape and specificity of its relationship to measures of depression severity. Method: Of the 414 subjects who completed the WHO-5 and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), 207 had a diagnosis of a major depressive episode (MDE). A subsample also completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and was assessed by clinicians using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Results: The WHO-5 demonstrated strong measurement invariance regarding the presence or absence of a current MDE. The WHO-5 showed a very high negative association with self- and observer-rated measures of depressive symptoms, especially in the range of mild to moderate symptoms. These associations were still substantial after controlling for measures of anxiety symptoms. Limitations: In addition to a diagnostic interview, only one measure for self- and observer-rated symptoms of depression was used. Furthermore, the observer-rated measure was only assessed in one subsample that exhibited a somewhat restricted range of depression severity. Conclusion: Although this index was originally designed as a measure of well-being, the results support the use of the WHO-5 in the context of depression research.

Effect of music therapy during vaginal delivery on postpartum pain relief and mental health,"Background: Childbirth is an important experience in a woman's life, and unfavorable birth experiences have been shown to negatively impact postpartum maternal health. Aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of music therapy on postpartum pain, anxiety level, satisfaction and early pospartum depression rate. Methods: Totally 161 primiparous women were recruited and randomized either music group ( n = 80) or a control group ( n = 81). Women in the music group listened to self-selected music during labor. Postpartum pain intensity, anxiety level and satisfaction rate were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS), postpartum depression rate was assessed with Edinburg Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) at postpartum day one and day eight. Results: Mothers in the music therapy group had a lower level of postpartum pain and anxiety than the control group and it was statistically significant at all time intervals (1, 4, 8, 16 and 24h, p &lt; 0.001). A significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of satisfaction rate ( p &lt; 0.001) and postpartum depression rate at postpartum day one and day eight ( p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: We only measured the effect of music therapy on early postpartum depression rate. Effect of music on late postpartum depression rate should be investigated in future. Conclusions: Using music therapy during labor decreased postpartum anxiety and pain, increased the satisfaction with childbirth and reduced early postpartum depression rate. Music therapy can be clinically recommended as an alternative, safe, easy and enjoyable nonpharmacological method for postpartum well-being.

Parenting strategies for reducing the risk of adolescent depression and anxiety disorders: A Delphi consensus study,"Background: The family setting, particularly parents, is a strategic target for preventive interventions for youth depression and anxiety disorders. However, more effective translation of relevant research evidence is required. Method: This study employed the Delphi methodology to establish expert consensus on parenting strategies that are important for preventing adolescent depression or anxiety disorders. A literature search identified 402 recommendations for parents. These were presented to a panel of 27 international experts over three survey rounds, who rated their preventive importance. Results: One-hundred and ninety parenting strategies were endorsed as important or essential in reducing adolescents' risk of developing depression or anxiety disorders by ≥ 90% of the panel. These strategies were written into a document suitable for parents, categorized under 11 sub-headings: You can reduce your child's risk of depression and anxiety problems, Establish and maintain a good relationship with your teenager, Be involved and support increasing autonomy, Establish family rules and consequences, Minimize conflict in the home, Encourage supportive relationships, Help your teenager deal with problems, Encourage good health habits, Help your teenager to deal with anxiety, Encourage professional help seeking when needed, and Don't blame yourself. Limitations: This study utilized an international panel of experts from Western countries, hence the strategies identified may not be relevant for families from other cultural groups. Conclusions: This study produced a set of parenting strategies that are supported by research evidence and/or international experts, which can now be promoted in Western English-speaking communities to help parents protect their adolescents from depression and anxiety disorders.

Oxidative stress in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders,"Background: Anxiety disorders are common in children and adolescents, and they can significantly impair quality of life. Genetic, neurobiological, neurochemical, and psychological factors are believed to play a role in the etiopathogenesis of anxiety disorders. Recent evidence suggests that the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders may be associated with oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated whether there are associations between children with anxiety disorders and total oxidant/antioxidant status. Methods: The experimental group consisted of 40 patients (children and adolescents) with anxiety disorders. An age- and gender-matched control group composed of 35 healthy subjects was also assessed. Venous blood samples were collected and total antioxidative status (TAS), total oxidative status (TOS), and the oxidative stress index (OSI) were determined. Results: Both the TOS and the OSI of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group. There were no significant differences in TAS between the experimental and control groups. Limitations: The main limitation of our study was the small sample size. Conclusions: This study suggests that oxidative balance is impaired in children with anxiety disorders. Oxidative stress may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of anxiety disorders, and TOS may be a useful diagnostic tool in this context.

Parental factors associated with depression and anxiety in young people: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: There is a burgeoning and varied literature examining the associations between parental factors and depression or anxiety disorders in young people. However, there is hitherto no systematic review of this complex literature with a focus on the 12–18 years age range, when the first onset for these disorders peaks. Furthermore, to facilitate the application of the evidence in prevention, a focus on modifiable factors is required. Methods: Employing the PRISMA method, we conducted a systematic review of parental factors associated with depression and anxiety disorders in young people which parents can potentially modify. Results: We identified 181 articles altogether, with 140 examining depression, 17 examining anxiety problems, and 24 examining both outcomes. Stouffer's method of combining p values was used to determine whether associations between variables were reliable, and meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the mean effect sizes of associations between each parental factor and outcome. Limitations: Limitations include sacrificing micro-level detail for a macro-level synthesis of the literature, not systematically reviewing moderators and mediators, the lack of generalizability across cultures and to younger or adult children, and the inability to conduct a meta-analysis on all included studies. Conclusions: Parental factors with a sound evidence base indicating increased risk for both depression and anxiety include less warmth, more inter-parental conflict, over-involvement, and aversiveness; and for depression additionally, they include less autonomy granting and monitoring.

A multicentre randomised controlled trial of a carer supervised Culturally adapted CBT (CaCBT) based self-help for depression in Pakistan,"Background: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) based self-help has been found to be effective for treating depression and anxiety. There is some evidence to suggest that CBT needs to be culturally adapted for it to be effective in non-Western cultures. CBT is not widely used in low and middle income countries and there is a need to test its effectiveness in different settings and formats, including self-help. Methods: We describe a RCT of a Culturally adapted CBT (CaCBT) based self-help manual in Pakistan. The trial was conducted in psychiatry departments in three cities. Assessments were carried out at baseline and at 12 weeks, using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Bradford somatic Inventory and brief disability Questionnaire. Results: At the end of the trial CaCBT based self-help was found to be effective against care as usual in reducing the symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as somatic symptoms and disability. Limitations: This study was conducted only in secondary care and required either patient or a carer to be able to read and write. Conclusions: This is the first study outside West of a CBT based self-help intervention for depression. This study highlights the importance of using cost effective interventions in developing world in low intensity formats. Future studies should focus on trying these resources in different settings, like primary care, and with the use of audio/video or multimedia resources to improve compliance in patients with lower literacy.

"Corrigendum to “Comparison of four self-report measures, and a generic mood question, to screen for anxiety during pregnancy in English-speaking women ” [J. Affect. Disord. 148 (2–3) (2013) 347–351]","Reports an error in ""Comparison of four self-report measures and a generic mood question to screen for anxiety during pregnancy in English-speaking women"" by Stephen Matthey, Barbara Valenti, Kay Souter and Clodagh Ross-Hamid ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2013[Jun], Vol 148[2-3], 347-351). In the original article, the acknowledgment of Barbara Valenti to her supervisor Dr. Paola Gremigni, and Dr. Francesca Agostini for enabling her to obtain a placement in Australia and for the support given to her during the whole placement was omitted. The acknowledgment is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-21914-010). Background: Increasingly researchers and clinicians have called for perinatal mental health depression screening to be broadened to also screen for significant levels of anxiety. This study therefore aimed to compare the screening performance during pregnancy of four self-report anxiety measures, as well as a generic mood question. Method: The measures tested were two measures of general anxiety (the anxiety subscales of the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and two measures of pregnancy specific anxiety by Huizink and colleagues, and Rini and colleagues (both originally called the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire). A generic mood question (Matthey Generic Mood Question) asking about stress, anxiety, unhappiness or difficulty coping was also tested. Between 132 and 389 women completed these measures at their first antenatal clinic appointment and up to 249 women completed a diagnostic interview and various measures two weeks later. Results: The generic mood question performed best, detecting between 58% and 87% of high scorers on the other measures, including 80% of the women with an anxiety disorder. The next best measure was the EDS anxiety subscale, detecting between 26% and 73% of high scorers on the other measures, though this only detected 54% of the women with an anxiety disorder. Limitations: Findings are only applicable to English-speaking women. In addition whether the findings can be applied to women later in their pregnancy, or postpartum, is not known. Conclusion: Services wishing to screen for not only possible depression but also possible anxiety should use the generic mood question. For those services which currently use the EDS we recommend they also score the three-item anxiety subscale.

Lack of gender effects on gray matter volumes in adolescent generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Previous epidemiological and clinical studies have reported gender differences in prevalence and clinical features of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Such gender differences in clinical phenomenology suggest that the underlying neural circuitry of GAD could also be different in males and females. This study aimed to explore the possible gender effect on gray matter volumes in adolescents with GAD. Methods: Twenty-six adolescent GAD patients and 25 healthy controls participated and underwent high-resolution structural magnetic resonance scans. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to investigate gray matter alterations. Results: Our study revealed a significant diagnosis main effect in the right putamen, with larger gray matter volumes in GAD patients compared to healthy controls, and a significant gender main effect in the left precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, with larger gray matter volumes in males compared to females. No gender-by-diagnosis interaction effect was found in this study. Limitations: The relatively small sample size in this study might result in a lack of power to demonstrate gender effects on brain structure in GAD. Conclusions: The results suggested that there are differences in gray matter volumes between males and females, but gray matter volumes in GAD are not influenced by gender.

"Depression, subthreshold depression and comorbid anxiety symptoms in older Europeans: Results from the EURODEP concerted action","Background: In the epidemiology of late life depression, few insights are available on the co-occurrence of subthreshold depression and comorbid symptoms of anxiety. The current study aims to describe prevalence patterns of comorbid anxiety symptoms across different levels of depression in old age, and to describe the burden of depressive symptoms and functional disability across patterns of comorbidity. Methods: Respondents were older adults in the community, age 65–104 ( N =14,200), from seven European countries, with in total nine study centres, collaborating in the EURODEP concerted action. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Geriatric Mental State examination (GMS-AGECAT package), providing subthreshold level and case-level diagnoses. Presence of anxiety symptoms was defined as at least three distinct symptoms of anxiety. Number of depressive symptoms was assessed with the EURO-D scale. Results: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms amounts to 32% for respondents without depression, 67% for those with subthreshold depression, and 87% for those with case-level depression. The number of depressive symptoms is similar for those with subthreshold-level depression with comorbid anxiety, compared to case-level depression without symptoms of anxiety. In turn, at case level, comorbid symptoms of anxiety are associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms and more functional disability. Limitations: GMS-AGECAT is insufficiently equipped with diagnostic procedures to identify specific types of anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Anxiety symptoms in late life depression are highly prevalent, and are likely to contribute to the burden of symptoms of the depression, even at subthreshold level.

"Adaptation and validation of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) to Brazilian Portuguese","Background: Depression and anxiety have been associated with a range of symptoms that often overlap. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale‐21 (DASS-21) is a single instrument to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. This study aimed to adapt and validate the DASS-21 for use in the Brazilian Portuguese language. Methods: The DASS-21 has been adapted following the translation–back translation methodology from English to Portuguese. 242 subjects completed the following assessments: the DASS-21, the Beck Depression Index (BDI), Beck Anxiety Index (BAI) and the Inventory of Stress Symptoms of Lipp (ISSL). Results: The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) result was .949, indicating that the adequacy of the model was high. Cronbach's alpha was .92 for the depression, .90 for the stress, and .86 for the anxiety, indicating a good internal consistency for each subscale. The correlations between DASS scale and BDI scale, BAI scale and ISSL inventory were strong. The factorial analysis and distribution of factors among the subscales indicated that the structure of three distinct factors is adequate. Limitations: Older subjects over 65 years of age were not largely represented in this sample. A study specific to this elderly population should be conducted. Another limitation of the study was education level. The impact of low education in its applicability should be considered. Conclusions: The findings support the validity of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the DASS-21 and add to the evidence of the DASS-21 quality and ability to assess emotional states separately, eliminating the use of different instruments to assess these states.

Emotional reasoning and anxiety sensitivity: Associations with social anxiety disorder in childhood,"Background: Two specific cognitive constructs that have been implicated in the development and maintenance of anxiety symptoms are anxiety sensitivity and emotional reasoning, both of which relate to the experience and meaning of physical symptoms of arousal or anxiety. The interpretation of physical symptoms has been particularly implicated in theories of social anxiety disorder, where internal physical symptoms are hypothesized to influence the individual's appraisals of the self as a social object. Method: The current study compared 75 children on measures of anxiety sensitivity and emotional reasoning: 25 with social anxiety disorder, 25 with other anxiety disorders, and 25 nonanxious children (aged 7–12 years). Results: Children with social anxiety disorder reported higher levels of anxiety sensitivity and were more likely than both other groups to view ambiguous situations as anxiety provoking, whether physical information was present or not. There were no group differences in the extent to which physical information altered children's interpretation of hypothetical scenarios. Limitations: This study is the first to investigate emotional reasoning in clinically anxious children and therefore replication is needed. In addition, those in both anxious groups commonly had comorbid conditions and, consequently, specific conclusions about social anxiety disorder need to be treated with caution. Conclusion: The findings highlight cognitive characteristics that may be particularly pertinent in the context of social anxiety disorder in childhood and which may be potential targets for treatment. Furthermore, the findings suggest that strategies to modify these particular cognitive constructs may not be necessary in treatments of some other childhood anxiety disorders.

"General distress, hopelessness—Suicidal ideation and worrying in adolescence: Concurrent and predictive validity of a symptom-level bifactor model for clinical diagnoses","Background: Clinical disorders often share common symptoms and aetiological factors. Bifactor models acknowledge the role of an underlying general distress component and more specific sub-domains of psychopathology which specify the unique components of disorders over and above a general factor. Methods: A bifactor model jointly calibrated data on subjective distress from The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale. The bifactor model encompassed a general distress factor, and specific factors for (a) hopelessness—suicidal ideation, (b) generalised worrying and (c) restlessness—fatigue at age 14 which were related to lifetime clinical diagnoses established by interviews at ages 14 (concurrent validity) and current diagnoses at 17 years (predictive validity) in a British population sample of 1159 adolescents. Results: Diagnostic interviews confirmed the validity of a symptom-level bifactor model. The underlying general distress factor was a powerful but non-specific predictor of affective, anxiety and behaviour disorders. The specific factors for hopelessness—suicidal ideation and generalised worrying contributed to predictive specificity. Hopelessness—suicidal ideation predicted concurrent and future affective disorder; generalised worrying predicted concurrent and future anxiety, specifically concurrent generalised anxiety disorders. Generalised worrying was negatively associated with behaviour disorders. Limitations: The analyses of gender differences and the prediction of specific disorders was limited due to a low frequency of disorders other than depression. Conclusions: The bifactor model was able to differentiate concurrent and predict future clinical diagnoses. This can inform the development of targeted as well as non-specific interventions for prevention and treatment of different disorders.

The neural representation of emotionally neutral faces and places in patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia,"Background: Panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD-A) has been associated with abnormal neural activity for threat-related stimuli (faces, places). Recent findings suggest a disturbed neural processing of emotionally neutral stimuli at a more general level. Methods: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we investigated the neural processing of emotionally neutral faces and places in PD-A. Fifteen patients with PD-A and fifteen healthy subjects participated in the study. Results: When they perceived neutral faces and places, the patients with PD-A showed significantly less brain activity in the fusiform gyrus, the inferior occipital gyrus, the calcarine gyrus, the cerebellum, and the cuneus compared with the healthy controls. However, the patients with PD-A showed significantly more brain activity in the precuneus compared with controls subjects. Limitations: It was not possible to distinguish the agoraphobia-associated effects from possible contributions due to general anxiety induced by fMRI. For future investigations, an additional clinical control group with patients suffering from panic disorder without agoraphobia would be of interest. In addition, the psychopathology concerning the agoraphobic symptoms needs to be investigated in more detail. Conclusions: The findings suggest altered neural processing of emotionally neutral faces and places in patients with PD-A. Reduced neural activity in different brain regions may indicate difficulties in recognizing the emotional content in face and place stimuli due to anxiety-related hyper-arousal.

Bereavement and common mental disorders in middle-aged adults: Results from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil),"Background: Although bereavement is accompanied with depression and anxiety symptoms, it is usually not associated with increased rates of mental disorders in North American and European samples. Data from low- and middle-income countries are, however, scarce. We therefore explored the prevalence of mental disorders after bereavement in Brazil. Methods: The Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) was used for psychiatric assessment of 15,105 participants from the Brazilian Health Longitudinal Study (ELSA-Brasil). We asked whether the participant suffered loss of a first-degree relative/spouse within 6 and 12 months prior to the interview. Results: The prevalence within 6 and 12 months after bereavement for major depressive disorder (MDD, 4.3% for 6 and 12 months) and anxiety disorders (17.4% and 15.9%, respectively) did not differ compared to non-bereaved participants, except for panic disorder. Sociodemographic and clinical data were also similar. Conversely, we found increased 12-month prevalence of bereaved-related (vs. non-related) mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (15.7% vs. 12.5%, respectively) and common mental disorder (30.7% vs. 26.2%); diagnoses that are solely based on the number and severity of depression and anxiety symptoms. Limitations: Although this was a cross-sectional study, the sample size was large. Conclusions: Bereavement was associated with greater psychopathological burden but not with increased prevalence of MDD and anxiety disorder diagnoses, therefore highlighting the need of carefully monitoring subjects whom recently experienced bereavement. Our findings also support and provide a “cultural validator” for excluding bereavement as an exclusionary criterion for MDD diagnosis.

Relationship between measurement invariance and age-related differences in the prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) peaks in prevalence in middle age and declines in prevalence into old age. Some commentators have suggested that this is not a meaningful epidemiological trend rather a methodological artifact. This study tested this hypothesis by matching respondents of different ages based on their severity and examining whether age influences the probability of endorsing GAD criteria and the prevalence of GAD. Methods: Self-reported worriers from a nationally representative survey of non-institutionalized adults were selected for investigation ( n = 1738). All respondents were interviewed using the World Mental Health version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Age-related differences in the prevalence and invariance of the GAD criteria were examined between 16 and 29 years, 30 and 44 years, 45 and 59 years and 60 years+ age groups. Effect sizes were used to assess the impact of statistically significant criterion level non-invariance on the prevalence of GAD. Results: Respondents aged 60 years or more were less likely than younger adults to endorse most of the GAD criteria. Significant non-invariance was identified in each of the age group analyses. Nonetheless these differences had no impact on the prevalence of GAD in three group comparisons. In the other three group comparisons, the impact was minimal ( d ≤ 0.3). Limitations: Our results support age-related differences in the prevalence of GAD but we are limited to the extent to which we can say why these differences occur. Conclusions: Age-related prevalence differences in GAD are meaningful epidemiological trends.

Performance anxiety in Brazilian musicians: Prevalence and association with psychopathology indicators,"Background: Musical performance anxiety (MPA) refers to persistent and distressing apprehension associated with performing to an audience. Our objective was to assess the presence of MPA and other psychopathologies in musicians and find correlations between socio-demographic and clinical variables. Methods: We assessed 230 musicians using self-rated instruments whose results were statistically compared. The logistic regression was used to check for predictors of MPA. Results: 24% of musicians had MPA indicators, 19% had indicators of social anxiety, and 20% of depression. These figures were even higher in the comparison between professional and amateur musicians, where the rates were doubled. In the logistic regression, gender and professional status did not predict MPA, but did predict social anxiety (OD = 3.22; p = 0.006) and depression (OD = 3.87; p = 0.003). Conclusions: We conclude that there is a high rate of psychiatric indicators among musicians, who have been dealing not only with difficulties inherent to their occupation, but also with under-recognized comorbidities with the potential to affect their personal and professional life in specific, poorly investigated ways. Limitations: It should be noted that our results must be interpreted with caution as we used screening and not diagnostic instruments, and because of the fact that our sample was restricted to the Brazilian context. Also, the role of temperamental features that could have a positive association with the condition of musician—and therefore minimize performance anxiety—could have been explored in order to provide a deeper understanding of the topic.

Does comorbid subthreshold anxiety predict treatment response in depression? Results from a naturalistic cohort study (the CRESCEND study),"Objective: To investigate whether the anxious depression defined as depression with clinically significant anxiety but not comorbid anxiety disorder predicts poor outcomes of depression treatment in naturalistic clinical setting. Method: From nationwide sample of 18 hospitals, 674 patients with moderate to severe depression who completed the DSM-IV-based Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) were recruited. Anxious depression was defined as not having comorbid anxiety disorder by SCID and having a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score ≥20. Participants were classified into three groups: anxious depression ( N = 259), non-anxious depression ( N = 351), or comorbid anxiety disorder ( N = 64). Rates of and time to remission and response and changes in scale scores were compared between these groups during 12 weeks treatment with antidepressant interventions freely determined by clinicians. Results: No significant differences were observed in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) remission rate and the time to achieve HAM-D remission between anxious and non-anxious depression after adjustment for variables is not equally distributed at baseline. There were also no significant differences in HAM-D and HAM-A response rate and time to responses between two groups. Patients with comorbid anxiety disorder showed less improvement on HAM-D and HAM-A score than did those with anxious depression despite similar baseline symptom severity. Limitation: This study was observational, and the treatment modality was naturalistic. Conclusions: Anxious depression did not predict worse outcome to antidepressants treatment. This finding might result from exclusion of comorbid anxiety disorder from anxious depression population and allowance of broad treatment modality.

State anxiety modulates the impact of peripherally presented affective stimuli on foveal processing,"Background: The priority processing of peripherally presented affective stimuli was recently shown in healthy individuals to divert attentional resources dedicated to foveal processing. Here we investigated the influence of sub-clinical levels of anxiety and depression on this bias. Methods: Eighty-four participants were submitted to psychological tests that evaluate anxiety and depression levels. Then, they had to make speeded responses to the direction of left- or right-oriented arrows that were presented foveally at fixation. Each arrow was preceded by a peripherally presented pair of pictures, one neutral and one emotional, unpleasant or pleasant. Thus, the direction of the foveal arrow was either congruent or not with the peripheral location of the previously presented emotional picture. Data analysis focused on the differences of reaction times between congruent and incongruent conditions, which assess the spatial response bias in the task. Results: A main effect of state-anxiety was observed suggesting that the higher the level of state-anxiety, the greater the congruence effect. Limitations: Since the obtained result relates to subclinical anxiety levels, its generalization to anxiety disorders remains tentative. Conclusions: State-anxiety appears to modulate the propensity to be influenced by emotionally salient information occurring in peripheral vision, independently of its relevance to the ongoing behavior. The long-term persistence of a high level of alertness for emotional cues in visual periphery could contribute to the causation and the maintenance of anxiety disorders.

"Effects of extended-release quetiapine fumarate on long-term functioning and sleep quality in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): Data from a randomized-withdrawal, placebo-controlled maintenance study","Background: This analysis evaluated effects of quetiapine XR maintenance treatment on functioning and sleep in patients with GAD. Methods: Analysis of patient-reported data from a randomized-withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of quetiapine XR monotherapy in GAD. Following open-label run-in (4–8 weeks) and a 12–18-week stabilization phase (quetiapine XR 50, 150, or 300 mg/day), eligible patients were randomized to continue on quetiapine XR or receive placebo for up to 52 weeks. Primary variable was time to an anxiety event. Secondary variables included the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: In total, 432 patients were randomized (quetiapine XR, N = 216; placebo, N = 216). The risk of an anxiety event was significantly reduced for quetiapine XR vs. placebo (HR 0.19; 95% CI 0.12, 0.31; p &lt; 0.001). Quetiapine XR was more effective than placebo at maintaining SDS total scores (LSM change: −0.19 vs. 1.01; p = 0.017) and non-work-related SDS domain score ‘family life/home responsibilities’ (−0.13 vs. 0.32; p = 0.011), but not ‘social life’ (0.05 vs. 0.34; p = 0.114). Quetiapine XR was more effective than placebo at maintaining the work-related SDS domain score ‘days lost’ (−0.05 vs. 0.11; p = 0.027), but not ‘work/school’ (−0.10 vs. 0.29; p = 0.051) or ‘days underproductive’ (0.06 vs. 0.13; p = 0.619). PSQI global scores were reduced from randomization with quetiapine XR vs. placebo (0.39 vs. 1.60; p &lt; 0.001). Limitations: Lack of active-comparator arm, exclusion of patients with comorbid depression. Conclusions: In patients with GAD, long-term treatment with quetiapine XR (50–300 mg/day) monotherapy was effective at maintaining improvements in functioning and sleep quality.

The role of somatic health problems in the recognition of depressive and anxiety disorders by general practitioners,"Background: Recognition of depression and anxiety by general practitioners (GPs) is suboptimal and there is uncertainty as to whether particular somatic health problems hinder or facilitate GP recognition. The objective of this study was to investigate the associations between somatic health problems and GP recognition of depression and anxiety. Methods: We studied primary care patients with a DSM-IV based psychiatric diagnosis of depressive or anxiety disorder during a face-to-face interview ( n = 778). GPs' registrations of depression and anxiety diagnoses, based on medical file extractions, were compared with the DSM-IV based psychiatric diagnoses as reference standard. Somatic health problems were based on self-report of several chronic somatic diseases and pain symptoms, using the Chronic Pain Grade (CPG), during the interview. Results: Depression and anxiety was recognized in sixty percent of the patients. None of the health problems were negatively associated with recognition. Greater severity of pain symptoms (OR = 1.18, p = .02), and chest pain (OR = 1.56, p = .02), in particular, were associated with more GP recognition of depression and anxiety. Mediation analyses showed that depression and anxiety in these patients were better recognized through the presence of more severe psychiatric symptoms. Limitations: Some specific chronic diseases had low prevalence. Conclusions: This study shows that the presence of particular chronic diseases does not influence GP recognition of depression and anxiety. GPs tend to recognize depression and anxiety better in patients with pain symptoms, partly due to more severe psychiatric symptoms among those with pain.

"Common mental disorders in women and men in the first six months after the birth of their first infant: A community study in Victoria, Australia","Introduction: Studies of postpartum mental health have focused predominantly on women and on depression. There is limited evidence regarding men's postpartum mental health and about other common mental disorders, such as anxiety and adjustment disorders, which may also be relevant at this life phase. The main aim of this study was to establish the period prevalence of depression, anxiety, and adjustment disorders in primiparous women and their male partners in the first six months postpartum Methods: English-speaking couples were recruited in five local government areas in Victoria, Australia. Women and men completed separate telephone interviews which included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and selected Depression and Anxiety modules of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. DSM-IV criteria were used to classify adjustment disorders, based on subclinical symptoms not meeting criteria for diagnoses of major or minor depression or generalised anxiety disorder. The main outcome was any common mental disorder (depression, anxiety or adjustment disorder) in the first six months postpartum Results: Complete data were available for 172 couples. The 6-month period prevalence of mental health problems was 33% for women and 17% for men. The most common diagnosis in both women and men was adjustment disorder with anxiety symptoms Limitations: Unpartnered women and men, women whose partners were not willing to participate and those who did not have sufficient English fluency to complete the interviews were excluded from the sample. The results of this study cannot be generalised to these populations. Conclusion: The most common postnatal mental health problem in both women and men in this community sample was anxiety.

"Depression, anxiety and loss of resilience after multiple traumas: An illustration of a mediated moderation model of sensitization in a group of children who survived the Nazi Holocaust","Background: Depressive and anxiety disorders (DAD) have become a major public health problem. Multiple trauma is known to increase the risk of DAD through a sensitization mechanism. We investigate the hypothesis that resilience is a mediator of this mechanism. Methods: Former Hidden Children (FHC), the Jewish youths who spent World War II in various hideaway shelters across Nazi-occupied Europe, were compared with a control group. In each group, we measured the presence of multiple traumas, the resilience with the Resilience Scale for Adults, which has a six factors solution, and the DAD with the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist. We test a mediated moderation model with childhood trauma as the predictor; Later trauma as the moderator; Resilience as the mediator; and DAD as the outcome variable. Results: Results are consistent with a sensitization model of DAD mediated by resilience: confrontation with a primary trauma during childhood followed by secondary trauma(s) after childhood damages resilience, which, in turn, results in higher level of DAD. Limitations: We are unable to differentiate if the sensitization process is a consequence of the nature of the trauma endured by FHC (long-standing exposure to extreme external events) or a consequence of the fact that this first trauma occurred during childhood. Conclusions: Resilience construct is multi-factorial and a limited damaging of some of the factors is sufficient to lead to DAD even if other factors remain unaltered. Resilience can be altered by multiple traumas and, therefore, needs to be bolstered in therapy sessions.

Anxiety sensitivity and impairment: Evidence for a direct association and partial mediation by subclinical anxiety symptoms,"Background: Mounting evidence suggests that specific psychological risk factors increase the likelihood for the development of anxiety psychopathology. Anxiety sensitivity (AS), the fear of the consequences of anxiety, is one such risk factor. However, very little is known about the consequences of having elevated AS prior to the development of diagnosable psychopathology. We hypothesized that elevated AS may create impairment among premorbid individuals. The aims of the present study were twofold. The first aim was to examine whether having elevated AS would be predictive of impairment in a nonclinical sample. The second aim was to examine whether subclinical anxiety symptoms would partially mediate the association between AS and impairment in daily life. Method: These aims were examined in two studies utilizing samples of individuals with elevated levels of AS. Study 1 ( N = 387) and Study 2 ( N = 79) were comprised of participants with elevated AS. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires and a diagnostic interview to assess for risk status. Only participants without an anxiety disorder were eligible to participate in the study to ensure that they were in the premorbid stage. Results: In Study 1, there was a direct effect of AS on impairment. Additionally, there was evidence for anxiety symptoms acting as a partial mediator in the relation between AS and impairment. Study 2 revealed the same pattern of results, with AS having a significant direct effect on impairment that was partially mediated by anxiety symptoms. Limitations: The samples utilized in the present sample were primarily Caucasian females, thereby potentially limiting the generalizability of these findings. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that a premorbid risk factor is associated with impairment before the actual development of an anxiety disorder. Implications of the present investigation and future directions are discussed.

"Anxiety, stress and perfectionism in bipolar disorder","Background: Previous reports have highlighted perfectionism and related cognitive styles as a psychological risk factor for stress and anxiety symptoms as well as for the development of bipolar disorder symptoms. The anxiety disorders are highly comorbid with bipolar disorder but the mechanisms that underpin this comorbidity are yet to be determined. Method: Measures of depressive, (hypo)manic, anxiety and stress symptoms and perfectionistic cognitive style were completed by a sample of 142 patients with bipolar disorder. Mediation models were used to explore the hypotheses that anxiety and stress symptoms would mediate relationships between perfectionistic cognitive styles, and bipolar disorder symptoms. Results: Stress and anxiety both significantly mediated the relationship between both self-critical perfectionism and goal attainment values and bipolar depressive symptoms. Goal attainment values were not significantly related to hypomanic symptoms. Stress and anxiety symptoms did not significantly mediate the relationship between self-critical perfectionism and (hypo)manic symptoms. Limitations: 1. These data are cross-sectional; hence the causality implied in the mediation models can only be inferred. 2. The clinic patients were less likely to present with (hypo)manic symptoms and therefore the reduced variability in the data may have contributed to the null findings for the mediation models with (hypo) manic symptoms. 3. Those patients who were experiencing current (hypo)manic symptoms may have answered the cognitive styles questionnaires differently than when euthymic. Conclusion: These findings highlight a plausible mechanism to understand the relationship between bipolar disorder and the anxiety disorders. Targeting self-critical perfectionism in the psychological treatment of bipolar disorder when there is anxiety comorbidity may result in more parsimonious treatments.

Genetic variants of the &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;DRD&lt;/i&gt;3 genes in bipolar disorder comorbid with anxiety disorder,"Background: The high comorbidity rate between bipolar disorder (BP) and anxiety disorder (AD) has been studied in depth. This comorbidity is not as high in Han Chinese in Taiwan. Therefore, we explored the genetic effects BP comorbid with AD. Methods: We recruited 1316 participants: 286 with BP-I, 681 with BP-II, and 349 healthy Controls. Genotypes of the BDNF Val66Met and DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphisms were determined using polymerase chain reactions plus restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results: The DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism was associated with BP-II comorbid with AD (BPII +AD ), and the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was associated with BP-I comorbid with AD (BPI +AD ). An interaction between the Val/Val genotype of the BDNF Val66Met and Gly/Gly polymorphism of the DRD3 Ser9Gly was found in BPII +AD , but not in BP-II not comorbid with AD (BPI −AD ) compared with healthy Controls. Limitation: The low comorbidity rate of AD in both BP subtypes, especially BP-I, limit generalizing our findings. Conclusion: The involvement of the dopaminergic pathway in AD was confirmed, particularly with BP-II rather than BP-I. Because the Val/Val genotype of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, rather than the other two polymorphisms, has been associated with anxiety, it seems to affect BP-I comorbid with AD without the involvement of the DRD3 Seg9Gly polymorphism, but may modify the involvement of DRD3 Gly/Gly in BP-II comorbid with AD.

"Working conditions, serotonin transporter gene polymorphism ( &lt;i&gt;5-HTTLPR&lt;/i&gt;) and anxiety disorders: A prospective cohort study","Background: The etiology and pathology of anxiety disorders involve both genetic and environmental influences. Adverse working conditions may contribute to the development of anxiety. The serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region ( 5-HTTLPR ) has been implicated in stress sensitivity. Therefore, we investigated the potential interplay between 5-HTTLPR and job-related risk factors in the prediction of the occurrence of anxiety. Methods: We conducted a prospective study using the first two waves of a Swedish population-based cohort. At Wave I, 1585 individuals without anxiety, depression or dysthymia who were active in the labor market during both waves were included. Information on job demands, skill discretion, decision authority and social climate was collected at Wave I. After a three year interval, the presence of anxiety disorders was determined at Wave II. All 1585 participants were genotyped for 5-HTTLPR . Both additive and multiplicative models were considered in examining the potential interaction between 5-HTTLPR and adverse working conditions on the development of anxiety. Results: Anxiety was associated with high job demands but not with 5-HTTLPR . An interaction was observed between 5-HTTLPR and high job demands among females. Individuals with 5-HTTLPR high expression genotype (LL) developed anxiety disorders more frequently when exposed to high job demands compared to ‘LS/SS’ carriers. Limitations: A limited number of participants developed anxiety. Conclusions: High job demands predict the development of anxiety. The 5-HTT polymorphism has a moderating effect on the relationship between high job demands and anxiety among females.

"Interoceptive awareness, positive affect, and decision making in Major Depressive Disorder","Background: Little work has examined the relation between interoceptive awareness and symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Existing research suggests that depressed individuals exhibit impaired heartbeat perception, though the results of this research have been equivocal. Importantly, depressed participants in these studies have had comorbid anxiety disorders, making it difficult to draw inferences about interoceptive awareness in MDD. The current study addresses this issue by assessing heartbeat perception in depressed women without current anxiety disorders and exploring the relation between interoception and perturbations in both affective intensity and decision making, components of MDD postulated to be related to bodily awareness. Methods: Depressed women without concurrent anxiety disorders ( n = 25) and never-disordered controls ( n = 36) performed a heartbeat perception task. Participants completed the self-report Affect Intensity Measure (AIM), and decision-making difficulty was assessed in MDD participants using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Results: Depressed women exhibited poorer heartbeat perception accuracy than did control participants. Impaired accuracy in MDD participants was associated with reduced positive affectivity and difficulty in decision making. Limitations: Our sample was composed exclusively of females and was heterogeneous with respect to treatment status, thereby limiting our ability to generalize results to depressed males and to exclude the contribution of exogenous factors to the observed group differences. Conclusions: Results of this study suggest that for depressed individuals without anxiety comorbidities, disrupted perception of bodily responses reduces both the experience of positive arousal and the ability to use interoceptive feedback to inform decision making.

The Parental Overprotection Scale: Associations with child and parental anxiety,"Background: Parental overprotection has commonly been implicated in the development and maintenance of childhood anxiety disorders. Overprotection has been assessed using questionnaire and observational methods interchangeably; however, the extent to which these methods access the same construct has received little attention. Edwards et al. (2008, 2010) developed a promising parent-report measure of overprotection (OP) and reported that, with parents of pre-school children, the measure correlated with observational assessments and predicted changes in child anxiety symptoms. We aimed to validate the use of the OP measure with mothers of children in middle childhood, and examine its association with child and parental anxiety. Methods: Mothers of 90 children (60 clinically anxious, 30 non-anxious) aged 7–12 years completed the measure and engaged in a series of mildly stressful tasks with their child. Results: The internal reliability of the measure was good and scores correlated significantly with observations of maternal overprotection in a challenging puzzle task. Contrary to expectations, OP was not significantly associated with child anxiety status or symptoms, but was significantly associated with maternal anxiety symptoms. Limitations: Participants were predominantly from affluent social groups and of non-minority status. Overprotection is a broad construct, the use of specific sub-dimensions of behavioural constructs may be preferable. Conclusions: The findings support the use of the OP measure to assess parental overprotection among 7–12 year-old children; however, they suggest that parental responses may be more closely related to the degree of parental rather than child anxiety.

Depression and anxiety among migrants in Austria: A population based study of prevalence and utilization of health care services,"Background: Although migrants form a large part of the Austrian population, information about mental health of migrants in Austria is scarce. Therefore, we compared the prevalence of dysphoric disorders (depression and anxiety) and the corresponding utilization of health care services of Eastern European, western and other migrants with the non-migrant population in Austria. Methods: We performed a telephone survey on a random sample of the general population of Austria aged 15 years and older ( n = 3509) between October 2010 and September 2011. Depression and anxiety were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and utilization of health care services in the last 4 weeks was inquired. Results: 15.0% of our sample had a migration background. Female migrants from Eastern Europe, first and second generation, had a higher prevalence of dysphoric disorders (29.7% and 33.4% respectively) than Austrian women (15.2%) ( p &lt; 0.001). The prevalence in the other migrant groups did not differ significantly from the Austrian population. There was no gender difference in dysphoric disorders in the Austrian population. After adjustment for age and chronic diseases, having a dysphoric disorder was associated with a higher utilization of health care services among migrant and Austrian women, but not among men. Limitations: Because of the explorative nature of the study multiple testing correction was not performed. The reason for health care utilization was not assessed. Conclusions: Mental health of female migrants from Eastern Europe should be studied in more detail; men could be an underserved group, both in migrants and Austrians.

Treating anxious depression using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation,"Background: A subset of patients given a clinical diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) are described as having “anxious depression,” a presentation that, in some studies, has been an indicator of poor response to pharmacotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine if anxious depression is associated with attenuated response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), an FDA-approved treatment for MDD. Methods: Participants were 32 adult outpatients with treatment resistant MDD who were referred for rTMS. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) was administered to assess treatment response, and anxious depression was defined as a score of seven or above on the anxiety/somatization factor of the HAMD. A quarter of the sample met the anxious depression criterion at pretreatment. Results: Both depression (total score) and anxiety symptoms improved from pre- to post-treatment with moderate to large treatment effects. Patients with and without anxious depression demonstrated similar rates of improvement in depression. Patients with versus without anxious depression demonstrated larger improvements in anxiety. Limitations: The sample size was small, and assessments did not include structured diagnostic interview or independent measures of anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: For the sample as a whole, there were significant improvements in both depression and anxiety. Anxious depression was not associated with attenuated treatment response to rTMS.

Anxiety symptoms among remitted depressed outpatients: Prevalence and association with quality of life and psychosocial functioning,"Background: Prior studies of remission from depression have only examined the impact of residual depressive, but not anxiety, symptoms. Given that anxiety comorbidity in currently depressed patients is common and is associated with poorer outcomes, residual anxiety symptoms may play a significant role in remitted patients' well-being and vulnerability to relapse. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we examined the frequency of residual anxiety symptoms among depressed outpatients in remission based on the HAM-D and associations among residual anxiety, psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Methods: We interviewed 274 psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with DSM-IV major depressive disorder. Patients completed measures of depression and anxiety symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life. Results: Nearly three-quarters of remitted depressed patients endorsed at least one residual anxiety symptom, with a majority experiencing more than one symptom. Anxiety severity was associated with reduced functioning and quality of life across all life domains. Controlling for depression severity, anxiety symptoms were independently related to reduced functioning and quality of life in several domains. Limitations: We did not assess for specific pre-existing DSM-IV anxiety disorders nor particular treatments patients received, which may have influenced residual anxiety symptoms. Future studies should replicate the results using other measures of remission. Conclusions: Anxiety symptoms are common in depressed patients in remission, and independently related to reduced functioning and quality of life. Thus, it is important to consider anxiety symptoms in evaluating the completeness of treatment response of depressed patients.

"The relationship between worry, rumination, and comorbidity: Evidence for repetitive negative thinking as a transdiagnostic construct","Background: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) increases vulnerability to multiple anxiety and depressive disorders and, as a common risk factor, elevated RNT may account for the high levels of comorbidity observed between emotional disorders. The aims of this study were to (a) compare two common forms of RNT (worry and rumination) across individuals with non-comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders, and (b) to examine the relationship between RNT and comorbidity. Methods: A structured diagnostic interview and measures of rumination, worry, anxiety, and depression were completed by a large clinical sample with an anxiety disorder or depression ( N = 513) presenting at a community mental health clinic. Results: Patients without ( n = 212) and with ( n = 301) comorbid diagnoses did not generally differ across the principal diagnosis groups (depression, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder) on worry or rumination. As predicted, comorbidity was associated with a higher level of RNT. Limitations: Cross-sectional design precluded causal conclusions and findings may not generalize to excluded anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Consistent with the transdiagnostic hypothesis, RNT was associated with a range of anxiety disorders and depression and with comorbidity for those with a principal depressive disorder, supporting recent evidence that RNT is a transdiagnostic process. The presence of RNT, specifically worry and rumination, should be assessed and treated regardless of diagnostic profile. Future research may show that both pure and comorbid depressed or anxious patients receive incremental benefit from transdiagnostic protocols developed to treat core pathological processes of RNT traditionally associated with separate disorders.

Alpha absolute power measurement in panic disorder with agoraphobia patients,"Background: Panic attacks are thought to be a result from a dysfunctional coordination of cortical and brainstem sensory information leading to heightened amygdala activity with subsequent neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral activation. Prefrontal areas may be responsible for inhibitory top-down control processes and alpha synchronization seems to reflect this modulation. The objective of this study was to measure frontal absolute alpha-power with qEEG in 24 subjects with panic disorder and agoraphobia (PDA) compared to 21 healthy controls. Methods: qEEG data were acquired while participants watched a computer simulation, consisting of moments classified as “high anxiety”(HAM) and “low anxiety” (LAM). qEEG data were also acquired during two rest conditions, before and after the computer simulation display. Results: We observed a higher absolute alpha-power in controls when compared to the PDA patients while watching the computer simulation. The main finding was an interaction between the moment and group factors on frontal cortex. Our findings suggest that the decreased alpha-power in the frontal cortex for the PDA group may reflect a state of high excitability. Conclusions: Our results suggest a possible deficiency in top-down control processes of anxiety reflected by a low absolute alpha-power in the PDA group while watching the computer simulation and they highlight that prefrontal regions and frontal region nearby the temporal area are recruited during the exposure to anxiogenic stimuli.

Manualised Individual Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for mood disorders in people with mild to moderate intellectual disability: A feasibility randomised controlled trial,"Background: Evaluation of complex interventions, including standardisation of the intervention, types of outcomes selected and measures of change, is a fairly novel concept in the field of intellectual disabilities. Our aim was to explore these issues in a feasibility study of Manualised Individual Cognitive Behaviour Treatment (M-iCBT) compared to the treatment as usual alone (TAU). Methods: Service users with mild to moderate intellectual disability experiencing a mood disorder or symptoms of depression and/or anxiety (mini PAS-ADD total score &gt; 10 or 7 respectively) were randomly assigned to either. Results: In total, 32 participants were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of M-iCBT ( n = 16) in addition to TAU or TAU alone ( n = 16). We explored recruitment and accrual rates, willingness to participate, acceptability of the intervention and suitability of assessment tools. Mean change (95% CI) in the Beck Depression Inventory-Youth (BDI-Y) score from baseline to the 16 week endpoint (primary variable) was 0.10 (95% CI: −8.56, 8.76) and in the Beck Anxiety Inventory-Youth (BAI-Y) 2.42 (95% CI: −5.27, 10.12) in favour of TAU. However, there was a clear trend in favour of CBT in depressed participants with or without anxiety. Limitations: The intervention targeted both depression and anxiety following a transdiagnostic model. This may have impacted the anticipated size of change in the primary outcome. The precise impact of cognitive limitations on ability to use therapy effectively is not fully understood. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that it is feasible to carry out a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of M-iCBT for people with mild to moderate intellectual disability. However, uncertainties about its clinical and cost effectiveness can only be fully answered by further examination of its superiority against other treatments.

Validity of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales in assessing depression and anxiety following traumatic brain injury,"Background: Anxiety and depression following traumatic brain injury (TBI) are associated with poorer outcomes. A brief self-report questionnaire would assist in identifying those at risk, however validity of such measures is complicated by confounding symptoms of the injury. This study investigated the validity of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), in screening for clinical diagnoses of anxiety and mood disorders following TBI. Methods: One hundred and twenty-three participants with mild to severe TBI were interviewed using the SCID (Axis I) and completed the DASS and HADS. Results: The DASS, DASS21 and HADS scales demonstrated validity compared with SCID diagnoses of anxiety and mood disorders as measured by Area Under ROC Curve, sensitivity and specificity. Validity of the DASS depression scale benefited from items reflecting symptoms of devaluation of life, self-deprecation, and hopelessness that are not present on the HADS. Validity of the HADS anxiety scale benefited from items reflecting symptoms of tension and worry that are measured separately for the DASS on the stress scale. Limitations: Participants were predominantly drawn from a rehabilitation centre which may limit the extent to which results can be generalized. Scores for the DASS21 were derived from the DASS rather than being administered separately. Conclusions: The DASS, DASS21 and HADS demonstrated validity as screening measures of anxiety and mood disorders in this TBI sample. The findings support use of these self-report questionnaires for individuals with TBI to identify those who should be referred for clinical diagnostic follow-up.

Evaluating the unique contribution of intolerance of uncertainty relative to other cognitive vulnerability factors in anxiety psychopathology,"Background: Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a cognitive vulnerability factor associated with a wide range of anxiety psychopathology. Other cognitive vulnerabilities such as anxiety sensitivity (AS), distress tolerance (DT), and discomfort intolerance (DI) have also been investigated as constructs of interest across anxiety disorders. As researchers increasingly uncover viable transdiagnostic vulnerabilities to anxiety, it becomes important to determine the degree of overlap between these constructs. Methods: The present studies examined the unique relationships between IU, other vulnerability factors (AS, DT, and DI) and social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and worry symptoms across two nonclinical samples ( n = 217, n = 241). Results: Findings were highly consistent across samples. IU was significantly associated with anxiety symptoms in all analyses, even when accounting for other transdiagnostic risk variables. Anxiety sensitivity, was uniquely related to social anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in all analyses, but was related to worry in only one study. Distress tolerance was only uniquely associated with worry. Discomfort intolerance was not uniquely related to the anxiety symptoms in any analyses. Limitations: Future research should attempt to replicate the findings in a clinical population and utilize a longitudinal design. Conclusions: The robust and incremental relationships between IU and anxiety symptoms suggests the potential benefit of targeting IU in the context of transdiagnostic anxiety treatments.

Changes in genetic and environmental influences on trait anxiety from middle adolescence to early adulthood,"Background: Middle adolescence to early adulthood is an important developmental period for the emergence of anxiety. Genetically-influenced stable traits are thought to underlie internalizing psychopathology throughout development, but no studies have examined changes in genetic and environmental influences on trait anxiety during this period. Method: A longitudinal twin study design was used to study same-sex twin pairs (485 monozygotic pairs, 271 dizygotic pairs) at three ages, 14, 18, and 21 years, to examine developmental shifts in genetic and environmental effects on trait anxiety. Results: The heritability of trait anxiety increased with age, particularly between ages 14 and 18, no significant new genetic influences emerged after age 14, and the genetic influences were highly correlated across the three ages, supporting developmentally stable genetic risk factors. The environmental effects shared by members of a family decreased in influence across adolescence, while the influence of environmental effects unique to each individual twin remained relatively stable over the course of development and were largely age-specific. Limitations: The twin study design does not inform about specific genes and environmental risk factors. Conclusions: Genetic influences increased in importance from middle to late adolescence but common genetic factors influenced trait anxiety across the three ages. Shared environmental influences decreased in importance and demonstrated negligible influence by late adolescence/early adulthood. Nonshared environmental effects were almost entirely age-specific. These findings support the importance of developmentally-sensitive interventions that target shared environmental factors prior to middle adolescence and shifting non-shared environmental risks at each age.

Recurrent suicide attempts in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders: The role of borderline personality traits,"Background: The presence of a comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD) may be associated with an increase of suicidal behaviors in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders. The aim of this study is to examine the role of borderline personality traits on recurrent suicide attempts. Methods: The Netherlands Study on Depression and Anxiety included 1838 respondents with lifetime depressive and/or anxiety disorders, of whom 309 reported at least one previous suicide attempt. A univariable negative binomial regression analysis was performed to examine the association between comorbid borderline personality traits and suicide attempts. Univariable and multivariable negative binomial regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for the number of recurrent suicide attempts in four clusters (type and severity of axis-I disorders, BPD traits, determinants of suicide attempts and socio-demographics). Results: In the total sample the suicide attempt rate ratio increased with 33% for every unit increase in BPD traits. A lifetime diagnosis of dysthymia and comorbid BPD traits, especially the symptoms anger and fights, were independently and significantly associated with recurrent suicide attempts in the final model (n=309). Limitations: The screening of personality disorders was added to the NESDA assessments at the 4-year follow-up for the first time. Therefore we were not able to examine the influence of comorbid BPD traits on suicide attempts over time. Conclusions: Persons with a lifetime diagnosis of dysthymia combined with borderline personality traits especially difficulties in coping with anger seemed to be at high risk for recurrent suicide attempts. For clinical practice, it is recommended to screen for comorbid borderline personality traits and to strengthen the patient's coping skills with regard to anger.

Reference values for anxiety questionnaires: The Leiden Routine Outcome Monitoring Study,"Background: The monitoring of patients with an anxiety disorder can benefit from Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM). As anxiety disorders differ in phenomenology, several anxiety questionnaires are included in ROM: Brief Scale for Anxiety (BSA), PADUA Inventory Revised (PI-R), Panic Appraisal Inventory (PAI), Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), Worry Domains Questionnaire (WDQ), Social Interaction, Anxiety Scale (SIAS), Social Phobia Scale (SPS), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). We aimed to generate reference values for both ‘healthy’ and ‘clinically anxious’ populations for these anxiety questionnaires. Methods: We included 1295 subjects from the general population (ROM reference-group) and 5066 psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with a specific anxiety disorder (ROM patient-group). The MINI was used as diagnostic device in both the ROM reference group and the ROM patient group. To define limits for one-sided reference intervals (95th percentile; P undefined₉) the outermost 5% of observations were used. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analyses were used to yield alternative cut-off values for the anxiety questionnaires. Results: For the ROM reference-group the mean age was 40.3 years (SD = 12.6), and for the ROM patient-group it was 36.5 years (SD = 11.9). Females constituted 62.8% of the reference-group and 64.4% of the patient-group. P ₉₅ ROM reference group cut-off values for reference versus clinically anxious populations were 11 for the BSA, 43 for the PI-R, 37 for the PAI Anticipated Panic, 47 for the PAI Perceived Consequences, 65 for the PAI Perceived Self-efficacy, 66 for the PSWQ, 74 for the WDQ, 32 for the SIAS, 19 for the SPS, and 36 for IES-R. ROC analyses yielded slightly lower reference values. The discriminative power of all eight anxiety questionnaires was very high. Limitations: Substantial non-response and limited generalizability. Conclusions: For eight anxiety questionnaires a comprehensive set of reference values was provided. Reference values were generally higher in women than in men, implying the use of gender-specific cut-off values. Each instrument can be offered to every patient with MAS disorders to make responsible decisions about continuing, changing or terminating therapy.

Complementary and alternative therapies as add-on to pharmacotherapy for mood and anxiety disorders: A systematic review,"Background: Depressed and anxious patients often combine complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies with conventional pharmacotherapy to self-treat symptoms. The benefits and risks of such combination strategies have not been fully evaluated. This paper evaluates the risk-benefit profile of CAM augmentation to antidepressants in affective conditions. Methods: PubMed was searched for all available clinical reports published in English up to December 2012. Data were evaluated based on graded levels of evidence for efficacy and safety. Results: Generally, the evidence base is significantly larger for depression than for anxiety disorder. In unipolar depression, there is Level 2 evidence for adjunctive sleep deprivation (SD) and Free and Easy Wanderer Plus (FEWP), and Level 3 for exercise, yoga, light therapy (LT), omega-3 fatty acids, S-adenosylmethionine and tryptophan. In bipolar depression, there is Level 1 evidence for adjunctive omega-3s, Level 2 for SD, and Level 3 for LT and FEWP. In anxiety conditions, exercise augmentation has Level 3 support in generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Though mostly well-tolerated, these therapies can only be recommended as third-line interventions due to the quality of available evidence. Limitations: Overall, the literature is limited. Studies often had methodological weaknesses, with little information on long-term use and on potential drug–CAM interactions. Many CAM studies were not published in English. Conclusions: While several CAM therapies show some evidence of benefit as augmentation in depressive disorders, such evidence is largely lacking in anxiety disorders. The general dearth of adequate safety and tolerability data encourages caution in clinical use.

The effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in patients with bipolar disorder: A controlled functional MRI investigation,"Background: Preliminary research findings have shown that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy improves anxiety and depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder. In this study, we further investigated the effects of MBCT in bipolar disorder, in a controlled fMRI study. Method: Twenty three patients with bipolar disorder underwent neuropsychological testing and functional MRI. Sixteen of these patients were tested before and after an eight-week MBCT intervention, and seven were wait listed for training and tested at the same intervals. The results were compared with 10 healthy controls. Results: Prior to MBCT, bipolar patients reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and symptoms of stress, scored significantly lower on a test of working memory, and showed significant BOLD signal decrease in the medial PFC during a mindfulness task, compared to healthy controls. Following MBCT, there were significant improvements in the bipolar treatment group, in measures of mindfulness, anxiety and emotion regulation, and in tests of working memory, spatial memory and verbal fluency compared to the bipolar wait list group. BOLD signal increases were noted in the medial PFC and posterior parietal lobe, in a repeat mindfulness task. A region of interest analysis revealed strong correlation between signal changes in medial PFC and increases in mindfulness. Limitations: The small control group is a limitation in the study. Conclusion: These data suggest that MBCT improves mindfulness and emotion regulation and reduces anxiety in bipolar disorder, corresponding to increased activations in the medial PFC, a region associated with cognitive flexibility and previously proposed as a key area of pathophysiology in the disorder.

Acute and long-term treatment outcome in depressed inpatients with vs. without anxious features: Results of a one-year follow-up study,"Background: Anxious depression (AD) is common in patients with unipolar depression. It remains unclear if they have a higher level of depressive symptoms, a higher risk of non-response, a poorer prognosis and a higher relapse rate compared to non-anxious depressed (non-AD) patients. Methods: 168 patients took part in all three measurement points: (1) intake, (2) discharge and (3) follow-up. Patients fulfilled the criteria for anxious depression if they had a baseline score &gt; 7 on the anxiety/somatisation factor of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Patients with AD and non-AD were compared regarding symptom reduction from intake to discharge as well as from discharge to one year after discharge. Primary outcome measure was the HRSD. Results: The prevalence of AD was considerably high (81%). At intake, patients with AD had a significant higher score in the modified HRSD ( M = 20.677 ± 4.12 vs. M = 14.35 ± 5.06). Both patient groups showed a significant and comparable intake-to-discharge symptom reduction in all inventories. Remission rates at discharge did not differ between AD and non-AD patients. At 1-year follow-up, AD patients showed a similar symptom severity compared to non-AD patients. Conclusion: Symptoms of anxiety are common in depressive disorders are associated with higher depressive symptoms at the beginning of treatment. Acute and longer-term treatment outcome of AD patients was comparable to that of non-AD patients. Limitations: Limitations of this study are the naturalistic design, treatment was not standardized and comorbid anxiety disorders were not assessed using a structured interview.

Can we identify mothers at-risk for postpartum anxiety in the immediate postpartum period using the state-trait anxiety inventory?,"Background: This study assessed the stability of maternal anxiety and concordance between State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores in the immediate postpartum period to 8 weeks postpartum. Methods: A population-based sample of 522 mothers completed the STAI at 1, 4, and 8 weeks postpartum. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive power of the 1-week STAI in relation to identifying mothers with elevated STAI scores at 4 and 8 weeks was determined. Predictive power of the STAI was further assessed using odds ratios and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: At 1 week postpartum, 22.6% of mothers scored 440 on the STAI, decreasing to 17.2% at 4 weeks and 14.8% at 8 weeks. Using the cut-off score of 440, the 1-week STAI accurately classified 84.0% mothers at 4 weeks and 83.6% at 8 weeks with or without anxiety symptomatology. The 1-week STAI was significantly correlated to the 4-week ( r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.001) and 8-week ( r = 0.64, p &lt; 0.001) STAI. Mothers with a 1-week STAI score 440 were 15.2 times more likely at 4 weeks (95% CI = 8.9−26.1) and 14.0 times more likely at 8 weeks (95% CI = 7.9–24.8) to exhibit postpartum anxiety symptomatology. Limitations: Psychiatric interviews were not completed in collaboration with the STAI and specific types of anxiety disorders were not identified. Conclusions: A cut-off score of 440 on the STAI administered early in the postpartum period is recommended in a 2-phase identification program in order to not miss mothers with postpartum anxiety.

"Do urban environments increase the risk of anxiety, depression and psychosis? An epidemiological study","Background: The present study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between type of living environment (urban versus rural) and anxiety, depression and psychosis in the Scottish population. Methods: Data were obtained from the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics database on Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation and urban–rural classifications for 6505 data zones across Scotland. Multiple regression was used to test the association between prescriptions for psychotropic medication for anxiety, depression and psychosis, and type of living environment according to urban–rural classification, controlling for a range of socio-economic factors. Results: Urban–rural classification significantly predicted poorer mental health both before (β = −.29) and after (β = −.20) controlling for a large number of socio-economic variables, with more urban areas having higher rates of prescription for psychotropic medication for anxiety, depression and psychosis. Limitations: The current study focussed on macro-level variables and did not include individual level data. As such, the study did not include data on individual diagnoses, but instead used drug prescriptions for anxiety, depression and psychosis as a proxy for level of affective disorders within data zones. Conclusion: More urban living environments in Scotland are associated with higher rates of prescription for psychotropic medication for anxiety, depression and psychosis.

Tardive dyskinesia from atypical antipsychotic agents in patients with mood disorders in a clinical setting,"Background: There is a paucity of information on the risks and clinical characteristics of tardive dyskinesia with atypical antipsychotic agents in patients with mood and anxiety disorders in clinical practice. Methods: The authors retrospectively screened the charts of 268 patients with a mood or anxiety disorder treated with atypical antipsychotic agents from a psychiatric practice. Fifteen patients who developed tardive dyskinesia were identified and further data was collected on these patients. Results: Tardive dyskinesia occurred in 5.9% of patients after exposure to an atypical antipsychotic agent for a mean of 28.7 months (range: 1–83). The average dosage of the offending agent in chlorpromazine equivalents was 350 mg/day (range: 67–969). All patients experienced oral-buccal-lingual stereotypy, which was frequently severe in nature, but completely resolved in all but one patient. Most patients (90.9%) who consented to a second trial of an atypical antipsychotic did not experience a relapse of TD. Limitations: All patients were treated in a clinical practice setting by a single psychiatrist, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: The observed rate of TD represents a real world estimate of the risk of TD with atypical antipsychotic agents in patients with mood disorders. Fortunately, with early recognition symptoms appear to be reversible and further treatment with another atypical antipsychotic does not necessarily lead to relapse.

Reduced PON1 enzymatic activity and increased lipid hydroperoxide levels that point out oxidative stress in generalized anxiety disorder,"In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) which is one of the most prevalent mental disorders in general population. Psychological, genetic, neurobiological, and neurochemical factors are believed to play role in the etiopathogenesis of GAD. The role of oxidative stress, as a neurochemical cause, in various anxiety disorders has been studied in recent years; however, it has not been thoroughly studied in GAD, yet. In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the serum levels of lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH), paraoxonase, and arylesterase in GAD patients without any co-morbid psychiatric disorders and investigate their diagnostic performance. Blood samples were collected from 40 GAD patients and 40 healthy control subjects to measure their serum LOOH levels, arylesterase and paraoxonase activities. Obtained results have been compared between groups and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve has been drawn for diagnostic performance of measured biochemical markers. Positive and negative predictive values have been estimated where appropriate. Mean LOOH level of the GAD patients was significantly higher than that of control subjects ( t = −5.49, p &lt; 0.001), whereas, mean paraoxonase activity was lower in these patients ( t = 3.056, p = 0.03). GAD could be predicted for LOOH level over 7.740 μmol/l with 92.5% positive predictive value and 92% negative predictive value. Increased LOOH level and decreased paraoxonase activity of GAD patients may suggest increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in these patients. LOOH levels may be a state marker for diagnosing GAD.

Unplanned pregnancy and discontinuation of SSRIs in pregnant women with previously treated affective disorder,"Objective: To identify the factors associated with discontinuation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in pregnant women and to determine the rates of SSRI reintroduction during pregnancy. Method: A prospective study was conducted in the Perinatal Psychiatry Service of the Hospital Clínic in Barcelona. The total sample comprised 132 consecutive pregnant women with depressive or anxiety disorder (DSM-IV criteria), seen between January 2005 and December 2008 and who were receiving SSRIs at the time of conception. Clinical, psychometric and socio-demographic variables were collected at the first visit. All women were assessed during treatment with the Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Dose and type of antidepressant were recorded at each visit during pregnancy. Results: Seventy women (53%) discontinued SSRI treatment upon confirmation of pregnancy. Socio-demographic, obstetric and psychiatric variables did not differ significantly between women who maintained and women who discontinued treatment. Only unplanned pregnancy was associated with a greater risk of discontinuation (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.34–5.52). Women who discontinued treatment also had higher EPDS and STAI scores in the first visit and prenatal visit (34–36 weeks) ( p &lt; .05). Of the 70 women who discontinued treatment, 57.1% ( N = 40) reintroduced treatment, almost half of these in the first trimester of pregnancy. Conclusions: Unplanned pregnancy was a risk factor for abrupt discontinuation of SSRIs upon confirmation of pregnancy in women with depressive or anxiety disorder. More than half the pregnant women who discontinued SSRIs reintroduced antidepressant therapy during pregnancy.

Serum neurotrophic factors in adolescent depression: Gender difference and correlation with clinical severity,"Background: Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) play critical role in growth, differentiation, maintenance and synaptic plasticity in neuronal systems which is more relevant in adolescence. The present study was undertaken to verify the ‘neurotrophin hypothesis’ in adolescent depression by (i) comparing serum concentrations of neurotrophic factors in depression patients and healthy control, and (ii) analyzing correlations between clinical severity and serum neurotrophin levels. Methods: Eighty four adolescent (aged 13–18 years) depressed patients (56 males; 60 medication free/naive) and 64 healthy controls (39 males) were recruited. Severity of depression was measured by Beck's depression inventory, and anxiety by state-trait anxiety inventory. Measurement of serum neurotrophins was done by ELISA. Results: Adolescents with depression had significantly lower levels of BDNF: mean diff. (95% C.I.): 2093.9 (1074.0, 3113.9), NGF: 813.3 (343.1, 1283.6) and GDNF: 158.8 (77.2, 240.4) compared to controls. On gender based analysis female controls had significantly increased trait anxiety scores [−1.1 (−1.8, −0.1)], as compared to control males. In the patient group, female patients had far lower level of NGF: 919.6 (210.9, 1628.3) and NT-3: 1288.8 (145.4, 2432.3) compared to male. BDI-II score showed a statistically significant ( p &lt;0.01) negative correlation with all four neurotrophins in male patients while in female patients such negative correlation was observed only with NGF and GDNF ( p &lt;0.01). Limitations: The study is cross-sectional from a tertiary care hospital. Conclusion: The novelty of the study lies in its large number of exclusively adolescent depression patients showing significant reduction of BDNF, NGF and GDNF serum levels as compared to controls. A gender bias with much reduction in female has also been recorded.

"Predictors for exacerbation/improvement of postpartum depression—A focus on anxiety, the mothers' experiences of being cared for by their parents in childhood and borderline personality: A perspective study in Japan","Objective: To investigate the course and influencing factors of postpartum depression in women during the child rearing period. Methods: Data were collected during 0-year-old baby check-ups and a follow-up investigation. 262 participants were included in the analysis. Both surveys employed the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS). The first also comprised the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), and Borderline Scale Index, enabling sub-division of participating subjects into healthy/pathological groups. ZSDS group and survey scores were compared using the t-test. Results: The average ages of the children and the ZSDS scores in both surveys were 7.0 ± 3.2 and 21.8 ± 2.4 months, 40.6 ± 7.9 and 40.1 ± 8.7, respectively, with no significant differences among depression scores. When subjects were divided according to individual scale scores, and survey scores compared, depression significantly improved in the high trait/state anxiety group, high PBI maternal care score group, nonborderline personality (BP) trait group, and breast feeding group, whereas depression was significantly exacerbated in the low PBI maternal care score group. Discussion: Postpartum depression characterized by strong anxiety and a depressive state in mothers with favorable psychological backgrounds showed gradual improvement. We noted an exacerbation of depression during the separation period in mothers who had received poor maternal care. We assume that the feeling of abandonment induced by individuation of their children is a major factor. Limitations: There is concern that some depressive women may have dropped out due to a performance bias.

Childhood anxiety: An early predictor of mood disorders in offspring of bipolar parents,"Background: Anxiety disorders are common among the offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). This study investigated the nature of the association between anxiety disorders and mood disorders in a prospectively studied high-risk cohort. Methods: High-risk offspring were identified from families in which one parent had confirmed BD based on SADS-L interviews and best estimate diagnostic procedures. All agreeable offspring aged 8–25 years were enrolled in a longitudinal study involving repeated KSADS-PL format clinical assessments. Control (C) offspring from families in which neither parent met lifetime criteria for a psychiatric disorder were similarly assessed. All DSM-IV diagnoses in the offspring were confirmed on blind consensus review. Cumulative incidence and adjusted Cox Proportional Hazards models were used to calculate the risk of anxiety disorders and the predictive association with mood disorders. Results: The cumulative incidence of anxiety disorders was higher (23.40% vs. 10.42%; HR = 2.136; p = .0382) and occurred earlier (9.79 vs. 14.84 years; p = .0125) in high-risk compared to C offspring. In high-risk offspring generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) followed by social phobia were the most incident anxiety subtypes; while high emotionality (HR 1.111; p = .0096) and shyness (HR 1.144; p = .0053) increased the risk of anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders increased the adjusted risk of mood disorders (HR 2.166; p = .0004), on average 8.49 years later (SD 5.97). Limitations: The cumulative incidence of BD is relatively low, as the cohort is still in the period of risk. Conclusions: Findings highlight the need for longitudinal surveillance of symptomatic high-risk children and suggest anxiety disorders are an important early intervention target.

Cognitive-behavioural interventions for mood and anxiety disorders in HIV: A systematic review,"Background: Mood and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and comorbid with HIV/AIDS. However, there is a paucity of research on the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural interventions (CBI) for common mental disorders in HIV-infected adults. The present study sought to review the existing literature on the use of CBI for depression and anxiety in HIV-positive adults and to assess the effect size of these interventions. Methods: We did duplicate searches of databases (from inception to 17–22 May 2012). The following online databases were searched: PubMed, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PsychArticles. Results: We identified 20 studies suitable for inclusion. A total of 2886 participants were enroled in these studies, of which 2173 participants completed treatment. The present review of the literature suggests that CBI may be effective in the treatment of depression and anxiety in individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Significant reductions in depression and anxiety were reported in intervention studies that directly and indirectly targeted depression and/or anxiety. Effect sizes ranged from 0.02 to 1.02 for depression and 0.04 to 0.70 for anxiety. Limitations: Some trials included an immediate postintervention assessment but no follow-up assessments of outcome. This omission makes it difficult to determine whether the intervention effects are sustainable over time. Conclusion: The present review of the literature suggests that CBI may have a positive impact on the treatment of depression and anxiety in adults living with HIV/AIDS.

Two-year stability and change of neuroticism and extraversion in treated and untreated persons with depression: Findings from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA),"Background: The personality dimensions neuroticism and extraversion likely represent part of the vulnerability to depression. The stability over longer time periods of these personality dimensions in depressed patients treated with psychological treatment or medication and in untreated persons with depression in the general population remains unclear. Stability of neuroticism and extraversion in treated and untreated depressed persons would suggest that part of the vulnerability to depression remains stable over time. The current study addressed the question whether treatment in depressed patients is related to changes in neuroticism and extraversion. Methods: Data are from 709 patients with major depressive disorder participating in a cohort study (Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety; NESDA). We determined the 2-year stability of extraversion and neuroticism in treated and untreated persons and related change in depression severity to change in personality over time. Results: Neuroticism decreased from baseline to 2-year follow-up ( d = 0.73) in both treated and untreated persons. Extraversion did not change significantly after controlling for neuroticism and depression severity at baseline and follow-up. Decreased depressive symptoms over time were related to decreased neuroticism ( d = 1.91) whereas increased depressive symptoms over time were unrelated to neuroticism ( d = 0.06). Limitations: Patients were not randomized to treatment conditions and the groups are therefore not directly comparable. Conclusions: Treated patients with depression in the general population improve just as much on depression severity and neuroticism as untreated persons with depression. This suggests that changes in neuroticism in the context of treatment likely represent mood-state effects rather than direct effects of treatment.

"The relationship between depression, anxiety and cardiovascular disease: Findings from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study","Background: Previous studies suggest a link between depression, anxiety and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms and CVD in a population based cohort. Methods: In total 1578 men and 1,417 women from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study were assessed for CVD at baseline and after 5.971.4 years. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured using the HADS scale. Results: Baseline HAD-D score, but not HAD-A, was significantly associated with baseline plasma triglycerides, glucose and insulin resistance (men only) and HDL cholesterol (women only). After adjustment for CVD risk factors, higher baseline HAD-D scores were associated with increased odds ratios for CVD (men: 1.162 [95% CI 1.096–1.231]; women: 1.107 [1.038–1.181]). Higher HAD-A scores associated with increased CVD in men only. High HAD-D scores predicted incident CVD (adjusted OR 1.130 [1.034–1.235]), all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.081, [1.012–1.154]) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR 1.109 [1.002–1.229]) in men but not in women. Limitations: The use of a self-report measure of depressive and anxiety symptoms, ‘healthy’ responder bias and the low number of cardiovascular events are all limitations. Conclusions: Depressive and anxiety symptoms are commoner in people with CVD. These symptoms are independent predictors of CVD in men. Although HAD-D score was significantly associated with several cardiovascular risk factors, this did not fully explain the association between HAD-D and CVD.

How well does the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale identify depression and anxiety in fathers? A validation study in a population based Swedish sample,"Background: Fathers are increasingly involved in infant care, and depression in postnatal fathers as well as mothers may have negative effects on child development and behaviour. The EPDS has been validated to identify depression in new mothers, but few validation studies have involved fathers and there is doubt as to whether the EPDS measures the same constructs in men as in women. Subjects and methods: A population-based sample of 1014 couples were sent the EPDS and the HAD-A subscale 3 months postnatally. All high-scoring fathers and a random sample of fathers scoring low were invited for a diagnostic interview to assess the presence of any depression or anxiety disorder. A factor analysis of the EPDS data was conducted for mothers and fathers. Findings: A factor analysis of the EPDS data revealed a different factor structure for fathers, implying that the scale picks up more worry, anxiety and unhappiness than depression. The EPDS yields high sensitivity and specificity, but low positive predictive value when screening for probable major depression at the optimal cut-off score of 12 or more. The accuracy of the EPDS, however, is modest for minor depression, and low for anxiety disorders. Neither the EPDS-3A score nor the HAD-A subscale reached acceptable validity in this study. Conclusions: The EPDS seems to pick up more distress than pure depression in new fathers. It is a valid instrument for screening for probable major depression, but it is questionable if it should be used to screen for minor depression. Neither the EPDS nor the HAD-A subscale can be recommended for screening for anxiety in postnatal fathers. Limitations: Confidence intervals around the estimates are wide and the interviewed fathers were selected preferentially.

Predictors of acute stress disorder severity,"Background: The DSM-IV diagnosis of acute stress disorder (ASD) describes a posttraumatic reaction that occurs two to twenty-eight days following a trauma and involves symptoms of intrusion, avoidance, hyper-arousal and dissociation. A better understanding of ASD and its pathogenesis could lead to improved post-trauma health care interventions. The aim of this study was to determine prospectively whether a combination of clinical, cognitive and demographic variables were predictive of ASD severity in an acutely traumatized sample. Methods: We assessed demographic (e.g. age, gender, education), clinical (e.g. sleep quality, trait anxiety, previous psychiatric diagnoses), and cognitive (e.g. negative cognitions following trauma) variables in a sample of 125 adult motor vehicle accident survivors (age: 32.2679.99; gender: 56.6% male) approximately 10 days after the accident. Univariate analyes and stepwise linear regression were performed to identify variables predictive of ASD severity. Results: Although a number of factors were individually associated with ASD severity, in a regression model only 3 factors, trait anxiety, suicide risk and post-traumatic cognitions, emerged as predictive of the severity of the disorder. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the study and use of self-report measures are important to bear in mind. Conclusions: Higher levels of trait anxiety, risk for suicide and negative appraisals of the traumatic event were predictive of ASD severity. As these factors may help to identify those who may be at risk of more severe responses after a traumatic event, and who may benefit from secondary prevention strategies, they should be assessed for in acute trauma survivors.

Relationship between physical activity and depression and anxiety symptoms: A population study,"Background: There are few studies evaluating the association between practice of physical activity and mood in a population sample. This study evaluated the frequency of symptoms of depression and anxiety in the population of the city of Sao Paulo and their association with the report of practice of regular physical activity. Methods: This survey was conducted with the adult population of Sao Paulo between July and December of 2007. The sample was composed of 1042 volunteers (both genders) with a mean age of 41.9 ± 14.4 years. The volunteers were evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and two simple questions designed to evaluate and classify physical activity. Socioeconomic status was also determined according to Brazil’s Economic Classification Criterion. Results: People who do not engage in physical activity are two times more likely to exhibit symptoms of depression (PR: 2.1) and anxiety (PR: 2.5) compared with those who regularly practice physical activity and a higher prevalence of symptoms for anxiety (9.8%) and depression (10.9%) was observed among those claiming to not practice regular physical activity and 63.2% related did not practice any physical activity regularly. Conclusion: Altogether, these results suggest that people who do not practice physical activity have a higher chance of exhibiting symptoms of depression and anxiety when compared to those who perform physical activity regularly. In this sense, regular physical activity must be encouraged, and this incentive should be routine in both current and future public health policies. Although the methodology in the present study does not allow assigning a relation of cause and effect, we observed associations between symptoms of depression, anxiety and physical activity.

Regional gray matter reductions are associated with genetic liability for anxiety and depression: An MRI twin study,"Background: The influence of genetic and/or environmental factors on the volumetric brain changes observed in subjects affected by anxiety and depression disorders remains unclear. The current study aimed to investigate whether genetic and environmental liabilities make different contributions to abnormalities in gray matter volume (GMV) in anxiety and depression using a concordant and discordant MZ twin pairs design. Methods: Fifty-three magnetic resonance imaging (3T) brain scans were obtained from monozygotic (MZ) twins concordant (6 pairs) and discordant (10 pairs) for lifetime anxiety and depression disorders and from healthy twins (21 subjects). We applied voxel-based morphometry to analyse GMV differences. Concordant affected twins were compared to healthy twins and within-pairs comparisons were performed in the discordant group. Results: GMV reductions in bilateral fusiform gyrus and amygdala were observed in concordant affected twins for anxiety and depression compared to healthy twins. No intrapair differences were found in GMV between discordant affected twins and their healthy co-twins. Limitations: The sample size was modest. This might explain why no intrapair differences were found in the discordant MZ twin group. Conclusions: As concordant affected MZ twins are believed to have a particularly high genetic liability for the disorder, our findings suggest that fusiform gyrus and amygdala gray matter reductions are related to a genetic risk for anxiety and depression. Discrepancies in regard to brain abnormalities in anxiety and depression may be related to the admixture of patients with GMV abnormalities mainly accounted for by genetic factors with patients presenting GMV mainly accounted for by environmental factors.

"First-incidence of DSM-IV mood, anxiety and substance use disorders and its determinants: Results from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2","Background: Prospective studies measuring first-incidence of DSM-IV mood, anxiety and substance use disorders in the general population are rare. We assessed these incidence rates in the Dutch population; and identified baseline sociodemographic, physical and psychopathological variables, and negative changes in sociodemographics and physical health between baseline and follow-up, as determinants of first-onset main categories of disorders. Method: Data are from NEMESIS-2, a representative face-to-face survey including 5303 subjects aged 18–64 interviewed twice (2007–2009; 2010–2012) with the CIDI 3.0. Results: In three years, 8.86% of adults without prior psychopathology experienced any mental disorder, corresponding with 3.09 cases per 100 person-years. Incidence was highest for anxiety (1.69 per 100 person-years) and mood disorder (1.65), and lowest for substance use disorder (0.97). For the separate disorders, incidence was highest for major depression (1.58), specific phobia (0.79) and alcohol abuse (0.73). For mood and anxiety disorder, incidence rate was higher among women and for substance use disorder it was higher among men. Age was inversely related to all disorder categories. Changes in sociodemographics, like no longer living with a partner and decrease in income, were stronger determinants than the corresponding sociodemographics. Incident mood disorder was predicted by baseline anxiety and substance use disorder, incident anxiety disorder by mood and substance use disorder, and incident substance use disorder by adult ADHD. Limitations: Validity of lifetime diagnoses can be questioned because of difficulty of accurate recall. Only determinants of categories of disorders were studied, due to low numbers of incident cases of most separate disorders. Conclusion: First-onset of mental disorders in a 3-year period is not an uncommon phenomenon. Results about determinants of incident disorders are important for prevention and early intervention initiatives aimed at reducing burden of mental disorders.

Factor mixture model of anxiety sensitivity and anxiety psychopathology vulnerability,"Background: The purpose of the present study was to shed light on the latent structure and nature of individual differences in anxiety sensitivity (AS) and related risk for psychopathology. Methods: The present study evaluated the latent structure of AS using factor mixture modeling (FMM; Lubke and Muthén, 2005) and tested the relations between the observed FMM-based model of AS and psychopathology in a large, diverse adult clinical research sample ( N = 481; 57.6% women; M(SD) age = 36.6(15.0) years). Results: Findings showed that a two-class three-factor partially invariant model of AS demonstrated significantly better fit than a one-class dimensional model and more complex multi-class models. As predicted, risk conferred by AS taxonicity was specific to anxiety psychopathology, and not to other forms of psychopathology. Limitations: The sample was not epidemiologic, self-report and psychiatric interview data were used to index AS and psychopathology, and a cross-sectional design limited inference regarding the directionality of observed relations between AS and anxiety psychopathology. Conclusions: Findings are discussed with respect to the nature of AS and related anxiety psychopathology vulnerability specifically, as well as the implications of factor mixture modeling for advancing taxonomy of vulnerability and psychopathology more broadly.

Comparison of four self-report measures and a generic mood question to screen for anxiety during pregnancy in English-speaking women,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 155 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2014-06746-008). In the original article, the acknowledgment of Barbara Valenti to her supervisor Dr. Paola Gremigni, and Dr. Francesca Agostini for enabling her to obtain a placement in Australia and for the support given to her during the whole placement was omitted. The acknowledgment is present in the erratum.] Background: Increasingly researchers and clinicians have called for perinatal mental health depression screening to be broadened to also screen for significant levels of anxiety. This study therefore aimed to compare the screening performance during pregnancy of four self-report anxiety measures, as well as a generic mood question. Method: The measures tested were two measures of general anxiety (the anxiety subscales of the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and two measures of pregnancy specific anxiety by Huizink and colleagues, and Rini and colleagues (both originally called the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire). A generic mood question (Matthey Generic Mood Question) asking about stress, anxiety, unhappiness or difficulty coping was also tested. Between 132 and 389 women completed these measures at their first antenatal clinic appointment and up to 249 women completed a diagnostic interview and various measures two weeks later. Results: The generic mood question performed best, detecting between 58% and 87% of high scorers on the other measures, including 80% of the women with an anxiety disorder. The next best measure was the EDS anxiety subscale, detecting between 26% and 73% of high scorers on the other measures, though this only detected 54% of the women with an anxiety disorder. Limitations: Findings are only applicable to English-speaking women. In addition whether the findings can be applied to women later in their pregnancy, or postpartum, is not known. Conclusion: Services wishing to screen for not only possible depression but also possible anxiety should use the generic mood question. For those services which currently use the EDS we recommend they also score the three-item anxiety subscale.

Potential role of membrane-bound COMT gene polymorphisms in female depression vulnerability,"Background: Several polymorphic variants within the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene locus have been associated with a number of diverse psychiatric phenotypes including affective disorders. COMT enzyme participates in metabolic pathways involving brain catecholamines, as well as steroid hormones such as estrogens. Given the suggested mood enhancing role of estrogens and the higher prevalence of depression in women, we set out to investigate the potential impact of functional COMT genetic variants on depression and anxiety symptoms in a homogeneous female community sample. Methods: We genotyped three common polymorphisms within the COMT gene in a rural female population isolate ( n = 391) interviewed for the presence of lifetime major depression episodes and generalized anxiety disorder. Furthermore, well validated self-rated questionnaires were administered evaluating state depressive symptoms and neuroticism personality trait. Single-marker and haplotype association analyses were performed. Results: Two highly correlated markers located in the membrane-bound (MB) COMT promoter region (rs2020917, rs737865) were significantly associated with both self-rated and clinician-rated depressive symptomatology. We did not detect any robust association with generalized anxiety disorder or neuroticism. Exploratory haplotype analysis examining the two promoter markers in combination with the extensively studied val158met polymorphism (rs4680) did not provide any further support for the contribution of this variant in depressive mood. Limitations: The relative small sample size should be considered a limitation of this study. Conclusions: Our results provide promising evidence that MB-COMT specific genetic variation may represent an as yet unrecognized genetic factor that influences predisposition to depression amongst females.

Could the lower prevalence of affective disorder in older people be due to measurement error? Reliability of the revised clinical interview schedule in younger and older adults,"Background: Population surveys report that anxiety and depressive disorders are less common in older people. It has been suggested this may be accounted for by measurement errors. We analysed 2007 English Psychiatric Morbidity Survey data to explore whether the reduced prevalences of anxiety and depression in older people might be explained by the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) items functioning differently across age groups. Methods: 7403 people, 57% of those approached, took part. A multiple indicators multiple causes (‘MIMIC’) model explored the factor structure of the CIS-R and the relationship between covariates (age, sex and IQ) and the factor structure. Results: A model with one latent factor ""neuroticism"", measured by 14 dichotomised individual symptom scores, was the most parsimonious (factor loadings 0.57–0.92). Younger respondents (&gt; 65 years), women and those with lower IQs, had significantly higher neuroticism factor scores. Older respondents (465 years) were less likely than younger adults to experience irritability, phobia, and worry, but more likely to experience fatigue, worry specifically about physical health and sleep difficulties. Model factor loadings remained strong and statistically significant (0.53–0.92) after including age, sex and IQ as covariates. Limitations: We analysed age dichotomously, defining older as aged 65 or above. We could not identify which of the participants had dementia, a potentially important covariate. Conclusions: This study indicates that the CIS-R can reliably identify people with anxiety and depressive symptoms across the population, suggesting that specialist instruments may not always be required to accurately measure anxiety and depressive symptoms in older people.

"White matter integrity alterations in first episode, treatment-naive generalized anxiety disorder","Background: Several neurobiological models of anxiety disorder posit a primary role for dysfunction of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). This study tests the hypothesis that patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have abnormal white matter microstructure in the amygdala and ACC, as inferred from diffusion tensor imaging, compared with healthy controls. Methods: Subjects were 16 right-handed, first-episode, treatment-naive GAD patients without comorbid disorders and 26 matched, healthy comparison controls. All subjects underwent diffusion tensor imaging and structural magnetic resonance imaging brain scanning. Fractional anisotropy ( FA ), a robust intravoxel measure of water self-diffusion, was compared between groups on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Associations between clinical ratings of symptom severity (i.e., the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire) and FA were assessed. Results: Compared with healthy volunteers, patients demonstrated significantly higher FA in the right amygdala white matter and lower FA in the caudal ACC/mid-cingulate cortex white matter. Higher right amygdala FA correlated significantly with higher Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores and higher Penn State Worry Questionnaire scores. Limitations: The sample size was modest and may contribute to false positive effects. Conclusions: These findings provide the first evidence of an abnormality in white matter microstructure that involves the amygdala and the cingulate cortex in the pathogenesis of GAD, and are consistent with neurobiological models that posit a defect in emotion-related brain regions.

The comorbidity of anxiety and depressive symptoms in older adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A longitudinal study,"Background: Comorbidity between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and depression and anxiety disorders in children and young to middle-aged adults has been well documented in the literature. Yet, it is still unknown whether this comorbidity persists into later life. The aim of this study is therefore to examine the comorbidity of anxiety and depressive symptoms among older adults with ADHD. This is examined both using cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Methods: Data were used from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). Participants were examined in three measurement cycles, covering six years. They were asked about depressive and anxiety symptoms. To diagnose ADHD, the DIVA 2.0, a diagnostic interview was administered among a subsample ( N =231, age 60–94). In addition to the ADHD diagnosis, the association between the sum score of ADHD symptoms and anxiety and depressive symptoms was examined. Data were analyzed by means of linear regression analyses and linear mixed models. Results: Both ADHD diagnosis and more ADHD symptoms were associated with more anxiety and depressive symptoms cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. The longitudinal analyses showed that respondents with higher scores of ADHD symptoms reported an increase of depressive symptoms over six years whereas respondents with fewer ADHD symptoms remained stable. Limitations: The ADHD diagnosis is based on the DSM-IV criteria, which were developed for children, and have not yet been validated in (older) adults. Conclusions: It appears that the association between ADHD and anxiety/depression remains in place with aging. This suggests that, in clinical practice, directing attention to both in concert may be fruitful.

A pilot randomised controlled trial to reduce suffering and emotional distress in patients with advanced cancer,"Introduction: A pilot trial was carried out to determine if a focussed narrative interview could alleviate the components of suffering and anxiety and depression in advanced cancer patients. Intervention: Patients recruited were invited to participate in a focussed narrative interview and reflect on their perspectives on their sense of ""meaning"", regarding suffering and their psychological, physical, social and spiritual well being—the emphasis was on allowing the patient to tell their story. Patients were encouraged to share what resources they themselves had utilised in addition to what professional care they may have received, to maintain a sense of well being. Method: Patients with advanced metastatic disease were recruited from hospices in the North West of England—the only exclusion criteria were not being able to understand written and spoken English and a non cancer diagnosis. At recruitment patients were asked to complete a numerical scale for suffering; the Brief Edinburgh Depression Scale, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), FACIT Spiritual well being questionnaire, Demographic information was collected and patients were randomised to either the intervention arm of the trial or the usual care arm of the study. Patients in both groups were invited to complete each measure at 2, 4 and 8 weeks. Results: One hundred people were recruited into the study—49 were randomised to intervention group and 51 to control group. The median age of patients was 66 years age range (31–89 years) and 68% of patients were female. At baseline the ECOG performance of 75% of patients recruited was 1 or 2. The median survival of all patients in the study was 169.5 days (range 10 days to still alive at end of study). There was no significant difference at any timepoint in scores on suffering measure between intervention group and control group. At each time point the intervention demonstrated mean improvement in scores for depression and anxiety on ESAS—the greatest changes for both depression and anxiety were seen at 4 weeks. Conclusion: This pilot randomised controlled trial of a focussed narrative intervention demonstrated an improvement in mean changes in scores for depression and anxiety at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. We suggest this intervention may have beneficial effects on depression and anxiety, but a larger powered trial is required to determine the full effects.

Recurrence of anxiety disorders and its predictors,"Background: The chronic course of anxiety disorders and its high burden of disease are partly due to the recurrence of anxiety disorders after remission. However, knowledge about recurrence rates and predictors of recurrence is scarce. This article reports on recurrence rates of anxiety disorders and investigates predictors of recurrence from a broad range of socio-demographic characteristics, illness-related and psychosocial putative predictors. Methods: Baseline and 2-year follow-up data were derived from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Participants who had at least one lifetime anxiety disorder (panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, agoraphobia alone, social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder), but were remitted at baseline ( N = 429) were included. Recurrence of anxiety disorders during the 2-year followup period was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, version 2.1. Results: Recurrence rates among pure and multiple anxiety disorders did not differ significantly and the overall recurrence rate of anxiety disorders was 23.5%. In those recurring, the incidence of a new anxiety disorder was common (32.7%). Disability and anxiety sensitivity remained predictive of recurrence of anxiety disorders in multivariable regression analysis. Limitations: The included participants had more severe symptoms at baseline than the non-response group and lifetime anxiety diagnoses were assessed, retrospectively. Conclusions: Recurrence of anxiety disorders is common and clinicians should be aware of the diagnostic instability within anxiety disorders. Disability and anxiety sensitivity are independent predictors of recurrence of anxiety disorders. Altering these predictors in regular cognitive behavioural therapy could contribute to the reduction of recurrence.

A psychometric evaluation of the French Canadian version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale in a large primary care population,"Background: The aims of this study were to: (1) evaluate the psychometric properties of a French Canadian version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-FC) in a large population of primary care patients in Quebec, Canada; (2) conduct a transcultural validation of the original HADS in a subsample of English-speaking patients; (3) explore HADS properties in subgroups with or without multimorbidity. Methods: A sample of 14,833 adults recruited in 64 primary care clinics completed the HADS, including 3,382 patients at elevated risk of mental disorders that also completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Simplified (CIDIS). The HADS’ internal consistency and discriminant validity were assessed, its factor structure was evaluated, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were undertaken to evaluate its case finding abilities. Results: The HADS-FC had good reliability (Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.79 to 0.89 depending on language version and subscales) and discriminant validity, and a two-factor structure reflecting anxiety and depression factors. Results were similar in patient subgroups with or without multimorbidity. Optimal cut-off values were calculated: HADS: ≥ 16 (sensitivity 62%, specificity 77%), HADS-A: ≥ 10 (sensitivity 66%, specificity 73%) and HADS-D:≥ 7 (sensitivity 65%, specificity 75%). Limitations: Our cohort selection process and use of the CIDIS as a gold standard may have contributed to the limited case-finding performance of the HADS-FC. Conclusions: The HADS-FC and English HADS presented good psychometric properties in primary care patients, including patients with and without multimorbidity. However, its performance as a screening instrument in these settings with patients of varying clinical profiles requires more scrutiny.

Differentiating disordered affect in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes,"Background: There is evidence for increased risk of affective disorders (AD) in adults with type 1 diabetes however, the prevalence and characteristics of AD in young people with the condition is unclear. Comorbid AD in type 1 diabetes is associated with deleterious self-management, sub-optimal clinical indicators, reduced quality of life, poorer physical health, increased complications, increased high risk behaviours in adolescence and young adulthood, and earlier mortality. The present study investigated the prevalence and character of AD in young people with type 1 diabetes. Methods: The self-report PH-PANAS-C was employed in a cross-sectional, case-control design to identify and differentiate full-syndrome (FS) and subthreshold (St) levels of AD in 53 participants with type 1 diabetes (case) and 54 age-balanced controls ( N = 107; 7–18 yrs). Results: Case participants reported greater AD than controls. When differentiated, only anxiety was significantly more prevalent. Case participants reported less positive affect, and greater negative affect and autonomic arousal. Further, 1:3 case participants presented with St symptoms of AD. Limitations: Self-report measures are known to produce moderated responses therefore symptoms may be more severe than reported. There has been some suggestion that responses to somatic items in the PH-PANAS-C may relate to diabetes-specific states rather than affect-related symptoms however, recent evidence has refuted this argument. Conclusions: AD, particularly anxiety, represents a significant clinical concern in young people with type 1 diabetes both as a disorder in its own right and as a major impediment to primary care and management of the diabetes. The significant dominance of anxiety-related symptoms and prevalence of subthreshold presentation warrant further investigation.

"Differential item functioning of the HADS and PHQ-9: An investigation of age, gender and educational background in a clinical UK primary care sample","Background: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) are commonly used measures in clinical practice and research. It is important that such scales measure the trait they purport to measure and that the impact of other measurement artefacts is minimal. Differential item functioning of these scales by gender, educational background and age is currently assessed. Methods: Severity of depression and anxiety symptoms were measured in primary care patients referred to mental health workers using the PHQ-9 and HADS. Each scale was assessed for Differential Item Functioning (DIF) and Differential Test Function (DTF) by gender, educational background and age. Minimum n per analysis = 895. DIF was assessed with Mantel’s χ², Liu-Agresti cumulative common odds ratio (LA LOR) and the standardised LA LOR (LA LOR-Z). DTF was assessed in relation to v ². Results: PHQ-9, HADS Depression Sub-scale (HADS-D) and HADS Anxiety Subscale (HADS-A) lacked bias in terms of gender and educational background ( v ² &lt; 0.07). However, both PHQ-9 and HADS-D exhibited bias with regard to age: PHQ-9 v ² = 0.103 (medium effect); HADS-D v ² = 0.214 (large effect). PHQ-9 items exhibiting DIF by age covered: anhedonia, energy and low mood. HADS-D items exhibiting DIF by age covered psychomotor retardation and interest in appearance. Limitations: No assessment of other potential DIF contributors was made. Conclusions: PHQ-9, HADS-D and HADS-A generally do not exhibit bias for gender and educational background. However bias was observed in PHQ-9 and HADS-D for age. Caution should be exercised interpreting scores both in clinical practice and research.

Interventions to reduce stress in university students: A review and meta-analysis,"Background: Recent research has revealed concerning rates of anxiety and depression among university students. Nevertheless, only a small percentage of these students receive treatment from university health services. Universities are thus challenged with instituting preventative programs that address student stress and reduce resultant anxiety and depression. Method: A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing stress in university students. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the assignment of study participants to experimental or control groups was by random allocation or parallel cohort design. Results: Retrieved studies represented a variety of intervention approaches with students in a broad range of programs and disciplines. Twenty-four studies, involving 1431 students were included in the meta-analysis. Cognitive, behavioral and mindfulness interventions were associated with decreased symptoms of anxiety. Secondary outcomes included lower levels of depression and cortisol. Limitations: Included studies were limited to those published in peer reviewed journals. These studies over-represent interventions with female students in Western countries. Studies on some types of interventions such as psycho-educational and arts based interventions did not have sufficient data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Conclusion: This review provides evidence that cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness interventions are effective in reducing stress in university students. Universities are encouraged to make such programs widely available to students. In addition however, future work should focus on developing stress reduction programs that attract male students and address their needs.

"Anti-anxiety drugs reduce conflict-specific ""theta""—A possible human anxiety-specific biomarker","Background: Syndromes of fear/anxiety are currently ill-defined, with no accepted human biomarkers for anxiety-specific processes. A unique common neural action of different classes of anxiolytic drugs may provide such a biomarker. In rodents, a reduction in low frequency (4–12 Hz; ""theta"") brain rhythmicity is produced by all anxiolytics (even those lacking panicolytic or antidepressant action) and not by any non-anxiolytics. This rhythmicity is a key property of the Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) postulated to be one neural substrate of anxiety. We sought homologous anxiolytic-sensitive changes in human surface EEG rhythmicity. Method: Thirty-four healthy volunteers in parallel groups were administered double blind single doses of triazolam 0.25 mg, buspirone 10 mg or placebo 1 hour prior to completing the stop-signal task. Right frontal conflict-specific EEG power (previously shown to correlate with trait anxiety and neuroticism in this task) was extracted as a contrast between trials with balanced approach–avoidance (stop-go) conflict and the average of trials with net approach and net avoidance. Results: Compared with placebo, both triazolam and buspirone decreased right-frontal, 9–10 Hz, conflict-specific-power. Limitations: Only one dose of each of only two classes of anxiolytic and no non-anxiolytics were tested, so additional tests are needed to determine generality. Conclusions: There is a distinct rhythmic system in humans that is sensitive to both classical/GABAergic and novel/serotonergic anxiolytics. This conflict-specific rhythmicity should provide a biomarker, with a strong pre-clinical neuropsychology, for a novel approach to classifying anxiety disorders.

Bridging the gap for ethnic minority adult outpatients with depression and anxiety disorders by culturally adapted treatments,"Background: Culturally adapted guideline driven depression and anxiety treatments have been developed for ethnic minority patients in Western countries to boost effectiveness for these growing and vulnerable groups. The aims of this study are to systematically review the empirical literature of outcomes associated with culturally adapted guideline driven depression and anxiety interventions, to describe the cultural adaptation and to identify the contribution of the cultural adaptation and approach as such. Method: Comprehensive search of the major bibliographical databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Pubmed; Psychinfo) for randomized controlled trials. Results: Nine eligible studies were identified and all were conducted in the USA. The pooled random standardized differences in means of the culturally adapted depression and anxiety treatment on clinical outcome was 1.06 (CI 95% 0.51–1.62, P = 0.00). Two studies demonstrated effectiveness of the population specific cultural adaptation per se. All studies incorporated a focus on cultural values and beliefs as a cultural adaptation. Limitation: We only identified a small number of USA studies so generalisation of the findings to other western countries can be discussed. Conclusion: Culturally adapted guideline driven depression and anxiety treatment was effective for USA minority patients from different cultural backgrounds. There is some evidence for the effectiveness of the population specific cultural adaptation as such.

Prevalence of bipolar disorder in panic disorder patients in the Japanese population,"Background: We examined the rate of bipolar I (BPD-I) and bipolar II disorders (BPD-II) in panic disorder (PD) patients, and compared clinical and psychological variables between PD patients with and without bipolar disorders (BPD). Methods: Participants were 649 Japanese patients with PD (215 men and 434 women, 38.49 ± 10.40 years) at outpatient clinics for anxiety disorders. Constructive interviews using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) were conducted to confirm the diagnosis of PD, agoraphobia, and BPD, as well as the presence and severity of suicide risk in each subject. Clinical records were also reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of PD and BPD. Participants then completed several questionnaires, including the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait scale, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, and the Revised Neuroticism-Extraversion- Openness Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R). Results: We found that 22.34% of the PD patients had BPD (BPD-I: 5.24%, BPD-II: 17.10%). PD patients with BPD-I showed higher prevalence and severity of suicide risk, trait anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and neuroticism, and lower agreeableness (subscales of the NEO-PI-R) than those with BPD-II and those without BPD. Limitation: First, we could not investigate the order of the onset of PD and BPD. Second, BPD patients without PD were not studied as another control group for PD patients with BPD. Conclusion: PD patients had high prevalence of BPD. Both PD patients with BPD-I and those with BPD-II had high severity of suicide risk, trait anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, neuroticism, and agreeableness, though these characteristics were more prominent in patients with BPD-I.

"Polysomnographic sleep patterns of non-depressed, non-medicated children with generalized anxiety disorder","Background: Polysomnographic (PSG) studies of children with psychiatric illness have primarily focused on depressed samples. Children with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) report high rates of sleep problems yet investigation of objective sleep patterns in non-depressed children with GAD are unavailable. Identification of unique clinical features linking early GAD with sleep disturbance, including possible HPA activation during the pre-sleep period, is needed to inform effective treatments. Method: Thirty non-medicated, pre-pubescent children (ages 7–11 years) were assessed including 15 children with GAD and 15 matched healthy controls. Anxious children had GAD as their primary diagnosis and did not meet criteria for secondary mood disorders. All participants underwent structured diagnostic assessment and laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG). State anxiety and salivary cortisol were assessed prior to light out on the PSG night. Results: Children with GAD showed significantly increased sleep onset latency and reduced latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep compared to controls. Marginal differences in the form of reduced sleep efficiency and increased total REM sleep also were found in the GAD group. Pre-sleep anxiety and cortisol levels did not differ between the two groups. Limitations: A small sample size, time-limited assessment of cortisol, and possible first night effects should be considered. Conclusions: Results of this study provide initial evidence of PSG-based differences in children with GAD compared to controls. Follow-up studies are needed to explore the course of sleep alterations and whether targeting sleep problems early in the course of GAD might improve clinical outcomes.

"Psychosocial work factors, major depressive and generalised anxiety disorders: Results from the french national sip study","Background: Anxiety and depression are prevalent mental disorders in working populations. The risk factors of these disorders are not completely well known. Developing knowledge on occupational risk factors for mental disorders appears crucial. This study investigates the association between various classical and emergent psychosocial work factors and major depressive and generalised anxiety disorders in the French working population. Methods: The study was based on a national random sample of 3765 men and 3944 women of the French working population (SIP 2006 survey). Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) were measured using a standardised diagnostic interview (MINI). Occupational factors included psychosocial work factors as well as biomechanical, physical, and chemical exposures. Adjustment variables included age, occupation, marital status, social support, and life events. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis. Results: Low decision latitude, overcommitment, and emotional demands were found to be risk factors for both MDD–GAD among both genders. Other risk factors were observed: high psychological demands, low reward, ethical conflict, and job insecurity, but differences were found according to gender and outcome. Significant interaction terms were observed suggesting that low decision latitude, high psychological demands, and job insecurity had stronger effects on mental disorders for men than for women. Limitations: Given the cross-sectional study design, no causal conclusion could be drawn. Conclusions: This study showed significant associations between classical and emergent psychosocial work factors and MDD–GAD. Preventive actions targeting various psychosocial work factors, including emergent factors, may help to reduce mental disorders at the workplace.

Quantitative Heel Ultrasound (QUS) measures of bone quality in association with mood and anxiety disorders,"Background: The common mental disorders are potential risk factors for low bone mass as a result of disease and/or medication-related processes. Quantitative heel ultrasound (QUS) is a portable and relatively cheap screening tool for determining fracture risk. Thus, we investigated the association between QUS parameters, mood and anxiety disorders in a population-based sample of 745 men and 897 women. Methods: Using a clinical interview (SCID-I/NP), mood and anxiety disorders were identified. Bone quality was established using QUS and included the following parameters: Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation (BUA), Speed of Sound (SOS) and Stiffness Index (SI). Anthropometry, socio-economic status (SES), medication use and lifestyle factors were determined. Results: In men, mood and anxiety disorders were associated with lower age–weight- and smoking-adjusted SOS, BUA and SI. In women, age was an effect modifier. Among younger women (≤40 yr), mood disorders were associated with lower age–weight- and smoking-adjusted SOS and SI but not BUA. No differences were detected in older women or women with anxiety disorders. These patterns persisted after adjustment for activity, alcohol, calcium intake, SES and medications. Limitations: Cross-sectional study design, and possible residual or unrecognised confounding. Conclusion: Our data suggest that bone quality, as measured by QUS, is reduced among men and younger women with a history of mood disorders. Furthermore, an inverse association between anxiety disorders and bone quality was evident for men. Thus, QUS may be a useful screening tool for determining fracture risk within these populations.

Decreased hypothalamus volumes in generalized anxiety disorder but not in panic disorder,"Background: The hypothalamus is a brain structure involved in the neuroendocrine aspect of stress and anxiety. Evidence suggests that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD) might be accompanied by dysfunction of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), but so far structural alterations were not studied. We investigated hypothalamic volumes in patients with either GAD or PD and in healthy controls. Methods: Twelve GAD patients, 11 PD patients and 21 healthy controls underwent a 1.5T MRI scan. Hypothalamus volumes were manually traced by a rater blind to subjects’ identity. General linear model for repeated measures (GLM-RM) was used to compare groups on hypothalamic volumes, controlling for total intracranial volume, age and sex. Results: The hypothalamus volume was significantly reduced ( p = 0.04) in GAD patients, with significant reductions in both the left ( p = 0.02) and right side ( p = 0.04). Patients with PD did not differ significantly ( p = 0.73). Anxiety scores were inversely correlated with hypothalamic volumes. Limitations: The small sample size could reduce the generalizability of the results while the lack of stress hormone measurements renders functional assessment of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis not feasible. Conclusions: The present study showed decreased hypothalamic volumes in GAD patients but not in those with PD. Future longitudinal studies should combine volumetric data with measurements of stress hormones to better elucidate the role of the HPA axis in GAD.

Are childhood and adult life adversities differentially associated with specific symptom dimensions of depression and anxiety? Testing the tripartite model,"Background: Different types of adverse events may have general or specific effects on depression and anxiety symptomatology. We examined the effects of adversities on the dimensions of the tripartite model: general distress, anhedonic depression and anxious arousal. Methods: Data were from 2615 individuals from the Netherlands Study for Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), with or without depressive or anxiety disorders. We analysed associations of childhood trauma, childhood life events (childhood trauma interview), and recent life events (List of Threatening Events Questionnaire, LTE-Q) with anhedonic depression, anxious arousal, and general distress (assessed by the adapted Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire, MASQ-D30). Results: We controlled for co-occurrence of adversities. Regarding childhood trauma, only emotional neglect was associated with all three symptom dimensions. Psychological and sexual abuse were associated with general distress and anxious arousal, whereas physical abuse was associated only with anxious arousal. Particularly strong associations were seen for emotional neglect with anhedonic depression and for sexual abuse with anxious arousal. Childhood life events showed no associations with symptom dimensions. The recent life events ‘Serious problems with friend’, ‘Serious financial problems’, and ‘Becoming unemployed’ were associated with all three dimensions. The recent life event ‘death of parent/child/sibling’ was associated with anxious arousal. Several associations remained significant when controlled for current diagnosis of depression or anxiety. Limitations: Our cross-sectional analyses do not allow for causal interpretation. Conclusions: Distinct childhood traumas had different effects on the symptom dimensions, whereas most recent adult life events were associated with all three symptom dimensions. Our observations help to understand the often reported associations of these adversities with depressive and anxiety symptomatology. In addition, symptom dimensions of the tripartite model were shown to capture effects of adverse events on top of those captured by diagnostic categories.

The association between lower birth weight and comorbid generalised anxiety and major depressive disorder,"Objective: Studies testing the association between birth weight and depression or anxiety have found inconsistent results and there has been a lack of research on the possible relationship between birth weight and comorbid anxiety and depression. We tested for an association between lower birth weight and major depression, generalised anxiety and comorbid generalised anxiety and major depression. Method: Data was taken from 2113 mothers and their offspring participating in the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP) birth cohort. Generalised anxiety, major depression and comorbid generalised anxiety and major depression at 21 years were tested for associations with birth weight using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Lower birth weight was found to predict comorbid generalised anxiety and major depression, but did not predict either generalised anxiety or major depression. Limitations: We were unable to specify comorbidity by the primary disorder, or by the severity or recurrence of the depression. Conclusion: Previous associations found between birth weight and mental health may reflect a specific link between lower birth weight and comorbid generalised anxiety and major depressive disorders. As neither disorder individually was associated with lower birth weight, this may suggest that this developmental origin represents a unique risk pathway to comorbidity not shared with either discrete disorder.

Using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale to screen for anxiety disorders: Conceptual and methodological considerations,"Background: Perinatal anxiety symptoms and disorders are prevalent and disabling but have not to date been a focus for specific clinical and public health attention. The EPDS is widely used to detect probable depression, and many studies have also found that three items from this scale load on an anxiety factor, in both the antenatal and postnatal periods. In addition, studies have found clinically significant correlations between the EPDS and various anxiety-specific measures in the perinatal period. The aim of this paper is to examine studies which address the capacity of the EPDS to detect anxiety disorders, to assess whether the EPDS performs differently in women with depressive or anxiety disorders and to consider the implications for future research and clinical practice. Methods: The English-language perinatal mental health literature was searched. Six studies with data pertaining to the capacity of the EPDS to detect perinatal anxiety disorders in women were identified. These studies provide information on i) comparison of total EPDS score by diagnoses of anxiety and depression and ii) comparison of the anxiety subscale score (EPDS-3A) by diagnoses of anxiety and depression. Results: There is evidence from both sets of information that the EPDS is useful for screening for anxiety in women and emerging evidence that Total EPDS and EPDS-3A can distinguish depression from anxiety reliably. Limitations: The findings are based on a small number of studies, conducted in a variety of clinical and community settings in different languages and countries, and with variable sample sizes, some of which lack power to ensure reliable conclusions. Conclusions: The EPDS appears to detect perinatal anxiety disorders, but further research is required to establish the clinical and public health value of the EPDS for this purpose, and whether it has more robust psychometric properties or is more feasible and acceptable than existing anxiety-specific measures.

Sensitivity to depression or anxiety and subclinical cardiovascular disease,"Background: Depressive and anxiety disorders are highly overlapping, heterogeneous conditions that both have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cognitive vulnerability traits for these disorders could help to specify what exactly drives CVD risk in depressed and anxious subjects. Our aim is to examine sensitivity to depression or anxiety in association with indicators of subclinical CVD. Methods: Data from 635 participants (aged 20–66 years) of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were analyzed. Depression sensitivity was measured by the revised Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity. Anxiety sensitivity was measured by the Anxiety Sensitivity Index. Subclinical CVD was measured as (1) carotid intima-media thickness and plaque presence using B-mode ultrasonography and (2) central arterial stiffness (augmentation index) using calibrated radial applanation tonometry. Results: After adjustment for sociodemographics, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol, higher scores of anxiety sensitivity were associated with both increased likelihood of carotid plaques (OR per SD increase = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.06–1.68) and increased arterial stiffness (β = .06, p = .01). No significant associations were found with carotid intima-media thickness nor for depression sensitivity. Limitations: The cross-sectional design precludes causal inference. Current mood state could have influenced the self-reported sensitivity data. Conclusions: The presence of carotid plaques and central arterial stiffness was especially increased in subjects who tend to be highly fearful of anxiety-related symptoms. These observations suggest that vulnerability to anxiety, rather than to depression, represents a correlate of subclinical CVD.

Chronic fatigue and affective disorders in older adults: Evidence from the 2007 British National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey,"Background: Although chronic fatigue is common in old age, the association between chronic fatigue and common affective disorders is largely unknown. Aims: To fill this research gap, the present study aims to determine the relationship between chronic fatigue and common psychiatric disorders among older adults aged 65 and older. Method: A national representative sample of 1793 England community-dwelling respondents aged 65 and above was assessed in the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS) using the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule to measure chronic fatigue and common psychiatric disorders. Demographic characteristics, medical conditions, and four health-related variables based on the Short Form 12 were also measured. Results: The prevalence of chronic fatigue was 18.6%. Bivariate analyses revealed that chronic fatigue was more common among women and non-white ethnicities. In addition, chronic fatigue was significantly related to depression, mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder after adjusting for demographic variables, medical conditions, and four other health-related variables. Conclusion: The prevalence rate of chronic fatigue in our sample is higher than a previous study. The psychiatric comorbidity of chronic fatigue supports the notion that chronic fatigue has a strong impact on quality of life in old age.

The impact of probable anxiety and mood disorder on self-reported collisions: A population study,"Background: Individuals diagnosed with psychiatric disorder are at significantly increased risk of death and serious injury, to which motor vehicle collisions may be important contributors. This study examined the association between probable anxiety or mood disorder (AMD) and self-reported collision risk in a large representative sample of the adult population in Ontario. Methods: Based on data from a regionally stratified general-population telephone survey of adults conducted from 2002 through 2009 (N=12,830), a logistic regression analysis examined self-reported collision involvement in the previous 12 months by measures of demographic characteristics, driving exposure, impaired driving behaviour, and probable AMD. Results: Controlling for demographic variables and potential confounders, probable AMD was associated with an increased risk of collision involvement ( OR =1.78, 95% CI =1.37, 2.31). Limitations: The use of self-report measures and the potential for bias created by groups excluded because they do not have access to landline telephones represent limitations to the current findings. Nevertheless, the benefits of a large sample derived from general population survey data far outweigh these limitations. Conclusions: The results suggest that the increased risk of injury and mortality associated with some psychiatric disorders is at least partially related to increased risk of collision involvement. The magnitude of the increase in risk associated with probable AMD is similar to that seen among individuals who drive after drinking or using cannabis. In view of these findings, more work to understand this risk among individuals experiencing probable AMD and how it can be avoided is necessary.

Comorbidity of personality disorders in anxiety disorders: A meta-analysis of 30 years of research,"Background: A comprehensive meta-analysis to identify the proportions of comorbid personality disorders (PD) across the major subtypes of anxiety disorders (AD) has not previously been published. Methods: A literature search identified 125 empirical papers from the period 1980–2010 on patients with panic disorders, social phobia, generalised anxiety, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several moderators were coded. Results: The rate of any comorbid PD was high across all ADs, ranging from .35 for PTSD to .52 for OCD. Cluster C PDs occurred more than twice as often as cluster A or B PDs. Within cluster C the avoidant PD occurred most frequently, followed by the obsessive-compulsive and the dependent PD. PTSD showed the most heterogeneous clinical picture and social phobia was highly comorbid with avoidant PD. A range of moderators were examined, but most were non-significant or of small effects, except an early age of onset, which in social phobia increased the risk of an avoidant PD considerably. Gender or duration of an AD was not related to variation in PD comorbidity. Limitations: Blind rating of diagnoses was recorded from the papers as an indication of diagnostic validity. However, as too few studies reported it the validity of the comorbid estimates of PD was less strong. Conclusions: The findings provided support to several of the proposed changes in the forthcoming DSM-5. Further comorbidity studies are needed in view of the substantial changes in how PDs will be diagnosed in the DSM-5.

Angiotensin-(1–7) central administration induces anxiolytic-like effects in elevated plus maze and decreased oxidative stress in the amygdala,"There is increasing evidence that besides the well-known angiotensin (Ang) II, other renin–angiotensin system (RAS) peptides, including Ang-(1–7), could have important effects at the central level. However, very few things are known about the central actions of Ang-(1–7), while the effects of its administration alone on anxiety have not been tested to date, to the best of our knowledge. In this way, we were interested in studying the effects of Ang-(1–7) intracerebroventricular administration on anxiety levels, as studied through some main behavioral parameters in the elevated plus maze, as well as the importance of Ang-(1–7) in the oxidative stress status from the amygdala, which is one of the key brain regions involved in mediating anxiety. We report here a possible anxiolytic-like effect of Ang-(1–7) administration, as demonstrated by the increased percentage of time spent and frequency of entries in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, as well as increased head-dipping behavior in the open arms and decreased stretching in closed arms. Also some antioxidant effects of Ang-(1–7) are suggested since a significant increase of GPX specific activity and a decrease of the main peroxidation marker MDA were observed in the amygdala. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between most of the behavioral parameters in the elevated plus maze and the levels of the oxidative stress markers. However, further studies are necessary in order to elucidate the effects of Ang-(1–7) administration on anxiety and oxidative stress status and also on the possible correlation that might exists between these aspects.

Is coping well a matter of personality? A study of euthymic unipolar and bipolar patients,"Background: Euthymic bipolar disorder (BD) patients often demonstrate better clinical outcomes than remitted patients with unipolar illness (UP). Reasons for this are uncertain, however, personality and coping styles are each likely to play a key role. This study examined differences between euthymic BD and UP patients with respect to the inter-relationship between personality, coping style, and clinical outcomes. Methods: A total of 96 UP and 77 BD euthymic patients were recruited through the CADE Clinic, Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, and assessed by a team comprising Psychiatrists and Psychologists. They underwent a structured clinical diagnostic interview, and completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, stress, personality, coping, social adjustment, self-esteem, dysfunctional attitudes, and fear of negative evaluation. Results: Compared to UP, BD patients reported significantly higher scores on levels of extraversion, adaptive coping, self-esteem, and lower scores on trait anxiety and fear of negative evaluation. Extraversion correlated positively with self-esteem, adaptive coping styles, and negatively with trait anxiety and fear of negative evaluation. Trait anxiety and fear of negative evaluation correlated positively with eachother, and both correlated negatively with self-esteem and adaptive coping styles. Finally, self-esteem correlated positively with adaptive coping styles. Limitations: The results cannot be generalised to depressive states of BD and UP, as differences in the course of illness and types of depression are likely to impact on coping and clinical outcomes, particularly for BD. Conclusions: During remission, functioning is perhaps better ‘preserved’ in BD than in UP, possibly because of the protective role of extraversion which drives healthier coping styles.

"Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of quetiapine XR and divalproex ER monotherapies in the treatment of the anxious bipolar patient","Background: Anxiety disorders complicate the treatment of bipolar disorder but are seldom the focus of bipolar treatment studies. Methods: The anxiolytic effect of quetiapine XR 50–300mg/day compared to divalproex ER (500–3000mg/day) was tested in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in 149 patients with bipolar disorder and a co-occurring panic disorder or GAD. The primary efficacy measure was the Clinician Global Improvement-21 Anxiety Scale (CGI-21). Secondary measures included the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and Sheehan Panic Disorder Scale (SPS). Results: Repeated measures last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) analyses of variance demonstrated significant treatment-by-time interaction effects on 3 of the 4 anxiety measures. Quetiapine XR at a mean endpoint dose of 186mg/day produced rapid sustained improvements relative to baseline, divalproex ER and placebo on anxiety. Mean baseline-to-endpoint improvement was significantly greater for quetiapine XR compared to divalproex ER and placebo on the HAM-A and SPS. Both active medications were well tolerated, but weight gain was higher on quetiapine XR. Limitations: The study was limited to 8 weeks and to patients with bipolar disorder and comorbid panic disorder or GAD. The results may not be applicable to quetiapine XR as an add-on treatment to mood stabilizers or to bipolar disorder comorbid with other anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Quetiapine XR in a dose range of 50–300mg/day appears to reduce anxiety in bipolar patients with comorbid panic disorder or GAD treated for 8 weeks. The efficacy of other second-generation antipsychotics and mood stabilizers in patients with bipolar disorder and a co-occurring anxiety disorder should be investigated in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

Clinical correlates of irritable mood,"Background: This study describes the relationship of irritable mood (IRR) with affective disorders in youths with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: Five hundred ADHD subjects were assessed with the childhood version of the Schedule for Affective Disorder &amp; Schizophrenia. Subjects were in a genetic ADHD protocol and limited to those of Caucasian/European descent. Results: The most prevalent concurrent diagnoses were oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) (43.6%), minor depression/dysthymic disorder (MDDD) (18.8%), and generalized anxiety (13.2%)/overanxious disorder (12.4%). IRR subjects (21.0%) compared to the non-IRR (NIRR) group had higher rates of all affective disorders (76.2% vs. 9.6%) and ODD (83.8% vs. 32.9%) but lower rates of hyperactive ADHD (1.9% vs. 8.9%). Among those without comorbidities, 98.3% were NIRR. Logistic regression found IRR mood significantly associated with major depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR]: 33.4), MDDD (OR: 11.2), ODD (OR: 11.6), and combined ADHD (OR: 1.7) but not with anxiety disorders. Among symptoms, it associated IRR mood with a pattern of dysthymic and ODD symptoms but with fewer separation anxiety symptoms. Diagnostic and symptomatic parameters were unaffected by demographic variables. Limitations: Potential confounders influencing these results include patient recruitment from only one clinical service; a cohort specific sample effect because some presumed affective disorders and non-Caucasians were excluded; and the young mean age (10.2 years) limiting comorbid patterns. Conclusions: The prominence of an MDDD pattern suggests this IRR group is appropriate in the DSM V's proposed chronic depressive disorder, possibly with or without temper dysregulation. A new diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder may be unwarranted.

Prevalence of depression and anxiety in older users of formal Dutch intellectual disability services,"Background: Little is known about the prevalence of depression and anxiety among older people with intellectual disabilities (ID). Therefore, the aim of this study was to study the prevalence of depression and anxiety in this population. Method: This study is a cross-sectional epidemiologic multicentre study which was part of the ""Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disabilities"" study. The study population consisted of 990 participants aged ≥50 years with borderline to profound ID which were screened with self-report and informant-report instruments; 290 of them were assessed with a standardized diagnostic interview. Results: Depressive symptoms were prevalent in 16.8% (95% CI: 14.4–19.1) and significantly associated with higher age. Anxiety symptoms were prevalent in 16.3% (95% CI: 14.0–18.6) and significantly associated with female gender and borderline to mild ID. Major depressive disorder was prevalent in 7.6% (95% CI: 5.2–11.0), anxiety disorders in 4.4% (95% CI: 2.6–7.0) and both in 0.7% (95% CI: 0.2–1.6). There was no relationship with gender, age or level of ID. Limitations: For most participants, informant-report instruments have been used instead of self-report to overcome communication difficulties or inabilities. Also, a standardized psychiatric diagnostic interview has been used instead of psychiatric diagnoses made by an experienced psychiatrist. Conclusion: Prevalence of major depressive disorder is higher and of anxiety disorders lower than in the Dutch general older community-dwelling population.

Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 gene polymorphisms and poststroke anxiety disorders,"Background: Anxiety is common in stroke survivors and may adversely affect recovery. Polymorphisms of tryptophan hydroxylase2 (THP2) gene have been shown to be associated with anxiety disorders and other affective disorders. This study was aimed to investigate the association of two polymorphisms of THP2 gene, rs4570625 and rs4565946, with poststroke anxiety disorders in a Han Chinese population. Methods: This case control study included 112 poststroke anxiety patients and 246 non-anxious controls. All participants completed Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and DNA was extracted from blood and genotyped for the two polymorphisms of THP2 gene. Results: Results revealed that the G allele of rs4570625 was associated with the increased risk of poststroke anxiety. In the female subgroup, both the GG genotype and G allele were observed to be significantly higher in case than in control. No significant difference in genotype and allele frequencies of the rs4565946 was found between case and control. Haplotype analysis identified that patients with the G-C haplotype had significantly increased the risk of poststroke anxiety. Limitations: More than 20 TPH2 polymorphisms have been detected, some of which are tightly-linked and may function together, only two SNPs of TPH2 were investigated in this study. Conclusions: The findings suggest that these polymorphisms in TPH2 gene are involved in development of poststroke anxiety in the Han Chinese population.

The role of impulsivity in the relationship between anxiety and suicidal ideation,"Background: The purpose of the present study was to examine the degree to which trait and cognitive (looming cognitive style) measures of anxiety are associated with suicidal ideation (SI), as well as whether trait and cognitive (time misperception) measures of impulsivity moderate the association between these variables. Methods: The sample included 100 undergraduate students (72% female) who completed the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Looming Maladaptive Style Questionnaire, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Time Paradigm Version 1.0 Task, Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and the Brief Symptom Inventory. Results: Trait anxiety and looming cognitive style were found to be positively associated with SI. Further, both trait impulsivity and time misperception moderated the association between these variables and SI, but in a different manner. Consistent with study hypotheses, among those high in trait anxiety, greater overestimation of time was associated with a higher likelihood of SI. Contrary to study hypotheses, among those low in trait anxiety, high trait impulsivity was associated with a greater likelihood of SI. The same pattern of results was found when looming cognitive style served as the independent variable. Limitations: The use of a cross-sectional design limits the ability to determine the temporal relationship of the study variables. Further, the sample included predominantly Caucasian undergraduates and thus study results may not generalize to other populations. Conclusions: Clinically, results suggest that high trait anxiety, looming cognitive style, time misperception, and trait impulsivity may be important risk factors for SI among college students and thus should be assessed when students present for treatment. Treatments that focus on problem solving, cognitive restructuring, and affect regulation strategies may help decrease anxiety and impulsivity, which in turn may help reduce the likelihood of suicidal thoughts.

The relationship between adult separation anxiety disorder and complicated grief in a cohort of 454 outpatients with mood and anxiety disorders,"Background: Recent epidemiological studies indicate that separation anxiety disorder occurs more frequently in adults than children. Data from literature suggest that Adult Separation Anxiety Disorder (ASAD) may develop after a bereavement or threat of loss. Research has demonstrated that bereaved persons may present a clinically significant grief reaction, defined as Complicated Grief (CG) that causes a severe impairment in the quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between ASAD and CG in a large cohort of outpatients with mood and anxiety disorders. Methods: Study participants comprised 454 adult psychiatric outpatients with DSM-IV mood or anxiety disorders diagnoses. Diagnostic assessments were performed using the SCID-I; ASAD was assessed using an adapted version of the Structured Clinical Interview for Separation Anxiety Symptoms (SCI-SAS-adult). Complicated grief symptoms were assessed by the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG). Social and work impairments were evaluated using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Adult attachment styles were assessed by the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ). Results: The overall frequency of ASAD in our sample was 43% and that of CG was 23%. Individuals with CG had a greater frequency of ASAD (56%) with respect to those without CG (40%). Subjects with CG plus ASAD reported higher scores on ICG and greater impairment on quality of life, as measured with SDS, than CG patients without ASAD. Conclusions: Adult separation anxiety disorder occurs in a high proportion of adult psychiatric outpatients with complicated grief. The association between these two conditions should be further investigated in light of their clinical implications.

"Depression, anxiety and cardiovascular disease: Which symptoms are associated with increased risk in community dwelling older adults?","Background: Depression is a risk factor for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). It has been reported that somatic symptoms of depression and not cognitive symptoms are associated with increased risk although findings have been inconsistent. Few studies have examined whether co-morbid anxiety confers additive risk. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional analysis of 7872 community dwelling adults aged 50 years and over from The Irish LongituDinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale and the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A), respectively. We conducted logistic regression analyses to determine the relationship between depression, anxiety, individual depressive symptoms and CVD. We further determined whether co-morbid anxiety was associated with increased risk. Results: Seven hundred and thirty eight (9.4%) study participants reported clinically significant depression. Depression was associated with 80% increased risk of CVD following adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Individual depressive symptoms most consistently associated with CVD included low mood, sadness, amotivation, fatigue, diminished appetite and concentration difficulties. Anxiety was associated with increased risk of CVD but did not confer additive risk in participants with depression. Limitations: Cross sectional design. Conclusion: Core symptoms of depression, which are both cognitive and somatic in nature, are associated with increased risk of CVD while co-morbid anxiety did not confer additive risk. It is important that clinicians give due regard both to both cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression when determining cardiovascular risk. Future longitudinal investigation should confirm these findings and explore potential pathological mechanisms.

State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores during pregnancy following intervention with complementary therapies,"Objective: We review intervention trials that have used the State–Trait Anxiety inventory (STAI) as a measure of maternal anxiety in pregnancy in order to provide ranges in scores before and after participation in complementary therapy-based interventions to highlight the expected ranges of scores in pregnancy and determine whether anxiety in pregnancy is amenable to change when measured by the STAI. Methods: Combinations of the key words ""STAI"", ""state anxiety"", ""pregnancy"", ""anxiety"", ""maternal"", ""stress"", ""outcome"" and ""intervention"" were used to search publications between January 1970 and January 2011. Studies eligible for inclusion recruited low risk, adult women to a non-pharmacological intervention or a comparator group, and measured anxiety at baseline and post-intervention. Results: Ten studies were eligible. Scores were routinely high compared to expected ranges in non-pregnant populations. Studies examining the immediate effects of an intervention consistently reported significantly lowered STAI scores after a single session. Likewise, studies examining the effect of interventions consisting of multiple sessions over the course of pregnancy found that those in the intervention group were more likely to show an improvement in STAI scores. Limitations: Heterogeneity in type and duration of intervention prevent drawing conclusions on which were most effective in reducing anxiety. Conclusion: Scores on the STAI appear amenable to change during pregnancy, both after a single session and multiple sessions of interventions designed to reduce maternal anxiety. This review offers a guideline for the expected range of scores for future studies examining the efficacy of interventions in pregnancy when using the STAI.

Do antidepressants change personality?—A five-year observational study,"Background: Whether antidepressants influence personality is a major clinical and societal issue due to their widespread use. In an observational study, we investigated whether depressive patients' neuroticism and extraversion scores covary with antidepressant pharmacotherapy, and if so, whether this remains significant after accounting for depressive or anxiety symptoms. Methods: Major depressive disorder patients ( N = 237) were interviewed at up to four time-points in a five-year prospective longitudinal study. Changes in neuroticism plus extraversion scores were compared with changes in antidepressant pharmacotherapies and depressive plus anxiety symptoms to uncover any covariation between them. Autoregressive path models were used to examine this covariation at the sample level. Within-subject change was estimated using a random-effects latent change model. Results: Significant covariation is present in the change trajectories between personality scores and depressive symptoms; declining depression scores were associated with rising extraversion and declining neuroticism. Although the personality scores of many patients changed significantly over the five-year study, none of these changes were associated with changes in antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Limitations: The study covered only two dimensions of personality. Single drug-specific analysis could not be done. Antidepressant blood levels were not measured. Conclusion: No evidence emerged for significant covariation of antidepressant pharmacotherapy with neuroticism or extraversion scores. By contrast, changes in both personality dimensions were associated with changes in depressive symptoms, those in neuroticism also in anxiety symptoms. If antidepressants influence these personality dimensions, the effect size is likely markedly smaller than that of the disorders for which they are prescribed.

"Does the stress generation hypothesis apply to eating disorders?: An examination of stress generation in eating, depressive, and anxiety symptoms","Background: The stress generation hypothesis posits that individuals actively contribute to stress in their lives. Although stress generation has been studied frequently in the context of depression, few studies have examined whether this stress generation process is unique to depression or whether it occurs in other disorders. Although evidence suggests that stress contributes to the development of eating disorders, it is unclear whether eating disorders contribute to subsequent stress. Methods: A prospective design was used to examine the influence of eating disorder symptoms on negative life stressors. Two hundred and ninety female undergraduates completed questionnaires at two time points that examined eating disorder, depressive and anxiety symptoms and the presence of negative life events. Results: Regression analyses found that while eating disorder symptoms (i.e. bulimic symptoms and drive for thinness) were independent, significant predictors of negative life events, they did not predict negative life events above and beyond symptoms of depression. Limitations: Limitations include the use of self-report measures and a college-based sample, which may limit generalizability of the results. Conclusions: Findings suggest that if stress generation is present in individuals with symptoms of eating disorders, it is likely attributable to symptoms of depression. Thus, it may be important for clinicians to target depressive symptoms in order to reduce the frequency of negative life stressors among individuals with eating disorders.

Longitudinal risk profiling for suicidal thoughts and behaviours in a community cohort using decision trees,"Background: While associations between specific risk factors and subsequent suicidal thoughts or behaviours have been widely examined, there is limited understanding of the interplay between risk factors in the development of suicide risk. This study used a decision tree approach to develop individual models of suicide risk and identify the risk factors for suicidality that are important for different subpopulations. Methods: In a population cohort of 6656 Australian adults, the study examined whether measures of mental health, physical health, personality, substance use, social support, social stressors and background characteristics were associated with suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours after four-year follow-up. Results: Previous suicidality, anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, neuroticism and rumination were the strongest predictors of suicidal ideation and behaviour after four years. However, divergent factors were predictive of suicidal thoughts and behaviours across the spectrum of mental health. In particular, substance use was only associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviours in those with moderate levels of anxiety or depression. Limitations: Most of the measurements were based on self-report. Further research is required to assess whether changes in risk factors lead to changes in suicidality. Conclusions: Examining suicide risk factors using decision trees is a promising approach for developing individualised assessments of suicide risk and tailored intervention programs.

"Predicting outcomes of mood, anxiety and somatoform disorders: The Leiden routine outcome monitoring study","Background: Mood, anxiety and somatoform (MAS) disorders are highly prevalent disorders with substantial mutual comorbidity and a large disease burden. Early identification of patients at risk for poor outcome in routine clinical practice is of clinical importance. The purpose of this study was to predict outcomes in outpatients with MAS disorders using routine outcome monitoring (ROM) data. Methods: We conducted a cohort study of 892 adult MAS patients in a naturalistic outpatient psychiatric specialty care setting and validated our results in a replication cohort of 1392 patients. Poor outcome was defined as a &lt; 50% reduction (compared to baseline) on the self-report brief symptom inventory (BSI) or a score of ≥ 3 on the observer-rated clinical global impression severity scale (CGI-S). During a follow-up of up to 2 years, Cox regression models were used to analyze the independent baseline predictors for poor outcome. Results: In multivariable Cox regression models, independent and replicated predictors for poor outcome were higher age (overall p &lt; 0.001 for combined cohorts in multivariable Cox regression model), having comorbid MAS disorders or a somatoform disorder (&lt; 0.001), dysfunctional personality traits (i.e., tendency to self-harm [ p &lt; 0.001], intimacy problems [ p &lt; 0.001] and affective lability [ p &lt; 0.001]), and a low reported general health status ( p &lt; 0.001). Limitations: Detailed treatment information was not available. Conclusions: MAS patients meeting the profile of being elderly, suffering from comorbid MAS disorders or a somatoform disorder, with cluster B personality traits, and a poor reported general health may need special preventive measures to minimise the risk of poor outcome.

Repeat testing on the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the HADS-A in pregnancy: Differentiating between transient and enduring distress,"Background: The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS/EPDS) is routinely used in many clinical services to screen for probable distress in antenatal and postnatal women. Typically a single administration of this scale results in a referral to a specialist mental health service if the woman scores above the service's cut-off score on the measure—that is, scores ‘high’. A few postnatal studies have shown, however, that many women when re-tested just a few weeks later no longer score ‘high’. This study explored this phenomenon in a sample of pregnant women, using both the EDS and an anxiety self-report measure (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale—Anxiety subscale: HADS-A). Method: 164 English-speaking pregnant women attending a local public hospital's antenatal clinic for their first appointment participated. At this appointment they completed the EDS and the HADS-A, and predicted how they might be feeling in about two-week time. Approximately two weeks later they were interviewed by phone and again completed the EDS and the HADS-A, and answered questions about possible mood changes. Results: Regardless of which of several cut-off scores on the EDS or HADS-A was used to define ‘high’ scorers, approximately 50% (±6%) of women scoring high at their first appointment on either measure no longer scored ‘high’ two weeks later. Common reasons given for their mood improvement included reduced morning sickness, reassuring results from routine tests (e.g., ultrasounds), fear of miscarriage subsiding, and a sense of reassurance following their hospital visit.Many of the women were accurate in predicting at their first appointment that they would be feeling better within a few weeks. Limitations: The administration procedure for completion of the measures on the two occasions was different. Women initially completed the measures by hand, and on the second occasion over the phone. Conclusion: Half the women screened as having emotional distress—that is, scoring ‘high’ on self-report mood measures (i.e., EDS and HADS-A)—during their first hospital visit in pregnancy are likely to have transient distress for predictable reasons. Referring women to specialist mental health services based upon just one administration of these measures will therefore result in a large number of unnecessary referrals, thus possibly overstretching the resources available. We therefore believe that when women score high on a self-report mood measure, enquiring as to why this is the case, and about whether the woman expects to feel differently in a few weeks time, together with a second administration of the measures in a few weeks is a better practice, unless there are good clinical reasons to do otherwise. In addition, studies reporting prevalence rates of perinatal distress should not simply use a one-off administration of a self-report mood scale to state the probable rate of disorders or distress.

Prediction of the outcome of short- and long-term psychotherapy based on socio-demographic factors,"Background: Socio-demographic factors predict the outcome of short-term psychotherapy (STT) in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, but information on the prediction for long long-term therapy (LPP) is lacking. We aimed to compare the prediction of changes in psychiatric symptoms afforded by socio-demographic factors across two treatment conditions, short- versus long-term psychotherapy. Methods: In the Helsinki Psychotherapy Study, 326 outpatients with mood or anxiety disorders, aged 20–46 years, were randomly assigned to STT or LPP. Socio-demographic factors (i.e. age, gender, education, employment status, marital status, and living arrangement) were self-reported. Psychiatric symptoms were measured by the Symptom Check List, Global Severity Index (SCL-90-GSI) and Anxiety scale (SCL-90-Anx), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at baseline and seven times during a three-year follow-up period. Results: Socio-demographic factors were found to predict symptom development during follow-up irrespective of the baseline symptom level. Patients in a relatively good position, i.e. married and highly educated patients benefited from STT, whereas patients in less advantaged positions, i.e. homemakers, lone parents, and divorced patients needed LPP or did not benefit from either therapy. In several categories of socio-demographic factors, the extent to which a patient's background predicted the outcome of the psychotherapy varied according to whether general, anxiety or depressive symptoms were studied. Limitations: We were unable to assess widows and pensioners. For ethical reasons, a no-treatment control group with a long follow-up could not be included in the study design. Conclusions: Socio-demographic factors may need to be considered in the selection of patients for short- and long-term therapy.

"Anxiety and depression after cancer diagnosis: Prevalence rates by cancer type, gender, and age","Background: Reported prevalence of emotional distress in cancer patients varies widely across studies. The present study determined prevalence of anxiety and depression (separated for presence of symptoms versus clinical levels) in a large, representative sample of cancer patients after diagnosis. Method: During the years 2004–2009, 10,153 consecutive patients were routinely screened with the Psychosocial Screen for Cancer questionnaire at two major cancer centers. Results: Patients' mean age was 59 years and 45% were men. Across cancer types, 19.0% of patients showed clinical levels of anxiety and another 22.6% had subclinical symptoms. Further, 12.9% of patients reported clinical symptoms of depression and an additional 16.5% described subclinical symptoms. Analyses by cancer type revealed significant differences such that patients with lung, gynecological, or hematological cancer reported the highest levels of distress at the time point of cancer diagnosis. As expected, women showed higher rates of anxiety and depression, and for some cancer types the prevalence was two to three times higher than that seen for men. In some cancer types emotional distress was inversely related to age. Patients younger than 50 and women across all cancer types revealed either subclinical or clinical levels of anxiety in over 50% of cases. Limitations: Findings describe levels of emotional distress after diagnosis but cannot inform about trajectories of anxiety and depression over time. Conclusion: Given that levels of anxiety and depression varied widely by cancer type, gender, and age, these results inform which cancer patients are most likely in need of psychosocial support.

Hypersensitivity to 35% carbon dioxide in patients with adult separation anxiety disorder,"Background: Adults with panic disorder (PD) and children with separation anxiety disorder (CSAD) show higher reactivity to CO₂. Our hypothesis was patients with adult separation anxiety disorder (ASAD) would show similar hypersensitivity to CO₂. In the present study, we determined whether sensitivity to CO₂ was enhanced in adult patients with separation anxiety disorder with no history of panic attacks. Methods: Patients with PD (n = 38), adult separation anxiety disorder (ASAD) patients with no history of panic attacks (n = 31), and healthy subjects (n = 40) underwent a 35% CO₂ inhalation challenge procedure. Baseline and post-inhalation anxiety were assessed with the Acute Panic Inventory, Visual Analog Scale, and Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3). Results: As hypothesized the rate of CO₂-induced panic attacks was significantly greater in PD and ASAD patient groups (55.3% and 51.6% respectively) than healthy comparison group (17.5%). Nine (69.2%) of 13 patients in PD group who have ASAD concurrent with PD had a CO₂-induced panic attack. ASI-3 total scores were not different between PD and ASAD groups and both were significantly higher than controls. However, anxiety sensitivity did not predict the occurrence of panic attacks. Limitations: The researchers were not blind to the diagnosis and there was no placebo arm for comparison. Besides, parameters of respiratory physiology were not evaluated. Conclusion: ASAD was associated with CO₂ hypersensitivity quite similar to PD. This finding partly unfolds the complex relationship of ‘CSAD, PD, and CO₂ hypersensitivity’ and indicates that CO₂ hypersensitivity and separation anxiety extend together beyond childhood.

Anxiety symptoms and disorder predict activity limitations in the elderly,"Background: In the elderly, little attention has been paid to anxiety both on a symptom dimension and as a disorder, as an independent risk factor for the incidence of activity limitations. Methods: In a community-dwelling cohort of 1581 persons aged 65+, the association between trait anxiety symptoms (Spielberger Trait, third highest tertile) and baseline DSM-IV anxiety disorder, and 7-year incident activity limitations was determined using mixed logistic regression models. Repeated measures of activity limitations included, by increased severity level: social restriction (neighbourhood and house confined), mobility (Rosow and Breslau scale) and limitations in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Results: Of the sample, 14.2% had an anxiety disorder at baseline. Adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and health variables, depression (past and current), antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs, baseline anxiety disorder was associated with an increased risk of incident IADL limitation (OR (95% CI): 1.84 (1.01–3.39), p = 0.048) and trait anxiety with increased incidence of social restriction (OR (95% CI): 2.41 (1.42–4.09), p = 0.001). Associations remained significant in participants free of depressive symptoms at baseline (OR (95% CI): 2.92 (1.41–6.05), p = 0.004; OR (95% CI): 3.21 (1.31–7.89), p = 0.011, respectively). Limitations: Activity limitations were self-reported and may have been over-reported in participants with anxiety. Conclusion: Both trait anxiety symptomatology and anxiety disorder were independently associated with increased incidence of activity limitations with a gradient of severity: trait anxiety associated with incident social restriction and anxiety disorder with more severe IADL limitations, suggesting that anxiety is a predictor of activity limitations in the elderly independently of depression comorbidity.

Nutrient intakes and the common mental disorders in women,"Background: There is an increasing recognition of the role of nutrition in depression and anxiety. Magnesium, folate and zinc have all been implicated in depressive illness, however there are few data on these nutrients in anxiety disorders and the data from population-studies are limited. Aims: In a large, randomly-selected, population-based sample of women, this study aimed to examine the relationship between the dietary intakes of these three micronutrients and clinically determined depressive and anxiety disorders and symptoms. Methods: Nutrient intakes were determined using a validated food frequency questionnaire. The General Health Questionnaire-12 measured psychological symptoms, and a clinical interview (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR, non-patient edition) assessed current depressive and anxiety disorders. Results: After adjustments for energy intake, each standard deviation increase in the intake of zinc, magnesium and folate was associated with reduced odds ratio (OR) for major depression/dysthymia (zinc: OR = 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.88; magnesium: OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.96; folate: OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.97). There was also an inverse association between the intake of magnesium and zinc and GHQ-12 scores (zinc: zβ = −0.16, 95% CI −0.29 to −0.04;magnesium: −0.14, 95% CI −0.26 to −0.03). These relationships were not confounded by age, socioeconomic status, education or other health behaviours. There was no relationship observed between any nutrient and anxiety disorders. Conclusion: These results demonstrate an association between the dietary intakes of magnesium, folate and zinc and depressive illnesses, although reverse causality and/or confounding cannot be ruled out as explanations.

Playing it safe: An examination of risk-avoidance in an anxious treatment-seeking sample,"It has been argued that individuals who are anxious are less likely and willing to take perceived risks across multiple behavioral domains (e.g., social, recreational, financial etc.), and that this bias is likely implicated in the etiology of pathological anxiety. While evidence is accumulating, there has been minimal research investigating the characteristics of risk-avoidance across anxiety disorders and across the specific risk-taking domains. The current study investigated risk-avoidance across domains in an anxious treatment-seeking sample. We hypothesized that: (i) individuals with anxiety would be more risk averse across domains relative to healthy controls; and, (ii) risk-avoidance would predict unique variance in anxiety symptoms, above and beyond other vulnerability factors (e.g., neuroticism). Individuals diagnosed with one or more anxiety disorders ( n = 67) completed measures of risk-taking, anxiety and depression symptoms, personality, and psychological distress. Healthy controls ( n = 58) completed measures of risk-taking and psychological distress. Results partially confirmed our hypotheses, demonstrating that anxious individuals were significantly more risk averse relative to controls across most domains, even after controlling for age and psychological distress. Furthermore, specific domains were found to account for unique variance in specific anxiety symptoms, as well as symptoms of depression. The results of this study provide novel evidence to suggest that risk-aversion is a possible transdiagnostic factor contributing to anxiety pathology.

A diagnostic profile of those who return a false positive assignment on bipolar screening measures,"Objectives: Our aim was to identify the diagnostic profile of patients classified as ‘false positives’ on two bipolar screening measures; the Mood Swings Questionnaire (MSQ) and the Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ). Methods: A total of 1534 patients attending the Black Dog Institute Depression Clinic completed the MSQ-46, and a smaller subset of 852 completed the MDQ. All patients underwent clinical assessment by one or more Institute psychiatrists. Results: Using clinical assignment (i.e. bipolar vs. unipolar) as the criterion measure for assessing the screening measures, the overall agreement rates were 84% for the MSQ-46 and 74% for the MDQ. Patients identified as ‘false positives’ were most likely to be clinically diagnosed as having a unipolar non-melancholic depression (37% for MSQ-46; 46% for MDQ), or a primary anxiety condition with secondary non-melancholic depression (19% for MSQ-46; 15% for MDQ). In addition, within the unipolar non-melancholic group, 46% of the MSQ-46 assigned false positives and 63% of the MDQ assigned false positives had co-morbid anxiety conditions. Conclusions: These findings suggest that patients with anxiety conditions account for a significant proportion of false positive diagnoses on bipolar screening tests—a finding that should be conceded in the development and refinement of such screening measures and in clinical assessment of the possibility of a bipolar disorder.

Psychosocial predictors of depression and anxiety in patients with epilepsy: A systematic review,"Background: People with epilepsy (PWE) have a high chance of experiencing depression and anxiety disorders over their lifetime. However, those most at risk are unknown. Psychosocial variables have been suggested as potentially important risk factors. A systematic review was conducted in order to critically assess available evidence regarding the psychosocial predictors of depression and anxiety in adults with epilepsy. Methods: Electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Studies were included if they assessed depressive or anxiety symptoms using a validated questionnaire, and controlled for the role of potentially important epilepsy factors. Eleven studies were identified and assessed for research standards using the Quality Index Scale (QIS). Results: Ten of the eleven studies found at least one significant predictor of depression and all six studies that assessed anxiety found one or more significant predictors. Limitations: Overall QIS score was only 7.5 out of 15, indicating significant design limitations of many included studies. There was also large variability between studies in measures used to assess psychosocial variables. Conclusion: Studies did not support the importance of attributional theory and stigma in the development of depression in epilepsy. There was inconsistent support for the role of illness representations but likely support for the role of stress and self-efficacy. Consistent support was found for the role of coping strategies and perceived social support. Given that psychosocial factors are potentially modifiable, a better understanding of their role in the development of depression in people with epilepsy is urgently needed to guide effective treatments.

Common mental disorders associated with 2-year diabetes incidence: The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA),"Background: Few prospective cohort studies describe the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus associated with depression or anxiety. The aim of this study was to determine the 2-year diabetes incidence and pattern of explanatory factors associated with depressive and/or anxiety disorders. Methods: A prospective cohort of 2981 participants (aged 18–65 years, 66% women) recruited in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) from community, primary care and outpatient psychiatric clinics were followed-up for two years. Complete data were analyzed from 2460 participants without baseline diabetes. Lifetime or current (past 6-month) depressive and/or anxiety disorders at baseline were assessed using the Composite Interview Diagnostic Instrument (CIDI) and classified by the DSM-IV. Diabetes was classified by either self-report, medications, or fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0mmol/L. Baseline covariates included age, gender, lifestyle factors, and medical conditions. Odds ratios (OR [95% confidence intervals]) for diabetes were determined using exact logistic regression. Results: The unadjusted 2-year diabetes incidence was 0.2% (1/571), 1.1% (6/548), and 1.8% (24/1340) for no, remitted, and current depressive and/or anxiety disorders, respectively. In comparison to those without psychopathology, current depressive and/or anxiety disorders was associated with diabetes incidence in unadjusted (OR 10.4 [1.7, 429.0]) and age-adjusted (OR 11.9 (1.9, 423.0]) analyses. The strength of this association (beta coefficient) was slightly changed after further adjustments for impaired fasting glucose (11.4%), high triglycerides (−7.8%), and lifestyle cumulative risk score (−5.0%), in contrast to other covariates when assessed in separate models. Limitations: The low incidence of diabetes resulted in considerable uncertainty for the odds ratios and low statistical power that limited covariate adjustments. Conclusions: The relative odds of developing diabetes within two years was increased for persons with current depressive and/or anxiety disorders, which was partially explained by, but remained independent of, lifestyle cumulative risk factors.

Anxiety disorders in intimate partners and the quality of their relationship,"Background: The aim of this study was to explain whether anxiety disorders presenting in one or both partners of a relationship can influence the latter and to what extent. Methods: This study included 85 couples, where: 1) the male partner suffered from an anxiety disorder and female partner was free from this type of disorder (F( − )M( + ), n = 20); 2) the female partner suffered from an anxiety disorder and the male partner was free from this type of disorder (F( + )M( − ); n = 40); and 3) both partners were affected with anxiety disorders (F( + )M( + ), n = 25). The quality of the relationship was assessed by both partners using three different scales: 1) Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS), 2) Family Attitude Scale (FAS), and 3) Marriage Success Scale (SPM). Results: In case of the SPM scale, women from F( − )M( + ) group evaluated their marriages significantly compared to other groups. In case of males, the self-evaluated quality of marriage was the lowest in the case of individuals from F( + )M( + ) group. In case of the DAS scale, women and men being free from anxiety disorders assessed the quality of their relationships significantly higher than other participants. The analyzed groups did not differ significantly in terms of mean values scored in the FAS scale. Limitations: The lack of a multifactorial analysis taking into account the effects of a variety of anxiety disorders. Conclusion: The presence of anxiety disorders in at least one partner negatively affects the quality of partner relationship. The couples where the female partners are affected are particularly fragile.

Humanistic and economic burden of generalized anxiety disorder in North America and Europe,"Background: To review the humanistic and economic burden of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, limited to articles published in English, between 1987 and 2010, in North America, Europe and Australia. The key focus was humanistic or functional outcomes, cost of illness and economic outcomes. Ninety articles fitting criteria on (a) GAD study population, (b) United States, Europe or Australia, and (c) humanistic burden or economic burden were reviewed. Methods and findings were summarized by two researchers; inconsistencies were resolved by a third reviewer. Results: GAD was associated with increased impairments in psychosocial functioning, role functioning, work productivity and health-related quality of life (HRQL). The HRQL impairments were comparable with those associated with depression or panic disorder. Patients with GAD and co-morbid depression reported significantly greater impairment in HRQL than did those with either disorder alone. GAD patients had significantly higher median medical costs than primary care patients without GAD (US $2375 versus $1448). The mean annual medical cost of GAD was $2138 higher than for other anxiety disorders (mean $6475). Finally, GAD was frequently under-recognized in primary care, and available studies reported that only 20% to 32% of patients were adequately treated. Limitations: The review was limited to pharmacologic treatments for GAD and to publications in English. Conclusions: GAD is associated with significant burden on patient functioning and well-being, leading to increased health care utilization and medical costs. Patients with GAD are often suboptimally treated, which adds to the HRQL burden of this disorder.

Psychological interventions for alcohol misuse among people with co-occurring depression or anxiety disorders: A systematic review,"Objective: Depression, anxiety and alcohol misuse frequently co-occur. While there is an extensive literature reporting on the efficacy of psychological treatments that target depression, anxiety or alcohol misuse separately, less research has examined treatments that address these disorders when they co-occur. We conducted a systematic review to determine whether psychological interventions that target alcohol misuse among people with co-occurring depressive or anxiety disorders are effective. Data sources: We systematically searched the PubMed and PsychINFO databases from inception to March 2010. Individual searches in alcohol, depression and anxiety were conducted, and were limited to ‘human’ published ‘randomized controlled trials’ or ‘sequential allocation’ articles written in English. Study selection: We identified randomized controlled trials that compared manual guided psychological interventions for alcohol misuse among individuals with depressive or anxiety disorders. Of 1540 articles identified, eight met inclusion criteria for the review. Data extraction: From each study, we recorded alcohol and mental health outcomes, and other relevant clinical factors including age, gender ratio, follow-up length and drop-out rates. Quality of studies was also assessed. Data synthesis: Motivational interviewing and cognitive–behavioral interventions were associated with significant reductions in alcohol consumption and depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. Although brief interventions were associated with significant improvements in both mental health and alcohol use variables, longer interventions produced even better outcomes. Conclusions: There is accumulating evidence for the effectiveness of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavior therapy for people with co-occurring alcohol and depressive or anxiety disorders.

Clinical configuration of cyclothymic disturbances,"Objective: While there is an increasing recognition of the role of subthreshold symptomatology in bipolar disorder, little attention has been dedicated to its only formally acknowledged subtype, cyclothymic disorder. The aim of this investigation was to provide a controlled evaluation of DSM-IV cyclothymic disorder by using a broad assessment strategy geared to subclinical signs. Methods: Sixty-two patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for cyclothymic disorder and did not present comorbidity with other mood disorders, alcohol and drug abuse, and borderline personality disorder and 62 control subjects matched for sociodemographic variables were administered the Structured Interview for Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR), the Clinical Interview for Depression (CID) and the Mania Scale (MAS). Results: In DSM-IV terms, there was an overlap with anxiety disorders in more than half of the cases. About 3 patients out of 4 were found to present with at least one DCPR syndrome (particularly demoralization and irritable mood). Cyclothymic patients displayed significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety disturbances on the CID, with particular reference to reactivity to social environment. They also had significantly higher scores on the MAS. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional and the sample, because of the exclusion criteria, may not be representative of the clinical populations in psychiatric settings. Conclusion: In our patients with cyclothymia, without comorbidity with major mood disorders, DSM-IV anxiety disorders, psychosomatic clinical syndromes (irritable mood, demoralization) and subclinical symptoms such as reactivity to social environment resulted to be more frequent than in controls. The use of a broad assessment strategy aimed at subclinical symptomatology may help identifying clinical phenomena that cut across the current definition of subthreshold forms of bipolar disorder.

Does anti-obsessional pharmacotherapy treat so-called comorbid depressive and anxiety states?,"Background: Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic condition that normally presents high rates of psychiatric comorbidity. Depression, tic disorders and other anxiety disorders are among the most common comorbidities in OCD adult patients. There is evidence that the higher the number of psychiatric comorbidities, the worse the OCD treatment response. However, little is known about the impact of OCD treatment on the outcome of the psychiatric comorbidities usually present in OCD patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of exclusive, conventional treatments for OCD on the outcome of additional psychiatric disorders of OCD patients, detected at baseline. Methods: Seventy-six patients with primary OCD admitted to the treatment protocols of the Obsessive–Compulsive Spectrum Disorders Program between July 2007 and December 2009 were evaluated at pre-treatment and after 12 months. Data were analyzed to verify possible associations between OCD treatment response and the outcome of psychiatric comorbidities. Results: Results showed a significant association between OCD treatment response and improvement of major depression and dysthymia (p-value = 0.002), other anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia and anxiety disorder not otherwise specified) (p-value = 0.054) and tic disorders (p-value = 0.043). Limitations: This is an open, non-blinded study, without rating scales for comorbid conditions. Further research is necessary focusing on the possible mechanisms by which OCD treatment could improve these specific disorders. Conclusions: Our results suggest that certain comorbid disorders may benefit from OCD-targeted treatment.

Temperament and character dimensions of patients with adult separation anxiety disorder,"Background: There is growing evidence suggesting that separation anxiety can occur in adults. We aimed to determine temperament and character dimensions in patients with adult separation anxiety disorder (ASAD) compared to patients with panic disorder (PD) and healthy subjects. Methods: The study sample included 77 outpatients with ASAD, 44 outpatients with a PD with or without agoraphobia diagnosis, and 35 healthy subjects. ASAD diagnoses were confirmed with Structured Clinical Interview for Separation Anxiety Symptoms. Other measures included Adulthood Separation Anxiety Checklist, Separation Anxiety Symptom Inventory, and Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). Group comparisons according to presence or absence of PD comorbidity in ASAD were also done. Results: Patients with ASAD scored higher in harm avoidance (HA) and scored lower in self-directedness (SD) compared to PD and control groups. Moreover, both PD patients and ASAD patients scored higher in RD, and self-transcendence dimensions than control subjects. All subscales of HA (anticipatory worry, fear of uncertainty, shyness, and fatigability) were significantly higher than controls. While HA scores were not different between ASAD and 'ASAD+PD' patients, HA levels of both groups were higher than PD alone and control groups. SD scores of patients with ASAD were lower than PD and control groups. Limitations: Cross-sectional design and ASAD group have other anxiety disorders comorbidity which might affect the results. Conclusion: Similar to PD and other anxiety disorders HA and RD was higher, and SD was lower in patients with ASAD compared to healthy subjects. Observed TCI profile is related to the ASAD itself since depression comorbidity was controlled.

Anxiety during the menopausal transition: A systematic review,"Objective: There have been relatively few studies of the relationship between anxiety and menopause. Despite the paucity of clear evidence, some authors have suggested that the menopausal transition is a time of heightened risk for onset or exacerbation of anxiety symptoms. There is also controversy as to whether anxiety predates or is a consequence of hot flashes. Method: A systematic review was undertaken based on literature published between 1960 and 2011, using the Medline, Web of Science and PsychINFO databases. The key terms ‘anxiety’, ‘anxiety symptoms’, ‘anxiety disorder’, ‘menopause’, ‘menopausal transition’, ‘midlife’, ‘hot flushes or flashes’ and ‘vasomotor symptoms’ were entered into the search. Studies were included if they reported original research using a clearly described measure of anxiety or investigated the relationship between anxiety and vasomotor symptoms. Results: Nine studies reporting the relationship between menopause and anxiety, two studies reporting the prevalence of panic disorder, and eight studies investigating the relationship between anxiety and vasomotor symptoms were identified. Overall, anxiety symptom levels were low throughout the menopausal transition, but the studies were characterised by poor measurement of both menopausal status and anxiety symptoms and relied heavily on the use of brief, largely nonvalidated measures of anxiety symptoms, which are of unknown clinical significance. In the studies that also measured factors such as attitude to menopause, and dispositional optimism or changes in family life these emerged as important predictors of vasomotor symptom severity. Conclusions: None of the available studies provides solid data on the prevalence of anxiety disorders that meet diagnostic criteria, and the present state of knowledge does not be no justify the inclusion of “menopausal anxiety” as a reproductive-related disorder. With respect to the relationship between hot flashes and anxiety, studies need to ensure that somatic and psychological symptoms are not confounded by the use of unsuitable anxiety measures, and that psychological variables are given serious consideration.

Coping strategies and psychological morbidity in family carers of people with dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Carers for people with dementia experience high levels of anxiety and depression. Coping style has been associated with carer anxiety and depression. Method: We systematically reviewed studies examining the relationships between coping and anxiety or depression among carers of people with dementia. We rated study validity using standardised checklists. We calculated weighted mean correlations (WMC) for the relationships between coping and psychological morbidity, using random effects meta-analyses. Results: We included 35 studies. Dysfunctional coping correlated with higher levels of anxiety (WMC=0.39, 95% CI 0.28–0.50; N=688) and depression (0.46, 0.36–0.56; N=1428) cross-sectionally, and with depression 6 and 12months later (0.32, 0.10–0.54; N=143). Emotional support and acceptance-based coping correlated with less anxiety (−0.22, 95% CI −0.26 to −0.18; N=628) and depression (−0.20, −0.28 to −0.11; N=848) cross-sectionally; and predicted anxiety and depression a year later in the only study to measure this. Solution-focused coping did not correlate significantly with psychological morbidity. Limitations: Just over a quarter of the identified studies provided extractable data for meta-analysis, including only two longitudinal studies. Conclusions: There is good evidence that using more dysfunctional, and less emotional support and acceptance-based coping styles are associated with more anxiety and depression cross-sectionally, and there is preliminary evidence from longitudinal studies that they predict this morbidity. Our findings would support the development of psychological interventions for carers that aim to modify coping style.

Anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns predict suicidality among smokers,"Background: Anxiety along with anxiety-related risk factors is receiving increased attention in regard to its role in elevated suicidality. One such risk factor, anxiety sensitivity (AS), refers to a fear of anxiety-related symptoms. Emerging research indicates that components of AS, particularly the AS subfactor focused on cognitive arousal concerns, are significantly associated with elevated suicidality in samples of diverse clinical outpatients, clinical outpatients with PTSD symptoms, and Air Force cadets undergoing a stressful life experience. Cigarette smokers represent another relevant population for this line of research due to recent reports indicating that cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence may be related to elevated suicidality. Methods: Study 1 examined the role of AS and the AS subfactors in a large sample (n = 343) of community adult smokers. Study 2 examined the role of AS and AS subfactors in a sample of “pack-a-day” adult smokers (n = 78) who were seeking outpatient treatment for substance abuse issues. Results: Study 1 results were consistent with our a priori hypothesis that AS cognitive concerns would be significantly associated with suicidality. Additionally, after covarying for relevant substance use variables, Study 2 results were also consistent with our hypothesis that AS cognitive concerns were significantly associated with suicidality. Limitations: Limitations included the use of suicide related outcomes, not death by suicide, and cross-sectional design. Conclusions: These findings suggest that suicide potential in cigarette smokers may be related to AS cognitive concerns and add to the emerging literature suggesting AS cognitive concerns are a risk factor for suicidality.

Determinants of (non-)recognition of depression by general practitioners: Results of the Netherlands study of depression and anxiety,"Background: Although most depressed patients are treated in primary care, not all are recognized as such. This study explores the determinants of (non-)recognition of depression by general practitioners (GPs), with a focus on specific depression symptoms as possible determinants. Methods: Recognition of depression by GPs was investigated in 484 primary care participants of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression in the past year. Recognition (yes/no) by GPs was based on medical file extractions (GP diagnosis of depressive symptoms/depressive disorder and/or use of antidepressants/referral to mental health care). Potential determinants of (non-)recognition (patient, depression, patient-GP interaction, and GP characteristics) were bivariately tested and variables with a p-value ≤ 0.2 entered into a multilevel multivariate model. Subgroup analysis was performed on 361 respondents with more reliable GP diagnosis data. Results: 60.5% of patients were recognized by their GP. Patients who did not consult their GP for mental problems, and without comorbid anxiety disorder(s) were less often recognized. In the subgroup, where 68.7% was recognized, in addition to these, decreasing number of symptoms of depression and increased appetite were associated with decreased recognition. No GP characteristics were retained in the final model. Limitations: Some data on recognition were collected retrospectively. Conclusions: In addition to patients without a comorbid anxiety disorder or who did not consult their GP for mental problems, GPs less often recognized patients with fewer depression symptoms or with increased appetite. Recognition may be improved by informing/teaching GPs that also increased appetite can be a symptom of depression.

Depressive and anxiety disorders in chronic hepatitis C patients: Reliability and validity of the Patient Health Questionnaire,"Depression and anxiety in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection influence their health-related quality of life and their adherence to antiviral treatment. Objective: To study the psychometric properties of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) as a screening instrument for depression and anxiety in HCV patients. Methods: Criterion validity, using the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV-Axis I (SCID-I) to diagnose depression and anxiety disorders as diagnostic standard, was evaluated for both summed and algorithm-based PHQ in 500 HCV patients. Correlations with quality of life (Short-Form-36 Health Survey; SF-36) and severity of illness (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) were calculated to assess construct validity. Test retest reliability and patients' reaction to the PHQ were assessed in 120 HCV patients. Results: Twenty-three percent of patients (N=114) had a psychiatric disorder (any depressive disorder=18.2%; major depressive disorder=6.4%; generalized anxiety disorder=7.0% and panic disorder=5.8%). The questionnaire demonstrated good test retest reliability for any depressive disorder (k=.847), major depressive disorder (k=.784), generalized anxiety disorder (k=.787), panic disorder (k=.848), and for any psychiatric disorder (k=.847). There was good agreement between PHQ and SCID-I diagnoses (for any PHQ disorder, k=.821; overall accuracy=90.43%, sensitivity=83.84%; specificity=97.01%). Patients with any PHQ disorder had higher impairment on the SF-36 (p&lt;.001). HADS depression and anxiety scores showed high correlations with PHQ depression (p&lt;.001) and anxiety (p&lt;.001) scores respectively. PHQ administration was well accepted by 97% of patients. Conclusions: The Spanish version of the PHQ is a reliable, valid, and useful screening instrument to detect depression, generalized anxiety and panic disorders in HCV patients.

Life events and their associations with depression and anxiety in older people with intellectual disabilities: Results of the HA-ID study,"Background: People with intellectual disabilities (ID) may be exposed to more life events due to different living circumstances and limited coping abilities. The frequency of life events may increase with age due to age-related decline, loss of significant others and forced relocations. We studied the occurrence of life events in adults with mild to profound ID aged ≥50 years and their association with depression and anxiety. Methods: Occurrence and burden of life events were assessed with a checklist of 28 items, completed by professional caregivers. Depression and anxiety were assessed with self-report and informant-report screening instruments (n = 988) and with a psychiatric interview (n = 286). Associations with depression and anxiety were studied for life events in general and for specific life events. Results: 97% of the participants had been exposed to multiple life events during the preceding year and 72% had been exposed to one or more negative life events. The frequency was significantly higher in participants aged 65 years or over, in participants with mild or moderate ID and in participants with depression or anxiety. Minor physical illness and problems with a fellow resident were significantly associated with depression and anxiety, decline or loss of mobility and loss of leisure-time activities with depression and change at work or from work with anxiety. Limitations: This study was cross-sectional and therefore lacks reliable information about causality. Conclusions: Given the high prevalence of life events and their association with depression and anxiety, life events should be better monitored and, if possible, prevented.

Clinical relevance of comorbidity in anxiety disorders: A report from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA),"Background: To study the clinical relevance of type of comorbidity and number of comorbid disorders in anxiety disorders. Four groups were compared according to sociodemographic-, vulnerability- and clinical factors: single anxiety disorder, anxiety–anxiety comorbidity, anxiety–depressive comorbidity and “double” comorbidity (i.e. anxiety and depressive comorbidity). Methods: Data were obtained from the Netherlands Study of Anxiety and Depression (NESDA). A sample of 1004 participants with a current anxiety disorder was evaluated. Results: As compared with single anxiety, anxiety–anxiety comorbidity was associated with higher severity, greater chronicity and more treatment. Anxiety–anxiety comorbidity was associated with an earlier age of onset and a more chronic course compared with anxiety–depressive comorbidity, while anxiety–depressive comorbidity was associated with more severe symptoms and more impaired functioning than anxiety–anxiety comorbidity. “Double” comorbidity was associated with higher severity, greater chronicity, more treatment and increased disability. Sociodemographic and vulnerability factors were comparable among the four groups. Limitations A prospective design would be more appropriate to study the outcome. In this study no distinction was made between whether depression or anxiety disorder preceded the current anxiety disorder. Conclusions: It is clinical relevant to diagnose and treat comorbidity among anxiety disorders as it is associated with higher severity and more chronicity. Whereas anxiety–anxiety comorbidity has an earlier age of onset and a more chronic course, anxiety–depressive comorbidity leads to more treatment and impaired functioning. “Double” comorbidity leads to even more severity, chronicity and impairment functioning compared with both anxiety–anxiety and anxiety–depressive comorbidity.

Comorbid anxiety in bipolar spectrum disorders: A neglected research and treatment issue?,"Background: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent among patients with bipolar disorder and have a substantial impact on the course of illness and response to treatment. Despite the substantial impact that comorbid anxiety disorders have on the prognosis of individuals with bipolar disorder, many aspects of this comorbidity have received little attention from researchers. This study aims to document the current state of the literature on the comorbidity between anxiety and bipolar disorders by analyzing publication trends on the subject. Method: This study is a quantitative and qualitative review of articles on the comorbidity between anxiety disorders and bipolar disorder published between 1990 and 2010 in the ISI Web of Science, Medline and PsycINFO databases. The number of articles published each year on this comorbidity was calculated and compared to the literature published on bipolar disorder as a whole. Articles were classified into five categories and 13 subcategories to identify the main focuses of the literature and current gaps in the knowledge on the subject. Results: Interest in the comorbidity between anxiety disorders and bipolar disorder grew continually since 1990, but seems to have reached a plateau. The majority of articles addressing this comorbidity are descriptive in nature, with very few concrete studies examining the mechanisms and treatment approaches that might lead to positive advancements in the field. Limitations: Articles written in languages other than English or French were not reviewed. Conclusions: It is time to step up research efforts to better understand and manage this understudied combination of disorders.

"Low trait anxiety, high resilience, and their interaction as possible predictors for treatment response in patients with depression","Background: Although many demographic and clinical characteristics have been suggested to predict treatment outcome of depression, they provide only a weak prediction for clinical response. Based on the predictive values of trauma and biological markers involved in stress response, we investigated the roles of baseline trait anxiety and resilience, which were assumed as vulnerability and resilience factors, respectively, in predicting treatment response in naturalistically treated outpatients with depressive disorders. Methods: A total of 178 outpatients with depressive disorders were consecutively recruited and completed measures of trauma experiences, psychological symptoms, and resilience at baseline. Response was defined by Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Improvement score ≤2 at last visit during a 6 month-treatment period. Univariate analyses and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed to determine predictors of treatment response. Results: Among demographic and clinical variables, treatment response was associated with increased age, longer treatment duration, higher resilience, and lower trait anxiety. In logistic regression analysis, resilience, trait anxiety, and their interaction significantly predicted treatment response after adjusting for age and treatment duration. Interaction between resilience and trait anxiety remained significant in the final model. Examining the interaction between the two, patients with low trait anxiety were only significantly affected by the level of resilience in response rate. Conclusions: Low trait anxiety, high resilience, and their interaction might contribute to better treatment response in depressed patients. Our result suggested that individual differences in responding to stress might be important in predicting treatment outcome of depression in addition to other demographic and clinical factors.

Physical function as predictor for the persistence of depressive and anxiety disorders,"Introduction: Depressive and anxiety disorders often involve a chronic course. This study examined whether objective physical function is a predictor for the persistence of depressive and anxiety disorders. Method: The study sample consisted of 1206 persons with depressive and anxiety disorders at baseline. Hand grip strength and lung function were used as objective physical function measurements and were determined at baseline. Outcome variable was a 6-month depressive and/or anxiety diagnosis after 2 years of follow-up. Results: Lower hand grip strength predicted the persistence of depressive and/or anxiety disorders at 2-year follow-up (per SD increase: OR = 0.82, CI: 0.69–0.99, p = 0.04). Associations were consistent for depressive and anxiety disorder persistence. Poorer lung function was associated with the persistence of depressive disorders (per SD increase: OR = 0.83, CI: 0.70– 0.98, p = 0.03) but not with anxiety disorders. Limitations: Follow-up was limited to 2 years. Conclusions: Objectively measured poorer physical function predicted the persistence of depressive and/or anxiety disorders.

Symptom dimensions as predictors of the two-year course of depressive and anxiety disorders,"Background: Because of the heterogeneity of known predictive factors, course-predictions for depression and anxiety are often unspecific. Therefore, it was investigated whether symptom dimensions could be used as more specific course-predictors, on top of already known predictors, such as diagnosis and overall severity. Methods: A sample of 992 subjects with depressive and/or anxiety disorders was followed in a 2-year prospective cohort study. Dimensions of the tripartite model (general distress, anhedonic depression and anxious arousal) were assessed at baseline. Diagnostic and course information were assessed at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Results: Dimensional scores at baseline predicted diagnosis after two years and course-trajectories during follow-up. Increased general distress at baseline was associated with comorbid depression– anxiety at follow-up, increased anhedonic depression was associated with single depression and anxious arousal was associated with (comorbid) panic disorders at follow-up. Baseline general distress was associated with an unfavorable course in all patients. All associations were independent and added prognostic information on top of diagnosis and other predictive factors at baseline. Limitations: Only prevalent patients were included at baseline and only three dimensions were measured Conclusions: Symptom dimensions predict the future 2-year course of depression and anxiety. Importantly, the dimensions yield predictive information on top of diagnosis and other prognostic factors at baseline.

Validation of simple visual-analogue thermometer screen for mood complications of cardiovascular disease: The Emotion Thermometers,"Objective: Conventional scales may help with the identification of depression but are generally too lengthy for clinical practice and perform poorly against anxiety and distress. We therefore examined the value of a single item NCCN Distress Thermometer and an enhanced visual-analogue method (Emotion Thermometers, ET) that incorporates four emotion thermometers. Methods: We examined 228 patients with mixed cardiovascular conditions of whom 200 completed questionnaires. 64.5% suffered from cardiomyopathy/congestive heart failure, 9.5% had coronary artery disease, 4.5% had multiple cardiac diagnoses, 3% suffered from hypertension, 2% had rhythm problem, 2% had valve problems and 1.5% were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. We used DSM-IV criteria to define current depression, the GAD7 to define current anxiety and the HADS-T to define distress. 13% had DSM-IV MDD and 19.1% had major or minor depression using DSM-IV (any depression). There were also 59 people (29.6%) with clinically significant distress and 46 with clinically significant anxiety (23.1%). Results: The optimal accuracy for major depression was either the Depression thermometer (DepT) or the Help thermometer (HelpT), as both performed well. They had a sensitivity and specificity of 73.1%, 89.7% and 84.6%, 85.6%, respectively. The DepT was also best for detecting any DSM-IV depression (sensitivity 68.4% and specificity 93.2%) and HAD-T based distress (sensitivity 79.7% and specificity 82.9%). The Anxiety thermometer (AnxT) performed best against the GAD7 (sensitivity 84.8% and specificity 83.7%). Conclusion: Innovative visual-analogue screening tools for mood appear to perform well in cardiovascular settings.

An urge to jump affirms the urge to live: An empirical examination of the high place phenomenon,"Background: The experience of a sudden urge to jump when in a high place has been speculated to be associated with suicidal ideation; however, scant data has informed this speculation. We termed this experience the high place phenomenon (HPP) and proposed that it stems from a misinterpreted safety signal (i.e., survival instinct). The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of the HPP, to provide evidence that the phenomenon is not exclusive to suicide ideators, and to explore the role of anxiety sensitivity in the phenomenon. Methods: 431 undergraduate college students completed online measures of lifetime frequency of experiencing the HPP, suicidal ideation, anxiety sensitivity, depressive symptoms, and history of mood episodes. Results: The HPP was commonly reported in the general population, even among participants with no history of suicidal ideation. There was a significant correlation between anxiety sensitivity and the HPP, and this relationship was moderated by level of current suicidal ideation. Particularly, the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and the HPP was potentiated among participants with low levels of suicidal ideation. Limitations: The cross-sectional design of the study limits the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn. Conclusions: The HPP is commonly experienced among suicide ideators and non-ideators alike. Thus, individuals who report experiencing the phenomenon are not necessarily suicidal; rather, the experience of HPP may reflect their sensitivity to internal cues and actually affirm their will to live.

Long-term outcome of eight clinical trials of CBT for anxiety disorders: Symptom profile of sustained recovery and treatment-resistant groups,"Background: Few clinical trials of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders have conducted follow-up beyond one year post-treatment. This paper summarises the long-term outcome of eight clinical trials of CBT for anxiety disorders in terms of diagnostic status, healthcare usage and symptom severity and compares the symptom profile of participants with the best and worst outcomes relative to chronic depression and the normal population. Methods: Follow-up at 2–14 years with 396 patients (51% of those available to contact) employed structured diagnostic interview, assessment of healthcare usage and self-report measures of symptom severity. This paper concerns 336 participants who had either no disorder or at least one anxiety disorder and information on healthcare usage over the follow-up period. Results: Only 38% recovered with little or no treatment over the follow-up period while 30% had a very poor outcome despite extensive treatment for anxiety over many years. The symptom profile of this ‘treatment-resistant’ group was comparable to 76 patients with chronic depression and significantly worse than normative data for psychiatric outpatients. Chronic anxiety disorder with co-morbid depression has a more severe symptom profile than chronic anxiety disorder alone. Limitations: The follow-up sample, although broadly representative, may have a bias towards a more favourable picture of overall outcome. Conclusions: The long-term outcome of anxiety disorders, irrespective of diagnosis or active treatment, is diverse but with a tendency towards chronicity. Distinctions between acute and chronic presentations of common mental disorders are more important than distinctions between chronic anxiety and chronic depression.

Disengagement coping partially mediates the relationship between caregiver burden and anxiety and depression in caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease. Results from the MÁLAGA-AD study,"Background: Caring for people with Alzheimer's disease can be considered stressful and demand adjustment strategies. While various variables have been associated with caregiver anxiety and depression, a possible mediator role of coping strategies adopted by caregivers between caregiver burden and anxiety and depression is still unclear. We hypothesized that caregivers with clinically significant anxiety and depression were more likely to use disengagement coping strategies that non-anxious and non-depressed caregivers. Methods: This study involved 80 Alzheimer disease patients and their primary caregivers. Patients were evaluated using the Mini Mental State Examination, the Bayer Activities of Daily Living Scale, the Global Deterioration Scale and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Caregivers were evaluated with the Caregiver Burden Interview, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Coping Strategies Inventory. We conducted a series of multiple linear regressions to determine the relationship between caregiver burden and caregiver anxiety and depression, and if the coping strategies mediated this relationship. Results: Using more disengagement (β = 0.270, p &lt; 0.001) and less engagement coping (β = −0.310, p &lt; 0.001) were predictors for anxiety scores. Using more disengagement (β = 0.250, p &lt; 0.001) and less engagement coping (β = −0.261, p &lt; 0.001) were predictors for depression scores. Limitations: This study was a cross-sectional design, so the direction of causality should be strengthened by a longitudinal study. Conclusions: Most caregivers reported higher anxiety and depression levels and this was partially mediated by their dysfunctional coping strategies.

Negative affectivity moderated by BDNF and stress response,"Background: Gene × environment (G × E) interactions are known to predict susceptibility to disorders such as depression and anxiety. Adverse experiences in childhood and number of stressful life events (SLEs) have been widely studied as environmental risk factors; however, SLE response has not yet been studied. Here we present a first attempt at the analysis of the interaction between the response to personal and academic stressful events during different life stages and the gene polymorphisms 5-HTTLPR, 5-HTTVNTR (STin2), HTR1A C(−1019)G, and BDNF Val66Met in the prediction of negative affectivity (NA). Methods: Standardized questionnaires (ST-DEP and STAI) were used to measure negative affectivity derived from depression and anxiety in a sample of 303 undergraduate students. Response to stressful events during childhood, high school and college years was evaluated together with a self-report personal history form. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to perform association and G × E analysis. Results: Negative affectivity is strongly associated with childhood maltreatment and stress response. Gene associations were observed between 5-HTTVNTR allele 12 and the S_12 haplotype with NA derived from high scores in both depression and anxiety. The BDNF gene variant was not associated with NA derived from depression or anxiety alone, but it was associated with the comorbid presentation. A significant G × E interaction was observed between the BDNF Val66Met and stress response during childhood and college years although the risk for negative affectivity conferred by stress response during childhood was only significant among the Met allele carriers, while stress response during college years was a significant risk factor regardless of the BDNF Val66Met genotype. A significant G × E interaction was also found between the HTR1A C(−1019)G variant and childhood maltreatment. Limitations: The study has two main limitations, sample size is lowand retrospective recognition of SLEs is a concern. Conclusion: Altogether, our results demonstrate that the BDNF Val66Met variant moderates the effect of stress during both childhood and college years; although this effect seems to be more critical during childhood given that the risk conferred by childhood stress was restricted to the Met allele carriers. We also found that the HTR1A C(−1019)G variant moderates the effect of childhood maltreatment in our study population.

The psychological costs and benefits of being highly persistent: Personality profiles distinguish mood disorders from anxiety disorders,"Background: The personality trait of Persistence is highly valued by conscientious overachievers, but it has both psychological costs and benefits. The interactions among multiple personality factors influencing the development of mood and anxiety disorders have been confounded in prior clinical samples, but can be disentangled in terms of their underlying brain circuitry and influence on perception of emotional stimuli. Methods: 285 individuals who represented the full range of personality variation in a large sample of adult volunteers from the general community of Israel were selected for follow-up by psychiatric interviews, cognitive testing, and medical examinations. The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) measured profiles of traits that distinguished individuals with diagnoses of mood and/or anxiety disorders using linear discriminant analysis and non-linear profile analysis. Results: High Harm Avoidance and low Self-directedness strongly distinguished people with mood and/or anxiety disorders from those with neither. High Persistence distinguished people with only anxiety disorders from those with mood disorders. High Persistence was associated with greater health and happiness overall, but also led to more negative emotions than in people with low Persistence unless they were both unusually tolerant of frustration (i.e., low in Harm Avoidance) and self-accepting of personal limitations (i.e. high in Self-directedness). Limitations: Subjects were volunteers over 40 years of age at assessment. Conclusions: People who are highly persistent (i.e., persevering, ambitious, perfectionistic) are more likely to have anxiety disorders than mood disorders, even when they have other traits increasing risk for both (i.e., high Harm Avoidance and low Self-directedness). High Persistence increases both positive and negative emotions in most people. However, high Persistence reduces negative emotions and increases positive emotions if a person is easy-going (i.e., “happy-go-lucky” when low in both Harm Avoidance and Self-directedness).

Sleep problems outperform depression and hopelessness as cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of suicidal ideation and behavior in young adults in the military,"Background: Sleep problems appear to represent an underappreciated and important warning sign and risk factor for suicidal behaviors. Given past research indicating that disturbed sleep may confer such risk independent of depressed mood, in the present report we compared self-reported insomnia symptoms to several more traditional, well-established suicide risk factors: depression severity, hopelessness, PTSD diagnosis, as well as anxiety, drug abuse, and alcohol abuse symptoms. Methods: Using multiple regression, we examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation and behavior, controlling for depressive symptom severity, hopelessness, PTSD diagnosis, anxiety symptoms, and drug and alcohol abuse symptoms in a sample of military personnel (N = 311). Results: In support of a priori hypotheses, self-reported insomnia symptoms were cross-sectionally associated with suicidal ideation, even after accounting for symptoms of depression, hopelessness, PTSD diagnosis, anxiety symptoms and drug and alcohol abuse. Self-reported insomnia symptoms also predicted suicide attempts prospectively at one-month follow up at the level of a non-significant trend, when controlling for baseline self-reported insomnia symptoms, depression, hopelessness, PTSD diagnosis and anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse symptoms. Insomnia symptoms were unique predictors of suicide attempt longitudinally when only baseline self-reported insomnia symptoms, depressive symptoms and hopelessness were controlled. Limitations: The assessment of insomnia symptoms consisted of only three self-report items. Findings may not generalize outside of populations at severe suicide risk. Conclusions: These findings suggest that insomnia symptoms may be an important target for suicide risk assessment and the treatment development of interventions to prevent suicide.

Twelve-month prevalence and correlates of subthreshold and threshold anxiety in community-dwelling older adults with cardiovascular diseases,"Background: Studies that examined the prevalence of anxiety in older adults with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were mainly conducted in clinical settings limiting the generalizability of the results to community-based samples. Moreover, among older adults with CVD, little is known about the prevalence of subthreshold anxiety and about which characteristics differentiate those with subthreshold anxiety from those having an anxiety disorder. This study aimed at determining the 12-month prevalence rates of subthreshold and threshold anxiety in community-dwelling older adults with CVD as well as to examine whether older people with CVD reporting an anxiety disorder differ from their counterparts with subthreshold anxiety. Method: Froma representative sample of community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and older ( N = 2811), 613 cases of CVD were identified based on government medical records. Subthreshold and threshold anxiety were assessed using in-home interviews based on the DSM-IV criteria. Results: The 12-month prevalence rates of anxiety disorders and subthreshold anxiety were, respectively, 5.1 and 14.8%. Compared to older adults with CVD reporting no anxiety, individuals reporting subthreshold or threshold anxiety aremore likely to bewomen, to have high blood pressure, and to suffer from a depression. Limitations: No information was gathered regarding alcohol and tobacco use. Conclusions: The present study provides evidence for the fact that subthreshold anxiety has a high prevalence among community-dwelling older people with CVD and that clinicians working with this population should screen for anxiety, even at a subthreshold level, since it may be associated with high blood pressure and depression.

Distinguishing symptom dimensions of depression and anxiety: An integrative approach,"Background: Clark and Watson developed the tripartite model in which a symptom dimension of ‘negative affect’ covers common psychological distress that is typically seen in anxious and depressed patients. The ‘positive affect’ and ‘somatic arousal’ dimensions cover more specific symptoms. Although the model has met much support, it does not cover all relevant anxiety symptoms and its negative affect dimension is rather unspecific. Therefore, we aimed to extend the tripartite model in order to describe more specific symptom patterns with unidimensional measurement scales. Method: 1333 outpatients provided self report data. To develop an extended factor model, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted in one part of the data (n = 578). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted in the second part (n = 755), to assess model-fit and comparison with other models. Rasch analyses were done to investigate the unidimensionality of the factors. Results: EFA resulted in a 6-factor model: feelings of worthlessness, fatigue, somatic arousal, anxious apprehension, phobic fear and tension. CFA in the second sample showed that a 6-factor model with a hierarchical common severity factor fits the data better than alternative 1- and 3-factor models. Rasch analyses showed that each of the factors and the total of factors can be regarded as unidimensional measurement scales. Limitations: The model is based on a restricted symptom-pool: more dimensions are likely to exist. Conclusion: The extended tripartite model describes the clinical state of patients more specifically. This is relevant for both clinical practice and research.

Predictors of response among patients with panic disorder treated with medications in a naturalistic follow-up: The role of adult separation anxiety,"Background: Efficacy of treatments for panic disorder is well established, but not all patients respond. Adult separation anxiety has been found to predict poorer response to CBT, but its effect on response to medication has not been previously explored. Study aim: The aim of this study is to investigate if panic–agoraphobic spectrum factors, including ‘ separation anxiety ’ factor predict treatment outcome in patients with panic disorder. Study sample: Participants who met criteria for PD (n = 57) completed baseline assessment and 12 months follow-up. Patients were administered the Panic Agoraphobic Spectrum Self-Report (PAS-SR, Lifetime and Last-Month Versions), and the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS). We examined patients who met the following criteria at baseline: 1) PDSS total score &gt;7; 2) no current Axis I comorbidity with major depression; 3) no lifetime or current bipolar disorder. All patients were treated with evidence-based psychopharmacological treatment for panic disorder during the 12-month observation period. Results: Twenty eight patients (48.1%) achieved remission during the follow-up period. In a logistic regression model, controlling for baseline severity, gender and age, only the last-month PAS-SR ‘ separation anxiety ’ factor was associated with a lower likelihood of remission. Conclusions: Signs and symptoms of separation anxiety in adulthood, as assessed with the PAS-SR Last Month version, are predictors of poor treatment outcome in patients with PD. We submit that the assessment of panic–agoraphobic spectrum features, including adult separation anxiety, should become routine of clinical assessment of patients with PD. It is likely that a better psychopathological characterization of patients may inform treatment selection, and result in better treatment outcome.

Associations of polyunsaturated fatty acids with residual depression or anxiety in older people with major depression,"Backgrounds: Depression in late life often follows a chronic course with residual depressive and anxiety symptoms. Levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been found to be depleted in people with major depression in the acute stage. Additionally, lower omega-3 PUFA levels have been suggested to be associated with anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PUFAs levels (omega-3 or omega-6) are correlated with residual depressive or anxiety symptoms in older people with previous depression. Methods: Participants aged 60 years or over with previous major depression in remission were enrolled from outpatient psychiatric services of four hospitals. Participants with residual depressive symptoms were defined as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores &gt;5, and those with anxiety were defined as sum of scores for the two anxiety subscale of HDRS≧2. The levels of fatty acids in erythrocyte membranes and in plasma were measured separately by gas chromatography. Results: One hundred and thirty two older people with previous major depression (mean age of 68 years, range 60–86 years)were analyzed. Erythrocyte membrane linoleic acid levels had a curvilinear association with depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. Plasma linoleic acid levels were found to have a negative linear relationship with depressive symptoms. No significant associations were found between any omega-3 fatty acid level and depressive or anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: Linoleic acid levels may be a possible biomarker for residual depression and anxiety in older people with previous depression. Possible clinical applications need further investigation.

Combined anxiety and depressive symptoms before diagnosis of breast cancer,"Purpose: To determine the relationship between pre-diagnosis state anxiety, depressive symptoms, and combined state anxiety and depressive symptoms (CADS) with quality of life (QOL), fatigue, state anxiety and depressive symptoms one and two years after surgery in women with breast cancer. Methods: Women with breast problems referred to a Dutch outpatient clinic were recruited for the study. Participants (N = 428) completed a set of questionnaires before diagnosis (Time0) and the women with breast cancer subsequently received questionnaires at 12 (Time1) and 24 months (Time2) after surgical treatment. The questionnaire set consisted of questionnaires on demographics, state anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, QOL, neuroticism, and trait anxiety. Chi-square tests, independent samples T-tests, and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to do the analyses. Results: Before their diagnosis of breast cancer, 111 women (28%) had CADS. Of the CADS-group, a higher percentage had elevated levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and CADS at all follow-up moments than of the non-CADS-group. CADS-score at before diagnosis and neuroticism were the most important predictors of outcome measures at Time1 and Time2. Conclusions: More than one in four women, who later received the diagnosis breast cancer, had elevated levels of both state anxiety and depressive symptoms (CADS) just before diagnosis. This factor was also a major predictor of QOL, state anxiety, depressive symptoms, and fatigue 12 and 24 months after surgery. This implies that women with a higher score on both state anxiety and depressive symptoms should be identified as soon as possible in the process of diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer using validated questionnaires or screening instruments. Only by identifying this group of patients, tailored psychological care can be accomplished.

Cholecystokinin system genes: Associations with panic and other psychiatric disorders,"Background: The cholecystokinin (CCK) system has long been hypothesised to have a role in the pathogenesis of panic attacks. Previous research into genetic variation within the CCK gene and the genes for its two receptors, CCKAR and CCKBR , has produced mixed results. We aimed to clarify this association by investigating multiple variants within each gene and multiple phenotypes associated with panic that may have confounded the previous studies' findings. Methods: Variants were selected for the three genes based on HapMap CEU data. Individuals from a family based cohort (n = 563) were genotyped for these variations and this data was analysed in FBAT. Results: CCKBR showed the strongest association with panic, having multiple variants with p &lt; 0.05 (lowest: p = 0.007). In CCKAR , some evidence was found for an association with panic, though further analysis suggested that the co-morbid bipolar–panic phenotype was most strongly associated. No variants in CCK were associated with panic but broader anxiety phenotypes did show associations. Limitations: Small sample size prevented thorough investigation of phenotypes, particularly pure disorders, and no correction was made for the multiple phenotypes analysed. Conclusions: Our findings support the involvement of variation in the CCK system, particularly CCKBR , in the pathogenesis of panic. Our data suggest that variation in CCK may be involved in several anxiety phenotypes and CCKAR may be involved in the development of panic co-morbid with bipolar disorder. These latter findings require further investigation and highlight the importance of clearly defined phenotypes when investigating psychiatric genetics.

Family religion and psychopathology in children of depressed mothers: Ten-year follow-up,"Background: Previously we found that transmission of religion from mother to adult offspring as measured by correlations on ratings of personal importance of religion and frequency of attendance at religious services was hindered by maternal depression. Concordance of denomination, a measure indicating successful transmission of denomination within a mother and offspring pair, was associated with a 71% decreased risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) in offspring. This study attempts to replicate the findings in a younger generation of mothers who were the original offspring or spouse of the original offspring in the previous study, and their offspring. Methods: Mothers (N = 45) and offspring (N = 78) were assessed for MDD and anxiety using semi-structured clinical interviews (The Diagnostic Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Modified for the Anxiety Disorders) at two points across a ten-year interval. Religiosity was assessed by report of personal spirituality, frequency of attendance at religious services, and religious denomination Results: Results partially replicate previous findings that maternal depression hinders the transmission of importance but not attendance or denomination to offspring. Concordance of denomination is protective, decreasing by 91% the likelihood of childhood anxiety or depression, independent of maternal depression. Limitations include small sample size that represents few denominations, limited assessments of religiosity, and inability to control for the possible confound of a close relationship between mother and offspring in our analyses. Conclusions: Family agreement and practice of religious denomination may be a robust protective source from MDD or anxiety for youth, independent of the effects of maternal depression.

Personality and perceived need for mental health care among primary care patients,"Background: Although there are many forms of effective, evidence-based treatments available to patients with mood and anxiety disorders, many do not seek any help. Certain personality characteristics are associated with increased use of mental health services. The objective of this study is to examine whether personality traits are also related to patients' perceived need for (specific types of) mental health care. Methods: Cross-sectional data were derived from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). A total of 762 patients recruited from general practices, and who had been diagnosed with one or more DSM-IV diagnoses of anxiety and/or depression were included. Perceived need for mental health care was assessed with the Perceived Need for Care Questionnaire (PNCQ) and personality traits were assessed with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). Results: We found indications that personality traits, in particular neuroticism and openness to experience, have an impact on care needs. Patients with higher scores on these traits were more likely to have a perceived need for care, irrespective of whether or not this need was met. Extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness were largely unrelated to perceived need for care. Conclusions: Regardless of the severity of anxiety and depression, personality is associated with need for care. This seems to be true for neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness. Associations with these domains were found for various types of treatment. These findings suggest that patients with different levels of personality traits need different treatments.

Principal domains of quantitative anxiety trait in subjects with lifetime history of mania,"Background: High comorbidity rates for anxiety have been documented in subjects with history of mania or hypomania. We explored the presence of latent constructs of quantitative anxiety in subjects who have a history of mania or hypomania. Methods: We conducted an exploratory factor analysis of anxiety trait in 212 subjects who have a lifetime history of at least one manic/hypomanic syndrome. Participants were originally recruited for a Costa Rican sibling pair genetic study of Bipolar Disorder. We used principal factors extraction method with squared multiple correlations (SAS/SAT Professional software) of the STAI (trait subscale). Results: A three-factor solution with a good simple structure and statistical adequacy was obtained with a KMO of 0.84 (&gt;0.6) and Bartlett's Test of Sphericity of 2.4668E-162 (p &lt; 0.05). Items were grouped into anxiety-absent factor and the anxiety-present symptoms in two additional factors based on the nature of the symptoms, worry and rumination. Limitations: Comorbid disorders could affect the interaction of anxiety score with manic/hypomanic symptoms. Some statistical parameters (mood status independence, score distribution and correlation between trait score and quantitative mania/hypomania) were not taken into consideration to extract the factors. Because anxiety dimensions were explored on individuals with history of mania or hypomania and not in healthy subjects, comparison of our results with other studies can draw confusing conclusions. Conclusions: Two underlying constructs, worry and rumination may explain anxiety sub-syndromic symptoms in Costa Rican patients with history of mania or hypomania.

Social anxiety in the general population: Introducing abbreviated versions of SIAS and SPS,"Background: Social anxiety is characterized by the experience of stress, discomfort and fear in social situations, and is associated with substantial personal and societal burden. Two questionnaires exist that assess the aspects of social anxiety, i.e. social interaction anxiety (SIAS) and social phobia (SPS). There is no agreement in literature on the dimensionality of social anxiety. Further, the length of a questionnaire may negatively affect response rates and participation at follow-up occasions. Aim: To explore the structure of social anxiety in the general population, and to examine psychosocial and sociodemographic correlates. Our second aim was to construct abbreviated versions of SIAS and SPS that can be easily used and with minimal burden. Method: A total of 1598 adults from the general Dutch population completed a survey asking information on social anxiety, mood and demographics. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses as well as reliability analysis with item-total statistics were performed. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a 3-factor structure for social phobia, and a 2-factor structure for the SIAS, with the second factor containing both reversely scored items. The abbreviated versions of SPS (11 items) and SIAS (10 items) show excellent discriminant and construct validity (Cronbach's α = .90 and .92), while specificity analysis showed that gender,marital status and educational level (SIAS¹⁰: p &lt; .0005; SPS¹¹: p &lt; .0005) are important determinants of social anxiety. Conclusion: In the general population, social interaction anxiety and social phobia are two aspects of a higher-order factor of social anxiety. Social anxiety is validly captured by the short versions of SPS and SIAS, reducing the questionnaire burden for participants in epidemiological and bio-behavioral research.

Empirically derived subgroups of bipolar I patients with different comorbidity patterns of anxiety and substance use disorders in Han Chinese population,"Objective: Bipolar-I disorder (BPI) often co-occurred with anxiety (ANX) and substance use disorders (SUD), which poses challenges in public health and clinical treatment, and adds complexity in searching for relevant etiologic factors. The present study sought to identify subgroups of BPI patients using comorbidity patterns with ANX and SUD. Methods: Clinical patients (N = 306) diagnosed with BPI were recruited and interviewed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview to collect data on demographics and clinical features, including episodic information, impairments, and lifetime diagnoses of ANX (panic, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, specific and social phobia) and SUD (nicotine dependence, alcohol use and drug use disorder). We applied latent class analysis to empirically derive classes of BPI. A number of exogenous variables were examined for each class. Results: A three-class model provides excellent discriminability for subgrouping BPI patients with different comorbidity patterns. The BPI-LOW class (83.99%) had more pure mania without most lifetime comorbidity, higher numbers of last year mania episodes, and less suicidality and impairments. The BPI-ANX class (3.60%) was female predominant, tended to comorbid with multiple anxiety disorders but no SUD, and had early onset age. The BPI-SUD class (12.42%) was male predominant,had high prevalence of lifetime SUD and frequent mood episodes in the last year. Both the BPI-ANX and BPI-SUD classes had severe functional impairments and suicidal behaviors. Limitations: Clinical information was retrospectively collected. Besides, we did not comprehensively access lifetime comorbidity for all psychiatric disorders. Conclusion: The three empirically identified subgroups of BPI patients exhibited distinguished comorbidity patterns and clinical features, including suicidal behaviors, frequent mood episodes and functional impairments. Our findings have clinical implication in intervention and treatment as well as to explore their different underlying mechanisms.

"Ruminative response in clinical patients with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders","Background: There is a growing interest in the transdiagnostic trait of rumination. However, few studies have directly examined the ruminative response in the diagnosis of disorders other than major depression, such as anxiety disorders and bipolar disorders. Even fewer studies have done so in a large, clinical sample. Method: Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), panic disorder with/without agoraphobia (PD), and generalized anxiety disorder or obsessive–compulsive disorder (GAD/OCD) were compared using the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A). Results: The PD group displayed the lowest levels of rumination even when depression and anxiety symptoms were treated as a covariate. The BPD group displayed higher levels of rumination than the MDD group. Conclusions: A heightened ruminative response was not only found among individuals with MDD, but also among those with BPD and GAD/OCD; this might indicate ineffective thought control.
