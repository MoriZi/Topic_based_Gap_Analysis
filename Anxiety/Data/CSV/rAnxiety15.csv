1,Whenever I go out the next morning I feel like everyone hates me and I want to kill myself.,"Whenever I go out and get tipsy/drunk I suffer from intense anxiety. The next morning I feel like everyone I went out with the previous night will hate me on top of strong feelings of wanting to kill myself. The wanting to kill myself feelings are harder to deal with because I can't stop repeating in my head that I want to kill myself and the voice in my head gets so persistent that I end up absent mindedly saying it aloud. It's only been getting worse as time goes on. I don't know why I have these feelings or how to get rid of them and I was just wondering if anyone else experiences the same thing.

Edit: I want to thank you guys for being nothing but supportive and kind. You're all amazing!",36,2015-07-19 18:41:29 EDT-0400
2,Does anyone else shake literally from anxiety?,"So this morning I woke up literally shaking in bed. I also have a shaking arm sometimes when awake that won't just get away. 
The GP, neurologist, my psychologist and I are all convinced it is due to stress/anxiety. I (25f) started a new job today after 6 month of reintegrating at another job due to burnout/depression. So it's not that strange that I woke up shaking. The only thing is I can't stop it, which leads me to feeling panicky, which leads to a massive panic attack. So I was wondering does anyone else have this? and how do you cope with this? I also don't use any medication. 

tl;dr: sometimes I wake up shaking or my arm shakes all on its own. How to deal with this?",27,2015-07-16 00:12:44 EDT-0400
3,"**Breakthrough** Just want to share my realization, amazing change!!","So I spend so much time being so frustrated with my SO, friends, and family essentially because they don't meet my expectations of what I think they should be doing for me. But, it occured to me this morning that it's completely fucking stupid to get angry at people for not changing themselves to do what YOU want because THEY ARENT YOU. They are them. So, instead of getting angry I accept them as they are and instead evaluate whether what I'm asking for is even reasonable, and most of the time it's not. It's basically just about accepting people. It's not about changing them, it's about asking yourself if you can accept them for who they are and what they do and can do for you. 

I know it seems kind of dumb and round about, but this new perspective is really allowing me to release a lot of anger (and therefore anxiety) and allows me to just accept others. It's relieving a lot of tension in my relationships. I'm just a little proud of myself for this breakthrough...years in the making! I'm hoping this helps others as well. :-)",34,2015-07-17 20:43:37 EDT-0400
4,I just discovered this subreddit and I already feel a rush of calm over me because I can tell this will be a great resource for me.,"Looking forward to hearing everything you all have to say and to have a community of people who understand how I feel (especially since I don't have that in my personal life)

With that being said - what are some of your strategies to discuss your anxiety / when you're anxious with people you have relationships with in real life that don't suffer from anxiety (significant others, parents, friends, coworkers)?

5,Advice needed. Can't poop with friends/partner in the house. Overnights/long weekends are painful.,"I have no idea where to post this and if you can recommend a better sub, I'll go there. The only thing I think this can be is anxiety.

I've always had this problem, but it's become a more serious issue now that I (25/F) have a boyfriend (my first, four months). He sleeps over once a week, typically for a night and all of the next day. This past weekend, he slept over two nights in a row.

I live in a studio apartment, so the bathroom is right by the living/bed area. But this has always been an issue for me, even when I've been at friends' houses and stayed overnight. If I was there for multiple days, I'd go to the college building right by there and use a zero-traffic public bathroom. When I dormed very briefly, I used a one-person occupancy stall by the lounge or waited until my roommates are gone.

At this point, it's not so much about the noise, although there is that. It's in part him/them realizing I must be pooping because of how long I take . . . but then there's also just something else. I feel like I'm in ""on"" mode or something, like I'm wired and just can't relax. I feel like I need to be constantly socializing/entertaining him (studi apartment, no wifi, no TV).  I've tried just sitting and waiting a long time whenever I do go to the bathroom (set a timer), but it doesn't work.

As soon as he leaves, literally within five minutes, I feel my body relax and I can go. I have been effortfully drinking a lot of water/eating a lot of fiber to make it easier to go. 

I love him sleeping over, but it becomes painful when I can't go and it distracts me. ",34,2015-07-20 04:55:06 EDT-0400
6,"If you're suffering - go to the doctor. I did, this is what has happened so far","I started having panic attacks early this year.

I wouldn't wish them on my worst enemy.

Everybody's panic is different - mine manifested in being convinced I would die.  If I was hot - I interpreted that as a risk of heat stroke.  I had an episode last 4-6 hours, ending in me laying naked on the bathroom floor, sopping wet from being in the shower, trying to find any way to cool down.  I was covered in goosebumps and I forgot what being cold/hot felt like.  I couldn't interpret it anymore.  I thought surely I was going to have a stroke.

If I started to think about my breathing, I was afraid I wasn't breathing enough.  I would start panicking.  It started with a numb feeling in my face, until I would get tremors that coursed through my body, thinking I was dying, that there was something wrong with me.

I would search for a pulse and if I couldn't find one (I've always had difficulty finding my pulse) I would think my heart stopped and any second, I was going to die.

If my heart was beating rapidly, I would think I was having a heart attack.

So I accommodated my anxiety more than I should of.  I couldn't stand direct sunlight anymore.  After my first public panic attack in the super market that lead me locked in a public bathroom, laying on the floor, I didn't want to leave the house anymore.

After enough attacks, I wished I would die during them, just so I wouldn't have to live in the constant fear of another attack anymore.  Death would at least offer me a reprieve.  I began seriously thinking about this - how could I live my life in such constant stress and fear?

However, through most of this, I never sought help.  I was told by my mother that I was ""more logical"" than that, to receive medication, and by others I loved that I should just ""deal with it"" on my own.

Then I spoke to some people on forums who told me:  Just get the prescription.  Just go to the doctor - get something to control it.

The stigma on medication was very negative from others in my life.  But I realized that because of this - I didn't need the strength to overcome the disease - I needed the strength to acknowledge that I needed help.  To break this habit, to stop suffering.

I went to the doctor who prescribed me a no-refill xanax prescription, 0.5 mg.  Not a daily dose.  She said take 1 if I have anxiety, 2 if I have a full-blown attack.

I read online before taking any that you shouldn't take it if you have breathing problems.  Because I am as paranoid and as scared as ever, I had a pulmonary function test (breathing test).  It didn't go too well (I fell short of the reference marks, but not too short, and I did react to one of the medications I inhaled, but not until the second-highest dose showing that I was sensitive, but likely didn't have severe asthma), but it didn't say that I had a severe problem either.  Still, my fear was strong.  I didn't take any of the drugs.

I had my 30 pills for a month.  The strange thing is during this time - I didn't have an attack.  Just the placebo effect of knowing I had a way to stop an attack IF NECESSARY made them not develop fully.  Sure, I still had episodes of me sitting around worrying, I still felt great dread at leaving the house too far, but none developed into the 5 hour crippling sense of fear and demise that lead to me being locked in my bedroom, avoiding those I loved.  I was able to go on an overnight trip, I feared being in the car a little less.  It wasn't the solution - but it was made just a little bit more bearable.

I didn't want to get 'fucked up' on these pills, but it sure was nice knowing I had a way to lessen the fear - even if I didn't take them.

Then, the time had come to take one.

It was last night.  All weekend I was in a heightened state of anxiety.  And last night it started culminating.  I was feeling very hot, which lead me to feel not like I was dying but like I was very ill, very off.  I was acting very irritated.  I started to get afraid that I would have an attack again, which only made things worse.  My boyfriend, initially against the medication, suggested I take one pill.

I did and the fear set in immediately.  What if I'm allergic?  What if I do have a breathing problem?  What if I die from this?  I drank half a beer 24 hours ago, what if they mix poorly?

For twenty minutes I lie still and repeated a mantra to myself. 

Then it worked.

In twenty minutes, I did not feel high.  I didn't feel 'fucked up.'  I simply felt calm.  

Not relaxed, not sleepy, just simply and utterly calm - I couldn't force myself into an attack.  The idea that something was seriously wrong stopped being broadcast on my consciousness.  It went out not with a bang, but with a whimper.

I had been dealing with this monster for months before seeking help, and finally, for one time, I didn't have to lie in fear.  I didn't have to coax myself into sleep just to avoid lying awake in panic.  I got to feel normal for a night, before drifting off to sleep.

I plan on enrolling in cognitive behavioral therapy once I can afford to, hopefully sometime during my next school semester - this is the optimal way of dealing with anxiety FOREVER.

In the meantime, I have a message for those suffering who have not sought help - please do.

Please do not suffer when there is something out there that can break the habit, that can offer you a sense of normalcy.  Do not abuse these drugs because if you do, their reward will be truly lost.  But do not avoid them either due to stigma.  I get it, 'white-man lab-coat medicine bad' is what I've been told all my life.  But there IS a reason that these drugs are on the market - it's because they work.

Now I feel even my state of anxiety will be lessened over time, since I have taken the pill and seen that I have no reason to fear it.  I hope at the end of my prescription, with no refills, I will have no reason to ever seek it out again.  But in the meantime, I feel truly healed.  Do not let the fear of prescription drugs prevent you from getting help like I did - start healing, and start healing today.  ",38,2015-07-20 18:29:35 EDT-0400

8,I went outside today,"I went outside today, which is big victory for me because I think people are ruthlessly criticizing me in public. I didn't talk much, but I did go to three stores. After I got home, I had some palpitations, which is usually the start of a panic attack, but I managed to calm down, and I avoided the panic attack! I think today was such a success because of the medicine I've been taking, which is: Lexapro. It's been helping my anxiety a lot. I just wanted to share my success for today.

9,Thoughts of suicide,"I experience thoughts of suicide when  my anxiety is at its worst. 

I have cystic fibrosis and while I'm doing amazing all things considered I sometimes just wish I could cease to exist.  

No more suffering.  No more pain.  

Even just posting this thread I'm filled with feelings of disappointment and inadequacy. 

I have a handle on my situation most of the time but I needed to vent.

11,"Does anyone else have that feeling you have when you can brake just in time not to hit the car in front of you when you're not paying attention, multiple times a day for minor things?","It's getting crazy. I receive a phonecall, my chest starts to hurt and feels as if it contracts, my heart is pounding, I'm ready to have a heart attack. I have to go somewhere to get some paperwork done. While walking there I get the same thing, as if I saw an axe murderer in front of me and I needed to fight him to the death.

I'm so jumpy all the time, I can't handle it anymore. The adrenaline in my body is raging. I've been declared healthy by multiple specialists but I can feel my blood pressure spiking, my muscles tensing up, especially in my neck and my arm.

Whenever I chill out I feel that it takes it's toll on my body. I get tired quickly, I'm nauseous and sick to my stomach, I eat less and therefore I'm skinny as hell. I need to find some kind of way to let off steam because it's not normal to feel all tense in resting mode. ",15,2015-07-15 15:51:52 EDT-0400

15,"""The fog"" after anxiety, anyone else?","I notice that after a long, horrendous, rough day of panic attacks and anxiousness, if I meet with people, a close friends, or close friends, I feel like I am in a fog.  I have been so wrapped in my brain, it is hard to fully cohere what is going on during a conversation.  I feel out of my body, almost high, distant or something.  Then, of course, it makes me anxious because I am thinking ""am I crazy?  I am completely sober, why do I FEEL this way?  Is something wrong with my brain?!""

16,Earworm (music stuck in your head) vs intrusive thoughts.,"I suffer from generalized anxiety, as well as obsessive and intrusive thoughts (among other things). I'm working with my therapist on not being bothered by my thoughts so much, and he brought up an interesting point. He asked if I ever have music stuck in my head, and I do - pretty much all the time. I've been playing guitar/bass for 10 years now and listen to music a lot, so it's only natural that a certain riff will stick out to me and I'll repeat it in my head over and over. He said that a lot of people are bothered by this, but I'm not. Music is music, a sequence of notes; there's nothing about it that would cause me anxiety or other negative emotions.

What surprised me is that he said that you can train yourself to see negative, intrusive thoughts the same way. Has anyone thought about this before?",5,2015-07-15 05:40:08 EDT-0400
17,Almost 21 and I can't/don't drive. It makes me feel really crappy about myself.,"I'm from NY state and the majority of people here don't drive until they are 18. When I was 18 and preparing for my road test, I went through a really bad stage where I frequently had a lot of anxiety and panic attacks. I soon stopped learning how to drive, because it was way too stressful for me and driving made me nervous. Fast forward 3 years, I'm on the brink of becoming 21 and I still can't drive. I live in the suburbs, where public transportation sucks and I rely on others to get around and it sucks. Thinking about driving during the day where there's other people and traffic makes me anxious.

For a period there, I was actually learning how to drive. I've been told I'm a good driver, technically, but when it comes to making critical decisions and driving around other cars, I get extremely anxious and it just screws everything up. I took my road test and failed due to not making enough of a full stop. After that instance , I just felt like driving was impossible for me.

It's such a simple and ordinary task but I see it as such a huge hurdle. Driving would make my life infinitely easier and overall more enjoyable, but it's such a mental roadblock for me. I see 16 yr olds driving around like nothing and I, for the life of me, cannot bring myself to actually feel confident enough to do it. I feel extremely self conscious about not having a license, and it holds me back from a lot. :/ I feel like a loser whenever I have to tell people my age I don't drive and brings down my overall self-esteem.",35,2015-07-14 23:08:52 EDT-0400

20,Saw somebody else suffering today.,"I have been suffering with anxiety and panic disorder for 10 years. In all that time I have never visibly seen somebody else suffer. Today, however, I saw somebody suffering. They had the look of distress in their face and I could see them doing breathing exercises, which I believe they were doing too fast. I wanted to help them so bad but I was thinking how I would react if somebody came up to me when I'm having an attack. I'm pretty sure if somebody told me they know what I'm going through, I wouldn't believe it.

I saw them while I was going to pick up my sibling from school. My sibling told me they had just borrowed their phone. They said some things like they ""just couldn't do it"" and were apologizing a lot. As somebody who's been punched in the face by his father just for having an anxiety attack I have to wonder if they are also in an abusive environment.

But I'm probably thinking too hard about this. I went ahead, got my sibling, and left. I figured if they were doing breathing exercises they're not clueless about their symptoms.

Should I have helped? What would you have done? How would you react if somebody walked up to you offering help during an attack?",8,2015-07-20 19:09:25 EDT-0400
21,Anxiety and digestion problems,"Hi, this particular stretch of anxiety has been going on for about a month now and for that whole time I've been unable to go to the toilet properly. I know that the adrenaline rushing though your body causes digestion abnormalities, but was wondering if anyone has found a way to overcome this. 

I'm struggling to eat as it is, and most of my anxiety is at night/in the morning so when I assume most of the digesting gets done.

I'm reluctant to go to the doctor as I've been a lot recently and they're just trying to get me to take pills which I don't think I need quite yet.

23,I was able to play my instrument while my parents were home today!,"I'm a musician that can't play her primary instrument due to expense (percussion is super pricey, so I'm probably never going to play again) so I'm learning ukulele. I love it. It makes me feel so normal and *me* to be playing music again.

But I have an intense aversion to practicing when my parents are able to hear me. If it's my boyfriend, I don't care. If it's my friends, I care a little but only if they're my musician friends. It's my parents that I absolutely refuse to practice in front of for some reason. Thanks, G.A.D....

Nowadays, of course, my mother is unemployed and home almost 24/7. So, obviously, I don't practice. Then I get into a loop of ""I don't practice, so I don't want to practice, but now I'm not good and never want to practice, because I'm still bad."" etc.

But today I was talking to one of my bosses at work about this. He's very realistic and blunt without being mean, so what he said really worked for me. He said something along the lines of, ""You don't practice because she can hear you? That's silly! Practice anyway, and if she says something condescending just say ""That's why I'm practicing!"" You're doing this for fun, right? So have fun.""

And as much as the ""just get over it"" approach doesn't work for some things, it really does help me in particular with some of my more irrational anxiety moments.

So I came home, did some homework, and by god I actually practiced for half an hour for the first time in months. *Both* my parents are home, but they're sitting out on the front porch so they can only hear me faintly. And ukulele is a lot quieter than a vibraphone, so they may not have even noticed. My dad was even pleasantly surprised to come inside and see me using my instrument. He's going deaf though, so I'm not surprised that he didn't hear it at all lol.

I'm so proud of myself. Now I just have to keep doing it! If I'd kept up practicing since this time last year when I got the thing, I'd be good at it by now. But it's better late than never, right? And who cares if my mom hears me (unless she's sleeping, I'm not a jerk)? I certainly shouldn't! Hell, she's probably pleased to hear me doing something that isn't Internetting.",1,2015-07-17 04:52:58 EDT-0400

25,Whoohoo! I did it! I made a phone call!,"I'm a high school student. I've had problems with anxiety and depression for about the last six years. I have trouble with talking to people and initiating conversations. Especially over the phone. I get stressed out and start shaking and sweating and stuttering and rambling. There are times when I even get stressed out over calling my dad. Last year, my issues waned a bit, but recently I've had problems at home, and the anxiety and depression have come back.

For a while now, I've been planning on getting a piercing. I've probably put way more thought into it than I should have, I've researched everything from piercing methods to the cultural significance of piercings throughout history (I overthink things). I knew that the hardest part would be calling ahead and finding a piercer, but that once I found one and had an actual plan, I wouldn't let myself back out of it.

I looked online; I found one. I had the number of the studio written down. I had a list of what I would say when I called. I picked up the phone and rehearsed what I would say a few times. I got a cup of coffee, lit incense, and turned on some upbeat music to help me calm down. It took me a while, and I was still shaking, but I eventually got the courage to make the phone call. Someone at the studio answered the phone, and I was able to ask my questions. It went well. I didn't stutter or ramble (at least, I *think* I didn't). I had my questions answered. I got down to the last one. ""I'm seventeen, will I need parental consent? What sort of ID will I and my parent need to bring?"" Before I could finish asking, the person on the phone cut me off, said you've got to be eighteen, and hung up. Turns out that the one thing I forgot to look up was the legal age in my state.

Normally, I would have been angry at myself for getting stressed out over nothing. Not this time. I actually made a phone call! It seems like a ridiculous thing to be proud of, but I am. Less than a week ago, I almost passed out on an elevator because I was still stressed out over ordering coffee five minutes earlier. This time, I found ways to calm myself down. I did something that was difficult for me. It might have just been a simple phone call, and it may have ended up being a bit of a waste of time, but it feels big!

31,I passed my driving test!,"I've seen a few posts about this on here so I just wanted to share some encouragement.

I've been trying to pass my test for 4 years now. An ex boyfriend taught be how to drive when I was 21 and then he broke up with me the day before my first test. That started a long spiral of massive anxiety surrounding the test.

I passed on my 6th try but I've been to the dmv many more times than that. So many times I hyperventilated in the parking lot and couldn't even bring myself to go in the building.

What worked for me? It's hard to say, it took a lot of time and a lot of failure. I always failed for stupid mistakes that I normally wouldn't have made if I was feeling relaxed and focused. This time I took it early in the morning. I was the very first appointment of the day. In the past I've had to wait in my car for over an hour just to get my turn to take it. The waiting is what killed me. Normally I work but I'm on a break so I was able to go as soon as they open and just pull up and go. I didn't have time to analyze or overthink, I got there and I was going.

Throughout the test I took a lot of steadying breaths. I've been practicing mindfulness and anytime my mind started to wander I would take a deep breath and try to focus back on myself in the present moment.

I also was taking it with the instructor who had already failed me twice. I had an internal monologue of ""Fuck this guy, who the fuck does he think he is?"" going the entire time and that honestly helped too, lol.

Anyway i'm just driving to work and the store and stuff for now but I wanted to provide some words of encouragement for those of you in the same boat. I honestly never thought that I would pass it. I didn't think it was possible. If I can do it, you certainly can too!",24,2015-06-20 00:23:58 EDT-0400

But I can't seem to keep it up. In my adult life, I haven't managed to go more than a few months at a time before having an episode that affects my work performance. 

I'm diagnosed with Boderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar II, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD. I seem to be right on the line between functional, and disabled.

I'm currently employed at a summer seasonal job for the 2nd year in a row. It's a stressful job to start with, but I also work longer hours, and have more responsibility this year.

About a month ago, I lost an immediate family member, and all of my problems at at their peak. I can tell I'm on the verge of a breakdown, and I need to change something. I've been trying various medications and therapies since I was 13 years old. I'm 26, and still sick.

38,Being chained to the approval of others is killing me inside. How can I free myself?,"I feel so scared all the time.  So many obligations.  So much work to do to make something out of my career.  So poor, so alone, so lonely, so tired.

Today I saw my ex-girlfriend has someone now.  I loved her, a sick part of me always will.  

My anxiety is paralyzing me, keeping me from moving forward.  I care so much about what other people think that the concept of pleasing everyone feels like a physical weight that's sitting on my chest.  Fearing that I'm not making them happy is making me freeze up.  The thought of disapproval stings me like a thousand needles.

To top it off, I'm sick - got nonallergic rhinitis, and if past years are any indication, it'll last another month or two or three before it vanishes again once the weather gets drier.  Sleep does nothing - I'm tired all the time.  My head hurts, my sinuses ache, I can barely think, I have trouble breathing.  All I want is sleep and sleep does nothing.

I'm freelance, so my employment is irregular.  I'm too paralyzed to look for new work, so my funds are draining as the bills rise.

I've worked so freaking hard in the past, come a long way, but still have basically nothing to show for it.

This past week I've been running and hiding, in video games, in Netflix, in junk food, anything to distract myself from the pressure weighing down on my chest, from my thumping heart, from the sense of dread.  Hiding from all the voices that call out to me, from the eyes that stare at me with disapproval.    

I can't even meditate.  Being alone with my thoughts is...impossible.  The idea of sitting silent and still with nothing to distract me spikes my anxiety through the roof.

I want to be free of what others think, but I don't know how.  I don't know how to free myself.  How can I free myself?  I WANT TO FREE MYSELF!!!

I don't have anger issues, in fact most people say I'm extremely calm in most situations. I guess I just want to let it out, but something keeps me from saying what I want to say in most situations. Maybe it was the way I was raised. Because of this I'm not really sure how to express anything but blind agreement such as ""yah"" and ""sure"" and I feel like I am misrepresenting my true self. When I ask people if I should stop being how I am they tell me ""No, you're great how you are you're so nice!"" But yet I don't think anyone knows the true me.

48,"On being ""immune"" to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","I don't ""know all the tricks"" (as in ""a therapist seeing another therapist""); I just find them all easily rationalizable/identifiable as such. When trying to apply some agreed-upon exercise: it's as if I have various conscious levels operating simultenously (as a matter of fact, this is how my mind always works). Even if I could convince the lower level conscience to try something, I couldn't avoid the upper levels to ruin it all (convincingly showing me that this is only a little stupid trick, that one has to be too weak in self-knowledge to be able to fall to this one, etc.)

The arguments are very reasonable and persuasive, and I wonder how can therapeutic interventions like CBT be actually so effective on a rational, logical, hopelessly analytical mind. In particular, the claim that *every* depressed/anxious person have delusional minds, their disorders resulting from spurious thought processes/unreasonable assumptions, sounds offensive to me.

I'm not even claiming that I have an above average intelligence. Just pointing out how my mind actually works and suspecting that I'm not alone here. I'm tired of being (implicitly) accused of being actively sabotaging the therapy, as if the CBT was made to fit all kinds of human minds, every failure having to do with the patient's ""unwillingness to comply to its standard.""",16,2015-06-21 17:39:20 EDT-0400

51,Just want to throw out a reminder that we're all in this together.,"I want to say this because in the past week or so, I've seen some unbelievably nasty and belittling comments around here. I won't link to any in particular because that would be brigading and just send out more bad vibes overall, but it's happening. There are comments floating around that read: 

>Then why the hell don't you do something about it?

>You're a cry baby. Grow up

> it is likely that the people around you are trying to help you and that you are being abusive to them. I did the same thing. You do not need to control all the people around you. Learn to relax.

And probably the worst I've come across in a while:

>These days people who truly suffer from debilitating anxiety are now lost in the sea of attention seekers. These are the same fucks who have taken the word trigger out of context and now use it for their own gain.

It's not cool. **Really** not cool.

Also to note, some of these are days old and I've reported them but they're still around - this isn't the kind of stuff that needs to be seen in a forum for support like this. There is no context in which any of those comments can be seen as helpful or supportive.

My rule I've followed: You give **everyone** the benefit of the god damn doubt. We don't know each other here but we all just want to be understood. I know it's the internet, but the whole ""if you've got nothing nice to say"" rule still applies if you ask me.

If you yourself have been the recipient of hateful shit like this, then I want you to know that you deserve better. Words can hurt - people don't always get it, but they can hurt through the internet too. Especially in a place like this where we come for just the tiniest sense of safety that we're desperate for in our actual everyday lives.

If anyone has ever told you to grow up, or that you're an attention-seeker, or tried to turn the blame around on YOU for your anxiety, then they're all wrong. I know me saying ""don't let it get to you"" doesn't mean a whole lot, but it should be known that there are still those of us that do understand.

This sub's done me some real good and it hurts to see this kind of vitriol thrown around. So just remember, a lot of us are fighting a similar fight, so kindness and understanding are the most important things to keep in mind - in our outside of this sub.

54,I spend so much time living in the past and fearing the future. It's exhausting. Here is a simple exercise I learned today.,"I constantly worry and stress out. Thinking about the past, fearing it will happen again in my future, catastrophizing, over generalizing, trying to guess what other people think of me, trying to guess the tones of texts and emails and assuming the worst, hating myself, giving myself a hard time for minor mistakes...

I am tired!! I can't live like this anymore!I'm not living life, I'm just enduring it. 

So I went to my new therapist, and he said to ask yourself questions so you stay present.  If we stay present we won't bring up the negativity of our past and associate it with our future. Also, it keeps us logical - using the information we currently have in our surrounding environment.

Emotions stay out of it! 

Here are some of the ones I've been using:

What is in front of you?
What do you see?
What do you hear?


And answer yourself. 

And every time you venture back into the past or try to predict the future, or guess what someone is thinking, stop yourself and ask yourself these questions. Keep doing it every time you time travel.

I'm really liking it.

Every bit helps.

Edit: Glad this is helping people! A study showed that people with anxiety and depression have a difficult time with cognitive functions. Their perception of reality is distorted and it effects how they feel.  We have to stop letting our emotions control our thoughts. Stay logical!  I'm currently reading a great book called ""Feeling Good"" By David Burns.  It is transformative.  It will tell you about cognitive distortions (black or white thinking, overgeneralizing, labeling, fortune telling, mind reading...) and what to do about them.

58,"I have panic disorder with agoraphobia, and today I went out and did some stuff","It sucked, but hey, I did some stuff. 

I got in my car and drove to the liquor store. I'd never been inside, I don't drink, but I needed vodka for cleaning the tank of my electronic cigarette. See, I love smoking, its my favorite anxiety security blanket, but I also hate smoking and want to quit so I am going to try to switch to an electronic cigarette. 

The liquor store scared the crap out of me and my heart was pounding and my legs feel like jello and my head was swimming, but I got a little bottle of the cheapest vodka I could find and made it back out. 

Next, I went down the street and bought cigarettes. Ha! I I realize that I won't be able to make this transition all at once so I need to be prepared and I'm going to have to do this gradually. Sadly, one of my biggest anxieties is strange things and chemicals, and even though I know exactly what's in the nicotine juice mix, and even though there's 5000 more chemicals that I don't know in a cigarette, its still something different and I don't like different. 

Did I mention that I hit every single red light on the way to the liquor store and the quick stop? Not just pulling up to a red light, I'm talking they were all turning yellow as I got there so I had to sit through the full cycles. 

After leaving the quick stop I decided I would go to the vapor store for the first time and get some ejuice. Would you believe that in the half a mile it took to get there I had to stop, pinned in on all sides by traffic, while I waited for a train to pass. Not once, as it passed over both of the roads I needed to take, so I had to wait for the same train to pass twice. I was not amused. 

I still persevered and made it to the vape shop, where inside I had a 2nd full on shaking, dreamlike, crushing chest pain panic attack. But explained my panic attacks right of the bat and the employees were very kind. 

I made it back home with my vodka, my cigarettes, and a new bottle of nicotine juice that I currently can't even look at without feeling anxious (I'll tackle that another day).

But today, even though it really sucked, I left my house and I did some stuff.

Tldr: Left my house, drove to 3 places (2 of them I'd never been in), hit every red light and 2 trains, had awful panic attacks, lived through the whole uncomfortable ordeal. Yay? ",44,2015-08-27 19:31:03 EDT-0400

The interviewer asked me about this gap and I made up some lame excuse about my parents being disabled and having to take care of them (they are disabled, but not as badly as I made it seem). I didn't like that excuse, and I don't think the interviewer did either.

Yet they took my medication away and isolated me till my mum came to pick me up and told me not to come to school for at least two months. Even after the doctor said I am fit to go now. 
When I had a panic attack their were people touching me and talking all at once at me, someone even threw water on my face, and I think this escalated the situation. My principal tells me that people will touch me in situations like this even though the fact I haven't given consent and have asked against it is a very important factor.
My exams are close I'll be missing valuable classes and the worst part if I sit at home for so long and not interact I am scared of developing Agoraphobia. I just don't know how to handle this situation. Has anyone else been through something like this? I just feel like they're punishing me for something that is out of my control and something I'm getting medication and proper help for.

63,I'm a self-proclaimed Facebook addict...and today I deactivated my account.,"I have been struggling with anxiety for years now.  Like most of us do, I've had ups and downs...times where it's off the charts and times where it's somewhat under control.  For the last few weeks my anxiety seems heightened.  I'm more sensitive to triggers and seem to generally be carrying that heavy feeling with me each day.  I believe a lot of my anxiety is stemming from my grandmother passing 3 weeks ago; she was a massive part of my life since I was born.  Much like a second mom, but with all the benefits of being a grandmother.  On top of that, my dog got very sick this week and spent two days at the vet.  For a bit, it was a little dicey.  It turned out to be mushroom toxicity (she found some in the yard) and she's made a full recovery.  She's already back to her normal self.

I've been on Facebook since its birth.  I love it.  I enjoy all aspects of social media.  I love the engagement, I love the ever-changing content.  Over the last few years, though, I've noticed a difference in these things.  Facebook is used by people, businesses, news stations as a way of generating popularity and engagement regardless of the content that's being shared.  Every time I log on, SOMETHING triggers my anxiety.  This may sound bad, but I don't want to hear about a mother and daughter duo from Wisconsin that is going through chemotherapy together.  I live in Massachusetts - 5 years ago this story would never have been in my life.  I don't want to hear about a dog that was brutally beaten and shot in Florida.  These things trigger my anxiety...and I don't need that.  It seems that news stations have stopped sharing ACTUAL news...instead they share sad, viral stories from across the world just to get people to click.  Facebook has become filled with so much negative content that is not relevant to my daily life.  For some, that's okay...they have the tools to be able to keep scrolling through their feed without letting it affect them.  For me, it's not okay.  Right now, I don't have the tools to be able to combat these triggers.  I'm working on it, but I'm not there yet.

So, this morning, I deactivated my Facebook account.  I have been having the weirdest urge to cry since I've done it.  I don't think it's a sad cry, though...it feels more like the urge to happy cry.  It's like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.  I plan to remain off of Facebook for a few weeks.  I want to see what it does to me and I will reevaluate after that.  Something tells me I won't miss it.  I will keep my Instagram account.  Instagram actually tends to cheer me up.  Beautiful pictures, funny pictures, inspiring pictures...without all the viral negativity.  A different kind of social media.

I shared this with my mom and sister, who also suffer from anxiety.  My sister had already deactivated her account months ago and urged me to do the same.  My mom was contemplating deactivating her account for months and decided to take the plunge with me.  She's officially deactivated, too.  To anyone that has been contemplating the same, I invite you to jump onboard the bandwagon.  I don't need Facebook controlling my life and my emotions, I'd like to go back to doing that myself.",16,2015-08-27 17:32:51 EDT-0400
64,How can I make my anxiety easier on my boyfriend?,"Background: I am 21F and have had moderate GAD and OCD since I was a small child. I have anxiety attacks a few times per year, and feel a fairly regular level of anxiety day to day. I feel like I manage it decently well, especially in the past couple of years. 

Ok - Something that's been troubling me for a year now. My SO and I are planning to get married soon, but this is still a lingering problem I want to resolve the best I can before getting married. 

I feel like I have to maintain a constant balance of how much of my anxiety I let my boyfriend in on, and how much of it I bottle up so he doesn't have to deal with it. Does anyone else find themselves doing this? It's like when anxiety sets in, and my chest feels tight and the backs of my hands start to hurt (you know the feeling), I suddenly have to make a judgement call of ""is this worth telling him about? Or should I just pretend I'm okay and panic in the car by myself later?"" because I don't want to put too much on him, or bring him down. 

He says I can always talk to him, and can always come to him. Which is awesome, he is really supportive. But I feel like constantly dumping my anxiety on him will just wear him down, and maybe make us both unhappy. But I also don't want to always deal with it alone, or feel like I'm hiding my feelings or bottling things all the time. 

Thoughts? 

TL;DR - how much of my anxiety should I let my boyfriend deal with? Is there a point where it goes from healthy to unhealthy to be regularly open with him about my anxiety?",15,2015-08-25 00:44:34 EDT-0400

I always feel the urge to "" start over "" and just make a new email and all new accounts to purge my history away. I really don't understand why I feel this way. Paranoia? What else? I am generally anxious and definitely suffer from severe social anxiety but I am not diagnosed or on any medication and doubt I can afford treatment or even the transportation to get there at the moment.


Today I was thinking about my steam account and how I once made a payment with my parents credit card 7 years ago after giving them cash and somehow the account is soiled and I need to start over and only make purchases using my personal credit card attached to my name. I also would relegate that existing account to a secondary email address but would rarely or never access it again. 


Another recent example is that I purchased a Wii U about a year ago and I spent two weeks agonizing over a good online username for my account. I ended up making 6 or 7 accounts and deleting each one because I didn't like it or I was feeling dysphoric about the mii character I created and my conflicted gender identity. Instead of coming up with a account name I just formatted the system and have not touched it in months despite wanting to play games.


Another situation is that I had a tumblr account where I posted random things and on there you can tag each post so it can be found later or identified. Like if you post a selfie you can tag the actual post with the word selfie. The thing that bothered me was that all these tags are automatically saved and pop up if you decide to use them later. That really bothered me and I deleted my account. Instead of making a new account I just haven't gone on that site even though I really want to.


Just writing about this stuff is making me feel better but I know I need to work on it. Thanks for the replies everyone.

73,My favorite takeaway so far from The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook,[deleted],6,2015-08-28 03:39:10 EDT-0400
74,Any change in my life upsets me greatly and it's really hard to deal with. Not sure if it's normal.,"To start, I'm a 21 y/o female with GAD, panic disorder, depression, OCD, and ADD.  
I've found that change is really difficult for me to deal with.  I'll get into a routine, and when I have to change that routine it makes me feel really uncomfortable and anxious.  It's become a problem with jobs for me.  I had a job a few months ago that I kept for about a month and then quit because it was too anxiety-inducing, I think because they wouldn't give me a schedule for some reason? I just had to wait for them to call and tell me I was working the next day, which really threw me off.  I quit because of the unpredictability, which I honestly don't know how anyone can handle.  

I just got hired at a new part-time job last Thursday.  I had training yesterday and have my second day of training today.  I've been having anxiety attack after anxiety attack, even though it's a fairly low-stress, food service job.  The entire day before I have a shift, at any job, I am completely unable to enjoy my day at all. The thought of having something to do later in the day completely overrides any positive feeling I might have.  Yesterday's training wasn't even bad, just a bit boring, which is to be expected.  I just don't want to spend all day today in a depression about my night I'm used to being interrupted. It makes me feel horrible because when I bring up my concerns with anyone they just say something like ""yeah that's life, work isn't supposed to be fun"" or something.  I know it's not supposed to be fun, but I don't think it should cause me so much distress even when I'm not there. 

It's strange because it's not just work this happens with.  Any obligation I have, like a get-together with friends, my family coming to town, plans to go out to dinner with my boyfriend, etc. will have the same effect on me the entire day.  I feel paralyzed, unable to accomplish anything the whole day because I'm just anticipating what's going to happen later. I'm really sick of so much of my time being wasted because of this.

80,Is anyone else absolutely terrified of the passage of time?,"Thinking about the future, how uncertain it is, who/what will matter to me in 5/10/15/20 years, about where my friends and family and ex lovers and the entirety of mankind will be...It terrifies me more than anything. Just typing this fills me with dread and brings tears to my eyes. I genuinely don't know why. I can't enjoy the present anymore because I'm so fucking scared of the future. Not even potential bad things in the future, just the future in general and knowing my entire life will pass by inevitably. I dwell on this daily and it's seriously taking a toll on me. People say ""don't worry, you can't control it so don't bother stressing"" but I can't stop.

In particular I worry about my ex girlfriend's future, I guess because I love her, but she's out of my life. I worry I'll forget about her, and then I worry I won't forget about her. Maybe this whole thing revolves around her. Losing someone I wanted in my life might have warped my perception of the future. I don't know... heartbreak + anxiety is a serious recipe for disaster.

Sorry for the rant, I've just felt bottled up for ages and I don't have many people to share this with (plus I sound like an obsessive loon)",24,2015-12-18 06:30:32 EST-0500
81,Had a panic attack and... crashed my car,"It took me 7 years of lessons and 4 tests to get my licence only earlier this year. I had been awake since 4am for work, and had been driving for four hours to a big city for the first time. Around 7pm I got lost there, took the wrong exit and had to travel a fair distance to a roundabout only to eventually take the same wrong exit again. (Thanks Sat nav)

Frustrated, shaking and crying, I went too quickly around a corner I didn't see coming soon enough, after cutting someone off from a slip lane and lost control of my car. It spun a few times and crashed into a wall at the side of a dual carriageway before a tunnel. The bumper came off and the back was scratched a lot but, I was unhurt and no other cars were involved. 


Two ladies came out to help me, one of them being the person I cut off. They basically discussed with each other in front of me how I was driving like a crazy person while also getting help for me. 


I have never been so ashamed or frightened. I've been shaking and crying since it happened yesterday. I feel like, as someone who already suffers from anxiety, this is me totally mentally fucked now. I'm on edge, I feel immense guilt for the people I could have potentially hurt if I'd swerved into the road instead and I feel completely useless as a driver and by extension a functioning member of society. And isn't it just the worst when one of your worst paranoid fears actually comes to fruition? I'd had so many nightmares about crashing I was actually half expecting to wake up at any moment.


Driving anxiety is something I took a long time learning to control, but now I feel I'm back to square one. No, square negative one. I don't want to drive anywhere ever again. The worst part was, when my car was spinning all I could think was ""I fucking KNEW I'd die in a stupid way like this"" 


So I have to find a new way home from the city for work on Monday, face my parents who gifted me the car and also find a way to get to their home for Christmas without my car. 


Has anyone else been in an accident? Did you start driving again soon after? Did you need counselling? If you were liable how do you get over the guilt and feeling of uselessness?


Thanks for reading. Merry fuckin' Christmas.",25,2015-12-19 22:01:45 EST-0500
82,Does anyone else think they are dying because of everything?,"I'm young, only 19. Was diagnosed with depression a couple of years ago after a suicide attempt. I started realizing I've always had anxiety problems. There always seems to be something about my body that makes me think I am dying. My toes are always red or my fingernails are redder then usually. Or my breathing is to shallow etc. I always think I have heart problems or cancer etc. I go to the doctor often and she always tells me I'm to young for heart problems/ cancer. She'll do a check up and tell me I'm fine and that it's my anxiety and il feel better for a bit untill I get back into the same slump again. Is there anyone else in the same boat? I feel so alone, none of my friends ever have problems like this I feel like such a fuck up.",27,2015-12-17 17:32:27 EST-0500
83,FINALLY got to see a counsellor and I feel like the huge black cloud has been lifted a bit.,"I've been trying for so long, and been trying really hard this past year especially, to see someone. I've been to the public mental health centre three times in the past year, as well as visited the ER, talked with my doctor, and called the crisis line multiple times. I live in Canada though where our mental health services are incredibly overburdened and underfunded so people like me who are ""functioning"" (able to go to work, have a general grasp on what some of the issues are) get kind of left behind. 

I tried to search for counsellors out of the public health network, knowing I'd probably have to pay out of pocket and just eat the cost (over $100 per session), but they all seemed to be very specialised - things like drug addiction, domestic abuse, marital counselling, children and youth. I kept getting phone numbers for places that would just never work out as I didn't ""fit"". 

My coworker's young daughter is seeing a counsellor in town that I'd never heard of for her anxiety and my coworker seemed to be really happy with her, so I got the number and gave her a call. She got me in within a week and I finally saw her yesterday. 

It was so nice to get my whole situation put into perspective. My workplace is a bit of a toxic environment - well that's an understatement - but I feel like no one else from head office sees that. It was starting to make me feel a bit crazy and just out of control of myself. She confirmed that yeah it's not right at all, showed me how this is totally a textbook thing, and gave me some tools to help deal with it. Also gave me some exercises to help with my anxiety when I'm having an attack, and just to help calm my brain down. 

Today at work has been like a complete 180. I actually enjoy being at work, I'm calm. Some of the main offenders haven't really bothered me as much as they did, and I feel motivated (for once!). I don't know if it helped just having someone listen to me, but it is liberating. Today I'm not living under a black cloud, I know it may come back but I'm going to enjoy today. ",15,2015-12-16 23:50:53 EST-0500
84,Is anxiety trendy?,"Lately, I've been seeing a lot of social media making jokes about anxiety  and always wanting to stay inside, and not have friends, nor enjoying socializing. I feel like it's becoming ""cool"" to be anxious and uncomfortable all the time. I find myself getting upset whenever I see that kind of stuff, especially when I see friends who are totally normal posting it. It's almost like the populace is jealous of those with anxiety because they get to live that ""comical"" lifestyle. It's not comical, and should not be viewed as a ""cute"" quality for someone to have.

Anxiety already has a bad reputation as attention seeking, and I don't think social media's portayal is helping to change that.

I understand that seeing the anxiety as humorous can make it easier for people to get through it, so I don't want to sound like I'm miffed by the existence of anxiety humor.

Does anyone else get that ""anxiety is cute and fun to talk about now"" vibe? Or have an opinion to share in general? 

Edit: everyone in the world experiences anxiety, so I'm not trying to sound self centered, just concerned that it's becoming ""cute"" rather than ""tragic"". ",48,2015-12-18 01:48:16 EST-0500
85,The fear of negative emotions is more painful than emotions themselves,"I'm beginning to realize that I am filled with more pain, worry, and discomfort from being afraid of negative emotions, than by how those emotions would actually feel. I worry so much about a potentially negative outcome (that probably won't even happen) and how that would feel.

For example, when speaking in front of a group, I worry that I will misspeak and embarrass myself. The weeks I spend worrying about this causes knots in my stomach to the point of nausea, and eventual dread of the speech. If I were to actually misspeak, which most of us do, it is likely that the group won't even notice, care or judge me for it. But even in the case that they do judge me, and I am embarrassed, this embarrassment may last a few hours or days.  The severity of the embarrassment is not improved by adding additional weeks to that pain preparing for it. If anything, by hyping it up so much, I've made it feel much worse. 
Another example: I feel terrified that my partner will leave me when he finds someone 'better'. But when I think about how it would actually feel to be left, feel hurt, and have to put myself back together - it is probably less unpleasant than the amount of time and energy I've spent making myself sick over it! Not to mention the amount of distraction worrying can cause in other area of my life.  And by worrying about it, I'm actually doubling the amount of time this issue is affecting me!

When 'battling' with my thoughts and inner dialogue, I find that it is a worthwhile exercise to consider how I would respond to a loved one. If a good friend of mine comes up and says ""Hey! I'm freaking out! I'm SO nervous about this presentation! What if I embarrass myself! What do I do?!"" Would I response with ""OMG! You have every reason to worry! Ahh!! Let's freak out! You're never going to survive that!""...Of course not. I would tell them ""Hey, no need to work yourself up about this so much. It's not doing you any good. Maybe you can work on the presentation more to make sure you're more confident in your words. Otherwise, maybe you can work on some other projects that need your attention right now, since you've done all the preparation you can do for this presentation. Would you like a hug? Let's get a cup of tea."" So rarely do we respond with the kind of kindness and compassion that we would a friend. 

By allowing myself to ruminate on these worries, I'm only doing myself a disservice. I'm not mitigating the risk of the outcome at all and I'm only making myself feel awful for longer.  I'm very thankful for my meditation and mindfulness practice that have allowed me to calm my fears down before they spiral out of control. Don't get me wrong - it hasn't been overnight - it's taken years of practice. But little by little I'm able to get my emotions under control instead of allowing them to control me.",8,2015-12-15 23:12:03 EST-0500
86,How to deal with the physical effects of anxiety?,"Hey all,

I'm well experienced with anxiety, but after a few 'good' months I'm now struggling to cope with all the physical effects of prolonged anxiety. It's generalised anxiety, but I wake up every morning feeling like I have an exam or a job interview the same day. 

My heart beats too quickly, I feel sick so eating is a struggle, I've had diarrhoea (sorry TMI!) for weeks now and I can't sleep past about 6am because the anxiety wake me up, floods my system with adrenaline and then refuses to let me go back to sleep. It's constant and unrelenting and I just don't know what to do.

I'm getting so worried about the long term health effects this is going to have - being prescribed beta blockers isn't an options because I have asthma and although I have diazepam, I can't take it frequently!

Any advice on dealing with this would be so so good, I'm really struggling :(",42,2015-12-20 13:43:46 EST-0500

I made the decision to take a short walk around the sidewalk, which is something I've never done.

I'm on antidepressants, and have been for about 7 months, but they just don't seem to be working at all anymore...

92,"There's a quote in the movie, ""The Voices"", which is somewhat reassuring.","There's a scene in the movie ""The Voices""(featuring Ryan Reynolds) where Jerry, the main character, kidnaps his therapist and takes her to a field. Jerry asks his therapist why he hears voices and she tells him. ""A lot of people hear voices, or thoughts they can't stop. It might be a voice telling them they're worthless or stupid or it could tell them to indulge every desire... I can't shut them off entirely, nor do I want to... but I can argue against them. Just because you have thoughts, you don't have to act on them"".

I've had anxiety for years and I've suffered from low self-esteem. I've battled with thoughts that try to bring me down. This quote reassures me that I don't have to give in to these negative feelings.

96,DAE only feel like interacting with people when you are drinking alcohol?," So my problem is that I suffer with social anxiety and drink is the only thing that helps remotely. I have tried anti-depressants and they didn't work. I can't do CBT because I don't have the money for it. The only thing that ever makes me remotely comfortable around most people is alcohol. When I don't drink, I'm quiet, irritable and keep to myself, except when I meet with my only good friend for a coffee because I don't experience any anxiety around him. 


I go red extremely easily and generally avoid people as much as possible, especially those more extroverted than me. But as soon as I have 1 or 2 beers, I become the person I want to be. I can go to the bar, interact and not worry about going red or struggling to make conversation. 


I am 25 years old now and running out of time to deal with this issue which has blighted me since I was 15. I coped in school because I was lucky enough to be around  a few good friends people all of the time so my shyness never got too bad, well not as bad as it is now.  


Unfortunately the problem worsened significantly throughout college and I spent my college life as a hermit, keeping to myself almost completely. 


I have literally missed out on what everyone says are the best days of their lives. It's not as if I wasn't alive or doing anything in those times, I had a girlfriend for 3 years and kept in touch with my mates weekly - but we always drank together. But now i'm single and my friends are becoming more distant as they settle down with partners and my problem is getting worse.


I am unemployed and thus don't get much practise with overcoming my anxiety seeing as most of my interaction is either done with my mate who I'm not shy around or with others while i'm drinking. At this point I feel like I wouldn't even be able to cope with going through an interview to get a job. I wish I could be the same sober as I am tipsy or drunk. I really don't understand why I act all irritable and anti-social without drink and content and happy without it. No other substance does that for me. 

I don't know what help I'm looking for, or even what help exists - is all hope lost at 25 though?",9,2015-12-15 02:41:57 EST-0500
97,Does anyone else almost shut down during extreme cases of anxiety?,"I'm in a general state of anxiety most of the time.  Sometimes though when the load becomes too much and I physically feel like my body can't take it anymore, it just stops and I'm almost indifferent.  The first time I really noticed was a few years ago.  I had just separated, was trying to take care of my son half the week, 2 dogs, a house, my dad who lived with me, while working 2 jobs, one that required me to be up at 4, the other getting me home late at night.  In the midst of this my father had a massive heart attack and ended up in cardiac ICU in a hospital 45 minutes away.  So many days I'd be up at 4, work, drive 45 minutes to see my dad, then drive back to the house to let out the dogs, drive 30 minutes in the opposite direction to my other job.  On off days I'd be trying to make it up to the dogs for their neglect, clean, make sure my son was fed and paid attention to. I would sob the whole time while driving, thinking I would rather be dead because I couldn't hold it all together.  And then one day it was like it was done, it was like I couldn't care anymore.  While it's not been as extreme in recent years, I still notice when a lot is going on that my anxiety will ramp up to the point I feel like my body is unable to handle it and is going to keel over, then I fall into a depression for a few days unable to care about anything until I'm back to my regular everyday worry.",8,2015-12-20 20:15:29 EST-0500
98,Counselors telling me to be more religious,"Hi, I live in the Philippines and almost everyone here is religious. Every time I go see a counselor I open up to them about my anxieties.

In the Philippines' subreddit, someone suggested that I go checkout this well-known therapy place. I called and found out theyre all about seeking closeness wiTh God. They even asked me if I wanted to talk to a priest!!! The mere thought of asking for help from a professional is now giving me anxiety because all of the ones I've talked to suggests that I should become more religious. I think they only take the ones that are borderline suicidal seriously. I really just need someone to talk to and possibly get some meds because I've been anxious ever since I can remember.

We played super mario bros and talked about life and ate food. And the whole time I was subconsciously freaking out, I had constant negative thoughts. Like oh no, he's checking his phone, am I being too boring? Or is he talking to someone else? Unnecessary worries. But I got through it, we had a great day, regardless of my anxiety.

At the moment the most significant anxiety is with his job -- it's a fairly low level receptionist role, where he is almost always bored or stressed to some degree. He hates it and it is making his mental health worse. He has had incidents of self-harm and suicidal thoughts because of how much he hates it. But he seems paralyzed when it comes to finding something else, or even considering that he can leave. He is convinced that he hasn't got any skills or  interests worth perusing and that he's just ""stupid"" and that's why he can't figure out how to leave. 

I help him as much as I can, talking him down from his worst moments of self-hatred and trying to be present and communicative while also not enabling his spirals. But I can't do everything. I've tried to talk him into seeing a doctor, but the mental health services in our area are shockingly bad and oversubscribed (a wait of 6 months+ for a therapist) and we can't afford to go private. Every time he manages to work himself up to going, he's told that there's nothing they can do and he will have to deal with it. Last September he actually attempted suicide and we tried to get him access to services, but again he was told they can't do anything unless he tries again or is willing to go into hospital. 

Despite all of this, he doesn't seem to realise that his anxiety is an illness or that it's even not normal to spend 90% of your time either anxious, miserable or angry. 

What I think would help would be some literature on recognizing this -- can you recommend a book, an article or something that helped *you* realise what's going on in your head? What do you wish you could have been told to help you manage your anxiety?

Thanks in advance. It's great to know this community exists.",11,2015-05-07 15:46:47 EDT-0400
115,Low/no-pressure hobbies that help keep you grounded,"I've noticed that it's easier for me to get/stay calm when I'm engaged in some kind of task that's challenging or absorbing enough to hold my attention but not so difficult or saddled with expectations that it makes me anxious. Walking and running, in particular, have been pretty good stress- and expectation-free activities for me; I find that going for a run when I start to feel anxious, and just taking at least one long walk a day, help me stay ""grounded"" or balanced. (Conversely, I am more likely to get ""derailed"" on days when I haven't or can't walk/run.)

However, going for a run to alleviate an impending 2 AM anxiety attack is out of the question, so I'm currently in search of a new low-key, no-pressure activity or hobby to engage in when anxiety strikes in the wee hours. Calligraphy, maybe, or origami or something.

And that got me to wondering: **Do you also have a ""stabilizing"" hobby of sorts?**

**How did you get into it, and how do you sustain it? And are there specific ways in which it has helped you manage your anxiety?**",52,2015-05-01 22:13:26 EDT-0400
116,Does anyone else shop at midnight?,I go to the store for groceries late at night usually 10 pm to early morning to avoid people being there.

But I understand this isn't healthy per say. :( I want to shop whenever I want not only late.,8,2015-05-06 00:08:36 EDT-0400
117,"sorry, just want to rant about health anxiety for a minute","this'll just be quick, as I'm trying to sleep, but when it comes to my health anxiety I feel pretty embarrassed talking about it to people in my life, so I thought maybe it'd help to vent about it to strangers on the internet, discounting how silly the fears are, right?

I suffer from primarily obsessional OCD so most of my thoughts are loops, I start thinking of something and being frightened of it, then that transcends into believing it's true, I'll get caught up on whatever it is, obsess over it bla bla.

anyway, off the top of my head, right now I'm convinced I'm suffering from lung cancer, a brain tumor, pneumonia, sinus infection causing inflammation of the brain and I think there's a tumor in my back.

it's frustrating. i'm not even really afraid to die. it's just sickness, or anything health related that freaks me out. I wanted to get an apple watch but I read that it reads your heart rate, so i'll be passing on that...

It's tough, because I can't even listen to my girlfriend talking about seeing her doctor yesterday without feeling really uncomfortable, and all i've been doing really since february is sleeping all day to avoid the stress. it's just lame, i'm over it, but being over it gives me no peace of mind.",12,2015-05-02 00:56:45 EDT-0400

130,"How becoming ""Yes Man"" helped me.","Hey /r/anxiety ! A few months ago, I was watching *""Yes Man""* with Jim Carrey and thought to myself, *""Man, I could never do something like this, everything is so unplanned and everything must be so stressful !""*

I went to bed thinking about it and woke up the next morning, telling myself that I should probably at least try to be *that* guy.

College having just started (September), there was obviously a lot of parties and events. I am the kind of guy that has quite a lot of friends, knows a lot of people and that is known to be happy in general.

But during my 5 years of high-school, I have been to exactly **zero** parties because it would cause me intense panic attacks. I would always find excuses to avoid it since people were wondering why I'd never show up.

I realized that it's not a way to live for a 19 years old guy. So since College started, I forced myself to go to *every* parties and events. 

Every times someone invited me to a party, an event, or just going to eat somewhere, I'd say *""Yeah, absolutely""*.

As expected panic attacks ensued, but hey, at least that was some sort of progress, right ?

Fast forward a few weeks, I was in a party, sitting outside with a few friends while most people were still inside. As I was sitting there, enjoying myself, talking with people I enjoy being with, I suddenly realized how far I had come since a year ago.

At this moment, I remembered a quote that I really like 

*""Sometimes we focus so intently on our destination, that we forget just how far we've come.""*

So here I was, in a party, on a friday night, instead of being home, happy and most importantly, without any signs of anxiety.

some Whatifs crawled inside my ear

and pranced and partied all night long

and sang their same old Whatif song:

Whatif I'm dumb in school?

Whatif they've closed the swimming pool?

Whatif I get beat up?

Whatif there's poison in my cup?

Whatif I start to cry?

Whatif I get sick and die?

Whatif I flunk that test?

Whatif green hair grows on my chest?

Whatif nobody likes me?

Whatif a bolt of lightning strikes me?

Whatif I don't grow taller?

Whatif my head starts getting smaller?

Whatif the fish won't bite?

Whatif the wind tears up my kite?

Whatif they start a war?

Whatif my parents get divorced?

Whatif the bus is late?

Whatif my teeth don't grow in straight?

Whatif I tear my pants?

Whatif I never learn to dance?

Everything seems well, and then

132,"When you go to a Doctor, do you tell upfront about your anxiety? I feel like it makes them underestimate our symptoms.","I've been with my anxiety under control for about 2 or 3 years, last year without any medication. A couple months ago I began a program to lose weight. I don't know if it's related (Some people in my family say it might be) but I began to get some of the olds anxiety attacks.

You know, the whole deal, something heavy on my chest, unable to figure out what it is, hard time breathing, dizziness, heart races, hands get clammy, throat tightens and I feel very weak, mainly my legs.

So I've decided to go to a Cardiologist and several other doctors (Gastroenterologist, Neurologist, Oncologist (I had cancer before)) to make sure things are in order.

The problem is that based on my previous experiences once you tell a doctor that you have anxiety issues they start to treat you like you don't even need to do medical exams. It's like ""Oh, you have anxiety issues? It must be that then!"". Seems like we automatically lost all our credibility the moment we say we have anxiety issues.

So now I'm thinking about don't tell the doctors that I suffer from Anxiety issues and Obsessive Disorder (Not OCD according to my Psychiatrist, weird). Do you guys think this is a reasonable thing do to or note? I would appreciate any advice.

135,"Suffered in silence for years, then ridiculed for it now I've been diagnosed","I'm a 41 year old male, Recently been diagnosed with severe anxiety, and suffered from social anxiety for years. I come from London, England, I was born with spastic deplegia, a mild form of cerebral palsy. I have walked with a limp my whole life, and have the occasional involuntary head movements. I was bullied and picked on constantly growing up, and suffered from anxiety because of it, have always been scared around people, always paranoid they are judging me because of my disability. My mother was always pushing me to grow out of being scared, and wanting me to be independent, not relying on others.  I worked since I was 17, started at McDonald's and stayed there for ten years, it really helped me with my self confidence and anxiety. 

Being around people I know was a comfort, any time I had to be alone or out to go somewhere, I would panic, and break out in sweats. I came to America in 1999, but never really told anyone of my anxiety and social anxiety. To those around me I've always appeared rude or distant, when in reality I just freeze and can't talk or explain how anxiety makes me feel.  Meeting women was near to impossible the conventional way, so I met women online, some I met in person. I met a woman from Michigan and we got married in 2001, but I never told her of my fears or phobias. When it was time to be around her family or she wanted me to go out with her and her friends, I always made excuses or just plain said I didn't want to go. All I had to tell her was what was going on, but I said nothing, so she assumed I was the asshole husband who didn't want to go anywhere with her.

Somehow we had three kids together, but eventually we divorced.  My current relationship has lasted 6 years, I told her right from the start of my anxiety and social anxiety, and she had been great about it. Two years ago I had some neurological issues, relating to my birth disability. Went to see a doctor, and he recommended not working any longer, as on top of that I've got major arthritis in my hands and feet.  So I'm home by myself all the time, my gf's parents hate me because I'm not working and not worthy of their daughter, so I've shut myself away.  I eventually plucked up the courage to speak to my doctor about it all, he recommended seeing a psychologist. Been going to see her since July of last year, she has also diagnosed me as having depression and anxiety, and social anxiety. I relay all these things to my gf, and now I feel worse for it, she feels I use it all as an excuse not to do things with her or her family. My therapist feels the gf and the issues her family have with me contribute to my anxiety, as in their eyes I can't do anything right.

My sister is also a child psychologist, and she suggested finding like minded people for advice and even friendship, or for me to find a way out of 'my bubble' as she calls it. I guess my questions are how do you cope with your anxiety and other issues, how does it affect your daily life?. Would be great to converse with people that understand.

136,Something to keep in mind when you are having an anxiety attack,"Not too long ago, I noticed that when I am having an anxiety attack, my mind tends to believe that whatever thought goes through it, is either one more cause of anxiety, or something that will increase it. I'm not entirely sure how to explain this, so I'm going to give you guys an example:

Let's say that I start getting anxious because I am soon going to move to a new apartment. My mind starts racing, my thoughts get fuzzy, I feel stressed and worried, my stomach starts feeling weird,  etc. The usual symptoms. If, during that anxiety period, I start thinking about how my dog is not listening to me when I tell him to sit, my mind will feed the anxiety attack with that event. I will now start getting worried about a new branch of issues: I have not trained my dog well, he may have hearing problems, he has not exercised enough, etc. And from that moment, every time I think about my dog, I get more anxious. My dog becomes a trigger.

I realized that I do this often, and before I was aware of it, my anxiety would last much more time because the number of triggers would grow exponentially. But fortunately, I quickly learned how to control it:


1. Isolate the real issue that is causing your current anxiety attack. If my first trigger was the idea of moving to a new apartment, then I find a more specific and deeper reason: oh, so I'm actually getting anxious because this is a 12 month decision, and I'm scared about such long commitment.

2. Find a set of solutions to your problem, or reasons why you should not worry about this event: I made a list of pros and cons of living in my current apartment and living in the new one. I reminded myself how happy I felt when I saw the apartment and the neighborhood where it was located. I also reminded me how convenient it would be for me to get to work from now on. I reminded myself that it was not a life-long decision, just one year, I have enough money to break the lease any time and move somewhere else, etc.

3. If, while I'm looking for a solution to the real problem, I start thinking about other things, and I start feeling they are turning into additional triggers, I shut my mind up for a moment: I just stop thinking; forcing my thoughts to stop passing so quickly. I breathe deeply and slowly, and I start thinking again, slowly, but from a more distanced perspective and a clearer and calmer mind. I learned this technique thanks to meditation.

These steps have helped me reduce the time my anxiety attacks last, as well as the intensity. I wanted to share, in case it helps someone.

Be strong! Anxiety can be controlled if you make an effort!",6,2015-01-27 06:19:52 EST-0500
137,Anxiety is ruining my life.,"I am at my wit's end. This constant anxiety is driving me insane. I want it to stop, but I feel powerless to do so. Here is my story:

It all started in August of 2012. I was smoking weed (as I used to do every night) and watching TV. I went to take my dogs outside, and saw a huge spider run quickly across the floor. I jumped (as I always do, spiders are the DEVIL), and went to get something to kill it. As I returned to the living room, however, I felt a tightening in my chest, and my heart started to race. Bad. I felt panicky, Poop I was being chased by something. I tried to sit down, but felt Poop I HAD to keep moving. I paced the floor with my heart beating so fast & loud I could HEAR it. I checked my pulse...180...my BP was 180/120 so I called an ambulance. The ER told me I had a panic attack. Never had any anxiety before this. EVER. At the time, I was on dextroamphetamine for ADHD and Chantix to quit smoking. Ever since then, I cannot smoke weed without having BAD anxiety/panic attacks, and I have underlying anxiety almost constantly, unless I am hyper focused on something. Fast forward a couple years, and I fell in love with the most perfect girl on the planet. We are engaged, and looking forward to our future together. The problem is that the anxiety is wreaking havoc on our sex life, because It gives me ED. Not all the time, but it's Poop if I worry about it, it happens. Even with ED meds. God bless her, she never makes a big deal of it.  I have tried almost every anxiety med, and they work for a week or 2, then stop. I suspect a placebo effect. fir the longest time, I suspected certain foods were causing it, and systematically cut them out of my diet, but that didn't help. I am now on nefazodone 50mg x2 a day, but it does nothing. I still feel the anxiety, and obsess about it. I have no idea what to do. I don't know whether to blame the dextroamphetamine and chantix (which I stopped right away), or whether it's all in my head (which I suspect). I'm 36/M, in otherwise good health. I want to fix this.

152,"Does anyone else have ""Time Anxiety""?","I've had anxiety my entire life, it used to be half social, half anxiety about life.  However as I've gotten older, I have no social anxiety anymore, but I would still have this nagging anxiety about every aspect of my life.  Even being shut inside didn't do much for me, the only way to get away from it was to keep myself busy with either video games or alcohol, or what have you.

A few months ago, however, I stumbled upon [this article](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-in-world/201308/time-anxiety) and I started to cry because I realized what exactly my anxiety was about.

I'm so fucking afraid of wasting my life.  In my college years I would take 6 classes (18 credits), I was the Leadership chair of my fraternity, started my own honor society, got my senior thesis published, moved to D.C. for a semester, had 5 internships, and a bunch of other things.

I say this not to brag, but to show you that even while doing all those things, I still felt ""You can be doing more!  You suck!  Why aren't you making more money?  Why don't you have a 4.0?  You're wasting your time!""

The only downtime I had would be filled with playing video games, it's all i looked forward to.  I would have a rare day off, and for weeks would just look forward to it so I can sit on my couch and try to keep up with all my video games or to listen to music, or just fucking relax.  Yet the next day I had almost a hang over.  I felt worthless, I had horrible anxiety, I literally felt like I was sick because I had taken a day off.


Part of the reason I feel like this is because my parents weren't very ambitious people, they worked the same 40k salary jobs for 35+ years, then my dad got laid off about 8 years ago.  We've almost lost our house a few times, I've skipped birthdays, etc.  It's sucked, and I'm just deathly afraid of being like that.


I don't even know why I'm writing anymore, I could write a fucking book about how I feel, but I just want to know if anyone else has this type of anxiety, of just wasting opportunity, of doing one thing but wondering ""Would I be better off doing something else?"" it's gotten to the point where I can't even listen to a song, without wondering if I'd enjoy another song.

153,anyone with anxiety have trouble accepting love?,"I haven't discussed this with my therapist yet, because I feel pretty dumb about it, but I've been dating my boyfriend for almost a year now, and I still have days where I wake up (sometimes at his apartment!), and in the first few hours of my day, I have these intrusive, negative, anxious thoughts like:

""He doesn't really love me, he'll realize it because I _____ (did something or said something dumb)""
""What's the point of a relationship? One of us will inevitably get bored one day, or our feelings will disappear.""
""I don't do enough for him, I'm so selfish and I don't deserve him.""

He is a wonderful, caring, passionate guy, and for Christmas this year, while I was visiting my family, he built me a new bed and bought all the trimmings for me. (He also spent the week over Christmas with me and my family.) When I came home, he had put everything together and had written me a long poem about us. I want to cry sometimes, thinking about how wonderful he is to me. I love him very much.

Do you ever feel like your anxiety makes you high-maintenance in relationships, or clouds the truth? I feel like I'm always fighting with myself internally to say, ""I'm not perfect but that doesn't mean he doesn't love me.""

Does anyone have advice on calming down and not being in a shame spiral where you're constantly having to convince yourself that everything is fine?

156,Anyone else get disturbing/intrusive thoughts that make you feel guitly and like killing yourself?,"Hello everyone. I've suffered from anxiety, emetophobia and depression for around 4 years now. It's snowballed so quickly over the past few months. Every time I get a headache I think I'm going to get sick, I'm scared of going near people in the street/next to people on the bus etc. I have to carry hand sanitiser around all the time. I have cut myself several times in the past few years, and I'm close to doing it again. I think about death as a relief every time I get anxious. More recently, and I'd rather not go into detail but I'm getting awful thoughts that make me feel guilty and like a fucking awful person. I have assignments to do at university and I just can't, I don't feel like having sex with my boyfriend anymore, and he's constantly on the other end of all my shit, I feel so bad for him. These thoughts are taking over my life and I just want to know if anyone else gets these and how they have helped themselves?",23,2015-01-19 22:45:58 EST-0500
157,"In order to seek therapy, I need to do the exact thing that I need therapy for (making phone calls and asking for help). What do I do?","I was in therapy for years from ages 8 to 16 as we tried to deal with one very specific symptom of my anxiety (my inability to go to school or complete work without feeling disproportionately overwhelmed). When I ended up dropping out of school, I was pulled from treatment because it seemed like I'd ""won."" I started college part time and pulled As and Bs and things seemed alright.

Over the past few years, though, it's gotten worse. I'm overwhelmed by anything and I'm at a point now where I'm not good for anything; I shower, I eat enough to not pass out, and I lay in bed until my boyfriend has time to come see me (when I'm physically with him, my symptoms are eased dramatically). I often feel like it won't get better and wrestle down thoughts of suicide because I feel so far gone and can't picture myself living a life where I'm functioning and independent. 

My lovely boyfriend sat me down last night and told me that he's incredibly worried about my condition and it hurts him because he loves me but is starting to need to look out for himself and that can't happen if I'm weighing him down with my poor condition. I don't blame him; this is a lot for anyone, but specifically a regular, nice guy in his early 20s to handle. He's been insisting that I seek professional help, and I've agreed for a long time, but recently it's become more clear to both of us that the need is VERY urgent. 

I'm now freaking out because I know I have to do this by myself. My mother (who is minimally helpful and generally unkind to me) tried making an appointment with a counselor but was told that, because I'm technically an adult now, I have to make the appointment myself. 

One of the number one stressors in my life is my inability to ask for help. Whether it's asking a retail employee to let me into a fitting room or calling the doctor and asking to make an appointment, I would rather go without than advocate for myself and my own needs, no matter how basic. 

I found out that I need to make my own appointment on Wednesday and have spent most of my free time since trying to turn off the panic mechanism in my brain. I've toyed with asking a female friend to call for me, but I don't see it taking much, if any of the edge off of the experience (since I'd need to be present to tell which days I'm available). 

As if the stress of having to figure out how insurance works and worrying about explaining my problems aren't enough of a deterrent, I literally can not even begin to find help without having my whole respiratory system lock up on me and I don't know what to do.",25,2015-01-18 22:22:19 EST-0500
158,[Success] Just Gave a Lecture to 200 People,"So this might be a bit more of an unusual post, but I wanted to share it with the community.

While I feel that my anxiety is not a severe as many of the users I see on here, I still suffer greatly when public speaking (as one person pointed out, it's most likely a form of social anxiety).  I work as a researcher, so I have to give increasingly more presentations, which in general I don't like doing, but are generally to small groups of people (that doesn't make it much better).

However, today my boss needed me to cover a lecture for him (and some subsequent teaching).  This was by far and a way the biggest thing I've ever had to do (public speakingwise) and managed to do it without having too many problems.  I may have stumbled over a few things and repeated things unnecessarily, but I managed to do it in as positive a manner as possible.  I am now however completely exhausted (mentally and physically).  

I would really like to thank the community here, since thanks to all of the stories and advice I've managed to handle this one.  Hopefully, I can carry this into future presentations and completely overcome it.

**tl;dr: Had to cover a lecture, didn't panic, didn't go horribly, thanks everyone**

163,"To those who suffer from palpitations, read this.","Let's start here by talking about a very special part of the human anatomy called the Vagus nerve. The vagus nerve, also referred to as the 10th cranial nerve, is appropriately termed a ""mixed"" nerve. It provides a sort of two-way communication of nerve impulses back and forth between the brain and the pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach and associated abdominal viscera (basically, your throat, windpipe, your tummy and guts), the heart, lungs and several more complex but irrelevant body organs or functions. The vagus nerve is the longest and most complex of the cranial nerves in the body.

The key point here is to make note that this nerve involves the ""heart,"" the ""lungs"" and basically the whole digestive system of your tummy and intestines. Now let's pair that with some real specific and limited physiology about the heart and its rhythm. We also need to bring clarity to some of the medical jargon being talked about by many of you in your messages. The term PVC, or Premature Ventricular Contraction, is just one of many arrhythmias and not necessarily isolated to what many term as ""palpitations."" So for our purposes here, when we speak of benign palpitations, what we in essence are referring to is the presence of extra cardiovascular electrical activity and the precise induction of these beats felt as dancing of the heart or a flutter sensation in the chest, the prominence or intensity of which is determined by the precise moment of the extra beats in proximity to the most recent beat and the upcoming beat or contraction of the heart ventricles or atria. 

Think of it in relation to your memory of your worst date, where the person you're with has no rhythm whatsoever but wants to impress you with all the right moves and clumsily tries to introduce their own dance-step into your otherwise smoothly flowing and natural pace with the music. Depending upon their rather untimely entry, they can cause awkwardness that either simply causes you to quickly pause and regain your rhythm or literally trip you repeatedly until you're forced to leave the dance floor. Well, the same holds true for the heart in our example. The extra beat, or palpitation might come at a point that's subtle, or it might be at a point where the heart is in a different part of the cardiac cycle and stumbles repeatedly until normal sinus rhythm is regained. Now let's get to ""why"" palpitations occur.

The heart has a natural pacemaker called the sinoatrial node among several less distinct and similar pacers, whose steady rhythmic signals can be affected by which nerve? You guessed it; The VAGUS nerve.
Among its many duties, the vagus nerve helps transfer signals within the parasympathetic nervous system to the brain to regulate the heart in addition to other functions taking place and is doing its job right now in each and every one of us. Think of the nervous system as a two-way street, one being the sympathetic nervous system that sort of represents stepping on the gas pedal, and the parasympathetic nervous system that is analgous to stepping on the brakes so to speak. When your heart races, think sympathetic nervous system and when it slows down, think of the parasympathetic system. See?

So for our purposes, we want to focus mainly on the parasympathetic nervous system, particularly with respect to the 10th cranial nerve otherwise known as the vagus nerve. The variability of your heart rate during inspiration and expiration of your lungs is an effect of the vagus nerve. We've all noticed that when we take a breath in, our heart tends to beat just a little faster and when we breathe out, a little slower. It's an entirely normal bodily function and is connected to the need by the body's system to respond to the environment. It's a very simple example of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system working in concert with other physiological processes. But sometimes extra signals along the vagus nerve due to over-stimulation can directly affect the organs involved in a way that was not normally intended, namely the heart, and cause extra activity to occur like palpitations. It merely represents a misguided nerve impulse coming from the nervous system and not a message from the heart that something is wrong in this case. Does that make sense? It's sort of like an involuntary muscle twitch. Nothing more.

Now that we kind of have a little medical background under our belts, let's take one of the complaints by many of you regarding the proximity or untimely appearance of palpitations and indigestion. Remember that we said the vagus nerve is linked to the tummy, the throat and the heart. Let's assume that we've eaten a meal and it's caused us to experience some gastrointestinal discomfort, or in other words, gas. The irregular presence and activity by your tummy and intestines stimulates, more appropriately irritates, the vagus nerve which sends a rather inappropriate signal back along the pathway to guess where? That's right, the heart. 

The heart is busy pacing away regularly and is relatively unconcerned with all the food you poured into your tummy, when all of a sudden in comes a signal from the vagus nerve because it has been inappropriately stimulated and tells the heart to beat. Well, just like our bad date example, the signal to beat is rather untimely and awkward but the heart has to accept it and respond. The result is extra beats that make the heart feel like it is stumbling. The degree to which it stumbles oftentimes depends upon the extent to which the vagus nerve is irritated and the relative states of indigestion present as the causative agent.

There is most often no pain associated with this occurrence because it is not the result of a lack of blood or oxygen that creates the palpitation, but rather just a simple additional electrical impulse or series of impulses. Pericardial pain, or pain adjacent to the heart, can sometimes accompany palpitations or exist exclusive of any arrhythmia, but is not necessarily considered pathologic or harmful to us. Remember that we're dealing with inappropriate electrical impulses and typically more nerves than just the Vagus nerve are affected and can respond inappropriately, causing a jabbing or shooting pain than many describe as a ""catch"" in their chest. We'll talk more about chest pain in a bit.

Let's discuss the sensation that some of you described as a warm flushing sensation of your face and perhaps other body areas that accompanies the palpitations. One of the causes for this is epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, released from the adrenal glands atop the kidneys and is designed to help prepare the body for fight or flight. Its effects can cause sensory disturbances, sweating, palpitations, nausea and other changes in physiology. Also recall our anatomy lesson. The vagus nerve stimulates many areas of the body in response to our environment or internal conditions caused by the outside environment, ie. a meal that produces indigestion. The vagus nerve provides all of us with a stable process called vagal tone. This tone or stability keeps us in a state of physiological preparedness with relation to our environment. 

In response to environmental cues or situations, that tone or stability changes to prepare for what may be required. You've probably all seen a guy(or gal) that makes your heart ""skip a beat."" Ever wonder why that phrase ever came about? Think for a moment. If you've ever been emotionally overcome, your heart races or feels like it pounds in your chest, we begin sweating, our blood pressure rises, we feel nervous and at some point our face is overcome by a warm flushing sensation that we attribute to nervousness or embarrassment. Well, guess what nerve plays a very big role in that entire process? Right Again!!! The VAGUS nerve. And epinephrine is right there to assist in the process.  

The above scenario would be a case of increased vagal tone. Well, if there's an increase, there's likely to be a case of decreased vagal tone as well. Indeed there is. Decreased vagal tone can make us weak, nauseated, tremble, and even faint. It happens in cases of being excessively startled or frightened. Other conditions, such as diabetes can cause decreased vagal tone, but for our purposes we'll stick to conditions that by what I've read from all of you are non-disease provoking conditions, with the exception of one individual with Mitral Valve Prolapse but we'll touch on that in a bit.

The point is that our body doesn't always accurately recognize proper environmental cues and the vagus nerve doesn't always know when and how to act. In other words, it misbehaves once in a while as a result of inappropriate stimulation. All sorts of things make the vagus nerve act out, including stress, anxiety, depression, illness and even idiopathic causes (origin or cause is unknown). In fact, there is work going on right now using electrical vagus nerve stimulation to treat depression, anxiety and even seizures. And here's a little extra for those who cough when experiencing a palpitation. Recall your anatomy lesson again. Remember we said the vagus nerve stimulates the pharynx, larynx, bronchi and esophagus. Well, what do you know? Those are exactly the processes involved in the cough reflex. So when the vagus nerve inappropriately stimulates the heart and causes a palpitation it also stimulates in some cases the cough reflex. How about that!

So we begin to see that the cause for palpitations and the palpitation itself is not a life-threatening occurrence at all. It concerns us for several reasons. First, it has to do with our heart and hey, that's the thing that keeps us alive basically. Big concern! Secondly, we've been bombarded by all the medical revelations and awareness about heart disease. But a case for heart disease does not make for every condition the heart demonstrates, especially palpitations. If you've ever had a cramp in your hand from typing too much, it probably never gave you pause to think you might not make it, so to speak. You reason in your mind that the cramp is caused by repetition fatigue and you need to take a break, massage your hand and rest momentarily. Well, palpitations can be considered sort of a cramp and nothing more. Under stress and other factors we talked about, the vagus nerve gets irritated or fatigued and acts out. Just because the heart is affected, doesn't mean that you've got heart disease or vascular problems that are looming. They're annoying, worrisome and even frightening, but knowing where they come from and why will help go a long way in knowing that they are non-injurious and if we respond appropriately, will subside and we can go about our lives with far less worry.

Let's touch on anxiety for a moment. Anxiety and depression too, can definitely cause a state of dysfunction in many areas of our body. Many patients who have these disorders are exhausted from constantly presenting themselves to the medical community with real and valid symptoms of pain, fatigue, bowel problems, vision problems, tinnitus or ringing in the ears, difficulty swallowing, excessive saliva, dry mouth, sore or sensitive tongue, and many more troublesome circumstances only to have repeated tests all return normal. How can that possibly be?!! It's there, we feel it, we experience it, we hate it. Why doesn't the test confirm that it's there? How frustrating is that?

Well, here's some news that should make you feel a bit less frustrated and even comfort you. Most all tests are based upon the algorithmic or sequential processing, of certain symptoms and signs that are all conclusive of various disease and illness. When someone with anxiety, depression or other condition that has somatic features(felt physically)undergoes these tests, the components that underlie the actual diseases which have similar symptoms simply does not add up and no presence of the actual disease is evident. So it's a case of false identity, sort of like having a biopsy of a mole that turns out to be benign. Looks like cancer, but is not cancer. Well, that same thing can happen to us with regard to all sorts of disorders and diseases. They look similar in presentation, but one reveals true disease and the other a non pathologic condition or illness. So the next time your doctor tells you he can't find anything wrong, be glad for that much at least. Many people get far worse news!

So with regard to depression and anxiety, these conditions impart disturbance upon body functions. I suppose you're already guessing that the vagus nerve is not exempt from those circumstances and you're exactly right. So when you have an episode of anxiety, rest easy when you have a palpitation or two, or three or even four. The vagus nerve is irritated and needs a break or to reset. No problem whatsoever and you needn't worry any longer that a palpitation is sure indication of worse things to come. Nothing else happens. Just an extra heartbeat or two where there should not normally be. What a relief!!!!!
And the caveat I promised to the individuals with Mitral Valve Prolapse, your heart condition, while not necessarily life-threatening at all, does predispose you to panic disorder which I'm sure you are probably already aware.

Okay, so now we know what these palpitations are and what causes them. What the heck do we do about 'em? Well, there are several techniques that can help. Firstly, let me say that if a run of palpitations makes you feel faint or weak, don't panic and try to make it somewhere less embarrassing. Be safe and think smart. Squat to your knees or sit down until the feeling subsides. No sense in cracking open your skull by trying to make a mad dash for privacy. Anyone can feel faint and people in your company will always rally to your aid more often than not. So relax. The conditions will quickly pass and you'll be back to yourself in a jiffy.

Secondly, if you sense indigestion and gas, discomfort and bloating when the palpitations are present, try merely changing positions which often causes the distention to realign from its offending position proximal to the vagus nerve. If that doesn't work, then a short walk will usually help. Even taking small sips of water will eventually help relieve the indigestion. And you can certainly use antacids if necessary, but take care not to over-use them or other problems may begin to occur to make matters worse... More in comments 1/2

164,So I went to the Doctor's with a recurring neck pain...,"and walked out with a prescription for Effexor XR.

I have always suffered from strong anxiety, usually around stupid things such as inability to contact someone or whether or not something I said might have offended someone.  These would send me into hours of me sitting panicking (been this way since about the age of 21, so over 20 years).

Add to that, stress of the normal type, financial, career, family and such, I didn't realize how bad the symptoms had got.

Pins and needles on the arms and legs.
Hot flashes.
Higher blood pressure (hoping this one is related).
Irritability
Loss of focus (a big one).

For several months, I've been dealing with this recurring neck ache, I had no idea that anxiety and stress could do all of the above.

So, I'm almost a week into the prescription and I can honestly say, the anxiety levels of dropped somewhat.  I seem to be handling the more common triggers that would freak me out with a little more ease, the neck pains seemed to have been greatly reduced, the pins and needles haven't been happening and the irritability seems to have been greatly reduced.

The focus still hasn't come back to where I want it, but I'm only a week in, so hopefully that solves the problem there.  I feel, normal?

181,I'm being denied an appointment at my docs office and it's all because the new front desk girl.,"I called my psychiatrist office on Monday to obtain an appointment for tomorrow, which I was given, no problem. I haven't been in six months due to being unemployed and not being able to afford it, my doc was aware of this the last time we met. I received a phone call this morning from the new front desk girl stating they would need to cancel my appointment for tomorrow because after six months I'm considered a new patient and new patient appointments don't start until April. Needless to say I flipped. I told her this was not a routine follow up or a new issue but more of a ""I need to get back on my meds because things are getting worse type of deal"" (I'm waking up in the middle night having panic attacks) She didn't seem to care and continued to deny me my appointment. I asked to speak to the office manager who according to her, was not there. Ok, I asked to speak to my doctor herself, the response was ""I'll leave her a message.""

I've had emergencies in the past where I've left this doctor messages and she has promptly responded within a few hours, this time there's been no return phone call. I just called again and the receptionist says ""oh shes gone for the day"" I say ""well I was advised I'd be receiving a call back"" to which she replied ""I gave her the message."" End of conversation.
I used to work in the medical field and if your patient called and said they needed to see the doc and it was an emergence type of visit and the front desk turned them away, you'd be in some trouble. That's a huge no-no. Plus, this particular doc has let me come in twice before with no scheduled appointment when I was having panic attacks and needed to see her (this was prior to the new girl).

My question is, would I be a complete crazy person if I showed up tomorrow and asked to speak to my doctor? I feel like I wouldn't but I need some advise. 

Thanks guys! <3

EDIT: Ok, I'm off to my non-existing appointment! I'll follow up with you guys a bit later! 

EDIT #2: So it wasn't a very pleasant visit. I arrived at the office before anyone got there, it was just me and the receptionist. I calmly explained to her that I need to see the doctor and that I promise I'm not trying to make her miserable, I can clearly see she's super annoyed. She basically tells me to have a seat and then just ignores me, 15min later my doc walks in, tells me to follow her into her office. Once I'm in her office she tells me that it's irresponsible of me to just quit treatment for six months then demand an appointment. I explained to her everything that happened yesterday. She had no response to that but continued to tell me that she would see me today but that I would need to find a new doc, that she can no longer treat me because I lapsed in my care. Seriously? I asked her if she honestly thought I wanted that to happen because I didn't, I'm the one paying dearly for it now as my condition is a million times worse. All I got was a ""of course not, but.."" Anyway, she treated me, gave me meds to last three months and now I have to find a new doc. Hooray. It was a shitty experience and made me feel shittier than I already felt. Fucking ridiculous.

184,Anyone else get extremely anxious in brightly lighted places?,"Not necessarily when it's sunny, but like how grocery stores are overly lit up and the way the light bounces off the linoleum just triggers something in me. 

Whenever I see someone I know in a ""bright"" place it's hard for me to have a conversation and I'll sometimes completely freeze up like an idiot. However, if the lights were dimmed just enough then that same conversation wouldn't be a problem at all.



Another example are bright rooms in houses. At parties I'll find myself staying in the living room where it's typically dimmed (so I hold anxiety-less conversations) as opposed to the kitchen where lights are blazing full force. 


I don't know what's causing this and I want to learn how to cope.",20,2015-02-24 03:55:02 EST-0500
185,"How do I find a career and become financially independed from my parents, despite mental illness?","*Independent. I hate my phone and stubby fingers.

I'm xposting this from r/findapath, I probably shouldn't have bothered them. I am a 23 y/o female with severe depression and anxiety. I've been in and out of therapy since I was very young, but I haven't had much progress. Social situations, new people, crowds, and conversation scares me, sometimes to the point of self harm. 

My dream is to be able to support myself without help from my parents, in some home of my own. I currently work in a quiet small business making about $400/month. Obviously no one can live off of that sort of money. I live in my moms house, and she pays for groceries, food, health insurance, pretty much everything I can't afford.  I dropped out of college due to anxiety, and have been at this job ever since.

You're first reaction is probably ""Well, you need to get healthy first."" I agree. I do need to solve my mental health problems. But I'm also looking at this realistically. My family isn't going to be around forever, and without their financial support, I'd be lost. I may never be truly healthy, but I'll always need a roof over my head.

So where do I find a career? Where do I find a job that I could support myself from, but not end up losing it or hurting myself in the long run? For some back ground, I live in a rural part of PA. I would say most people in this town work in the factories in the area, and make less than $30,000/year. I can't work in a factory, guys. Not because I'm better than that, but because it's truly better than me. I'm not a lazy person, and I don't expect to coast through life. I'm very ill, and very self aware of my situation. Any advice is appreciated. If this isn't the place for this post, I really apologize. I'm looking for help to find a job to support myself, not asking for mental health guidance.",40,2015-02-28 18:08:54 EST-0500

I feel like I'm starting to understand them better but they still scare the shit out of me. One of the symptom bothers more than others though, it's this weird sense of vertigo/dizziness. It's like the world is almost laggy or delayed. During my first panic attack it got so bad I thought I was stuck in time or on the brink of death. I notice it especially when I start to pace around my room. It's the weirdest feeling ever and very hard to describe. It's as if I'm on drugs or something.

191,"So embarrassed and humiliated. Please support your anxious students, lecturers.","We had to bring our work into college today, and one by one we had to stand in front of the class (already an anxiety inducing situation) and explain why we wrote it the way we did and stuff.

The lecturer was like ""okay so what did you mean here?"" pointing to it and I explained what I meant, and he said, really bluntly, ""right okay, well that's not what you wrote.""

I instantly started panicking.

Started feeling myself going flushed and red, 
Started getting shaky, 
Couldn't think straight at all, 
Was SO aware of everyone staring at me, of what everyone might have been thinking.
Probably ""shes so awkward"", ""why is she getting so worked up"" etc.

Out loud I was saying; Oh God what did I write? What did I mean?
What am I doing?

and I honestly could not think straight enough to think of how I'd written it wrong. I was getting really flustered and panicky to the point where I felt super self conscious and embarrassed and basically almost had a panic attack.

To make matters worse; the LECTURER said ""calm down"", as did some of my classmates. Must have been at least 2 or 3 people in total saying ""jeez calm down"" out of like 7 students.

This means that to add to how horribly anxious I felt, they all NOTICED how visibly panicky I was, and also probably thought I was overreacting, in turn making me insanely more panicky and embarrassed.

Thing is, when you're practically on the verge of a panic attack probably the worst thing someone could say is ""calm down"".

or so I thought.

a friend of mine, who knows I suffer from panic attacks, adding SO much more insult to injury, said

""jeez don't have a panic attack"".

nope yep thats definitely the worst possible thing you could say.

fuck.

I was shaking for hours after.

TL;DR: Lecturers should really read your medical profile to make sure they don't aggravate mental health issues before unhelpfully telling you to ""calm down"" when you start to panic.",34,2015-02-24 01:18:50 EST-0500
192,Mild panic attack on weed. Can anyone relate to this event?,"When you're stoned, you tend to enter a panic attack the same way you enter a dream. You just suddenly find yourself there and it's impossible to remember where it started. I do remember not being able to sit still. I was in the back of a car and I was swaying back and forth in my seat. I would say something and it would echo back in my head until my voice became distorted and ugly. Sometimes an unbearably high pitched shrieking. My laugh would come out very high as well. I leaned forward and back repeatedly. 

I became ""self-aware"" and went on a horrifying inner monologue about how I am different from everyone else to the point of being a freak. I decided that my friends pitied me and everyone else resented me. A lot of that stuck with me after the high and increased my anxiety. I still think it's true as I am, in my eyes, exceptionally ugly, but that's beside the point as it has nothing to do with the panic attack itself or the factors that brought it on. These thoughts intensified those areas of self-perception.

""You're just having a panic attack, you'll be okay""

""Panic disorder is very treatable"" 

""You're going to get better""

Man, fuck that. 

I've been having panic attacks since I was 16 years old. I'm turning 25 this year. I've tried a lot of medications. I've seen therapists. I've altered my diet. I've tried yoga. Everything is a miracle cure apparently. I'm envious of you people who have found reprieve in something, but the truth for me is I don't think I'll ever get better from this. Honestly, I'm frustrated by the optimism, and by saying this I'm sure someone will think I haven't tried. Fuck you. I have tried. I try every day. I'm trying. 

I've asked for help since the beginning of this mess, I'm constantly looking for help. Lets cut the bullshit about how looking for help is a step to getting better, for some of us it's a fucking circle. An endless loop of medication, therapy, and anxiety that just sends back to where we were before, sometimes worse off. 

Anxiety is treatable. Sure, there are ways to make it *less* bad, but the truth is, there is no cure. That is reality. That is the truth. There's no cure. And somedays are worse than others, but there are days like today that remind me I'm stuck with this for life. I'm damaged fucking goods. How can I be with someone, if I can't even be with myself? How will anyone be able to accept me for me? 

I've got dreams, and hopes that I see pass by me as the years go by. I've loved and I've lost, and I'm tired of living this fucking life with a handicap. I know things could be much worse, I know, I know, *I know.* and by writing out this huge thing I just feel like I'm whining, but I'm just so frustrated.

I just kind of needed to get this out, and for someone to read it. There is no hope for me I don't think. I'm not a suicide risk, so I hope you don't think that. The truth is, despite all my pain, I'm too scared of a death to be. No I'll sit here and wait till it's my turn to go, I just wish it wasn't so lonely. I just wish I could be the person I want to be.

202,Methods to help anxiety that won't hurt your wallet,"Hi guys,

I used to suffer very badly with anxiety, but fortunately am doing a lot better these days and have learned a lot from what I went through.  I know that the cost of different treatments can be a big worry, so I thought I'd put together a post that outlines some helpful methods I learned that are either totally free or cost very little.

I'd urge any of you suffering with anxiety and panic attacks to see your doctor first, it's really important to get proper help and guidance. The post I'm writing here is only meant to be used alongside what proper medical treatment you're getting. 

The new year is a great time to take up some new practices in our lives, so I thought that today would be a good time to post :) 

***

**Cognitive Behavioural Therapy** - Often anxiety is driven by our own thoughts and the way that we worry about things. CBT will help you get a handle on this and learn to change unhealthy thought patterns. There's a free website called [Mood Gym](https://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome) that will teach you the principles of CBT for free. CBT takes hard and persistent work, but it's a powerful tool for recovery. 

I would highly recommend going to a CBT therapist if you can afford it. Remember that therapists will work with what you can pay, you can space out sessions as little or often as you can afford. In some countries you can be referred to free CBT by your doctor, check it out.  

**Meditation** - When we're stressed or anxious a lot, it's the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that is often engaged. This keeps us on edge and feeling anxious. To combat it we need to engage the parasympathetic nervous system (PSN) which will calm us down and help us deal with stress/anxiety better.  Meditation has been shown to do just this, even just ten minutes a day is enough to make measurable changes on both mental and physical health. It is wonderful for anxiety.  

There are a lot of websites and videos on YouTube that will teach you to meditate for free. I recommend starting with a very simple meditation on the breath. 

If you're a member of your local library then you might find this book helpful: [Soul-Centered](http://www.amazon.com/Soul-Centered-Transform-Your-Weeks-Meditation/dp/1401935869/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) by Sarah McClean. But there are loads of books out there, often available second hand on Amazon.

Guided meditations, where someone talks you into a very relaxed state, can be a good place to start if you find it hard to sit in silence (I found this really hard when my anxiety was bad). Again, there are loads of lovely guided meditations for free on YouTube, I love [The Honest Guys'](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheHonestGuys) channel :)

**Emotional Freedom Technique** - A few years ago a therapist thought me this odd tapping technique called EFT. It's very effective for cutting off panic attacks, and actually I haven't had a full blown one in the several years since I learned it.  There are plenty of YouTube videos that will teach it to you for free. It's a strange one, but very helpful. 

**Mindfulness** - Mindfulness has been growing in popularity over the last few years, and for very good reason. Like meditation, it will help you to handle stress better.  It teaches you to stay in the moment and pay attention to the present instead of allowing your mind to run away with worries.  It's kind of similar to CBT in that way.  

There's lots of free information online about mindfulness, and plenty of YouTube and TED videos about it.  Have a look around on YouTube, there are lots of interesting talks about it that you might find interesting.  

If you'd like a book on the topic, I'd recommend [Mindfulness](http://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Eight-Week-Finding-Peace-Frantic/dp/1609618955/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1420147376&sr=1-1&keywords=mindfulness) which explains the research behind it as well as how you can start practising it. 

**Exercise** - Exercise is important because it raises levels of hormones in your body that will boost your mood and help you deal with stress better.  It's also very hard to be anxious when you're focused on your body and breath, honestly it gives such a welcome break from worrying. Running/jogging/walking/cycling is free, frisbee is cheap and fun, swimming is great for your whole body - there are so many options that won't cost you much. Aim for 20 minutes exercise every second/third day. 

Yoga in particular is wonderful for anxiety, it will teach you to focus on your body and breath and help calm your mind. There are lots of videos that will teach you the basics of yoga for free on YouTube, but if you can afford it I'd recommend joining a class once a week as it really is such a treat for your body and mind. 

**Breathing exercises** - These work in a similar way to meditation, they engage the PNS and help your mind to slow down and relax.  I used to do them at my desk at work, or on the tram to work, when I was feeling particularly anxious.  I still use them when I'm feeling overwhelmed with any emotion, like when I get angry.  They're very subtle, no one will notice you doing them so you can practice anywhere when you feel the need.  

There's lots of info for free online, but here is a very simple one: breathe in for 7 counts, hold your breath for 2 counts, then breathe out for 11 counts, repeat for 4/5 minutes. Please note that these don't need to be deep or prolonged counts, just gentle and regular breathing.  If you find it makes you dizzy then you're probably breathing too deeply or doing it for too long, so simply stop and try again another time.  If you practice regularly you will notice that you feel calmer.  

**Diet** - It's important that you eat well and eat regularly if you're struggling with mental health issues.  Skipping meals can cause drops in blood sugar that can feel similar to panic attacks, anxiety and even depression, so please never skip meals and especially breakfast.  Caffeine, sugar and other stimulants will make you feel on edge, so they're best kept to a minimum or avoided completely.  Foods that are rich in B vitamins and magnesium can be soothing to the nervous system.  Drink plenty of water, dehydration can make you feel worse.  Alcohol can heighten anxiety, especially the morning after when your blood sugar will be low and you'll be dehydrated, so keep it to a minimum. 

**Sleep** - Bad sleep makes everything seem worse and can make you feel even more stressed, so it's really important to sleep well.  If you're having trouble sleeping then do some googling with the term ""sleep hygiene"" for some advice on what might help.  If you find it hard to switch off your worries when you go to bed at night then a guided meditation will help because it forces you to listen to the meditation and relax.  

**Mood boosting** - Raising your basic levels of mood boosting hormones is really important.  This is a nice one because it basically means being good to yourself, kind to yourself and giving yourself permission to indulge in the things that make you feel good.  So many of us feel guilty about taking time to ourselves, especially if we have families, busy jobs, or people in our lives who need to be cared for - but honestly, it's essential for good mental health, and learning to make yourself happy will help you more than you can imagine.  Consider it an investment in your health, and make time for yourself. 

Give yourself time every day to do something nice for yourself.  Go for a walk in your favourite park, read a new book, watch a movie or tv show that makes you laugh (laughter raises levels of endorphins in the body, it's a great tool!), spend time with your favourite people, have a bubble bath, play with your pet (very therapeutic!), take up a new hobby, listen to music that lifts your mood (also good for mental health), learn to cook your favourite food.  Basically do anything and everything that makes you smile and feel good.  If you don't have many ideas then it can be a wonderful journey of discovery, learning what ways to make yourself happy.  Doing nice things for the people that you care about will also boost your mood, it's a great way to let go of worries for a while and build bonds with others.  

**Journalling** - Another free way to help yourself.  Journalling is very cathartic, it helps you to get worries out on the page and let them go, it can help far more than you think.  Write a page or two every morning or evening, let all your worries out, then close your notebook and don't look over what you've written for at least six months.  

**Gratitude journal** - Research has shown that a regular gratitude practice can improve mood and even relationships, it's a lovely way to be reminded of the good things we have in our lives despite the worries that weigh us down.  Keep a simple gratitude journal that where you jot down three things a day that you are grateful for.  It can be something simple such as the colour of the sky, it can be anything that you appreciate in your life at that very moment.  

**Anxiety research** - learning about anxiety, how it works, what drives it and what we can do about it is an empowering thing to do.  There is so much information out there online for free, have a look around and you'll find even more tips and tricks that work.  

***

This has been a huge post, but please don't feel overwhelmed.  Pick one or two things that appeal to you and give them a try.  Figure out what works for you.  I firmly believe that learning to be good to ourselves, understanding how mental health works and carving a lifestyle that supports and boosts good mental health is a great basis for recovery.    

Happy new year everyone, I really hope that some of you find this helpful.  If you have any tips of your own please add them! Take care :)",29,2015-01-02 00:30:40 EST-0500

206,Some tips I use when a panic attack comes on...,"When I feel a panic attack coming on I usually try doing the following things to lessen the effect:

#1 - Say out loud what is happening. When I feel my heart start to beat faster and my stomach twist and turn, I say to myself (aloud if possible) 'I am having a panic attack. This too shall pass.' I repeat this as a little mantra to let my consciousness know I am aware of what's happening, and as a step to regain control.

#2 - Deep breathing. Probably the most common but very effective. Deep slow breaths in and out, focusing all the time on the breathing alone. This distracts me from the thoughts and feelings of the attack and allows my mind to calm and my heart rate and breathing to normalise.

#3 - Pretend I'm excited. This was advice from a really successful businessman I had the pleasure of meeting. He told me he suffers with extreme anxiety but his tip to me was 'when you feel a panic attack coming or are generally just very anxious, tell yourself you're actually excited about what's happening.' Until I tried this myself I was dubious but with practice it becomes easy to substitute the attack for false-excitement and makes it easier to deal with.

Let me know if you do any of these and feel free to post some of your own tips below.

208,[xpost from /r/Minecraft] Starting a mental health community using Minecraft as video game therapy.,"**Who I am**

I'm a 25 year old sort-of Behavioral Neuroscience student struggling with mental health issues. I am disappointed with the resources I have found locally for those issues, so I have started playing with the idea of starting an online support group of like-minded (haha!) individuals who need friends to care about and to be cared for by. 

I'm an emotionally in-tune person when I am not terribly devastated by my own problems and I have a history of starting projects to bring people together.

**What I Want**

I want to start a small community of lonely, neuroatypical people, preferably within their 20s and 30s but not a requirement, to work together and play together. I want to start with Minecraft, probably with a modpack (although if everyone prefers Vanilla we can do that as well), and a group Skype call that we can join while we play. The idea is that for those of us struggling with mental health, and especially those who cannot hold a job, we can provide comfort and a stable platform for friendship and support. And also video games.

This isn't a dating service and this isn't for hookups. I know they can and do happen, because hearts are just as crazy as we are, but please don't join to be a predator. I myself have struggled with that and I won't tolerate it in this safe place I am trying to start. Don't be evil, guys. Please.

**How Do We Start?**

Please PM me your Skype or some other method of communication, along with your age and a little about what you are going through. I will add you as soon as I see the message, and we can talk a little one on one before I introduce you to the others. This can be either text or voice, whichever you prefer. If you seem like you are genuine, I will add you to the group.

The server doesn't exist yet. This is just day one. I need to see how many people would like this sort of event/place to exist, and then we can go from there.

209,Anxiety preventing me from telling anyone how bad my anxiety is,"Basically, I've had social anxiety for years, (which has resulted in little to no close friends) and more recently just anxiety in general about everything, and all I've ever wanted is just to tell someone absolutely everything. I have several problems though.

When a rare opportunity to tell someone anything comes around I get stage fright, for want of a better phrase and my mind goes blank and I can't even make any intelligent sound. Really just what happens whenever I try and do any kind of public speaking. Then people forget I was ever trying to tell them anything.

I don't want to have to go to the doctors, especially if they try were to try and put me on any weird drugs. 

I'm scared of people seeing me not strong. I've managed to appear strong my whole life. I can't even remember the last time I properly cried in front of someone. I just don't want anyone to be worried about me.

I don't want everything to become about anxiety. I hate when people ask me if I'm ok and if people know about mental illness they greet you with a sympathetic 'hello, how are you doing today' and accompanying head tilt and saccharine smile.

EDIT: Thanks for the responses, they've given me a little boost. It's nice knowing I'm not alone apart from anything else.

I want to beat this and develop brilliant friendships with a group of people I've recently met but I am so scared I'm gonna leave it too late and everyone will just forget about me.

I've been trying to figure out what this is a result of.  I don't remember any particular negative associations with dusk.  I was thinking maybe it's something about the quality of light that makes me dissociate more, and it in turn causes anxiety?

215,Does anyone else feel like their generalized anxiety is actually stemming from something that you're just unable to put your finger on? Some sort of subconscious worry?,"Like I feel like if I sit and think about it long enough I'll have a lightbulb moment and think ""Of course! That's what I'm anxious about."", and then I can deal with it. 

It's a nice thought. Currently I'm anxious over seemingly nothing at all. I just feel like there's gotta be something bothering me on a subconscious level that I just need to recognize so I can tackle it. Somehow. ",23,2015-01-06 00:52:26 EST-0500
216,Does anyone avoid getting too close to people due to anxiety about losing them?,"I have a hard time getting really close to people (""best"" friends, close relationships, family) for fear of losing them.  I'm easy at making friends and have lots of general acquaintances, but also keep people I should (and would like to) be closer to at that distance as well and I feel like I'm missing out on an important part of life.

My dad died when I was young (14) which is the source of a lot/all of my anxiety around death.  I have been treated for generalized anxiety including panic attacks, but now that I'm a bit older that's all under control without medication.  

Anyway, my question is, for those of you who have the same sort of anxiety, how have you all pushed through that?  I don't want my coping strategy for anxiety to be avoiding the source of it.",11,2015-01-07 21:07:49 EST-0500

218,A new method to calming myself down when I get flustered,"I found this out last week and its been helping me a lot. So when I get super frustrated and I have a million anxious thoughts and I can't control myself, I make a mess. It can really be any mess but I usually use my bedside table. I sprawl out all the things I use day to day: bobby pins, remotes, cups, medicine, etc etc. 

Then, after the mess is made and I'm like 10% more anxious, I start organizing things and associating them with my thoughts. The smaller things like the bobby pins I see as the little nagging thoughts that come up every now and then, like ""are you sure you turned that file in to your boss?"" And I use the big things like remotes and cups as my biggest worries. 

I organize the objects (metaphorically, my thoughts) by use and then take them away because I don't need bobby pins on my nightstand or half the things I originally put on there. 

By the end I'm left with usually remotes (the big things) but by then, they seem so small compared to when I first made the mess that it puts my thoughts in perspective and makes everything seem just that much less heavy on my mind. 

This works really really well for me, I hope it can help somebody else out there. 

TLDR; I make a mess, attribute the big items in descending order relative to my thoughts (big item=what I'm most worried over), I organize, I get rid of the things the I don't need, I'm left with a clean area and a realistic perspective on how important those ""big worries"" are and can then clearly process them.",4,2015-01-06 06:07:27 EST-0500
219,Is anyone else scared to go to a psychiatrist because they might not diagnose you with anything?,"Basically, I'm afraid that I don't have any sort of anxiety disorder and...I'm just making a big deal out of nothing, I guess? Like, there's no medical basis for why I feel like this.",18,2015-01-02 02:51:54 EST-0500
220,Obsessively trying to remember conversations after nights out?,"Anyone else get like this? I had a really good night out last night for NYE but for some reason I am spending the whole day obsessively trying to remember all of the conversations I had last night. I've no idea why, but I guess it's curiousity as to what I was talking about with different people or maybe a bit of OCD.

Thing is, i'm never gonna remember with all of the drink I consumed. I just sometimes find it mad how you can be having drinks with friends for four hours and not remember much of what was said, despite it being a fun night.",9,2015-01-01 20:13:04 EST-0500
221,I do good things. I deserve presence and opinions.,"Lately, my anxiety has been taking a toll on my self-esteem. I am afraid of expressing myself or sharing my opinions for fear of other people disapproving or not liking me. I have also been extremely hard on myself lately. Everything I do is inadequate in my mind or I think it doesn't live up to someone's expectations, and I am an absolute wreck if I actually mess up or make a mistake or bad choice. I have been watching myself shrink in an effort to cause less harm and be less of an inconvenience to to other people. This is not fair. I know that people like me and respect me, but for some reason a part of me keeps telling me that is not true. 

My new year's resolution this year is to meditate everyday. So far I have been sticking to just breathing, but tonight I decided to add a mantra: ""I do good things. I deserve presence and opinions."" Tonight I repeated over and over again the words that I so desperately want to believe. That I deserve to take up space, that I make positive contributions to the lives of the people around me, and that people are interested in the things I have to say. 

It is now a few minutes after I stopped the mediation, and I can feel the negative self-talk and anxiety creeping back. But for a little while, I genuinely felt like I mattered more than I have in a long time. I am hopeful that 2015 will be a better year and I can't wait to meditate again in the morning. Let's just hope I can fall asleep while I'm still feeling relatively good about myself!",16,2015-01-07 06:16:40 EST-0500
222,What is the craziest thing your anxiety has made you do?,"I've done some pretty bizarre things when I was anxious. One time, I came home to find that my housemates were having a small party with their friends. I could have gone in the front door and joined them like a normal person, but that would have involved a small amount of social awkwardness, so instead I decided the best option was to go around back, jump over the wall into my garden and climb into my bedroom through the window. It was only afterwards that I realised that if a neighbour had seen me they probably would have called the police and I would have had to answer some difficult questions.

So tell me a story of when your anxiety made you act in a crazy or stupid way.",46,2015-01-07 00:56:46 EST-0500

234,For the first time in almost a year I went out and did something out of my comfort zone.,"I've recently been dealing with depression and with it a little anxiety. I use to be really outgoing around 1 year ago. I use to be have a wanting for adventure. But over the past year I have found comfort in staying at home and not wanting to do anything that wasn't reliable. School, work, and go home, once in a while go to dinner with friends. I didn't have the urge to meet people, it scared me. I thought talking to someone new was a little terrifying and found comfort and safety in it. But yesterday I saw a meetup going for comic books. The entire train ride I was so scarred, my heart pounding, thinking I could just get off this stop and go back home, but I didn't.Once I got in front of the place I couldn't seem to get myself to enter the building. Yet someone saw me, opened the door and said it's cold come on in. I sat down to the meet up, they were already talking and felt left out. After an hour of feeling like a stranger, feeling like the oddone, feeling like if I run out that door I could forget about this, I spoke up.By the end of night, I meet a really nice group of people, walked out with free comics, and have not feel this proud of myself in a long time. A lot of my friends/family don't know about my anxiety and really wanted to share with someone.  Thanks for listening <3 (reading?)",7,2015-10-18 21:59:19 EDT-0400
235,In grad school. Realized I no longer want to do what I'm studying. Terrified. Have stayed up all night 10+ times already for no reason and it's only October.,[deleted],14,2015-10-21 14:56:15 EDT-0400
236,I'm getting called out for being an awkward introvert at work,"I started a new job a couple months ago... I should preface this by saying I've always, for some reason, felt anxiety when it comes to having eye contact with people I pass in the hallway. I've never known how long is too long, it's always made me feel awkward, and I'm terrible at small talk, so I don't hold it for a long period of time.

A couple weeks ago, my coworker noticed me not holding eye contact with him. He asked me about it and if I have trouble holding eye contact. I answered that I typically don't... I only do when I pass people in the hallway. 

Well fast forward to last week, my supervisor took my unit out to lunch... Everyone was joking, having a nice time. towards the end of the lunch my coworker said 'hey, everytime you pass vballienn in the hallway, make sure and look her DIRECTLY in the eye.'... Suddenly all eyes turned on me and I had to explain myself... I could tell by the way my coworker said it that he was joking, but it really hurt my feeling and has made me bottle up ever since. On top of the eye contact thing, my supervisor told me that I caused 'a panic' bc I assumed my other coworker needed to do training, when in fact he didn't. I was just trying to help a friend of mine and to hear I caused 'a panic' just got to me and made me feel awful. 

Just now, my supervisor came to my desk to talk about something ... She ended it with asking 'are you ok? I noticed you're not holding eye contact with me?'

I just wish my coworker had never brought it up to begin with, or that I answered his initial question about me having trouble with eye contact differently ... I'm known for being a jokster and laughing a lot. But this has really gotten to me, but I have to put on a happy face and pretend everything is OK.

238,Getting raped did not help my already terrible anxiety problems. (F22),"A few months ago, I was raped by my high school sweetheart/childhood best friend. I've honestly been acting like it never happened and suppressing it hardcore up to this point, but now it's on my mind a lot. It's also opened up a lot of old wounds that I never bothered to heal. My grandpa also raped me from my toddler years up into middle childhood. My cousin also attempted to rape me as a kid, but I manage to escape that one. Lately, I'll be doing anything and the smallest things will trigger me to flashback and go into full on panic attacks. I'm barely able to get through my days. I'm always shakey and out of breath. I barely sleep and when I do, I have terrible dreams and wake up having more anxiety attacks. Yesterday, I couldn't even go to work because I couldn't pull myself together. I feel like I can't trust people  because I've been violated by people that were supposed to be so close to me. I feel like no matter how hard I work to be independent and strong that at any moment anybody could come in and take it all away from me. I know this is all over the place. I just needed to tell someone, I guess. I don't know what to do to get better, but I know I can't stay like this for long. Any suggestions would be helpful. ",27,2015-10-16 10:31:26 EDT-0400
239,The Anxiety Coloring Book Thread!,"Yesterday many of us discussed Adult Coloring Books as a means of distraction from stress and anxiety. (The fact that they call them Adult Coloring Books makes me lol).

It seems several of you had great suggestions or wanted to know more about them. For me, they have been a great tool in managing anxiety and keeping me distracted.

I like to use Watercolor Markers, but some people use color pencils or pens. You can also blend different tools to make different effects. It's really whatever you want it to be! You can find these books online or in stores. The two that I'm working from came from Michael's and Books-a-Million.

If you have a nearby Michael's you might know they almost always have a 40% off one item coupon weekly. You can use this for your markers or pencils!

The sale this week is pretty good and there are online deals on the Michael's website if you want to have it shipped.

Some people like the super intricate designs while others like the simpler designs. Here are a few photos of the books I'm working from. http://imgur.com/a/MbTDs

One is watercolor marker and one is color pencil and marker blended. Please add advice, suggestions, and links to this thread and feel free to ask questions!

I don't usually post here (most threads get buried anyway) I'm just looking for some common ground, and if possible how you try to deal with it. Like I have some major embarrassing moments in the past (social fuck-ups, bullying, even small things like a minor stutter, or failing to maintain conversation with a girl during a phonecall, etc).

These moments, both big and small, haunt me. Something I can go a few days without really being bothered, other days i'm just overcome with emotion about how awful a memory that was, to the point that i'm reliving it in my brain for an entire hour, wondering how I could have done it differently to avert such psychological trash. You just feel like screaming because of how the memory feels. Doing totally unrelated things seem to spark these moments too.

I feel like it's never going to get better, it's almost like the main driving force of my depression and social anxiety. Anyone else experience this?

258,6 months and life has changed,"Hello all. Yesterday I had my 4 month check up with my doc, and it has been amazing what a difference being on meds (Lexapro) has made in my life.

Back in June I was diagnosed with GAD and depression. I was a nervous wreck working a high stress job and it finally got to me. I had a nervous breakdown at work and decided right then I was done and needed to finally seek help. 

I have been on Lexapro since June and my life is a complete 180 from where it was. My anxiety levels are super low if even non-existent. If a problem arises instead of fearing for the worst, I can now calmly work things out. I don't lay awake in bed all night worrying about what the night day might bring. Socially I'm also way more open to people now (not that I was a shut in by any means). 

So if you're on the fence about seeking help or currently silently struggling please MAKE THE CALL and get help! You will thank yourself everyday for it later when the positive changes start taking place. ",11,2015-10-13 21:15:32 EDT-0400

I think about my heart all the time, every single thing I put in my body worries me if it's unhealthy. I obsess over taking supplements like fish oil to keep my heart healthy and drink lots of green tea. 

I exercise regularly, doing both heavy lifting and recently started doing more cardio. In school, while having presentations, I always feel like I'm gonna get so stressed out that I'm gonna have a heart attack. When I go to places, I always look around and wonder what will happen if I have a heart attack. 

Will I die here on this mountain top? Will the ambulance find me here in the woods? What if I die on this plane? I've been checked up with EKG twice in a year, nothing weird. But still my heart anxiety haunts me everyday and it's killing me. I've tried meditation, acupuncture, therapy and just pushing through. But my fears just reignite. 

Anybody got any good tips?",37,2015-10-10 21:27:00 EDT-0400

263,Anxiety was right. Feel even worse now,"I finally booked a short holiday this year, and decided to meet a friend while I was there. 

We had been talking about it for months, planned stuff for weeks in advance...

And then I got here, and they didn't show up. At first I thought they were just late, I thought I had given them the wrong time or place, or that I was in the wrong time or place... Anything to hold off the anxious fear that they had stood me up. 

I was already more anxious than usual from being in an unfamiliar city, so I kept waiting. I tried to contact them, anything. 

A few hours later I straight up ask why they didn't show and they played it off that they got mixed up, and invited me across town to some middle of nowhere pub. I turned it down because it would cost a fortune to get a cab there, and I didn't know the area. They promised we'd meet today. 

And then they stood me up again today. 

I feel sick to my stomach because my anxiety was right the whole time and they kept giving me hope.

I stopped talking to them, but I feel like absolute shit now. So much for my relaxing holiday. ",15,2015-10-10 12:41:31 EDT-0400
264,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder, feel a bit lonely in this...","Hi people. First time poster here.

I am a 24 year old girl who recently got diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, GAD. I have had a lot of phobias and OCD in the past so I am no newbie to anxiety.. I have probably had GAD for most of my life but the diagnosis is new. 

Does anyone else have GAD? What's your life like, and what do you do to cope? I feel a bit lonely in this..",47,2015-10-13 19:40:41 EDT-0400

List of hotlines via phone/text/and online,"I've noticed a small influx of posts with people wanting help or in 'crisis' and under the misconception that there are no or little options.

266,Shower breakdowns,"Just thought I'd share that breakdowns while showering are the best. Last night I hit my limit and couldn't suppress my stress and depression anymore- I erupted in tears and let the hot water loosen my muscles. I turned the water off and just sat in my bathtub- alone, vulnerable- but it was amazing I was letting myself feel emotions for the first time in about 3 months. Sure I'm still in a funk, but it was a nice release. Try it sometime. The next time you feel overwhelmed, take a hot shower, pamper yourself, you and your body deserve it. It's okay to feel- it's okay to not be strong all the time. ",5,2015-10-12 15:30:35 EDT-0400

269,I owe r/anxiety a huge thank you,"The last few days have been strange but rewarding, and I wanted to share the experience because R/anxiety made a big difference in my life. 

On Wednesday, September 30, I had a panic attack. Not a huge shock, as I've been having panic attacks since February of 2014. Unlike previous attacks however, this one came with a single, horrible thought: ""What's the point. You should just give up"". I made my way to an emergency room and stayed there until they felt I was no longer a threat to myself. I felt numb for a few days after that, not sure what would happen when that feeling ended. On Monday I found out. 

On Monday, October 5, I had a panic attack on my way to work. I took Lorazepam but I never felt the effect. The same thought appeared and overpowered everything else. I posted in r/anxiety and a few users were kind enough to offer comfort. It was enough to get me to leave work and go to my psychiatrist. She signed a form which let the hospital hold me up to 72 hours. After spending the night in emergency, I was moved to the hospitals Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit as it was the only part of the ward that had a open bed. The first night, I was terrified. I felt like I was in way over my head. The nurses help me acclimate and made that first night much easier. 

The following morning, a team of psychiatrists and medical students came to begin my assessment. As I spoke to them, I saw the whole chain of events that got me here. A string of panic attacks and medication changes that formed a terrible cycle: One where I would sink into depression, have a panic attack, get my meds changed, feel good for a few months, then sink into a depression and start all over again. After the assessment I sat in my room and thought about my approach. I started writing out ideas and, most importantly, I spent time listening to my anxiety instead of trying to run from it. I don't mean listening to the negative thoughts, so much as the cautious ones. I stopped treating that cautious voice as an enemy, and used it to drown out the negative. By the next day (today), I had a list of small changes I needed to make to break the cycle. After talking with my psychiatrist and the PICU team, we came up with a treatment plan to make sure I didn't make the same mistakes. 

I'm writing all of this for two reasons. The first is because I wanted to show that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, even if you're at the point of being placed on suicide watch. The second is because /u/ZexMurphy reminded me that for everything /r/anxiety has given me, I should give back in kind. I love you guys. It may be unorthodox (You should have heard me try to explain reddit to my psychiatrist), but having this open place has meant more to me this last year than I can express. I will do my best to give as much as I take, and hopefully give a whole lot more. 

tl;dr - Had suicidal thoughts, but got help thanks to r/anxiety 

Quick P.S - The myths I heard about the poor quality of hospital food were greatly over-exaggerated... Apart from the morning I got a off-putting blueberry muffin and a hard boiled egg.

Edit - For reference purposes, here is the post I made on Monday -> https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3nk58f/its_coming_and_i_dont_know_if_i_can_fight_it/",10,2015-10-08 23:58:53 EDT-0400

271,My first inescapable panic attack on a train,"Every day, I commute on a train between San Francisco and the Easy Bay area. The train spends about 8min underwater as it passes under the San Francisco bay, and during that time last Tuesday I experienced my first inescapable panic attack. 

The trains at 8am get packed. By packed, I mean everyone huddles in as closely as possible and you are packed like a bunch of sardines inside of a moving piece of metal. Usually, I can survive these daily rides without incident and move on with my day. But, Tuesday, a mixture of no sleep and work related stress sent me over the edge while packed shoulder to shoulder with 100 other people and I couldn't escape. 

I felt the stress slowly rolling over me as we got closer to the tunnel, and as the lights went dark I began to panic. For the first time in my life, there was nowhere to run or hide and it amplified my anxiety. My body had chills, yet felt like it was on fire. I started getting light headed. I began to lose strength in my legs and my stomach turned over. In an underwater tube, in front of 100 people, I collapsed in the corner of packed train and silently held onto the wall while fighting to keep consciousness. 

No one understood what was happening. No one said a word. Everyone stared. 

I have never been so horrified in my life. The 8min of terror felt like a life time and it took every ounce of energy I had to stay conscious until the door opened and I pushed my way out of the train on to the subway floor. I ended up having to take a taxi the remainder of the way to work so I could regain what little composure I had left.

At the end of the day, I had to take the train back home. My stomach was in a knot, my heart was racing, and something that I have done every day for the past year now had turned into a new nightmare. But, I did it. I sat in that train and I took it like a man. Because, I would rather lose my dignity and bowel control than secede what little self respect I have left to an enemy that does not exist.

TL;DR Went on a train with 100 people, had a panic attack and collapsed in a corner, arrived at work and took the train back home. I count this as a win.

272,Anxiety is pushing boyfriend away,"For the past few months, I've basically just felt overall shitty. I've felt kind of down, super insecure (I never used to be this insecure), and it feels like my stomach is in knots 80% of the time. I recently decided to get help because I realized more and more that maybe this isn't something I can control on my own and that I need to talk to someone. 

Basically, I've felt my boyfriend getting more and more distant lately. I heard him complain to a friend that things ""aren't going super well"" and that I'm really clingy. This hurt because I know I've been kind of needy lately, but it's because I actually need him. He's one of the few people I trust I can go to when I'm hurting. I want to talk to him and tell him that I'm willing to give him his space, and that it should be better now that I'm getting help, and that he just needs to communicate with me if he needs space, not withdraw. I just can't help thinking that he's going to just break up with me. He's canceled plans on me a few times and won't answer some of my messages (even one that just asked about plans for getting dinner with me and one of my visiting relatives) and I'm afraid he's going to just avoid talking, which is going to make it worse. How do I reach out to him and make him realize that I want to feel like me again and that I'm going to work towards that? I'm just so afraid he doesn't feel the same way about me anymore. He told me this week that he ""loves me a lot"" and I don't know how that would change over the course of a few days but I just can't get it out of my head that he didn't mean it. 

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the responses! It's calming to know that people either know what I'm going through or just to hear some kind words. I asked him last night if we were ok, and to tell me if I'm ever too much, and he said that we are and that I've been fine. But I'm still not completely reassured (again, me needing this reassurance probably isn't a healthy thing) but I asked him if we could talk more in depth later, and we are going to do so. I'm going to be calm and mature about it, and just explain the way I've been feeling and how I'm afraid it's affecting our relationship, and ask him what he thinks and what I can do better to make this easier for the both of us. Thanks again for all the responses! ",8,2015-10-10 19:44:44 EDT-0400

274,Does anyone get huge waves of anxiety that wash over you from head to toe?,"When my body has tried everything it possibly can to tell me to get the hell out of a situation i'm in (sweating ,twitching ,balance issues ,racing thoughts ,chest pains ,dizziness ,lightheadedness.) I get to the point were I know that I'm just going to faint and I close my eyes and instead of fainting I feel a huge roller coaster drop/adrenaline rush travel all through out my body. It scares the shit out of me and it's only happened twice once when driving on the interstate and once during jury duty when an attorney started questioning me.

Thanks in advance 

also does anybody get the weird balance issues? Like I'll step on my gas pedal and I'll miss it and get a ""falling in a chair backwards sensation"". That sensation also happens when I lean on something and it gives a little.

275,A simple metaphor that really spoke to me and will hopefully bring you some peace.,"I met with my Psychologist the other day and he said something that really spoke to me.
He said to think of anxiety like a rain storm. They come and go, and eventually, you learn the signs to know when to expect them. Sometimes they turn into thunderstorms and become a little more uncomfortable. Sometimes they may even spawn a tornado. But after a little while, they pass and it's over.

278,I gave a presentation in front of 40 people today,"Public speaking has been my biggest trigger for anxiety and panic attacks for as long as I can remember. I failed a communications class in college because I had to run out of the room to vomit in the middle of my speech. 

Over the years, it has gradually gotten easier, but it was still a struggle, and any time I had to speak in front of more than two or three people, my face would be on fire and my voice would shake. 

Two weeks ago, my manager asked for volunteers to present during an important meeting with high level executives. As scary as it sounded to me, I feel like I need to start stepping out of my comfort zone if I want to move up in my career. I volunteered.

I had help creating the presentation, and met with my manager and ran it through with my husband to make sure I was fully prepared. I delivered my presentation this morning to a room full of people, including high level executives, including the president of our business segment.

I did great! I was nervous leading up to it (which led to me spilling my coffee all over a co-worker and then running to the bathroom to cry because I felt so bad), but when it was time to get up there, I was confident, poised, and completely prepared. I spoke clearly (I have issues with projecting my voice and I tend to speak very quietly), didn't stumble over my words, and my hands were steady as a rock. I got compliments from all the higher-ups, and I feel so great about it.

I wanted to share this story with all of you, because I never thought I'd be able to do this without passing out or worse. But I did it, and I did it well, and I feel so positive about future public speaking.

Yay!",30,2015-06-09 23:57:42 EDT-0400
279,There is nothing wrong with you.,"As the title says there is nothing wrong with you and it never was. Your body works just as it should if there was a danger at hand. The limbic system initiates the fight/flight response if it thinks you are in danger, and it cant tell the difference between a real danger and a made up one. The limbic system makes conclusions from how you behave and respond to different things. If you are avoiding normal activities the limbic system will observe and conclude there is a danger thus initiating the fight/flight response. If you constantly think there is something wrong with you and you search for an exit the limbic system concludes that there is a problem and initiates the fight/flight response. Stop using avoidance techniques and stop thinking there is something wrong with you, there is nothing wrong with you it never was. Anxiety should be called protection circle as it is just your body trying to protect you. Dont be afraid of the symptons, as it is the bodys way of getting ready to fight/flight. Even when you throw up it is a way to make you lighter to move faster. So you accept that there is nothing wrong with you, now what? The nice thing is that the limbic system reprogramms itself. You need to do the things you have been avoiding, you need to act normal when you feel anxious. You need to live your life like a person that never was trapped in this protection circle. When you act normal even tho you are anxious the limbic system concludes that there is no problem and initiates the rest/digest response instead. The limbic system will reprogramm, it wont happen over night. It will steadily get better, and eventually the rest/digest response will be initiated most of the time. It might be hard to act normal when you feel anxious, remember that the limbic system always observes what you do. It will conclude that there is no danger when you act normal when feeling anxious. Remember there is nothing wrong with you, it never was.



Edit : Bit more explained.

What occurs in an anxiety disorder is the following: 

1) You use avoidance techniques

2) Your Limbic System has access to your senses.

3) It watches you perform an avoidance action in response to a fear sensation/symptom.

4) It concludes there must be a danger purely by analyzing your actions/choices.

5) It initiates the fight/flight response to keep you safe.

6) You feel the fear it produces.

7) You use avoidance techniques.


In other words you create the disorder by avoiding perfectly normal and healthy bodily functions. If you keep avoiding, the Limbic System concludes that there must be a disorder, and it keeps you on alert!!!!


What happens in anxiety removal is the following:


1) You do not avoid or escape, instead you understand that the fear not required and you do not react regardless of the presence of the fear sensation/symptom

2) Your Limbic System has access to your senses.

3) It watches you not reacting in relation to your fear sensation/symptom

4) It concludes that there is no danger.

5) It initiates the rest digest response

6) You feel the relaxation it produces.

7) You no longer feel compelled to avoid or escape.

Stop Avoiding.

In theory I'm going to break it up at first taking out the bottom questions where people gave input (so I can go through those without feeling rushed so much) and will post the majority of the results later today sometime - again fingers and toes here people :)    
The bottom part of the survey I intend on sorting though, reading everyone's suggestions & thoughts and making an attempt to then create another graph that represents that information. Sssooo here we go - wish me luck hah :)    I have no clue why I'm so nervous about this I hope it comes out well!!

--------------------------------------------------   

~~##Greetings my wonderful /r/Anxiety peeps~~   

~~Back in 2012 a user posted up a survey and a good number of people participated - the results can be **[viewed here](http://i.imgur.com/CPb6p.png)** for anybody interested. It's been a while so I thought it might be nice to do this again, with a few alterations to the previous one posted. I figure I'll keep it up a few weeks and then post the results - maybe even do a side by side compare if anybody would be interested in seeing that.~~    

~~[I've de-actived form but if you want to look here you go](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BaWY8eQD2_cxM0DNBEOw0IQc_eAB0fkjrjGiA22GOfg/viewform)~~   

## So pretty please go take the survey - and at the bottom if you could give your thoughts/suggestions it would be much appreciated!! If you have suggestions of questions to add to the form please reply to this post, or pm me, /u/ri0tnrrd

##Thanks :)

284,I'm never going back to caffeine.,"When I was a kid, I drank Mountain Dew a lot. Too much actually. I wish I hadn't as it's terrible for your health. I felt amazing when I drank it, but I am now 26 years old, and over the last 3 years I have developed an extreme sensitivity to caffeine. I now get absolutely zero of the side effects people drink it for. Instead, I am filled with the sense of an impending doom. I feel like the ship is going under and I have one last breath to savor. It gnaws at that spot, just below the solar plexus.  It fills my head with terrible thoughts. 

A few weeks ago, the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with broke up with me. To say that I was and am devastated wouldn't do the feeling justice. I have been absolutely miserable. Coincidentally, I had quit caffeine just beforehand. It is one of the best decisions I have ever made. I believe I would be unable to function if I would have continued drinking caffeine.

I went on quite the bender this weekend to try to distract from my broken heart. Walking into work this morning was difficult. I had a very important meeting with our CEOs wife and his right hand. I had to have caffeine, even knowing what was going to happen. I had a quarter of a cup of black coffee. More than enough to set things in motion. I felt a little better half way through the meeting. Cheerful even.  That feeling was quickly replaced with intense anxiety. It hasn't been this bad since last time I drank caffeine, even with my life crumbling around me. 

I can never go back to that. I still have anxiety, and I try to deal with it, but when I was addicted to caffeine, it was on a whole other level. ",40,2015-06-09 00:58:47 EDT-0400

286,Anyone else tend to get panic attacks several hours or days AFTER something stressful occurs?,"It happens to me all the damned time, and I feel crappy for plowing through my xanax because of it.

I've posted here before while having a panic attack, and I'm sitting here having another one now. What drives me nuts is that my most predictable panic attacks occur after the fact.

Today, my younger brother (16) had a big dance performance at our local city theater. He rocked it and I couldn't be more proud of him. I was so amped sitting there watching him shake it like the proverbial polaroid photograph.

After his performance, my family decided to go and celebrate at our favorite restaurant. We ate, talked, laughed, and celebrated, and my brother went to bed smiling. All in all, it was a great day. I powered through a nice steak and mashed potatoes and went to bed full.

And, 3 hours later, I woke up shaking, sweating bullets, and just about to revisit that $30 filet mignon. I'm waiting on my xanax to kick in and occupying my mind by contributing and commenting in some of this sub's other threads. I'm not terribly panicked, just sick (that's how my episodes always are) and unsurprised. After a big, stressful day - even if it's a good-stressful like going to a big show - I can almost count on waking up later that night shaking like a spastic colon, WITH a spastic colon, cold sweats, and nearly puking up my toenails.",12,2015-06-08 12:37:33 EDT-0400

288,Does anybody else hate unexpected visits from guests/friends/family?,"Hey everyone, Just want to know if anyone else experiences anything similar. I get a lot of anxiety, which manifests in anger/frustration/annoyance when my husband springs it on me that one of his friends is coming over. My home is like my safety bubble and I think it mallets me anxious. Does anyone else experience this?",29,2015-06-11 02:45:25 EDT-0400
289,I am a Liar. I can't help it.,"Anxiety is at the core of who I am today. I grew up afraid, anxious, and alone. I lied as a way to escape reality. However the reason I lie today isn't to escape but to avoid getting close to the truth. I get to personal way to quick. I have so much on my shoulders and I wish I had a friend to help with the load but everyone is dealing with there own shit too. So the few times I have opened up I was shut down. They walked away because it was to much and I regret it. So I lie so others won't get near ""me"". Telling the truth makes me feel vulnerable 

I am not afraid of being abandoned because I have never been supported and I would never turn down a helping hand. The thing is no one ever offers.

I am not a good liar. I like lying(I am weird). It's one of the few things I like about myself. The reason I love the internet is because I can lie here and most people could never tell I was. So I don't lie that way when someone doubts me I know I am telling the truth.

I wanted to write a post about asking for help on staying focused. I lose sight of my goals everyday. I blame part on my adhd, part on my anxiety and the rest on me. However I know the answer but can't move towards it because I am afraid. I am stuck.

tl;dr I lie because I am afraid if people knew the truth they wouldn't like me or want to be near me. I am stuck and hate my life. My problem is me. The answer is me.",14,2015-06-08 04:28:28 EDT-0400
290,[Rant] I remembered a really painful memory and I'm having trouble dealing with it,"Some background- I have depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety disorder.  I'm 21 and live on my own with my boyfriend, but my parents pay for my rent.  I live in a different state than them.  
My parents, my mom in particular have very high expectations for me.  They're pretty wealthy/successful, and I often get the impression that my main purpose in life in their eyes is to give them something to brag about.  When I was in elementary school, they would scold me for getting an A- instead of an A+, etc.  They constantly told me that I was lucky to be their kid.  Things like that I guess.  
Anyway, My mom recently came to visit my apartment and ended up going in my bathroom for a few minutes.  I didn't know she'd be coming so I didn't really have time to tidy up, and I didn't really want her going in there in the first place- I knew it was messy and I was embarrassed.  She didn't say anything about it so I was relieved and figured I was just being too hard on myself.  But yesterday (a week later) she sent me a long email ranting about how I needed to clean my bathroom and that I should be ashamed, it's gross, how could I let anyone see it that way, my living state is the reason i have mental health issues, etc etc.  It made me feel humiliated and disgusting.  My apartment is honestly not that bad; it's probably cleaner than all of my friends'. It's very VERY difficult for me to gather the motivation to clean however because of mental health problems, and it's something that really gets me down every day.   
BUT HERE'S THE BIG PART that's bothering me now.  I was reminded that a year ago, I was at my parents' home looking for something in their bedroom.  I ended up stumbling upon my mom's diary (invasion of privacy, i know, I shouldn't have) and flipped through it.  It was FILLED with pages and pages of negative things about me. It talked about how she didn't want me to come home because I was too depressing to be around, that I was a know-it-all, that I looked terrible and sick (I had lost 20 pounds because of a multiple-year-long IBS flareup), and just dozens of other things.  Just big long negative entries about me.  This entire journal was seriously just talking about things she dislikes about me and I don't think anything has ever made me feel worse in my life. But now I can't stop thinking about it- I feel like the harsh judgements I put upon myself are all true because of this.  I feel like a worthless disappointment and failure.  I just wish I never saw this and I don't know how I can ever get over it because it's certainly not something I can ever discuss with either of my parents.  Idk

292,"Vertigo, Anxiety, and Earwax Buildup","I had been having constant off balance/dizziness/vertigo for the last four days. I blamed a lot of it on anxiety.

Today though, I realized it might be something else since it wasn't really going away. Plus three nights ago, I remember sticking a bobby pen in my ear to help clear some earwax and remember hitting my eardrum. That was dumb of me I know.

Fast forward to today. I went to the doctor, and he couldn't see my eardrums because there was so much wax buildup.

After washing it all out, he noticed I had swimmer's ear in my left ear and an infection in the other that was causing my vertigo and dizziness.

I felt so much better after having them cleaned. As in, my anxiety has gone way down. I have to put drops in both ears and take a round of antibiotics to clear the infection.

I just wanted to let this sub know that if you have earwax problems, that could be a potential source of anxiety. Doesn't hurt to check.",8,2015-06-13 21:09:34 EDT-0400
293,Singing helps to reduce anxiety!,"I've been anxious all day and everything seemed hopeless. My stomach hurt, everything hurt. I thought I would die. It was yet another anxiety attack.

I couldn't function at all, I just decided to sing. I played my favourite songs from fleet foxes and sang for an hour or two. I sang all of their discography and it felt so amazing, I was filled with happiness. I am even thinking of studying now and being productive. This is insane!",3,2015-06-11 15:37:42 EDT-0400
294,Because of my anxiety I quit drinking caffeine about a year ago.,"It was not super difficult at the time, but now that I am working almost 40 hours a week and I just started going back to school I am way more tired than usual and could use a pick me up throughout the day. I sleep normal hours but my diet could be a bit better. I know that a lot of lifestyle changes will help me improve in the long run, but I'm about to start work now could use some energy.

295,"[Help] [Rant] Anyone else have job anxiety, but are currently unemployed due to their condition, which may prevent getting one?","Basically, I'm in a position where I need a job, and would like a decent one, but the anxiety is really crippling.

For example, I know it would be a good idea to volunteer. I've picked out an organization that does things similar to my interests that could help build useful skills (which I also feel I lack) and I know the e-mail address where I could send my inquiry about open positions, but I can't seem to bring myself to do it. I'm looking for any advice as to how I can stop feeling so anxious and scared at doing something new and different.

I was able to hold a job before. I sold cars off and on again from 2012-2015 (I quit in January), but the anxiety got to me since its such a high pressure job where management treats you like garbage and so do the customers. Plus all the other salespeople hated the job, so the negative atmosphere didn't help. It got to the point where I'd see a car pull in to the parking lot and get anxiety because it meant that I might have to talk to them, and they could be mean, rude, or I could get yelled at by my boss for saying the wrong thing.

I'm not stupid. I have a master's degree. But sitting here unemployed while literally everyone I know is at least on a decent career track continues to chip away at me on a daily basis. Any type of help you guys and gals can provide would be much appreciated.",5,2015-06-09 23:35:00 EDT-0400
296,Do you smoke Marijuana with anxiety?,"Greetings, 

I'm wondering about Marijuana usage and it's affect on individuals with anxiety. I used to smoke no problem a couple years back with no affect on my anxiety levels. Which was great. But now I'm finding it that it increases my anxiety while high as well as sober. 
I've recently cut back to once or twice a month and I've been feeling tons better.

300,I've developed a free app to try and help with anxiety and depression. Feel free to check it out :),"*if this isnt allowed feel free to remove it*

*backstory*

As someone who has suffered from depression and anxiety (and still do) and watched close family and friends suffer also, I decided to search for an app to help with depression and anxiety. Except the ones I found were all expensive or unappealing (to me). So I decided to make one myself.

So this is my app, What's Up?, the product of about 8 months work. It includes over 60 simple grounding techniques to help keep you grounded, thinking patterns and metaphors to help you keep your thoughts in check, and a diary and habit tracker. It also has a few different themes if you see the screenshots and aren't a fan of the colors. Any sort of feedback is appreciated, so feel free to let me know what you think and make suggestions :)

EDIT: If you can't get the iOS version in your app store, try replacing the 'us' in the link with your countries code or whatever for example gb or au

EDIT 2: I just wanted to say a massive thankyou to all the support you guys are giving me. It honestly means the world to me that you'll be able to make use of the app. As I said previously, as someone who has been through depression and still faces anxiety, it's incredible to be able to use the knowledge I've gained to help others get through tough times.
 Thank you all so much <3

301,Did anyone else have a dysfunctional family growing up & think this has something to do with your anxiety issues?,"I am the youngest in my dysfunctional family (dad, mom, 2 older sisters, older half-brother). My earliest memories are of my parents fighting, like big fights. To be honest, everyone in my family fought. We were never close - no hugs, no saying ""I love you"". We always pretended to be the perfect family, when in fact we were anything but. 

I think this has followed me my whole life. I hate confrontation, I hate showing my true emotions, I hate letting people get close, so I have no close friends. This makes me anxious. All. The. Time. 

Am I alone, or does anyone else think the way they grew up has impacted their life and made their anxiety worse? ",85,2015-03-16 17:43:14 EDT-0400

305,My parents will die someday and I cannot accept it.,"(I'm not really sure why I'm posting this, but I guess I simply need to talk about it to someone.) 


I live in constant fear of my parents dying. I am an only child and I don't really have any close friends, so they are the only people I really care about. We've always had a really good relationship, I love and I know that they love me. Honestly, I can't imagine life without them.

So basically, the problem is that I have this habit of assuming worst case scenario.

Mom doesn't answer the phone? Well, she probably had a heart attack.

Dad's late? Must've been killed in car accident.

To make things worse, I don't live with them, so I call them almost every day to check if they're alive. Sometimes more than once a day. I know that this is insane, but I can't help it.


Do you know what's the worst thing about it? They **will** die. Everyone dies. Every fucking day I wake up and ask myself: is today the day? Or maybe tomorrow? This uncertainty destroys my soul.

I was having sex with my boyfriend and we were really enjoying it until I started feeling strange. I realized it was because I didn't enjoy it anymore. It came on very suddenly. I didn't want to have sex whereas a minute ago I did. I just kind of froze and my boyfriend asked me what was wrong. I couldn't exactly vocalize what I felt or why I was feeling that way.

309,PSA: Please be aware of serotonin syndrome / serotonin poisoning. (Personal experience),"If you are switching between meds, please make sure your Dr checks for interactions between the medications, and make yourself aware of the potential for serotonin syndrome.

It is not very well recognised in the general medical field, but it is becoming more common with the release of new anxiety meds coming into the market.

Check for interactions yourself online, look for the half life of your medications to be sure they will be cleared out of your system before starting a new medicine.

I am writing this from my bed, recovering from serotonin poisoning. I was switching between mirtazapine and buspirone, to venlafaxine (buspirone did nothing for my anxiety, and mirtazapine was causing weight gain).

We thought the buspirone would be clear as it has a short half life, but it is fat soluble and can remain in your body for up to five days.

A few hours after my first dose of venlafaxine, I became very sick. I was unable to move or speak. I had muscle tremors. I had a very high fever and heart rate. I hallucinated. I was very confused and mentally unstable. If I had been able to call out, or move, I would have called my husband to get an ambulance. I honestly thought I was dying and there was nothing I could do about it.

After about six hours, I was able to start to move and speak a little and then was able to call for medical advice. 

I have had to stop all meds until Monday to allow my body to recover and rest. I am going back to the mirtazapine and I will work with my Dr on a suitable regime for weight control.

So, yeah, if you are changing meds, make sure you have all the information. Double check. And if possible, have someone watch you for the first dose for a few hours.

I set an example and made a small accomplishment!,"I'm really awkward and have total social anxiety, but I've been doing small things to try and improve (answering the phone quickly before seeing the caller I.D., smiling and making eye contact with random strangers) and I decided to take it up a notch. I walked with my little sister down to the grocery from our place, got our groceries, and went through the self-checkout like usual. I know she knows how bad I am in social situations, and I don't want it to rub off onto her, so I needed to set an example of normal behavior.

Inside the store there is a Redbox kiosk by the checkouts. I had a code for a free rental memorized that I was going to use, but there was a woman browsing, and being the awkward, anxious little turd I am, I decide to just forget it since I don't want to stand behind her and make her rush. 

I remember that I need to set an example, so I work up the courage, walk up to the lady (squeezing my little sisters hand as a security blanket) and tap her shoulder.

Me:""Uhh, excuse me ma'am?""

Her: With a confused face ""Yes?""

Me: "" I have a code for a free rental you can have, you know, if you want""

Her: ""Oh that'd be great! Thank you!""

I proceed to give her the code and explain how to use it. She thanks me again and I walk away, groceries in one hand, sister in the other.

313,So i'm questioning my sexuality and it's making me anxious,"So i'm in my junior year of high school and I think I may be gay or at least bisexual. I never thought this until very recently. Up until now I've watched straight porn but it always has to be hardcore with at least one dude, and the dude is usually what I focus on. I can't get off to softcore naked women. Recently, I decided to watch gay porn to see what I thought. I really enjoyed it. I actually prefer it over straight porn. The thing is though, I can still find women attractive. If I'm at school and I see nice boobs or a sweet butt I can recognize that, and I actually notice attractiveness a bit more with women than with men. It's just that when it comes to porn and stuff, men totally trump women. And I was totally straight all throughout middle school. How the fuck did I just suddenly turn gay/bisexual? This has been on my mind for the past week and I can't seem to stop thinking about it. The thing that makes me anxious about this is not the outcome of being any sort of sexuality (because I'm totally cool with all of them), but of the confusion of it all. I've never been this unsure of such a big thing in my life. I've had an anxiety disorder for my entire life and this whole thing is really making it thrive. I'm actually afraid of spending the rest of my life with a man because the thought of spending the rest of my life with a woman is so ingrained in my psyche that just the thought of such a thing is totally foreign. But, I just went on a trip with a group of 8 people and there was one guy in our group that I was genuinely attracted to and that I would consider spending my life with. This is the first time that's ever happened. Maybe the answer is totally obvious to everyone else. If it is then please tell me because I have no idea.",19,2015-03-21 04:07:18 EDT-0400
314,Anyone else have problems with their face turning red?,"Hey guys. So I haven't been diagnosed with any sort of anxiety, but I have this awful problem of anytime any sort of attention is put on me, even worse when I do something embarrassing... My face turns bright red.

It's awful because a lot of people are assholes and say ""look how red he's getting!"" Of course that makes it ten times worse and probably even more red cuz now everyone is looking. 


It's terrible because I dont feel confident. I feel like a child who everyone is laughing at. It makes me all sweaty and shaky and I just want to melt into the floor and disappear.

Anybody else have this problem or a solution to the problem?

I still really want the other job.  But so much pressure is off.  Holy crap.  

And I was so anxious about the interview, I slept like crap last night.

I show up and walk in and sit down.  The guy says ""this isn't really an interview, we just want to make sure you're a person we want in our classrooms.""  So I don't look like an axe murderer, I'M HIRED!  Least stressful interview ever.

We are broke (more like poor).

321,Anxiety and Stomach Problems,"My anxiety has recently gotten worse recently due to the physical sensations that coincide with anxiety, most notably the stomach issues. Once I approach an anxious situation and begin to feel the stomach upset, my anxiety increases ten fold and I go into full on panic mode. I feel as if I'm literally going to shit my pants if I don't get out of that situation. It's especially bad if I'm in an agoraphobic situation where I feel trapped and there's no way of getting out. 

Agoraphobic social situations are a part of life. When I get a job I'm going to need to stay there and do my work. When I go to college I'm going to need stay and do my work. I'm beginning to feel hopeless and feel like I will be like this the rest of my life.

My social anxiety may onset my physical symptoms, but the stomach upset gets me into panic attack mode. I've started a cycle of being anxious about getting anxious. I think ""if I go and hang out with friends, what happens if I start to feel anxious and feel like I'm going to shit myself? What I've I'm in their car when it happens? What would I be able to do?"" these what if's work me into a frenzy and make me anxious before I even approach the situation. Just typing this makes me anxious.

I'm currently seeing a psychologist for therapy and a psychiatrist for meds, both of which think the best course of action is exposures, exposures, exposures. However, I can't do these exposures when I feel like I'm going to need to go the the bathroom every 20 seconds. I went to a gastrointrologist who said I have IBS. I'm taking Klonopin to help manage the anxiety, but I haven't noticed a significant effect and am still having to go to the bathroom on the fly when my anxiety comes around. I'm wondering what others who have experienced the same physical symptoms have done. What meds have helped for you? Have you turned to stomach meds instead to help your anxiety?

322,"Crippling fear of death. Panic attacks, can't breathe.","Okay, so there is [this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ek9wb/panic_attack_caused_obsessive_fear_of_death_what/) to an old /r/anxiety post that was posted here a year ago, which I found via Google.  That's what made me decide to try to post this here.

I'm not quite sure how to put this.  The other night, I was rushed to the ER with horrible chest pains.  It turns out I have pleurisy, and it wasn't a heart attack.  I didn't think that it *was* a heart attack, but being in excruciating chest pain and not being able to breathe was pretty terrifying.  So, I get home several hours later, and I lie down.  Suddenly, out of nowhere, I start having a panic attack.  It had been a few months since I had had one that bad...

I started thinking about death.  Not about *how* I'm going to die, but death itself.  The act of dying itself doesn't bother me, but it's the after part.  I know that we all die, and I've known eventually I will die for quite some time now (maybe since I was like 4 years old).  But I'd never really thought about death before.  All of a sudden, I started thinking about how one day I won't exist, I won't even KNOW I'm not existing anymore, and that life will be over.  I'll just cease to be.  I'll lose consciousness and I'll never wake up.  Life is all we know, so we have nothing to compare it to, and we can't imagine anything other than being alive.

> I feel like I'm the only rightfully panicked person in a room full of people that have drank the Kool-aid. People seem to just either ignore the fact that they are going to die eventually, or they find solace in religion.

^^ That is from the post I linked above, and it's exactly how I feel.  It's been about 48 hours now, and I can't snap out of that mindset.  When I lie down, I get the panic, and I can't breathe and I just cry.  During the day, nothing seems to matter anymore.  Why am I finishing my degree when I'm just going to die?  Why should I clean my bathroom?  Why should I meet new people?  Why should I do anything?  On the other end of that, when I don't do anything, I worry that I'm just wasting my life, because (again) I'm going to die and I won't be able to do the things I wish I had.  

I don't have patience for friends and family talking about the daily minutiae of life anymore.  I just want to grab everyone I know, slap them, and shake them, and just scream, ""Does it fucking matter? No!  We're all going to die!""  I can't bring myself to give even the most remote of shits about anything.  Everything seems so pointless.

I see that this is getting obsessive to the point where I need to see someone.  However, unlike my fear of heights, or my anxiety over my career path, this can't be fixed.  There's no way to stop myself from dying, and I think that that is why it's so fucking terrifying.  I'm not religious, but I have to say that now I really see the value in being a religious person.  I'd love to have the solace in an afterlife to comfort me, but I'm faced with crippling nothingness afterward.

How do I get to the point where I can exist normally again?  I feel like something has snapped, and I want to go back to that place of oblivion I was at before I became so hyperaware of my mortality.",18,2015-03-19 06:57:59 EDT-0400

329,"My son is 9, and tonight we had over our first guest. Ever.","I've never been one to open up my space to anyone really, especially not another child. I just have way too much anxiety about not having the right food or not being able to entertain or whatever else is the case. I don't want to be responsible for anyone else but my kiddo.

Tonight I decided on the fly random to accept his cousin's dad's request to watch him, and so far we are about 3 hours in and we went to the store to get a few candy snacks, got some fro-yo, they played a game for a few minutes, then we stat down and watched Godzilla together, and now they are making paper swords and crap to play out their own version of the movie. 


Soon I'll put them to bed and call it a night myself.

This is a big step for me. Hopefully I can handle doing this again with someone not in the family so that I can give my kiddo at least some sense of a ""normal"" childhood at my house (does this all the time at his dads and such so he isn't missing out on it completely) ",10,2015-03-22 08:04:18 EDT-0400

331,"Sweating. I hate it. More than anything in my life, I fucking hate it.","I sweat. A lot.

I've always sweat quite a lot, but it started to get worse when I started lifting weights around 17 years old. I got bigger and noticed I started sweating under my arms a bit more. That was fine, it wasn't a big deal. I just started using a stronger antiperspirant and it stopped. People noticed though, and commented, which obviously made me want it to stop, so I did something about it.

Since then, I've become very self concious about my sweating. It seems to get worse and worse. It's a vicious circle; I know I'm going to start sweating, I can feel it coming, I try my hardest to stop it from happening, breathing, slowing down, trying to calm myself, but it still happens. To the point where I'm literally dripping. Everywhere, face, head, back, chest, neck, everywhere. 

It's happened before where I've been in the chair about to get my hair cut. The barber has started chatting to me, like a normal human being would do, then I start getting a bit awkward and shock, begin to sweat. Just a tiny bit to start with, barely enough for anyone to notice. But then I think to myself, ""Please don't get any worse."" But it does. Next thing you know, I'm sitting in the chair, sweat pouring from every single part of my body, the barbers grabbed a towel, got me a glass of water, asking if I'm ok, and I'm sitting there, more embarrassed than I've ever been in my life, just wishing it would stop. Wishing no one would say a thing and just let me calm down. Eventually I did, but even walking to the barbers now I can feel my heart beating faster, just waiting for my body to break out and look like I'm about to pass out.

It's whenever I talk to someone new. Or whenever I talk to someone I'm not totally comfortable with. I'm just too fucking self concious about everything and I hate it.

It's embarrassing, humiliating, and I don't want to be known as the guy who sweats like an animal.

My friends know I sweat a lot, but that's mainly when we're doing exercise or playing football or whatever. I'm dripping, literally dripping with sweat after about 10 minutes of mild exercise. The problem is, I don't care if I sweat during physical activity, that's expected, I know people sweat more than others. We joke about how it's because I'm in such bad shape, but I completed a 12 mile assault course about 5 months ago, I'm not too much of a couch potato. It's when I sweat just talking to someone that I hate.

It's genuinely making me depressed. I hate it. I'm content with everything in my life, but this. Giving a presentation to people at work; before I'd even stood up, I could feel what would happen. I don't care if I'm nervous, everyone gets nervous. But when I get nervous or anxious or self concious, I sweat more than anyone else I've ever seen in my life.

I'm not trying to be melodramatic about this, I really do. I've never met anyone who even comes close to how much I sweat. I shouldn't have to go outside for 10 minutes to cool off and dry off every time someone I haven't known for 10 years talks to me for 30 seconds. That in itself is embarrassing. ""Where have you been?"", ""Oh, just had to go outside and calm down and let the sweat dry off because I can't talk to people without panicking and soaking my shirt through"", ""Oh... ok"".

Has anyone else dealt with this? What did you do? I hate it. So so much.

Even searching on the internet, I've yet to find examples of anyone struggling as much as I do. Maybe I've not been searching enough.",40,2015-03-22 22:43:43 EDT-0400
332,"Today, I had my first job interview in almost four years!","In the past four years, I've gone from retail employee, to student, to college dropout, to complete agoraphobic. I didn't leave my house for almost a whole year. And then, this past year and a half or so, I started pushing myself, with the help of my therapist, to get back out of the house and being around people. 

I attended church with my family (though I stood in the back where I could escape when I needed to), I started attending various open mic events at local coffee shops and bars, and I've made new friends that I never would have met, had I not pushed myself. 

Now, I've since become an agnostic/deist/whatever, I'm back in school (studying online, but it's better than nothing), I'm actually playing music at the open mic events on a regular basis, and I finally feel happy again. And, as I said in the title, I had a job interview today and I think it went really well.

I still deal with anxiety on occasion, but I know how to manage it now, and without taking any prescriptions.

335,Terrified of phone calls. Help?,"This is basically my first reddit post ever so I'm not entirely sure how to go about this.

Basically, whenever I have to make a phone call, I get crazy anxious. I basically curl up on my bed and rock back and forth. Sometimes I hide under the blanket for an hour or so. And when I finally do work up the courage to make a phone call, I shake like a leaf and stammer/can't reply a lot. 
I get anxious with receiving calls too but not nearly as bad. I basically react to my phone ringing like a jumpscare. I'm startled and afraid at first, but once I answer it seems to go perfectly fine. I guess as long as I'm not the one initiating the conversation, I do better.

But the biggest problem is that I have no idea how to work on getting better with this. I don't know anyone who has phone call anxiety nearly as bad as I do, and they don't know what to tell me. I'm so tired of being terrified of my own phone. Can anyone give me some advice?

EDIT:: Sorry for taking so long to do this. Thank you to everyone who responded! You all had really useful advice and I feel like I can start being that much more confident with the phone :)",20,2015-03-25 20:29:24 EDT-0400

So, long story short. I didn't have the best relationship with my parents. (Shocker!) 

~2yrs ago: My mom was in hospice for about 2 months losing against lung cancer. I was trying to prepare myself for that inevitability. But, my dad shocked us all by going first. He had a heart attack at her bedside just days before she also passed. The next month, my dog suddenly dies,  I spend 2 weeks in the hospital with Pancreatitis. I miss too much work and get fired from the best job I ever had. I worked there nearly 5yrs to the day. I've struggled with anxiety & depression most of my life, but it started to snowball hard at this point. I turned to drink and smoke to cope. But, it only made me paranoid and guilty on top of everything. 

January 2015: Things were getting a bit better. Got a new job alongside my sister, my wife and I moved in with said sister and her husband. I started to enjoy simple things again. 

January 20th my sister commits suicide. I subsequently lost my job because I couldn't be at work as much as I wanted to in the month following.

I started to watch the world crumble, again... 

Now I'm struggling to stay away from drugs and booze. I'm trying to get another job, but results aren't instant. My wife must be furious and extremely disappointed in me. I've lied about the drugs and booze in the past, and again I'm just having trouble controlling my addictions and emotions. She needs a man to help her in life, not a scared man-child. I'm scared she's going to divorce me any day. Though she says it's not on her mind and that she loves me. I can still only think that I'm just hurting her at this point.

Anyways, Saturday just gone I was invited to watch my friend perform at a gig, and it was the first time I've been somewhere new in over 18 months and been completely fine. I didn't even have the fear of having fear like at the previous gig. And I'm so happy - I had no problem communicating with anyone, I even went all out dancing which I NEVER do in public.

354,Anyone else set off by lots of noise? My noise sensitivity has been driving me extra nuts lately and I just need to whine it out,"So I have misophonia or whatever, where I'm extremely sensitive to and become fixated on certain sounds like repeated tapping or chewing or just certain random sounds.  That seems to become more agitated when my general anxiety is higher. But lately what's bothering me is VOLUME of noise.  We live in an old house that requires window units for air conditioning, and they're just so loud that all the rest of the sound in the house needs to be turned up too. So the tv, voices, music, videos on phones... it all overwhelms me.  It feels like all this loud sound turns into physical walls that are closing in on me and crushing me and causing me physical pain, piercing my ears and vice gripping my head and flattening my chest.  Gah, I hate it!

No one in my family understands.  I was just awoken to my kids piling in my bed and turning on Netflix really loud to hear over the AC.  I turned it down just a notch or two and put my head under the pillow, but then my husband came in too and started watching videos on his phone in the bed with us.  So he had that at full blast and then my daughter turned the shows up even louder and then they're all trying to talk to me, and I just burst into tears and had to leave the room.  So waking up that way and having my day off to a bad start will ruin my mood for a couple hours I'm sure. I'm currently in a dark, quiet room with a LOCKED door trying to recooperate because I need to feed these kids so they can leave or something. 

I'm starting Zoloft soon for depression (currently pregnant and limited in what I can or am willing to take, Zoloft seems to be the least risky)... I believe that helps anxiety too right?  Lord I hope so.  It's been so awful and crippling lately, not just with the noise stuff but just sensory overwhelming in general.

You ever start a project with such great intentions and by the end you just want to be done with it cause you keep starting over? Well that's what I've been doing all these weeks with these results. Honestly this is a crappy not the best job but I really feel bad not having given the results yet. Thank you to all who filled out the survey - all 1040 of you!?!!?!? I'm still reading though the comments portions so many great suggestions. :)

Anyway - I put the image on my server/site so I can go back and maybe clean some stuff up. I *HAD* wanted to also put in comments that users put in and reply to them but times is so not on my side. I talk to much - I think too much - I should be stop typing and just post this already.

#[Anxiety Results June 2015](http://therapyresources.org/anxietysubsurveyresults/anxietyresults2015.png)

Lets see here - of all the comment questions a few things I'd like to throw out there and get out of the way:

    1. WE HAVE A CHATROOM!?!?
Having a hard time, want someone to talk to? We're in our irc channel there's tons of people we're really nice and helpful. I only say this because of the 1040 responses there were sooo many ""I wish there was a place we could all hang out/is there a chatroom/whatnot"" - anywho the link is on the dropdowns at the top of the page.

    2. We have tips & resources!!
Ok yah they are new, and I'm still building them, but I want to start actually having a weekly 'share your tips' type thing so we can all help each other with things that have worked and whatnot.

    3. I like lists, and want to keep making this list but I've already typed wayyyyy too much. Any questions or comments or anything feel free to ask.

I don't like that it didn't break between 3 & 4 so I wrote something here.

358,Im finally doing it guys!,I am finally getting help and accepting that this is something thats out of my control. Anxiety has ruined many parts of life for me and keeps me inside a lot. I just got on some medication after an ER visit because of an anxiety attack that lasted 14 hours and I couldnt stop throwing up. I am also starting therapy Thursday so I feel excited to finally start taking control! ,10,2015-07-22 05:50:53 EDT-0400

360,College Anxiety...I don't know what to do...I think I'm just too stupid to learn.,"So...Here's the thing...I dropped out of High School at 16. I got a GED. I got Ds and Fs in High School and now I'm going to be starting college to get my degree in Computer Science so I can be a programmer...The problem is, going to college gives me such severe anxiety. I have this extreme phobia that I'm just too stupid to learn anything. Like I just keep having these images in my head of me reading textbooks, listening to lectures and trying really hard to learn things but it just doesn't...Stick...If that makes sense. I've had similar anxieties about learning new languages, like if I try to learn a second language I just won't be able to, like my brain won't process it. I just...I don't know...I can't fail college. I keep fearing I won't learn, I'll fail college which will make my girlfriend leave me and I can't go through that...I almost feel like I should just not bother with college and see if I can convince my girl to let me be a stay at home dad...But I don't think that will work, so I have no choice here...

Thanks for listening to my ramblings. If anyone can help, that would be appreciated.",19,2015-07-27 16:54:38 EDT-0400

362,"Anyone else seen this new ""#GrowingUpWithAnxiety"" fad on Twitter?","It ticks me off. A lot. These people that retweet the ""too nervous walk up to the cash register to pay #growingupwithanxiety"" and ""worried what people with think about me #growingupwithanxiety"" In some cases, yes. But NO. Anxiety is a mind-crippling and even physically crippling thing at times and for some people. You can't just self-diagnose yourself out of the blue. Anxiety isn't relatable. I just needed to go on a little rant... Does anyone agree??

366,"I'm sleep depraved because of my anxiety, and now I'm anxious about my lack of sleep.","I'm a 25 year old guy, lean with no health issues according to my doctor last week. The only thing I have is severe health anxiety, which keep negative thoughts racing in my mind, especially when I'm in bed.

This kept me from sleeping well the last couple of months. I could count the days I got 7-8 hours on one hand, and mostly it's between 6 and 7 hours when things are more or less ok.

 I have periods where I don't get more than 3-5 hours of sleep for about 5  days on end. This really makes me anxious, because I already have this fear of dropping dead randomly because of a heart attack or whatnot, and it doesn't make things better to say the least. My anxiety symptoms get worse, the chest pains, palpitations and arm pains are worse too. I'm too tired to go outside and actually enjoy my day doing something active.

My doctor told me I won't drop dead anytime soon but that's harder to believe everyday I don't get enough sleep, when I have cold hands, chills, a stiff neck, hot flashes and tingly feelings in my chest. Can anyone relate?",8,2015-07-25 19:27:06 EDT-0400

369,"You don't have to read this, I just really need to type this out.","I am at my limit today. I have been making plans to kill myself for over a month now, I even got a quote for a ferry ticket, my plan was to jump off the ferry in service so that nobody has to deal with it, hopefully I'll just sink to the bottom and nobody will hear of me again. But I am too pathetic to do that, I am a coward even though I don't want to live anymore. 

My wifes parents hate me, we got her mom to feed our pets while we went away for a weekend and they told me our apartment is the most disgusting thing she has ever seen. And now they are not talking to their daughter, because she is married to a disgusting slob, or me, because I'm a disgusting slob who married their daughter. 

I suck at my job, I have been on thin ice for months and now today they finally put me on the death sentence performance plan where if I make one mistake I get terminated. I am not going to survive this, nobody does. I am done at my job and now we will probably lose our apartment because we won't be able to afford rent.

I hate everybody around me, nobody makes me happy other than my wife, who I feel guilty for being with because all that has happened since I came into her life is that she has lost the respect of her family, friends and anybody who used to give her the time of day. I don't deserve her for one second.

My cats boxes are disgusting, they deserve better than the shitty owner they have who can't even afford a new box of litter till my probably last ever paycheck on friday before I get fired for good. My apartment fucking stinks and I know it, I am disgusting, my wifes parents are right and it is all my fault. There is fruit flies buzzing around the sink which is full of dirty dishes and I notice it every day but just pretend like it;s nothing. I know it is more than nothing, it is disgusting and I don't deserve to be alive for letting my pets and wife live like this. 

I'm disgusting, all I do is hurt people, make people live in filth and destroy their families. And now I won't even have a job. At least when I had a paycheck there was something redeeming about me, now I am just the most worthless person in the world. And I can't even kill myself because I'm too pathetic. 

Sorry for clogging this space, I just needed to type because my chest is going to explode right now. I hate myself, I always have and I always will. I need to not feel anything anymore. ",6,2015-07-23 02:56:33 EDT-0400

371,"Triggered by anyone being upset with me, no matter how small","Lately I've realized that I care too much about what people think of me. Like, to a point where I get sick. People tell me ""oh, you shouldn't care what people think of you."" *yeah, OK thanks. Let me just stop.*

Right now I am hiding in my room because my mother in law heard me calling my husband for help when my baby threw up all over himself. That shouldn't be a big deal. But I heard ""really?"" Like the kind of really that translates into *are you fucking kidding me?*

So now I'm in my room crying, too afraid to go out there. 

The other day, my mom asked me to watch her roast and put more water in it if it gets low. I did. But after I refilled it, it boiled out much faster than I expected. Burnt pan and roast... I automatically feel guilty and like I've ruined everyone's day.

I think I know the cause of this. When I was growing up, if I breathed wrong around my mom or step dad I would get in trouble. I was always getting yelled at, always waiting around for the next screaming match. Always waiting to get my phone, TV privileges and friends taken away. I was always the outlet of everyone's anger. I was the least favorite kid and everyone knew it. I was always doing something wrong.

Now I think it has made me a nervous adult. When someone is mad at me, even slightly annoyed, I get nauseous and my mind race s and I just want to be away from everyone. I don't want to ask anyone for help with anything because I think it translates into ""I'm retarded, I can't do anything for myself, nobody wants to be bothered with my problems.""

Anyone have any insight to help me better understand what the fuck Is going on with me?",10,2015-07-26 20:17:51 EDT-0400

373,"Tried overcoming social anxiety for once, stopped assuming bad, and something good came of it","Hey /r/Anxiety!

I always love reading the little success stories that come up here and in different subreddits once in a while. I now have one of my own to share. It's not much, but it means the world to me.

It's the third time I'm writing this now, because I always keep coming up with wall of texts. Now I'm just gonna spare you the details on how my social anxiety developed. Just be assured it was so bad that I stayed at home and played online games for 16 hours a day for years instead of going to school/university. For the last six years, I had exactly... no IRL friends at all. I'm in my early mid twenties now, having achieved pretty much nothing. Fake edit: Wall of text again, sorry.

Alright now comes the fun part. Way back then, shortly after said best friend just left me, there was some girl a few grades under me. At the time I had my hair dyed black (just trying new things), and because I was awkward and anxious, I didn't get it cut and instead grew it out. Well, said girl was in her emo phase at the time and apparently found me interesting. She chatted me up online in quite some creepy way (""I always see you everyday in school"", I didn't even know who the fuck she was after she sent me pictures). We did get along well chatting though. She was so into me that we decided to go to a concert of my favorite band at the time. We met and bought the tickets, it was awkward as fuck, because we were both shy. That in itself was quite a feat. She kept wanting to meet me, call me, I always rejected and instead played some game. Long story short, we slowly drifted apart.

Fast forward 6+ terrible, very lonely years. Me at my little-social-interaction job with her coming up to my mind for whatever reason. I decide to reconnect to her when I am in a better spot in life. But I also decided to do that 3 years prior. So, instead of wasting even more precious years for no reason, I yolo past my anxiety and send her a message on some super old site that barely anyone even uses any more. 

Doesn't answer for three weeks after even logging in. I get the most terrible thoughts of what I did wrong and how much she hates me. Turns out she did answer, answer quite positively in fact, since she immediately said she wanted to meet me. I told her I'm still awkward and weird as hell (which isn't really true), she said she can easily deal with it *smiley face*. Oh my, that was so good to read.

Of course, everything didn't go as planned. Over the course of two months, we tried to meet three times, each time falling through with nobody making concrete statements of where and when to meet. I was too afraid to ask her to meet up, she never said anthing either. We wouldn't send each other texts for weeks. Everytime I started assuming she just didn't care. I really thought she didn't. But then I also thought, she sounded so much interested before, why would she just change her mind for no reason? So each time, a day or two later, I'd just send a random text again. So in the end I would at least have tried. Sure enough, every time she also suggested again that we should still meet. Then again she'd forget to reply to more concrete meetup requests. It fucked with my head so much.

So for the 4th, *final time* I asked her again with more concrete times, and she didn't reply for 3 days straight again. I was about to give up. Instead I asked ""what is wrong with you"". Nothing, she forgot. And once again I said fuck it and just told her a time and place to meet. She agreed, this time we actually met.

And it went better than expected. You know those crazy running, not-having-seen-each-other-for-months her-jumping-on-him hugs? Totally happened. So happy.

All the doubts and bad assumptions I had built up were completely invalid and stupid. I was so afraid of meeting her, because I thought I'd run out of things to say. In the weeks prior I thought of so many things I could talk about. But I thought I'd eventually run out of things to say and it would get awkward. In reality I didn't even get to talk about 10% of the things I planned to say (mostly because she talked 80% of the time, admittedly). She changed quite a bit and is no longer some shy person but instead very outgoing, has many friends and is generally just very busy in life.

It's all going good now. We're planning to go to three local events within the next 6 months. And whatever comes in between, we'll see, nothing else planned.


Anyway. Maybe I'm lucky. But the one thing that I'm really happy about right now is that I kept trying. I would dwell on strings of negative thoughts and bad assumptions for weeks on end. Reasons for why she wouldn't text, reply, be unspecific and seem disinterested. Turns out she's actually just super busy IRL and barely getting along with that herself. Instead of dropping her over all those assumptions, I now even have someone that offered to listen to me if I want to talk about the awful past few years I had. Which is something I needed badly.",3,2015-07-25 17:24:05 EDT-0400

I ended up with less than 60% attendance at college. With doing intensive courses it meant I was having to teach myself a lot of work to catch up, to make things easier for myself I was studying two languages, one of which I knew nothing about.

Anyway, with only having 3 subjects instead of the usual 4 (I had to drop one due to being so ill, physically and mentally) I had, and to be honest still have no idea what lies ahead for me next year because I only just passed all 3.

Despite passing, I don't feel as happy or proud as I maybe should because I was so set at the start of the year to get A's and B's or at the worst C's. So for the first time in a long while I had that familiar feeling of dread as the panic attack took over.

382,Forgive yourself,"I've discovered a new tool to fight anxiety. It works really well! Let me tell you all about it.

I have a tendency to be extremely self critical. I ruminate on all the bad things I've done, and I hate myself for being so self defeating. What's wrong with me? Why do I have to be so weak and hypersensitive? Why can't I just get over it? That sort of thing.

Well today, I tried something different. I said, ""I forgive myself for everything. All my mistakes, all my flaws, all my wasted afternoons, missing assignments, half assed essays, all the times I disappointed people, all the times I let myself down, insulted myself, hurt myself: its all forgiven."" It's a huge weight off my shoulders. I've fucked up a lot in life, and that's ok. I forgive myself. Tomorrows a new day, and even if I fuck up again, its no big deal. I'll just forgive myself for that too.

For the first time in forever, I feel ok. I'm not dreading the future or ruminating about the past. I'm just enjoying this moment of peace. I hope others might also find refuge in this technique!",15,2015-08-12 03:31:55 EDT-0400
383,I want to kill myself.,"I was going to do it a while ago, but I decided against it. I thought, I'll just see a few friends over the summer, have some fun, I'll feel much better.

Three weeks in, I haven't seen anyone, I made arrangements to go out and then they ditched me as a 'joke', I see people having fun, going on holiday, meeting friends and going out on snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, everything.

I've developed this inferiority complex where I see everyone being better than me in every way, and then I get these thoughts, suicidal ones. 

""Why stay on this planet if I'm nothing"", that kinda shit. I wrote a list of reasons to kill myself, and day upon day ive been adding to it over and over again. 

Maybe some people should just die if they will be no use to society. Over population is a genuine concern, maybe I should just end it now and spare a few resources.

I get to extremely jealous and angry, I'm so anxious in public, thinking ""do I look fat/ugly/stupid"", and I usually do look fat/ugly/stupid.

I'm split between two homes, my dads side and my mums side are constantly at war with one another, I get anxious just going back to my dad's house, I can't do it anymore.

But here's the funny thing. I desperately want to end my life, however I don't want to use any of the methods I've found. 

Also, I swear to god, if you fucking refer /r/SuicideWatch to me I will go fucking ballistic.",45,2015-08-14 04:20:15 EDT-0400
384,I've never been more embarrassed in my life. I feel so broken.,"I finally got the courage to set up an appointment with a therapist to address my anxiety issues that have gradually been getting worse for the past months/year. 

I see the therapist in a few days but yesterday I feel like I hit a road block that has already digressed any potential progress I may have. 

I was at a family member's house last night and a fight broke out. It was a pretty intense yelling fight and it was about politics. It got extremely intense at one point and very, very mean things were said. My heart started to pound the very second it started. I eventually got pulled into it. When I'm at this house I get scared to talk. I'm scared to speak my mind. I'm terrified of confrontation. Usually, I just flat out dislike being over there because of how much it stresses me out. I constantly worry a fight like this will break out. After I was brought up in this fight that I wanted zero part of, she (family member) nags and confronts me to the point where I can't take another moment in that room. I ask to leave the room, and I'm told no. I stand up and say ""I just can't do this, I can't. I need to leave the room, please. I can't do this."" but she keeps on and on and she keeps asking why I can't stand it, why I can't deal with it, and she is being extremely aggressive. She asks why I can't speak up like the rest of them, what's my problem? I end up snapping and yell back to her that I hate the fighting, I can't take it, and they aren't acting like adults. At this point my heart is racing out of my chest, I'm trembling, and my mind is racing. She keeps on but I honestly can't remember what is said and I finally start to leave the room and in my anger and panic I say, ""this is why I'm seeing a therapist."" I completely leave the room and go into the garage and pace. I can't stop. My mind is completely blank and I can't stop moving. 

She eventually comes into the garage and yells to me ""If you're going to be like this, leave my house and I don't want you back here. Leave. You aren't welcome. We are adults. I have a serious problem with you right now. You come in our house and don't talk and whisper to SO and it's incredibly rude. I feel uncomfortable in my own house with you here.""

At this point I've lost it and I'm yelling back to her. Yelling things that I don't want to tell her, but she's nagging me and begging for confrontation. She brings up so many things she has issues with about me. Things like how I haven't introduce her to my friend, how I don't share anything, how I apparently stopped her from having a relationship with my mom because of my ""feelings"". I'm so upset, I'm so angry. I'm crying and trembling and I'm the most uncomfortable I've ever been in my entire life. I feel like the attacks and aggression just keep on coming. I eventually yell ""I HAVE SOCIAL ANXIETY LEAVE ME ALONE"". She doesn't leave me alone, but I think she eased up a fraction (but not like that made much of a difference at this point). I am then brought back inside and a to face the rest of the family (2 others) in my moment of utter brokenness and explain to them how I've been feeling. She eventually says she's glad I'm getting help and that she wants to help me as much as she can and that the family is there for me. She then calms down completely, says she loves me and that she'll try to alter the fighting behavior when I'm around and everything is back to normal like the fight never happened except for me crying at the kitchen table. 

After that, I don't want to see her for a long time. It's going to take me a long time to recover. I feel so embarrassed, ashamed, broken, and stupid. I didn't want to talk and I was not ready to talk about my problems with them. I feel like I was forced into this stressful situation and it's made me so upset with her. I feel that any help in the future from her will never be appreciated by me because of how she treated me. I will never forget last night and I will obsess and stress about it for months and months, years probably. How hard is it to be compassionate? I feel that any other person in that situation would not have acted in that way. Or maybe they would have and I'm just acting like a baby. I'm so hurt and confused.  


EDIT: Thank you everyone who responded, all your words and advice mean a lot to me. I'm still shaken up about the whole ordeal, my mind has constantly been racing since Sunday night. I'm trying so hard not to feel embarrassed and ashamed but it's been really hard. I know it's irrational, but I still feel like everything that happened was all my fault. I don't think I've ever been more ready to spill my heart and soul to a therapist because I desperately need her help right now. ",25,2015-08-10 21:30:58 EDT-0400

387,Struggling to Leave the House. Constant Anxiety for 12 years. Can't cope. Need some advice from other sufferers please.,"I urgently need help with my anxiety but I don't know where to go, or what to do. I have suffered with this for 12 years. It's a battle every single day.

I've been on all sorts of medications, I'm no stranger to my doctor. At 30 years old this is literally crippling me. Sometimes I would rather just not be alive because dealing with this is nasty.

I've smoked cannabis for the past year, it was the only thing that worked after my meds stopped working. Previous to that I had Testicle Cancer. I became dependant on cannabis and smoke way too much. An unhealthy amount. I can spend £200+ a week on cannabis.

But it helped me. Now it doesn't.

I stopped smoking it today, for good. I had a joint earlier, but I am determined that was my last one. I have no money for no more, and I want to ride out this storm and get my head back to normal.

The past few months I have been housebound much of the time. Content smoking weed, sitting on the bed with the laptop. But this too caused problems.

I've lost weight. Non of my jeans fit me. I don't eat much when I smoke because I've had a fear of choking from birth. I feel sick a lot because anxiety causes me to suck my stomach in constantly.

Today I left the house to go for a walk. I didn't feel too good before leaving. I could feel that cement feeling in the pit of my stomach and my mind was racing thinking ""What if I need food on my walk, I have no money to buy any"". Or ""What if I dont feel good and I'm too far from the home"".

I done the walk, but under extreme anxiety. I had to go home towards the end, but my partner stayed with the dogs. It causes problems in my relationship because when I'm out I sometimes don't feel good and I need to ""escape"" the situation. The only place I feel ""safe"" is my home.

When I'm out the house it's horrible for me to deal with. I will almost always have an elevated heart rate, then the tiredness will kick in and progresses into a full panic attack. If it's hot outside then it's even harder because heat makes everything feel so much worse. I read something about the UV rays from the sun triggering attacks, the same as florescent lights in a supermarket (which are problematic for me).

I used to be able to hide attacks, but now they feel stronger and I can't cope with them when they happen. Except of course to go back to the house. 15 minutes after being in the house I'm normal again. Go figure :S

I've had enough of this. 12 years! I'm on ESA because I can't work. I can't even build a career in my area of expertise because I find it so hard with anxiety to do anything.

It feels like there is no hope. I'm sick of feeling tiered, and sick all the time. There's only so much I can take before it starts effected everything else in life. It always ends in some horrible bout of depression.

Please, I'm seeking advice. What can I do here? I feel alone, I feel like nobody truly understands what it feels like to be that scared of leaving your own home.

And I know it's going to be even harder these coming days because I've made a decision to stop smoking cannabis (and tobacco).

I want to enjoy the last 20 years of my life (I expect to live to 50, anything more is a bonus). I want to see the world, with my family. I want to get a job to support my family, and be the man of the house. It's degrading to be put in this position.

388,Anyone else have a crippling fear of sex?,"First post, hi.

I'm a 21yo male. I have a long history with anxiety. I like to think of myself as very well experienced in it. I've had panic, hypochondriasis, social, general, childhood etc.

Anyway I don't really get panic attacks anymore. Or the others really. But I do still have anxiety, it has just shifted into other areas of life. 

Like right now, I have a crippling fear of sex. I'm just sort of realizing it now, though looking back I can tell it has been a problem for a while. I've had multiple chances to lose my virginity but I just can't do it. Condom or not. Can't do it. Not that I don't want to, I am attracted to women. 

It's not like an anxiety of body image or social situations. It's the act itself. The risk of infections.

I can't even comprehend how someone can have sex, with or without a condom. The risk to me seems huge and not worth it. Even though I know that the risk of infection is low as fuck.

I know for a fact I couldn't have sex with anyone. 

Why am I posting this now? Well I got a bit drunk and fooled around with a girl a few days ago (we didn't have sex, we did nothing that could even be considered risky) and now I feel like my life has ended. Like it's completely over. Like I have 100% gotten all sorts of diseases from her. 

Anyway I figure this is probably even quite rare as far as anxiety goes, so I thought I'd post it here and see if anyone else has these problems or whatever. ",31,2015-08-13 13:54:37 EDT-0400

397,"[Rant] Panic disorder suffers, don't drink alcohol","Sorry for a bit of rambling, English is not my native, and I am drunk

Those with panic disorders, for the love of gods, don't drink.

Every time I am I start recreationally drinking I will a rise in mood, I am feeling happiness, rise of internal will, all my anxieties go away, but not long comes a moment when everything mentioned above is gone and all anxieties come back threefold, (off topic - I want to kill the asshole that just put the gasket of his car to the floor that the whole block heard the screeching of his tires, and its 3 AM here) and my somewhat passive suicidal thought start to infest my mind.

I know it's very individual, but just be careful with alcohol, for the most part, it will never help to ease any pain or anxiety or just a  shitty day. 

For those wondering - no I am not a chronic alcoholic, just once in a couple of months everything starts with one beer and spirals a little bit out of control as soon as I feel that happiness surge.

Just want to share my experience what's it's like to be drunk when you have occasionally crippling panic disorder. How I am not still fired from my current job with all the mistakes I make because of panic attacks still baffles me.

398,Is anyone else really good at faking being calm?,"Heyhey-- Just wanted to know if this was the same for anyone else? 

I'm pretty sure I have anxiety for certain things(interviews, driving next to large vehicles, school/college, arguments, etc). But it's kind of hard to tell because I have a really bold and loud personality? 

For years I did not know that I had anxiety because of how well I handled it. I would get crushing butterflies in my stomach (to the point where it would literally kind of hurt), I would have to go to the bathroom (I believe it's called IBS when it's caused by anxiety? Correct me if I'm wrong), sorry if that's a bit TMI. I've literally squealed out if I'm called or touched suddenly while in this state.

But then right after I'm back to giggling and carrying on a normal conversation. But on the inside, my heart is racing-- I literally want to be anywhere but there, my hands are fidgeting, if it's really bad I start to shake, I'm going thru a million things in my head trying to remember all that I have to say, I begin to sweat just.....The whole 9 yards. But to the average person-- They wouldn't know the difference.

Then if it's really bad (like it usually is after interviews or a particularly bad day at college), the second I get home, I'm pissed off. I'm venting, sometimes crying. I just want to be left alone. It's an explosion of all of the tenseness being released.

It's almost a little insulting-- I've had people tell me that I'm overreacting and that I don't have anxiety, but it's like ""No. I know how I feel when I calm. This is not it."".  

Anybody else feel this way? ",12,2015-08-08 05:46:14 EDT-0400
399,Anxiety & heart palpitations - how to deal with it?,"This is my first official reddit post/question (which, hilariously, is giving me anxiety)... 

Background: I'm female, 32, work at a computer all day but stay active 3-4 times a week. I'm also a high-strung person who cares a little too much about everything. I've been getting really strong heart palpitations since May, around the time my mom was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. I'm pretty sure the anxiety sprung up because I can't check in on my mom... My immediate family lives in FL while my husband and I are in LA. 

Doc says I'm fine - blood tests are normal, EKG showed nothing, heart sounded great - and thinks it's anxiety and stress. Heart thumps really hard and it feels like my whole chest is beating. I refused to take Lexipro because I don't want to depend on medication like that. Tried going the medical marijuana route as it generally calms me down a lot. Palps went away for 2-3 weeks but came back and have been around since.

Any advice for people experiencing the same thing? I've seen recommendations for magnesium supplements and keto diet, which I might try next along with cutting back on coffee (I don't drink sodas). 

Note: I run a dodgeball league in LA. It's a fun way to stay fit and decompress but I also have to manage ~160 competitive people, which can be a nightmare.",45,2015-08-14 01:07:15 EDT-0400

405,Does anyone here get frustrated to the point of tears when the people around you can't follow a plan?,"I don't know if this is a personality disorder or what (both on my end and theirs), but my entire family is absolutely horrible at creating a plan and sticking to it. When I was a little kid I'd throw tantrums over this because I'd assume that when someone said they'd do something, they'd do it. It hurts more because it's not like they're lying to me, they honestly believe they're going to follow the plan and then don't. 

Nowadays I don't throw tantrums but when it happens a lot, it makes me nervous. Usually it's when people (mostly my family) say they want to do X, Y, and Z, and I also need to do one of those things so they invite me along, and then they end up either not doing the one I'm there for or just not doing any of them, and I can't help but think ""well shit, I still need to get X done, I wish I had just stayed home today so I could do it myself"". 


Usually around this point I ask to be dropped off somewhere near my house/car so I can just go do it myself, the answer is always no, that ""this is a good time to learn a lesson in flexibility"". And I don't WANT to be flexible, I want to get X done, that's why I left the house today, I made a plan and I want to follow it. And they're so nonchalant about it like ""just do X tomorrow you don't need to do it now, do it whenever"" and the thing is, for me I *do* need to do it now because I made a plan to do it, and the fact that everyone around me is so wishy washy about it is so frustrating I can't deal with it. 

This happened to me today and while I have a lot of other shit on my mind, it affected me a lot. We made a plan, hyped it up, decided that's what we were going to do, and then at the absolute last minute they decided they didn't want to go along with it. I would have gone along with it by myself and had a great time, but we had already decided to take someone else's car so it wouldn't have worked. I asked to be taken home so I could go do it myself and was told no, so I had an awful time and halfway through the thing I was so frustrated I cried.

417,"A simple thought to help with anxiety, something that has helped me today","Hello everyone - Sorry if your brains hurt, or there is pain in your life at the moment. I'm suffering on and off at the moment - I posted in /leaves (the weed quitting reddit) but I know that a lot of my anxiety is a simple predisposition towards panic and fear - one that has been with me since I was a boy. I'm now 36 and it's been a constant battle throughout my life.....but I look on it as a gift (when I can) and an opportunity to get to know my innermost thoughts.

A SIMPLE THOUGHT TO HELP WITH ANXIETY
I wanted to give back to anyone reading, as a few posts have really helped me over the last day or two. I hope someone finds this useful.

- I realise some of my anxiety and panic attacks are brought on by a fixation on things that could go wrong and really hurt or injure me.

- I try to deal with it by learning to be okay with the thought of any of these bad things happening to me, like if they actually happened, really what does it matter, we're all going to pass away one day...

- But I realised today, by thinking like that I wasn't dealing with the >>source<< of the anxiety, merely learning to be okay with the >>fantasy outcome<< ....in my case, death.

- So I looked at my current mood and my pretty negative outlook at the moment - And I realise it colours so many things....predictions about how the future will turn out. But I also realise that none of these things, like literally NONE OF MY FALSE BELIEFS have any grounding in reality, or my own experience.

- So if I'm basing my outlook on a FALSE SET OF IMAGINARY BELIEFS, and allowing those to influence me, why not imagine this>>:
------------Imagine that everything will be perfect, imagine that the people I meet will be friendly, imagine that I will be happier than I could imagine, imagine I was always going to be safe, always going to be ok with life.

- if you suffer from anxiety and it's because of negative and fear based predictions, well you know you're deluding yourself, but it's still real for you. You still live with this awful feeling. So why not live with a blissful feeling (one that is SO MUCH MORE PROBABLE) of safety and lack of anything terrible happening to you. I assume, if anything really bad had happened to most of you, you wouldn't be reading this, and even if anything terrible has happened, it's only happened once, or twice (forgive my assumptions) - so still, the GREATER LIKELYHOOD is that NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN AGAIN, that you will live at worst, a boring, confused and average life, and at best a life where you find some greater meaning, or merely learn to exist happily, realising the power of your existence is probably totally down to you and how you view the strange world of reality.

- And if something does go wrong, well, deal with it then - And deal with it you will....It's strange, the worst things that have ever happened to me are the thoughts that accompany the odd shitty moment in my life. The things themselves, the expereinces, they weren't all that bad...it's always been the repercussions in my brain. It's always been the mental trauma that hurt the most. Own worst enemy...anyone relate? :)

So thanks for reading what turned into a ramble. I hope someone gets something from it - And thanks for letting me post, it's good for me to get these things down on paper.

Much love.

418,Have you every had a friend kill himself with you there and how did you cope with it?,"One of my best friends killed himself about a month ago and the circumstances were very strange. We had been drinking and everything was fine. I went to the bathroom and came back into the living room and he was standing with his gun pointed to his own head. I didn't feel like my life was being threatened so I crossed the room to try and get the gun away from him. He let me take the gun from him,  but then wouldn't let me take my hands off of the gun or put it down. He just pointed it back at his head and kept asking me to pull the trigger. I kept telling him I couldn't do it and that it wasn't  really what he wanted. Before I could do anything about having no control over the gun in my hands, he pulled the trigger and killed himself. I had his blood and brain matter on my face and arms. I began screaming and freaking out because I was drunk by that point. I didn't know what to do.

420,Advice on SSRI's - Lexapro,"Hello all

Never in my life did I think I'd turn into a reddit poster rather than lurker, however, I'm in some serious need advice from experienced people because quite frankly I feel completely at my wits end. 

Basically I've had mild to severe anxiety problems for the last three years to the point where it has completely debilitated my life. Recently I decided to finally get help and today I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Lexapro and Valium

I've been advised to take both before going to bed which should be now but all I've been doing for the last hour is sitting up comtemplating actually taking my medication or not. 

I'm terrified. I don't want it to change who I am, how I feel about my loved ones or just generally make me regret trying it. 

I've never taken antidepressants or anything of the sort before so this is an extremely scary experience for me. 

Does anybody around these parts have experience with lexapro or other SSRI's? What should I be expecting in the first few weeks? Should I take this medication or not? Will it ultimately help?

Honestly I've never been so frightened in my life, any help would be good, thank you guys! ",19,2015-06-01 19:57:58 EDT-0400
421,Anyone's social anxiety triggered not by strangers but by close friends? How do you work through it?,"I'm actually fine around strangers. My latest review for my doctorate said I greeted and connected with clients confidently, and I have no problem making conversation with people. However, I have two close friends who live near me right now, and the anxiety with them is getting so bad I'm considering ending the friendships or at least taking a long hiatus. Has anyone had this problem? Does anxiety lend itself to a lack of trust?


When we hang out in groups now, I end up just being silent. The other two will discuss things they know I know nothing about, and interrupting people makes me shake. When I do talk, I'm frequently talked over. They know I have anxiety and logically I know they're not intentionally trying to make me feel terrible. I just feel like strangers or early friendships treat me better until they realize there's a scared person underneath the confident facade, and then I get trampled on. 


They'll also (unintentionally, I hope) call attention to my anxieties....like I asked one friend how I performed during a public speaking thing, and she said, ""Oh, you did fine during it. But your face turned bright red when the prof was giving you feedback."" Okay. Not exactly something I (as a SAD person) can work on since it's my autonomic nervous system taking over. Or, ""I bought these scrubs but the pants are WAY too baggy on me. I was thinking of giving them to you thistooshalll,"" even though she knows I'm very insecure about the weight I've gained. 


We have a constant facebook messenger going, and every time I hear it beep my stomach literally twists in knots. I'm trying very hard to be a positive person and not complain all the time to lessen the effects of GAD, and one of my friends uses the facebook messenger to complain about every single thing that happens to her during the day. I get about 20 messages from them every day of the week, and I feel sick/unhappy when I have to open it. I'm finding too that when we hang out I feel awful afterwards, and the anxiety ""decompression"" will last for days.  My husband is at the end of his rope from hearing about them. 


I feel like they don't actually care about me, and I beat myself up if I open up to them about what's going on in my life (like my mom is very sick and I updated one of them about it a couple days ago) because I think I shouldn't have let them in. Since I know my perception is all messed up being a GAD/SAD person I don't know if it's them or me, and I don't know how to make it better. 


tl;dr: My two best friends make me literally silent/sick with anxiety, and I don't know if it's them or me. Has anyone else dealt with this, and what helped? ",23,2015-06-04 01:47:56 EDT-0400

428,I start my first CBT course today. Wish me luck r/anxiety!,"Never done one before and don't know what to expect. It's a 5 week group course designed specifically for treating anxiety and depression with focus on tackling low self-esteem. 


***Edit:* Thank you for all the kind words! Seeing as so many wanted an update I thought I should deliver.** 

So session one went well, the hardest part was definitely making sure I didn't bail at the last minute (I almost did, really glad I made it). There are 8 of us in the CBT group, so some basic introductions were made and some pretty important ground rules were outlined i.e. No judgement, confidentiality etc. 

The counsellor talked us through the plan for the next 5 weeks, got us to consider how we felt and to set a realistic improvement target.

The session itself involved working in groups of 4 and brainstorming about various topics such as:

* Family and outside events that might lead to low self-esteem.
*  Your feelings and behaviours that have resulted from low self-esteem.

Overall, I am glad I took the plunge with a CBT course; it is still early days and I'm worried I am one of those people it doesn't help. Not going to give up though! Expect updates from me in the future about how the whole course goes.

My Dad got laid off of his job and I almost lost him when he was getting surgery, my best friend's Dad passed away(who was like a second father to me), I'm working overnights and going to school right after them, and a bunch of other shit. I'm a 23 year old male who was diagnosed with panic disorder when I was a junior in High School. I came a long way since then and was able to cope with my depression and anxiety attacks for a while until about 2 weeks ago I had a traumatic experience with thinking I had diabetes because I'm overweight. I went to my psychologist and told him that I'm afraid that I had a relapse. He flat out told me that it sounds like I did and that he doesn't know what to do since I'm on the highest levels of medication(1mg Alprazolam, 150mg Effexor) but to change my medication and see him often. He made it seem like the relapse was my fault. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm crying as I type this even though my brother keeps telling me men shouldn't cry. I don't even know how I'm gonna go to work tonight cause I have bills and credit cards to pay and can't stop working. I tried dropping down to 7 credits this semester but I still have a bad panic attack on the way to school and in class. My doctor basically told me that I'm fat because I have sleep apnea, and I have sleep apnea cause I'm fat. I feel helpless.",20,2015-02-10 19:16:05 EST-0500

I thought, maybe after the holidays are over I'll get some calls. I know that I am able and qualified to do every job I apply for, so it shouldn't take long. 
Last week I had an interview scheduled, but, I freaked out and canceled it. On Friday I had two interviews; at first I wasn't even going to go, as they weren't scheduled, just 'come in and fill out an application for an on the spot interview"". The first company seemed nice, but I had a total brain blank and ended giving the worst answer possible to a very important question. And the second interview was just, a miss.
I keep telling myself that I will get a job soon, but as more and more time passes, and the more failed interviews I go on (or call off) the more my anxiety builds up and the more convinced I am that I won't be able to get a job. ",6,2015-02-09 07:10:17 EST-0500

436,There are no options for me. It's game over.,"[help]

I can't keep up in class. I can't do it. It's too. Damn. Hard. It's too hard oh my god.

I was so codependent on my boyfriend, it was a toxic relationship but now that it's over, I really have nothing. No goals, no self-esteem, nothing. I'm lost. No plan. I had no friends in the area and still don't.

Yesterday was my birthday. You know what I did? I went out to meet an acquaintance I made in class, we had even hung out over the summer (same internship), I get there and she never showed. Bailed on me. Even though I planned it weeks in advance and she said she was going but not only did she not show, she didn't text me or call letting me know she wasn't coming or what was going on. She only responded to my one text today with ""sorry I was tired"" hahahaha. So I hooked up with my ex now I feel like I can't give him up, not because I think it'll work, but because he is literally the only person who cares about me.

My sister lives in SLC, where you're basically fucked if you're not Mormon (and I'm not and never will be). I lived there for 2 years myself and hated it, I couldn't make friends or date because I wasn't religious and it *always* came back to religion and converting me and it was incessant discomfort. My parents live on a ranch in the back-end of nowhere, 1 hour to the nearest grocery store, I'm fucked going out there living with them, there's nothing out there for me, even less than here. I would become a basement person and they would kick me out.

Trying to go to therapy but the campus counseling center is so booked they can only work me in twice a month. I'm on waiting lists for the 2 other places in town offering therapy and it's been months and I've never gotten a call. Fuck.

I have enough credits to graduate with an Independent Studies degree but that's a joke, I might as well drop out right? Drop out and move far away and become a waitress or work at Staples and just live even more anonymously until I finally go out, buy at least 3 sturdy boards, lay them across my cabinets, toss a rope over them, lay down a tarp underneath me so my rotting corpse doesn't stain the tiles and hang myself. And I would rot too because not a single fucking person around here even knows I exist, let alone would check on me.

It's thoughts of suicide every waking moment. It's gotten worse and worse over the past few months and all my therapist says is ""take a de-stress day, try going to yoga."" Well I de-stressed my grades into the fucking hole because even the thought of homework makes me sick so instead of doing it I do yoga. Also I've eaten my weight and vomited it all several times in the past week and it helps a little with the stress.

I'm a train wreck. A week ago I called the suicide hotline and this woman, I kid you not, would pause so fucking long that I had to ask ""Are you there?"" several times to get her to say something. I go on about my situation and she says, ""What are your hobbies?"" I tell her I don't have any and she does another long pause and says, ""Well there isn't a magical solution to all of your problems, like there's no magical wand you can wave and everything will work out,"" and I'm like *are you fucking kidding me.* I ask her what to do. What can I do? I'm so fucking exhausted and tired. She says, ""Well talking helps a little bit, right?"" Well if talking helped I wouldn't be in this fucking mess holy shit.

What do I do? What can I do? This semester I'm doing nothing but re-taking classes I've already failed, *and I'm failing them again holy christ.* It's like I go into lecture and my whole body gets full of white noise, I can't hear the professor, my heart races and my gut froths up.

Fuuuck. Fuck fuck. My life is over, right? It's fucking over.

**Update:** Wow I can't believe these responses... you guys are amazing. Today I was able to think more clearly, although the panic still came back around a few times. I reached out to my family; my parents were very helpful, they encouraged me and helped me make a little game plan and they didn't judge me for getting back into contact with my ex, but my sister was angry about that (she hates him), so that made me feel quite bad, but I'm still a step up from where I was. I still don't know what to do about a lot of my issues, but I've calmed down enough to realize I don't have to figure everything out immediately. Your posts made me think about the options.

438,"[Rant] I would very much like for my heart rate to stay completely normal, thank you.","I was minding my own goddamn business this morning when I suddenly and inexplicably started experiencing some weird symptoms. These symptoms immediately made me think, ""oh fuck, I'm going into cardiac arrest."" It was pretty damned stupid of me to think I was about to have a heart attack, but that's what it felt like.

For the longest time, I've had this problem where my heart rate would increase for no reason. Out of the blue. In addition to that, I'd get lightheaded and usually found it very hard to breathe. I didn't know that this was an anxiety issue until this morning, when I asked my roommate about it. She said she experienced the same thing and explained why it was a thing that happened. Up until I'd asked her, I just thought I was in some serious shit that had nothing to do with my anxiety.

I knew I had terrible anxiety (diagnosed and all that good shit), but I just wasn't ever told that these random symptoms that make you think you have a heart condition were a part of that. I feel pretty dumb. I should've known. This whole fucking time I was scared that I had like, *arrhythmia* or some other heart condition that was going to kill me someday. No idea why I never saw a doctor about it, but now I'm glad I didn't. Because this morning I learned that it was just a fact of my goddamn anxious life. I would've felt pretty damned stupid walking into a doctor's office and freaking out about a nonexistent heart condition. God, I do work myself up over these things an awful lot.

I don't know, guys. It's just annoying. It's really fucking annoying. I hate it. I'm considering biting the bullet and getting some meds. I don't know if I can handle this anymore. It's been a problem for years, and it hasn't gotten any less terrifying.

I just want to be able to relax without my heart feeling like it's about to explode. Seriously, I was having a nice and quiet evening to myself. Fuck this shit. Fuck anxiety. As soon as I can, I'm going to get on meds.

**EDIT:** All of you are supportive and amazing. Thanks for sharing your experiences. I'm sorry I didn't respond to everyone's comments, but I just woke up and I'm not awake enough. I appreciate you all taking the time to respond, though.

439,"My wife suffers from anxiety, I brought up the idea of us seeing a therapist and she's furious at me and doesn't wanna talk to me anymore. Help?","So my wife suffers from anxiety. We're recently married and it's been getting worse lately. She usually has really bad attacks right before bed and she doesn't usually fall asleep until 2/3 a.m. 

I do not suffer from anxiety. I am very happy-go-lucky. I go with the flow and am normally a very happy person. I love interacting with people and making new friends. 

My wife is the exact opposite. It's very hard for me to make friends because she doesn't want to hang out with them and when I suggest that I hang out with them by myself she gets very upset because she feels like I'm ditching her. 

I try my best to help her. I do everything I possibly can to help her. I talk to her about her problems and I try to keep her mind off things that trigger her anxiety. Most of the time she stays quiet. She doesn't wanna have loud, exciting conversations like I do. She just wants to be quiet, and I respect that. I give her her space. 

Lately it's been particularly bad. I asked her if she would be okay with seeing a therapist. I told her that I needed help to help her and I think we would both benefit from talking to people. She took that and got pissed. Furious. She was so mad at me. She stormed out of the room and hasn't talked to me sense. I need help. Its getting hard for me and I want help too.

442,[Meds] Medication made me myself again,"I thought I would share my experience with my medication in the hopes that it may help someone, or at the very least resonate with people. 
I had anxiety pretty much my entire adolescent life, but it really came to a head my first year of university. I was constantly having attacks, and I was so worried about everything that I would just shut down and do nothing. I skipped classes for weeks on end because they were just too stressful. I also was in constant fear of people judging me, which made me not want to leave the house for fear that I would say something stupid, or wear something atrocious, or even be wearing the ""wrong"" lipstick. 
I had been seeing a psychologist to try and deal with it, but it didn't seem to be quite enough. It got to the point where I didn't want to do anything but be in my room and watch movies (which is so not me, because I am highly extroverted). 
Finally, I mentioned to my doctor about all this, and she recommended that I try a low dose of cipralex, which is technically an anti-depressant but works for anxiety as well.
WELL. Within a week, I started to feel like myself again. I actually wanted to go to class, hang out with people, and spend time outside of my room. The little things that were stressing me out stopped scaring me. I stopped being worried about what other people thought of me, and started speaking in class.
I've been on Cipralex for about 2 years now. The best part is feeling like a normal human again, and feeling like **myself**. Obviously medication isn't for everyone, but it definitely saved my life.",19,2015-02-08 21:42:17 EST-0500

First off, it doesn't usually bug me what the internet hivemind says, but when it echoes a sentiment I often hear in real life, it's a bit concerning. It's kind of strange to see on every thread (outside of here usually) all of the anti medication rhetoric. Just smoke weed and that's it. Bro, just hit the gym, that's what I did! Big Pharma is lying!! 

I don't think anyone's denying that exercise helps our problems, but it's silly to say they're the only solution ever for every person. It's just frustrating to see people acting like you're stupid, gullible, or weak (online and in real life) if you choose to take medication for your mental disorder. Choosing to go on medication helped me through a very dark time in my life that I don't think could have been fixed by just hitting the gym. I don't think people who've been through similar things would agree with the anti-medication BS. It just makes everything harder for us when people have this attitude.

465,A simple question.. What are you missing out on right now,"I know that many of you have an internal battle going on. I just want to ask a simple question on the scene around you right now. 

What can you hear around you? Birds? People? Insects? Cars? Rain? Air conditioning? Neighbors? Pets? Yourself breathing? Distant sounds? What else?
Maybe what can you smell? Can you feel a breeze on you? Can you feel the carpet under your feet? Is there anything you aren't paying attention to? 

Some of you are probably aware that this is a question of mindfulness / awareness. And sure, it is one of the main techniques for anxiety and panic management. Still, a lack of awareness is something that roughly everyone on this planet suffers from. Children live in the moment outside of themselves naturally. For some reason as we mature we internalize more, lose focus and have to bring our attention to the things around us that we take for granted.

For example, the light through the window that paints shadows on the floor. There's a lot we miss out on even when we think we are there. We no longer pay attention to even simple tasks such as opening a door handle, feeling the coolness of the handle and the sound it makes.. It's familiar and it raises the question, how much of our woken lives do we sleep through? This isn't really the question I had for you though. Just the earlier ones would be great and I hope you can take away something from this.
Bring yourself back to these kinds of questions regularly and you might find a certain place of serenity.
--------------------------------------------
My scene right now? I'm listening to a youtube track that I will link below. I can hear the air conditioning unit on the wall. My 2 cats breating back and forth as they sleep. My own breathing. I'm tired and thirsty. My feet are crossed and my stomach itched probably because I'm self analyzing.

466,"Real solutions for anxiety and panic attacks: Believe me, working out DOES help.","EDIT to say: Sorry it's so long, I didn't notice, but that is all there is to say on the topic.

Ok so I am not a particularly sporty person so I am not here telling you my story from some Olympic podium or something. Listen up because I feel so much better and this stuff does help.

A little background that you might need:
I am a regular person in my 20s who has been diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder a couple of years back. I've had all the usual stuff: panic attacks, crazy hypochondria, days locked in my bedroom for paralyzing fear I'd be run over by a car, some degree of PTSD and a cluster C personality disorder. It was total crap, as we all know. I refused medications because a friend was taking it and I saw how dependent he became. I started with some natural supplements and things were a little better thanks to therapy but you know symptoms are always there hidden in your brain. Also, I am very sensitive to placebos as a person, because I've never been heavily drugged. This was just my before-experience.

I've always moved around quite a lot throughout Europe for university and work and so I continued. I am currently still seeing a therapist who is helping me with becoming my better self. But if there is one thing that seems to be re-organizing my brain to the core is working out. Crazy, I know. Everybody says it over and over. And it's true and I will tell you why from a ""lazy person"" perspective.


I KNOW the main problem with working out is that the very act of getting your heart rate higher may trigger some fears and symptoms that whoever suffers from panic attacks might experience. What I did: a total check up on my heart and stuff. I've had a good doctor telling me I am fine from that point of view.  I tried to remember his words as I started to run. I went running until I couldn't breathe and man did the world look like a better place.

I tried a few things because as I said I am not a very sporty person. Workin out sucks while you are doing it, but it's the after-part you want to look for. So here is what I suggest you do:


- Find the sport you like. There IS something you like. It might be some team discipline, kickin someone's ass in martial arts, running, or just exercising to get a more toned body. Anything that you like. The point here is feeling like YOU ARE IN CONTROL. Because you are, or you will be. Your body is your temple. REALLY


- Start slow. When I started exercising everyday after/before work, it didn't go well because I didn't have time to do other things I liked. I grew annoyed and quit for a while. Find what works for you, especially if you are not a sporty person. You might feel scared the first times. It's ok, it's just your body working.


- After the workout or whatever, stop for a second and listen to you body's response. It will be physically painful the next day, but that's part of the fun. If the little science I know is not completely disconnected, after a work out your brain releases endorphins (which make you feel happy! yay!) and you feel like a freaking god. You just took total control over your body, you have just done what you are supposed to do: move, work it, release the tension. No more getting all tied up because of a lack of movement and fear.

- DON't GIVE UP. I am a very lazy person and always found excuses. Now I force myself to work out at least twice a week, and it's working miracles for me. Do it for yourself.

In a few weeks -- hell, in a few days you'll start feeling better. Your body will thank you, your brain will thank you, life will seem much better because you got oxygen all over your brain and body cleaning things up. Here is more details on why and what:

- Our bodies respond quite well to any sort of mental input. When I had severe hypochondria, I spent my days in tension and my back ended up hurting like hell, which meant more hypochondria: I was scared I had some problem in my back. My problem was being scared of having some problem in my back. Stupid, right? My face and my stomach were bloated and I looked like shit. It was my body processing all my negativity. Now I have been doing some hardcore (hardcore for my ridiculous training level) workouts in the past weeks/month, I found myself with a resemblance of abs and an amazing feeling of using my body for what it is supposed to be used.

- Your body will be PHYSICALLY PRONE to avoid shit like panic attacks and the like, because your tension will be sorted out with some movement. It's really a matter of not feeding the beast. Channel your energy.

- Your problems will look smaller. Any problem, really. Don't get me wrong, I haven't deleted the past couple years. Your anxiety won't disappear overnight. But you'll learn to deal, to accept it, even to live with it and it will become something else. For me, at this very moment, it's a push to do better. To become the awesome person I couldn't develop into when I was locked in my room scared of any shadow.

Please don't roll your eyes when somebody tells you working out does help. You don't need to be the new Bolt to enjoy its benefits. I was among those who roll their eyes: things changed, and it's half an hour, twice a week. Don't forget your check up and then get moving. It will physically do you good, I promise. And it's a freaking lazy girl promising this.

468,About to let a life long dream slip through my fingers,"I was just given the most amazing opportunity today, something I had always dreamt about but never thought possible and I am about to let it slip through my fingers due to my anxiety. I was asked if I would chaperon some high school students to Japan for a month this coming summer. I would be responsible for roughly 10 to 15 students with one other adult. My excitement level is only matched by the level of my Anxiety. I have taken 5 years of Japanese as well as done this same exact exchange route 5 years ago. I feel like I am well enough qualified but my anxiety is telling me no way are you going to do this. I feel like I am going to regret it forever if I don't go or ruin everything if I do. There will be no one in our group who speaks Japanese fluently though and I think that is where my fears are coming from. I'm so torn and angry and frustrated with myself for not being better.

Do you think I am justified in feeling this way? 

Should I bow out before its too late? 

Thanks so much for you guys this subreddit. When I speak to my family about this they tell me to just decide like its that simple. 
That's why I am turning to you guys. :)

469,I Miss Coffee,"I stopped drinking coffee and caffeine about a year ago because whenever I'd drink it I'd get panic attacks. I'm fine with the fact that if I smoke weed or drink alcohol it triggers a panic attack because that keeps me sober, but coffee, fuck you anxiety, coffee was all I had left. I was a total coffee snob, I searched high and low for my favorite blend of bean and had my whole process of hand grinding the beans and putting it in the french press and heating the water perfectly and letting it sit for the right amount of time, it was therapeutic. Now its fall and winter and I can't drink coffee and thats bullshit and don't you dare say ""Just drink decaf"" its not the same and you know it, I know it, the whole world knows it.

474,I had a panic attack at work today.,"I only have panic attacks very rarely. The last one I had was a couple of months ago at a big department clothes store when I started to feel too claustrophobic and anxious.

Well, today I had one one at work. I work in a café, taking orders and making tea and coffee. It's usually quiet, and even the busier days that we had through the summer (thanks to tourists) were always manageable. But today, at exactly 1PM, large family after large family would enter the café in what seemed like a continuous stream. It's half term in the UK and a load of last-minute holiday makers from England have come over for the week, I guess, (I live in Wales).

I should mention that it's quite a small café, and there are only usually 2 people who work there at a time: one to take orders, make drinks and clear tables; and one to cook the food. Well, today 3 people were working: me and 2 others who cooked the food. Well, suffice it to say we got completely overwhelmed. The 2 cooks were able to cope with the pressure, but I just couldn't. In the middle of taking a customer's order, already with 6 different hot drinks orders to make, I had to say ""Please excuse me for a minute,"" and go to the kitchen. I couldn't breath at all, I couldn't stop shaking, I was sweating (ew) and I felt like I was going to implode. I wanted the the earth to open up and swallow me. I called my manager (one of the cooks) over and told him. He was actually very understanding despite us all being under a lot of pressure. He called his girlfriend (who works there anyway, but happened not to be today) and she came to help me out. 

Eventually we got on top of the situation and I felt a little better, but still very anxious, shaken up and on-edge. I got to leave once things died down after the lunch time rush, and I was relieved to get home and hide under my bed covers. That was 2 hours ago, and after listening to music, reading and smoking, I feel better now. Not great, but better.

Anyway, sorry for the long post, I just wanted to vent about my shitty day.",6,2015-10-28 22:21:40 EDT-0400

479,"DAE feels like their current life is so messy and filled with tons of tiny mistakes, so they want to abandon it all and start fresh for a perfect one?","I sometimes feel like that, even though I have a pretty comfortable life. Good job, happy marriage, healthy self and family, enough money to get by every month, cute pets, etc. Nothing can be perfect, because we're all humans, I know that.

But I can't help myself sometimes, I think there are too many small mistakes that takes away the perfection from a lot of things. Past arguments, wasted money, wrong decisions, broken hearts... I dwell on them a lot. I constantly ruminate. They're all in the past, but when I stop to think about even one of them, I feel like a total failure and want to start fresh. I can usually calm myself down and seperate anxious thoughts from my real feelings, but when I'm down, I'm *reaaaallly* down.

481,"There are moments of panic that you can work through, and then there's the deep, aching anxiety that don't go away.","I've had anxiety my whole life. I learned what the word ""anxiety"" meant when I was diagnosed with ""severe anxiety"" at age 7. I was on antidepressants when I was 11. I stopped seeking mental health care when I was 16 because I was going through a major life change and we thought it was getting better (surprise! it didn't). I'm 20 now and we're working on getting me back into it but it's taking time to find somewhere that can accommodate my insurance and scheduling needs. 

I do alright (not great, just alright) with situational things. If I'm afraid of making a phone call or using the oven, I'll be upset, but eventually the need to do that thing will go away. 

Then... There's the stuff that doesn't arise normally. It's the low, drumming ache of anxiety that follows me around and knocks me out. This is what I can't manage or work through because there is no specific thing it affects. I get upset over the past or worried about the future or angry that I am who I am and you don't just get over that. 

The only thing that helps with those feelings is having my boyfriend around, and I can't keep him around all the time.

487,I just met the kind of person I want to be,"This guy was really nice.  He was cheery.  He had a genuine smile that never left his face.  He just had a real positive energy about him.  And everything he said was affirmative, thankful...geez, here I go and we probably only talked for like a minute.  But he made an impression.  

That's what I want to do.  He also just kept talking.  I might never be that chatty.  I'm never going to be exactly like this guy, I know that.  But there were aspects of his character which I admire and I'd like to emulate.  I think because I've been so sad and depressed for so long it's seeped into every aspect of my persona and people can't help but be put off by that.  Nobody really seems to want to be around someone when they're be negative all the time.  But if you're hurting really badly and you don't know how to express it in a healthy manor it only gets worse and the problem exacerbates itself.  But if you can break the cycle by being positive and outgoing (even when you want to be sad or anxious), I think you might get better results. 

I won't ever be a social butterfly, and that makes me happy actually.  But I can still be a social being and put my best effort into everything I do.  That's what you have to do...this is going to be hard.  Thanks for reading!  I hope you discover good things about the people around you too that you can make a part of yourself.

I immediately start assuming it's some form of cancer or tumor. 

Also those medical problems I talked about. Turns out one of my spinal disks has become misaligned and I have to see a neurosurgeon and get an MRI to see if I need physical therapy or surgery.

CBT has given me a more helpfull way of analysing everyday situations. Jogging has reduced my baseline anxiety enough so that I can manage my anxiety in situations where it is provoked. There is still a long road to recovery but this is the best I have ever felt in my life.

My social anxiety can be really intense. When I was in high school I literally bolted out of the classroom several times when I'd attempt a presentation. I'm better than that now, and was able to give several presentations in a in a psych class a few semesters ago ***but*** that was because we could simply read our entire speeches or presentations.

I can't do that for this class though; all we get is one page worth of notes we can bring up with us. And when I get in front of a crowd I literally can't think. At all. The only thing I'm able to do is read. I actually couldn't even practice my speech in front of myself. No matter how many times I tried I'd get about 5-10 seconds and totally freeze. And that was with no audience at all! I'm going to be taking copious amounts of Ativan beforehand (more than I've ever taken before) but even that I don't trust will take the edge off enough.

I'll probably have to stop shortly through my speech and say that I can't continue or I'll have a panic attack.  Which will leave me with a horrible horrible grade. Maybe I'll be so drugged up that I'll hardly remember embarrassing myself which would be a small silver lining. I actually took a small amount of Ativan tonight to help me be able to practice my speech but I still wasn't able to do it. It did loosen me up enough to post on here though...

UPDATE: My speech went well! The actually speech wasn't  the best because it was 3-4 speech about myself. I couldn't even get to a lot of my points because I was running out of time. So it seemed a bit disorganized and rushed.

But I did it with confidence! I stood up and looked around the room and felt 0 nervousness looking at all my classmates. That's the biggest thing my Ativan does, it makes me not anxious about being in front of so many people. I can then get up and speak like I'm having a regular conversation

I went into a tailspin in January. Until that time, my self-image consisted of an intelligent, admittedly awkward, but otherwise standard-issue, gawky white kid. Normal amounts of extroversion, if not a little more than typical. There wasn’t much to indicate my future troubles. I had night terrors when I was little. 

I’m not sure exactly what happened to me. Throughout my first semester of college I smoked an exponentially growing amount of weed, drank a little, and studied my ass off. Looking back, I honestly acted a little manic. I really hit the ground running, joining clubs, talking my ass off, meeting people, etc. As time went on I found some great friends and smoked a lot of weed, as much as I could and still make good grades. 

I stopped playing frisbee and writing for the school newspaper. I probably knew that my level of fucks given correlated negatively with the amount of weed I was smoking, but I was having a fucking blast. I always smoked with two guys who are some of the highest quality human beings I’ve ever had the fortune to meet. 

By December, every time I got high was miserable. Smoking weed gave me so much anxiety that I was afraid to move or speak. I felt like I was getting much higher than my friends. I definitely couldn’t function while high as well as them. Neurotic thoughts spilled over into my sober time. By the end of the semester I felt like I was losing my mind. I was worried that I would hear voices any day, that my friends would abandon me, that people were looking at me and judging me. I had a couple of panic attacks when I texted my friends and they didn’t text back immediately. Whenever that happened, I would just lay in bed and stare at the wall. I stopped exercising and eating well. I stopped leaving my room, except to smoke with my fellow stoners. 

I gritted my teeth and focused on getting through finals. The times that I couldn’t avoid going to the cafeteria were hellish. I didn’t want to sit with people or have them look at me. I was extremely self-conscious. If that sounds cute or manageable at all, you haven’t been anywhere near as self-conscious as I was. It was like all of my thoughts turned inward and negative. I couldn’t think of a single redeeming quality I had. I experimented with cutting myself, but didn’t find any relief from it. 

I got through finals by the skin of my teeth. I think I probably drank three pots of coffee a day (or about 12 cups) and smoked every night. 

Winter break was tough. I smoked a couple of times and it was absolutely horrible. I quit smoking weed on New Year’s day and couldn’t sleep. When I could, my dreams were incredibly vivid. I went over to an old friend’s house and literally could not understand a board game that his family played at dinner (they were a household of engineers, bless them). I couldn’t speak and play halo at the same time. My friend, who is a great guy but probably isn't as intelligent as I am, started making fun of me saying “umm” so much, then actually got a little annoyed with me. I was terribly worried that I was becoming retarded, that I had accidentally smoked something in the prior semester that had given me brain damage (I didn’t). I had some suicidal thoughts, but they never got very bad. I spent long periods of time in front of mirrors due to a channel of twisted thoughts related to my self-consciousness. 

I went back to college for a week. My friends were incredibly supportive when I told them I didn’t want to smoke anymore, but my condition still wasn’t improving. I couldn’t get my thoughts organized enough to buy books from the bookstore or understand my readings. I couldn’t speak to people without feeling as if I was in front of a gun. I couldn’t even walk past people in the hallways without feeling as if I was moving awkwardly. I called my parents and they made the 17 hour drive at, I was told, on average 95 miles an hour because they thought I was going to kill myself. 

Today is May 20th, and I have made a lot of progress. I found a psychiatrist that is extremely objective. She prescribed me Paxil (an SSRI antidepressant) in February because some of my symptoms sounded obsessive-compulsive to her, and I agree. It nuked my anxiety and depression, but made me very drowsy and didn’t quite make me feel comfortable around people again, so I recently switched to Lexapro (another SSRI). I’ve written a couple of articles for local magazines and feel as mentally sharp as ever. I’ll go back to school in August and take another swing at it. I haven’t smoked weed except once since January. My goal is to get to where I can feel comfortable hanging out with acquaintances, at minimum. Strangers still spook me. 

I shared all of this to let people who are going through similar situations have some perspective and to know that anxiety and depression are very treatable. While December and January were gray, dead months for me, my life is at least worth living now. I think weed is an amazing and excellent drug, but ask your parents what your family’s incidence of mental illness is before you try any drugs. It turns out that most of the adults in my family are fucked up somehow. And if your highs start to become miserable, give it a rest. I’ll never smoke again because I very strongly suspect weed is worse for people with social anxiety than almost anyone else (a theory I developed during long periods of anxiety driven research, sorry but I don’t have links). 

If you have thoughts in response or questions, feel free to PM me, I get on reddit about once a week. ",42,2015-05-21 01:21:07 EDT-0400
505,Need to break it to a couple that their wedding footage I shot...is gone.,"I shoot wedding videos for a living. Generally when I shoot a wedding video; I come home and unload it onto my external hard drive and then when I get around to it I upload it to dropbox. However...in the case of a recent harddrive crash, I hadn't gotten around to backing up that specific wedding yet. The data recovery lab said all data is corrupted/fragmented, so there's officially nothing I can do now but refund them. 

The primary issue is...I don't know how to break it to them. I have depression and anxiety issues enough as it is; and hearing backlash from someone about something like this that's important to them...is something I can't handle to be honest. One of the points I figure I'll make is ""At the very least, you have your photos, which is what most couples stick with anyways, having video as a secondary option"". I'm really broken up about this...",41,2015-05-15 20:58:40 EDT-0400
506,"22 year old black guy whose a nervous wreak, please help","I've been teased throughout highschool for not being a typical black person, which has led me to be a much more quiet person. I feel like everything I do, from the way I talk to the way I do things, my hobbies etc. all have to seem like something black people would do in effort to not get ridiculed. It has led me to a lot of trust issues, and not being able to let someone know everything about me. 

As a result my social skills suck so much. I cannot approach girls with the purpose of getting to know them at all. I cannot approach acquaintances in public because I feel anxious. 

I also feel very stupid in front of my friends. Many of them know common things like music, geography, kinds of beer. I can't contribute to those kinds of conversations which makes me feel so inferior and stupid. I feel like my friends think I'm retarded because  I don't know common things. I just graduated university with a computer science major, but always feel like a dumbass.

Please help me find a way to let all this shit go, so that I can stop feeling anxious and be more sociable. I want to be a person who everyone enjoys talking to, not the nervous wreak who mumbles.

509,Called a hotline yesterday,"Yesterday I had the worst panic attack of my life. I had never considered suicide so seriously before. If you told me I had to do that for even a week straight I would rather blow my brains out. Called a hotline for the first time in a while. A nice women attempted to calm me down through my sobbing. She told me that I should go lay down/get water etc.. but I couldn't stop crying enough to even open my eyes. After a little more of this she literally just said ""well, you can do it. Im going to hang up now"". I felt so scared I tried to keep her on the line but she just hung up. This made me feel so upset. My last resort for when I feel suicidal just left me in the dark. I sat there crying for 30 more minutes before I was able to calm myself down and get up. It felt so awful. I NEVER want to experience that again. Im afraid for the future. Im afraid of life. I don't know if I can continue to exist if this is my reality I have to face.",21,2015-05-18 00:06:31 EDT-0400

511,How do I stop torturing myself with comparing my life to other peoples lives? (Help),"To break it down, I have 1-0 friends, no social life and generally very behind compared to my peers. I deal with GAD and I over think everything and have a hard time just ""getting out there"". I love torturing myself with looking at other peoples instagrams etc. and see how well they're doing compared to me. I know that it's social media and people generally choose to show what's nice etc. but I can't help but notice that the people I see do have friends, something going for them and a general social life. I've never been to a party my entire life.

I have a facebook user but I don't use it, I maybe go on there for 2 minutes or 1 minute one time every second week. Facebook often makes me break down because it makes me notice a thing I haven't been invited to and so on and on. 

I know it's somehow my own fault that I'm not getting anywhere in life because I have a hard time getting it on with other people and such but it's just a vicious cycle.

Any help, tips and maybe similar experiences would be nice. Thank you. :)",14,2015-05-17 19:58:37 EDT-0400
512,"Turned 21, still feel like a child [X-Post from r/depression]","So, the 14th was my birthday and instead of living it up with my closest friends I was stuck at home playing video games with them - which isn't bad or anything to be embarrassed about. The thing is, I go to community college while all my friends (only have a handful besides my girlfriend) go to a good state college. I should be going into my senior year of college but I'm still at approximately sophomore year.

Not to mention I can't ever hold a job because for some reason I just stop going to them after about 4-5 months. I don't know why, I just lose the urge, motive, and/or desire to go to work out of the blue.

And this behavior is not just limited to work; school is another issue. It's the same pattern. Go to class first month or two and do well. Get A's and B's on assignments and tests. Then, out of the blue, I lose motivation and skip/slack off and play video games instead or just waste time in general. My lack of discipline, drive, and willpower have been reoccurring themes in my life and I've almost come to accept and welcome them as a normal part of my life. Which is wrong, so very very wrong. As a result of these habits I've become extremely depressed.

One saving grace is that I may have an attention disorder which explains my spotty attendance and lackadaisical behavior. But when I went to do an assessment the psychiatrist basically told me to go somewhere else and talk to a different person as he would not help me. (A fucking doctor told me this!) So I've been pretty put off of seeking professional help unless someone is willing to PM me and lives in the Northern Virginia area to give me a personal recommendation to a doctor, therapist, or social worker who will hear me out.

In case you've made it this far and are willing to keep reading: I'll provide some context and background on myself.

* When I was 9 my father got sick and could not work any longer.
* He passed away when I was 10 1/2.

My dad was not neglectful or mean, but was always busy so I never got to really talk to or learn who he was. I only have the word of others to paint the picture of who he was (a great man).

As a result, and due to my brothers having to quit high school and college respectively to work in the family business, I had no proper male figure in my life to help me. No values of hard work, a set schedule, or drive to get things done was instilled in me. Now, it is kind of a cop-out to blame my father's death and refuse to grow up, and I've thought of that plenty of times too but I just can't get out of this funk I've essentially been in for a decade.

I try every year really hard, but I just end up making a mistake and then feeling like the world around me is caving in and everything I've done is all for naught. On the rare occasion when I do own up to my mistakes or fuck ups and try to make things right: I am plagued by severe social anxiety about what my peers, superiors, friends, or even family members will think about me when they find out I've failed and am in the process of fixing my mistakes. ""Oh, he did it again."" ""Typical throaway1914,he always makes the same mistakes."" ""What is wrong with him?""
I know I have serious issues and problems, and I really want to fix them, I just don't know how and struggle with depression, anxiety, and an addiction to competitive video gaming.

At least you'd think I'd find solace in being a really good player at this video game, but alas I may be in the 99th percentile of the player base, but I am still not famous, recognized, or even ""that good"" to make a splash into the professional scene. Nor do I want to be known as a pro gamer, it's just a hobby, nothing more. I want to have a life where I can actually benefit others and help them with real, serious issues and problems in their lives - but I can't do that if I can't even finish community college.

I don't even know what I am looking for posting this... But it is sort of relieving to put it all out there even if it is anonymous and no one will likely read this or care too much. Although, if you or someone you know has been through a similar ordeal PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me what steps you took to better yourself or improve your situation. It would mean a lot to hear of someone digging themself into a hole like I have and crawling their way out of it.

TL;DR I have anxiety, a gaming addiction, and depression due to the aftermath of a ruined childhood by my father's passing when I was an adolescent.

I forgot to mention that although my friends and family are aware of my predicament, however I consistently lie or tell them half of the truth about my situation. I don't want them to worry about me, but paradoxically will lie to them and try to do better, but end up making my problems worse, and then in the end they're even more pissed/disappointed because I lied and the end result of my efforts is just a steaming pile of shit.",9,2015-05-18 15:20:55 EDT-0400

515,Anybody else have anxiety related to throwing up that leads to a viscous cycle?,"I get so nervous about throwing up that I make myself feel like I am going to throw up. It only comes up at times that throwing up would be really bad(In public, before work, when I need to get something done)

 Its not so much about the puking then it is about me getting sick. I just hate the idea of being out for the count for a couple days due to a sickness. Got a really bad stomach bug earlier this year that I had to go to urgent care for and that really didn't help(I've been dealing with this way before that though) 

Usually I can avoid it by being really proactive about what I eat and when I eat it. Unfortunately I had to eat right before I went to bed so now I am awake at 5 am feeling shitty due to indigestion and my anxiety blew it up into deaf con 5 nausea mode.

There was period in my life where I got rid of this anxiety by drinking a lot and realizing puking isn't that bad. Now its more about being sick and not being able to fulfill certain responsibilities because of said sickness. 

I was wondering if anyone else had this issue and had any ways of coping? Things I do are, watching when and what I eat, avoiding caffeine, anti nausea medicine(Works wonders) Acid re flux medicine, tums, and cold water. I also like to go on walks outside because for some reason puking outside feels more safe than in a confined bathroom.",23,2015-05-16 15:01:50 EDT-0400

then i tried it a different way...'observing the natural breath'...or listening to the natural intake and outtake of your breathing....for me, not only did it calm me down, but it was incredibly relaxing...i got into that practice for a long time and each time i did it, i always felt the same..relaxed..

its definitely worth giving it a go...after all, we are always breathing, but never really notice it....try it, just sit and breath....if you get anxious or have excessive thinking, then gently go back to observing your breath again...the more you practice the easier it will be to 'get back' to your breath..

some might call this technique 'meditation'....but who cares about that stuff when you feel like crap?....you can look up that stuff later if you found the technique helpful right?...

hope this helps abit...anxiety can be beaten, just takes practice with the breathing and a few other realisations that happen naturally once you get the 'observation' part...gl guys ",2,2015-05-18 02:12:59 EDT-0400

522,There is a life after anxiety...or should I say with anxiety.,"I haven't posted in 9 months, and 9 months ago I was a mess, and 15 months ago I was a non-functioning bag of nerves. I've wanted to write this for a long time, but was unsure how, I know those in the throws of anxiety can be triggered by those who have overcome it, but anyway here it goes:
I've always been uptight, and have experienced mild panic attacks, however 16 months ago my whole life change. Literally in a blink of an eye. I experienced a series of consecutive and debilitating panic attacks that lasted weeks. I was in and out of the hospital, this pattern continued for about a year. I stopped going outside, being a proper mother and wife, I gave up on life, and wanted to die some days. Every day was spent in intense fear, something ""others"" don't understand. Not my friends, my family, or my husband. I couldn't eat or sleep. The one thing I did do was be proactive about getting better. I went to therapy, group therapy and a psychiatrist, I learned DBT and CBT, I practiced yoga, and learned breathing techniques. Most days I believed I would never get better. Do you know what changed it all for me? I began to believe that I was ok, and stopped fearing the fear. It sounds simple, but it was the hardest thing I've ever done. Since then I've landed the best job I could ask for, re-enrolled in a Bachelor's program, and my family moved to another state. This is not to say I am rid of the demon completely, but now it's more of a minor annoyance, one I'm grateful for. Without anxiety I never would have made the conscious decision to change my life and to challenge myself to be better.  I know that sounds crazy, and had the me a year ago read this I would've scoffed, and then gripped my already tight chest, a symptom that is long gone now. 
My point is, every single one of us has this, we are ok, there is life beyond this out there. Anxiety does not define us. I know, I didn't believe it either at one point. Even when you don't believe in you, remember someone does, I do. ",3,2015-05-15 06:01:05 EDT-0400
523,Job hunting and interview advice?,"So I'm on the job hunt. I'm managing it so far, but I have to fight myself every SINGLE step of the way. I know I shouldn't be tearing myself down, but on bad days it really feels like the most endearing trait is that people feel sorry for me. I feel like such a mess.

I get stuck and can't respond when I have to call someone back or send an email, and an interview pretty much means I won't sleep or feel normal for like that entire day and the day before and after. It won't be just one panic attack but like 2 pretty bad ones and continuous low-level ones. I'm in the process of getting insurance and don't have a healthcare provider right now so meds or therapy aren't an option. Luckily I have a really supportive partner who's been helping me through it, and getting through that terrible interview has helped me get confidence for the next ones. But I've also got that fear that I'll just repeat it again, I'm finding myself avoiding even that location while I'm applying for jobs because I don't want it to happen again.

The worst part is, despite all of that crap, I know for a fact I can function in a job and do really freaking well. I work hard, I hold myself to really high standards, and I've got nothing but good feedback from people I've actually worked with. I know I can do it, I'm just having a really hard time getting in the door, and I'm trying not to discourage myself.

Instead of trying to talk about how I felt and why, or seeking reassurance from loved ones, tonight I messaged a few of the people that are important to me and thanked them for their contributions to my well-being and role in my life. Letting them know how valuable *they* are to me forced me to understand I am cared for. Even without responses I felt relieved afterward. I feel like I can fall asleep now.

I either daydream, or write down stories of another reality, I listen to music, sometimes just go and binge on something, I forget the entire world. But I feel like it's ruined my life. It is my biggest issue. I don't want to avoid living my life, I am not eternal after all. 

Procrastination isn't funny at all, and i don't get how people can laugh about it... Escapism is the worst coping method, it's so hard to break these habits. They've been here ever since I was  a teenager. And I basically missed out on fully living my teenage years because of them... Is there any way to change ? Is there even hope ? Because I've completely lost hope. Will my entire life be like this ? Waking up to guilt and stress ? Sleeping with the resolve of doing it all tomorrow ?",35,2015-06-28 22:04:52 EDT-0400

539,Online cognitive behavioural therapy - my experience,"I'd just like to share my experience with an online course I did for my anxiety (GAD). I couldn't recommend this course highly enough so I thought I'd post about it here!
(Just a quick note, I'm not sure if those outside Australia can access this course. However they do have self help on their website.)

About me:
I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, and had a stint of OCD when I was around 9ish years old. (I don't remember it much.) Last year, I started to have panic attacks and my anxiety got very bad; I had to drop out of uni, cancel a holiday and broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years. I was put on escilatopram (more commonly known as lexapro, 5mg, upped to 10mg after a few months.) I also visited a psychiatrist (who I didn't find useful at all.)

How I came across the online course:
Fellow Australians may have heard of the SBS program 'Insight'. Each episode focuses on a particular issue.. the episode I watched was on anxiety. It was very interesting and comforting to watch, as if made me feel like I wasn't alone. Anyway, there was a professor on there who talked about this online therapy, titled 'This Way Up.' I wrote down his name and forgot about it for a few months.

http://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video/360897603960/Insight-S2014-Summer-Season-Anxiety

^ link if you'd like to watch the Insight program. (Hopefully this link works outside of Australia!)

Why I started the course:
My psychiatrist prescribed me medication and that was it. She had no interest in finding out what caused me anxiety and how to deal with the root cause. I was SO frustrated. Although the medication was helping a lot (no more panic attacks, yay!), I felt like it was a bandaid solution. I also hated the side effects (weight gain, super drowsy all the time, feeling numb.) I wanted to treat the cause. Why was I anxious? And how did it get so bad?

The program:
This Way Up is an online cognitive behavioural program (CBT) course that has 6 lessons over 8 weeks. To sign up, you must get a prescription from your Doctor and it costs $55. (My doctor did it within 5 minutes and voila, I had access to the course.) I thought - what the hell, I have nothing to lose. I don't even have to get out of bed to do the course, I can do it from home hahaha.

After a few months of procrastination, I finally got around to doing the course. The lessons took me between 20 minutes and 1 hour to do, 1x a week for 6 weeks. After each lesson you have homework to do for the week, which gradually gets harder. The first lot of homework I had to do was a breathing exercise and a bit of physical exercise. The rest of the lessons basically teach you to recognise your thought processes that induce anxiety and to retrain your brain to think realistically. (I don't know how else to explain it.)

For example:
One lesson talks about 'thought distortions.' Things that people with anxiety tend to think, which are totally unrealistic, but we convince ourselves that they are true. 'Catastrophising' was one of these distortions. I.e., you make a mistake at work. Instead of acknowledging you made a mistake and moving on, you think things such as I'm such a crap worker' and 'I'm totally going to get fired' etc etc. I'd never realised I do this, and during the course I learnt how to recognise this train of thought, stop it, and turn my thoughts into something more realistic.

Anyway this is one of MANY MANY lessons I learnt during my course!

Me after the course:
I'm currently still on medication, but tapering off (2.5mg currently and no major issues, just headaches, lucky me), and have not had a panic attack in months. I've even put myself in situations which would have induced panic attacks (plane rides, small spaces), but have managed to calm myself down during techniques I learnt in the course. I'm still on a journey to get better, I'm not quite there yet, but this course has helped SO MUCH. I hope it may help some of you too :)

You and the course:
I know the course is available to Australians, but not sure about people who are overseas. I couldn't find information on their website before I posted this. However there is a self help area that I'm sure could be useful.

Also, just like to say that this course is not a magic pill, even though I may make it sound like it is. I rave about it to the very few friends of mine that have anxiety (that I know about). It is merely a tool I have used in my journey to get better. I very very good tool. It isn't for everybody, but I'm sure everybody could learn a thing or two from it to help them on their journey :)

Here's the link:

They also have courses for depression, social anxiety, OCD and one that mixes depression and anxiety. I'm yet to try any of the others.

541,Anxiety is an excuse. (Rant),"How do you show your family your anxiety is not an excuse? It is nearly impossible. I have had panic attacks in front of my family; shaky hands, rapid heartbeat, profusely sweating, etc. Even then they believe my anxiety is an excuse. Recently I got my 1st job at subway (I'm 20) believing it would help my social anxiety, to an extent it did but it also made me realize how hurt I get by people when they are rude. Literally at times I felt I was going to cry in front of the customer. I had to quit because it was too much for me. My dad sees it as an excuse for me to be lazy. Now I'm back to square one and my dad just sees me as a lost cause, I also have no support from my mom, she basically gave up on me a long time ago. I honestly just don't know what to do anymore I feel empty inside and out, while I try my best to do these things such as getting a job, or completing college (doing decent for what I've been going through). It just isn't enough for my family and they see my anxiety as an excuse.  ",39,2015-06-23 16:02:22 EDT-0400
542,Existential Anxiety ruins my life,"10 years ago, at the age of 15, I suddenly had a chain of revelations that struck really, really hard. Thi triggered panic disorder in me.

Over those 10 years I have slowly, but surely become completely incapable of living a life as a consequence of these thoughts. Every time I step outside and look up at the sky I see an infinite cosmos and *know* on a deep level that we're spinning in this vast galaxy. I become so dizzy from this that I often puke..

I realized that we flesh-bots with no free will on a deep intellectual level.

I realized that morality is just an emergent phenomena and not fundamental.

I realized there is no actual meaning or purpose to life.

I know that every human being has similar thoughts from time to time, but mine are there 24/7 and make me unable to hold a job and often isolate my self for weeks inside. I have tried to just ""accept it"" and move on, but it doesn't seem to work at all...",21,2015-06-27 14:29:28 EDT-0400

I find this happening more and more frequently: when my friends don't reply me after they see my iMessage or Facebook message (known with the seen receipt), I feel like I'm not wanted or am undeserving of their time. I get overanalytical and see how often we talk and if we talk enough to be considered friends. I usually end up finding relief in thinking about weird stuff like me imagining that I have to ""break up"" with my friends or telling them I have a terminal illness; the imaginary effort and sympathy they give me calms me down a bit. But I know it's kinda messed up and I snap out of it whenever I find myself thinking those thoughts. I'm wondering what else can I do to stop getting so anxious over something so simple.

547,Fear of people being mad at me (what others think?),"Really been struggling a lot lately over the past month with fear.  Specifically the fear that people I work with will be mad at me.  

I work in independent film production as a team leader so I don't really have a boss; there are supervisors to make sure everything is done legally and safely, but they don't tell people what to do.  It's my fellow department heads that conjures the anxiety and damn, it's getting me good.

Typical chest tightness, trouble breathing, stomach issues, insomnia, and it's been causing a lot of physical tension in my neck and shoulders.

You know fight/flight/fright?  I'm stuck in fright and can feel myself wanting to hide; avoiding answering the phone; avoiding email; avoiding texting.  All from this fear that my coworkers are going to be mad at me.

When I search the feeling deeper I think I fear them being mad at me because (*I believe*) I'm not working hard enough; or not trying hard enough; or that I'm not doing my job well.  That they'll find out that I'm actually lazy and entitled and that I don't want success bad enough or that I don't have what it takes to be successful in the film industry.

In an effort to decrease pressure, there won't be any official membership list, or any obligations.  But you can help by:

* Upvoting any posts you see which are asking for help
* Commenting, even if it's short, just to let people know that you care.  You might want to consider targeting posts that don't have comments.
* Sending a personal message.  This can really mean a lot, especially if OP (or you) have trouble talking in a public place like this.
* Using this thread to discuss any anxieties you have about posting or commenting on this subreddit
* Using this thread to point out anyone who might need support, even if they've never posted in this subreddit
* Using this thread to point out any posts that you think are particularly urgent 

So that's a lot to take in, but hopefully some people are interested. :)

For the past a year and a half, every morning I would get out of the house, get the paper and highlight interesting job offers; But when I wanted to dial the number, I couldn't.  
It was physically impossible, my heart rate would increase, I would start sweating, my throat would go dry and pressing the damn button seemed like the most impossible thing on earth, eventually I would give up and go back home to bury myself in video games and porn.  
Unemployment made me miserable, made me hate myself, made me suicidal; I cut off contact with family and the only two friends that I had, because I was ashamed and embarrassed. I felt like the most disgusting creature in the world. 24 years of living off my dad's money without even earning a single penny.  
But today I finally did it, I started dialing and didn't allow myself to stop, I called and got the address, and much to my own surprise I actually went there. My legs were shaking, my hands were cold and I introduced myself with some hilarious phrasing; But at the end, I got it!

552,DAE find anxiety stops you pursuing your dreams/moving on in your career?,"Hi all.

First of all, a caveat. I am really lucky as I am not that anxious, and I already have a job in a field I like. So if you're dealing with something bigger than this then please just ignore my post.

I want to know: DAE find that they have trouble taking risks or making new steps at work? Do you worry about your ability? Maybe you even avoid doing things you're reasonably sure you could do (like going back into academia or going freelance or taking a lower salary) because your life would be more stressful?

Personally I have been in my job five years, I am well able to do it, had promotions, but struggle to take the next step. I find interview paralysingly stressful (as I'm sure some other redditors here too), so I haven't moved on. I can't go freelance - I couldn't deal with financial instability. And I couldn't go back to academia because I feel like I would be stressed and miserable. 

I'm sorry to be so negative! On the plus side I have done something recommended elsewhere in the forum - listed my possible next steps in a list from easiest to hardest - and hope to start progressing through the steps this year.

But if you have any more tips about this, I would love to collect them here.",41,2015-03-11 15:58:23 EDT-0400

So like the title says, I have a problem where I will say something stupid and then torture myself over it. ""Stupid"" could be anything, depending on how the person I'm having a conversation with reacts. Silence? Laughter? A smile? What was that supposed to really mean? What are they thinking about me?

Then the incident is branded into my memory. I will torture myself by replaying it over and over while audibly, verbally abusing myself. For what ever reason, I replay these incidents in the while in shower more than anywhere else. It's almost like a little temple of self-loathing. I imagine cutting parts of my skin off, or pulling parts out of my body, and the thoughts soothe me. At the worst points, I do end up cutting or burning myself to try and make the embarrassing incidents stop playing in my head. I don't ever really forget them, but they do get to the point where they stop torturing me for a few days or weeks. Then it all starts over.

557,"[Help] I broke down in my advisor's office and now I am on academic probation, of sorts. Anxiety is ruining my life. This is going to be long.","Short background: I am a first-year graduate student in a competitive, professional program. I am also a research assistant within my department and am technically employed by my state government. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I have posted here and in the chat before about my grad school issues so someone might recognize me for that, but oh well.

Yesterday, I yelled at my project supervisor during a meeting. 

I was doing a presentation on the work I have been doing this semester, and at the end, she said that it was a ""disappointing presentation"", even though I had presented everything she asked for (or so I thought). Also present at this meeting were 3-4 of my peers and my department advisors. I was obviously upset but I stood there and took the criticism for what I thought was a decent presentation.

My project supervisor mentioned several times during this criticism session that I ""never submitted a final draft"" of my work, that she ""never received a final draft"". Over and over again she said, in front of my peers and superiors, that I didn't do my work. Finally, I had enough, and I clarified that I had, in fact, submitted a final draft of my work last week. I was in her office and she asked me to email her a draft of my work, and I did. Never heard anything back from her until yesterday's meeting.

We got into a back-and-forth argument over whether or not I had submitted my final draft. She kept saying that she had to ""solicit"" my final draft from me, that other people on the project had approached her with printed out copies of their work. I think she meant that she emailed me asking me for my draft, which I emailed back to her. 

My project was 60+ pages long, I wasn't about to print it all out in the office, and I was under the impression that emailing it to her was fine-- considering that she had verbally and via email told me that this is what she wanted.

Finally, my department advisor put an end to what had become a shouting match and carried on with the meeting. I was supremely embarrassed and had to choke back tears. 

Later in the day, my department advisor called me into her office and talked to me about what had happened. She said that both she and my project supervisor (the one I was yelling at) had noticed that ever since January, I seemed disinterested and was having trouble getting work in on time. I'm also behind on work hours. The list went on and on. She said that she ""doesn't like surprises"" and that if there was a problem, I should have come to her about it.

That's when I broke down. I started hysterically crying. I told her everything: how I've felt alone since I started school, how I started medication but had since stopped taking it because it wasn't helping, how I was falling behind with my work but that I still wanted to be in the program. She let me calm down in her office for a little while, and then she told me that I had to call the campus counseling office right there and then, unless I would be asked to leave my position. My anxiety and depression issues were causing problems, as evidenced by my lack of preparation and my outburst in the meeting that morning.

So I called the counseling office. I have an appointment tomorrow afternoon. Next week, I am sitting down with my department advisor and we are going to work out the rest of the semester. I am so scared/nervous/embarrassed/upset/you name it, I feel it. I still need to reo-do my final draft and re-do the presentation so I am trying to just focus on that but I feel like I can never face my advisor, my supervisor, or anyone else in my department ever again.",34,2015-03-12 22:11:07 EDT-0400

560,I'm finally prescribed the right meds and I feel AMAZING!!!,"Hey everyone! I've posted a few times on this sub but mostly I've just been a lurker. But recently went to my psychologist and he gave me the right diagnosis and medicine that actually works with my body and I honestly can't remember the last time I was this carefree and happy. 

I've suffered from really bad anxiety for the past few years. I had a boyfriend, fell in love, got left for another girl, lost my job, and felt like I was burdening everyone with my existence. I was always over thinking things; things had deeper meanings than what they really *were*. And I'd drive myself absolutely insane. One minute, I'd be perfectly fine and then something as tiny as a friend not texting me back would lead me on a roller coaster of emotions, most of the time downhill. And I would always assume I was unwanted.

My life had turned to complete shit. I couldn't get a job because I would have anxiety attacks, hanging out with friends was always a chore because I had assumed they hated me so much, that everything was said to me in vain and I would **always** take things so offensively. 

A few months ago, I started seeing a psychologist. I told him my troubles of anxiety and we went through my vast history of anti-depressants and anxiety medications. I've taken Welbutrin, Prozac, Effexor, Xanax, Ativan and a bunch of other medicines I can't remember the name of. I had quit taking every one of them because I always ended up feeling **numb**, like I couldn't even enjoy life anymore. I would sit and stare off into space for hours just not feeling a thing. It was even worse than what I was feeling before. I was starting to feel discouraged and I thought I had to live the rest of my life with anxiety. 

This is where things finally start to get better. I told him how everything I had taken wasn't working for me; even the ones he prescribed me. Then he told me about this mouth swab test that can test your DNA and tell you what kind of medications will work for you based on your levels of serotonin or whatever. I don't remember exactly what he said, I'm not a doctor. Anyways, I took the mouth swab test and came back 2 weeks later to discuss my medications and how I was doing. 

I told him about how I have mood swings and the littlest things could send me into a deep depression, and he said that I might be bipolar along with having anxiety and I should try a mood stabilizer. He gave me a medicine called Lamictal and holy shit you guys. It fucking worked.

Today was my first day of taking it and I feel like I felt when I was a kid. You know that feeling that you get when you first fall in love and everything is perfect and you're still in the honeymoon phase and *nothing* can bring you down? Yeah, that's how I feel. Like a vacation from my anxiety! I didn't realize that my mood swings were actually the primary cause of my anxiety! I've had a clear head all day. I did things that would cause me to have a panic attack but I've been perfectly calm and handled myself pretty well in all tricky situations today! 

I'm not a huge poster on here, but I can't thank you guys enough for being supportive when I did need you, and for helping me come to my diagnosis as bipolar/anxiety. 

I guess there are a few bits of advice I have: 

**1)** Keep a journal handy at all times. Write down any feelings you have and make sure to mark it with dates and exact times of those feelings. It's extremely important to keep track of your feelings so you can go back and later asses them.

**2)** If you are lucky enough to have a psychologist, please use that to your advantage. I was an idiot for a long time and never told my therapists or psychologists the full truth because I was afraid of them judging me. Remember they are not there to judge you. They literally entered the business because they want to help you be the best you that you can be!

**3)* Also, if you have a psychologist, ask them about the mouth swab test! I'm not sure how common they are, he said it was fairly new but he's got nothing but good reviews from this method. Look around your area and find a psychologist who can do this for you.

**4)** Make sure you have the right diagnosis. I'm not a doctor, but I've been misdiagnosed a bunch of times. This is why it's important for you to keep a journal. A lot of times, anxiety can be triggered by other emotions, so make sure you know what exactly is causing them.

**5)** Lastly, please do not give up hope. I know anxiety is such a hard thing to have. Sometimes you can feel hopeless and engulfed in an endless sea of despair and sadness. I know how shitty it is. I thought I was a hopeless case but I kept trying because I knew I deserved more than a life like that. And so do you. If I can find happiness, I have no doubt that you can, too :)


**EDIT:** OHMYGOSH you guys I forgot another thing that helped me a lot! [this](http://www.amazon.com/The-Secret-Rhonda-Byrne/dp/1582701709) book has been amazing in terms of positive affirmation. Not only was this one of the key things that got me out of my anxiety but it has brought me so much happiness because it made me believe in myself. Which is hard to do when you're always second guessing yourself. If you only read one book this year, please read this book. You will not be sorry!",34,2015-03-08 09:42:18 EDT-0400
561,An app idea to help us all.,"Hello friends.  I've been having a super rough month or so and desperately needed someone to talk to the other day that understood what I was dealing with- I didn't talk to anyone.  I know, there is this subreddit, and there's also the chat room, but a lot of people don't get responses to their questions on the subreddit, and it's not always easy to get to the chat room.  

My idea is to create an app where people can get a hold of someone to talk to within minutes.  Here's how it would work:  You would download the app and create a username (standard stuff).  Afterwords, you would create a profile telling a little bit about yourself.  Lastly, you would indicate if you were available to talk (voice over the phone), or text in the event someone needed you.  Ideally the voice call would take place within the app to secure the privacy of your phone number, but you could give it out to whomever you were talking to if you desire.  

Here's a hypothetical situation to give you a better idea:  My wife and kid are out of the town, and I'm freaking out about some random health situation (I think I have cancer, or I'm having a stroke, or possibly a heart attack).  All I need is someone to talk to and tell me it will be alright and help me cope with it.  I open up my app on my phone and change my status from ""green (available to talk to someone) to either ""yellow (need someone to talk to, but not in any hurry), or to ""red (I need to get someone on the horn right now or I'm gonna lose my shit).  So I changed it to red.  Now, all the users that had selected that they were available to talk will get a notification, one by one, and whoever accepts it first will have the honor of helping someone get through a stressful time.  Let's say I set my status to yellow.  People that are logged on to the app will see that my status is yellow and that I'd like to talk to someone, but it's no rush.  They can choose to accept it-or not.  If no one has accepted it in a user-defined amount of time (maybe the person who needed help selected ""yellow- 1 hour"") then it will be processed through the same notification system as ""red"".  

Obviously this is bare-bones and needs fleshed out a little more, but it's an idea.  This would be free to anyone to use also.  No need to charge people to talk to friends.  Obviously some sort of ad system would have to be integrated in to keep it functional, though.  

I'd like some feedback from you all.  Does it sound like a good idea?  I'm not by any means an app developer or programmer, so if this is popular I would have to go to a 3rd party to develop this.

Lastly, my feelings won't get hurt if you tell me it's stupid.  But I know for people like us, it's nice to have someone in your pocket that you can reach out to at any time, and I also know that while we may have our issue, we never hesitate look after our own when they are in need.  Thanks for reading.

566,[Rant] Walked out on my siblings on my birthday,"I've always been an anxious person. But I don't think I've ever sunk this low before. I've been in the military for the past 6 years, away from home aside from a once a year visit. I love my family dearly and we're very tight knit, even if we don't communicate often.

I'm finally in town for a decent chunk of time, allowing me to actually spend some quality time with them outside of rushed visits. Only a month of being in the same state, catching up with my brother only a third time I end up walking out only a few hours into the evening. On my birthday no less.

I've never felt especially comfortable about my birthday and all the attention felt so overwhelming. Then feeling so out of place because I'm so removed from what goes on in their lives. It all got too much and I just walked out and found myself at a train station holding back tears whilst waiting for the train home. All I offered in text was an ""I'm feeling a bit out of sorts"".

I'm so looking forward to living back home again by the end if this year. But I've never felt so out of place and alien in my life and they're my closest and dearest family. I handled being deployed overseas better for fuck sake.",10,2015-03-14 17:20:32 EDT-0400

571,Finally went to the doctor to get help. Got into an accident on the way home.,"After months of contemplating getting help.. Wednesday I actually looked forward to finally having that conversation with my doctor about my anxiety and panic attacks. I meditated before I left and my mom drove me. For the first time in months I didn't feel anxious in the car, we actually went out of my comfort/safe zone. The appointment went great, my doctor prescribed me some meds to try and we headed back home. I was supposed to stop at the pharmacy and go back to the office get my shot. When we were heading towards our exit it started pouring, my mom could barely see our exit. We hydroplaned and slammed into a big truck in front of us. For the next hour it was a horrible dream and the worst panic attack I couldn't pull myself out of. My ears were ringing and I got out to pull my mom out but she was unconscious. Someone pulled over and helped my mom while I called for help. 

My mom ended up being taken to the hospital in the icu and I refused treatment and my brother brought me home. The accident was just a couple minutes away from our house. I spent the next several hours in the bathroom dry heaving, shaking and weak. Took forever for the shock to wear off. I've never been in an accident before. I still don't feel right, me entire body aches. Or that I'm here. Most of the impact was on my side and I don't understand how I wasn't injured and how I walked away from it. 

I don't know where to go from here. I woke up last night hyperventilating thinking I was still in the car. I can still smell the smoke and dust from the air bags. ",9,2015-03-13 18:10:55 EDT-0400

573,I like myself but I have no self-esteem. Can anyone relate?,"As a teenager/young adult I struggled with severe anxiety and depression. I eventually sought professional help and those problems are under control now, but I still have some weird self-esteem issues.

It's tough to explain because I feel like I really do like myself. Like anybody I have my share of strengths and weaknesses, but I take my strengths seriously and don't diminish them. I know I'm a smart person. I know I'm talented. People tell me I'm funny frequently enough that I believe it's true. I have a lot of friends and I'm generally well-liked by my coworkers.

But lurking in the back of my mind is this perpetual fear that if I let anybody get too close, they'll find out the truth about me, and the truth is that I'm just not good enough. I feel like I'm inherently unlovable, and as soon as the people I care about figure it out, they'll bail. So I keep pretty much everyone at arm's length.

I was abandoned by a parent when I was little and I feel like there's a relationship between that experience and these feelings. Even though intellectually I know my abandonment wasn't my fault, it's like my brain just doesn't get the message.

I'm a normal person, not depressed, but I do stress out a lot with exams and used to have problems with endorphines. 

I HATE leaving my house, and whenever I leave the first thing I think of is when will I come back. As I have matured and become older though, I have started to feel unconfortable at home as it's not 'normal'. Therefore I try to leave my house to the mall or something at least once a day to get that feeling of being 'refreshed' and 'phew, I'm back home'.

Whenever my friends tell me to go out with them, I say yes and go along. But my feelings betray me if they cancel the plans and my heart gives a giant leap and I sink back into my chair.

Something else that could identify what my problem is: I feel like everyone is always judging me.

my anxiety is strongest when it comes to work, it's something I've really been struggling with and trying to overcome - but I felt fine all day yesterday, minimal anxiety about it, I actually felt excited. 


then at around 8 I suddenly felt extremely sick. had to go to the washroom, and felt like throwing up but nothing would come out. I started shaking nonstop and my body heated up, felt disoriented, and honestly could barely tell whether I felt sick from the jalepeno fries or if I was having a spontaneous attack. 


I took an Ativan anyways and fell asleep early. woke up today same thing, went to the washroom and felt sick afterwards and had to ask to come in on Monday instead. but now I'm wondering if this will all repeat on Monday, or if maybe my stomach was just upset mixed with anxiety?


anyways. my post didn't really have a point other than to see if anyone else ever struggles with this!

But all of these movies end up being huge social events for my friends that everyone is talking about for weeks or months.

590,How do you deal with stigma from mental health issues and/or chronic unemployment?,"I'm trying to get back out there and trying hard to restore relationships with friends.  I cycle back and forth between periods of extreme stress and anxiety and I also deal with cycles of major depression.

I used to have steady work with good paying jobs, but in the past two years as my mental health has declined, my job history has turned into absolute shit.

I'm currently in an ""intensive rehabilitation"" mental health program because it has been about 18 months since I've been able to hold a steady job, none of them lasting for more than a few weeks, and I haven't been employed at all in 2015.  I see either a doctor, therapist, case manager, or psychiatrist nearly ever day.  I'm going to start doing some volunteer work so that I can build back my stamina to going back to work eventually.

I want to hang out with friends in my off time, but I think all of my old friends see me as ""flaky"" because I have a habit of cancelling plans when I don't feel well, or when I'm depressed or extremely anxious.  I also get the feeling that they don't want to be around a ""crazy person"".  I get social anxiety and I tend to over-share my problems when people ask me how I'm doing... I tend to tell the truth.

What do you say when you are trying to meet people and they want to know what is your occupation or career path?  How do you find people to surround yourself with who are positive.  How do you explain to people that you aren't deliberately being flaky, or cancelling plans with people to be mean... but that you legitimately struggle with being able to keep plans (and that's also the reason I can't keep a job)

I'm really wanting to get better but this has been a barrier to my recovery.  I just wish there wasn't so much stigma with mental health issues / unemployment.

Do you guys have any tips?  I just wish people would see me as a normal person and not someone they have to feel bad or sorry for.",7,2015-05-22 04:35:37 EDT-0400
591,Overwhelmed by hobbies,"about me: 24, woman, general anxiety, major depression

I've been wanting to write about this for a while, but I am not sure I can verbalize it well. Here goes...

I notice I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to watching movies, TV shows, and even playing video games. It's not that I feel like I shouldn't be doing these things for whatever reason. It's that I get overwhelmed.

I don't watch many TV shows, but people are always telling me about these awesome shows. Plus, new things are always coming out. I have a few shows I watch, but they tend to be older shows and ones I've watched. I think it's because they are familiar. I don't want to get involved with new characters and their dramas and how that might trigger me. Movies are easier because there is less commitment. 2 or so hours, I can deal with it.

Then there are video games. I like them and play them, but also get overwhelmed. I also get intimidated by different games than what I am used to. I feel like I won't be able to learn, or am not good enough. I do feel guilty when I don't finish a game though. I feel like it's a personal failure. I try to remember life is too short to keep doing things you don't enjoy, especially when it comes to hobbies, but it's still a weird mindset to get out of.

Also, when I am doing one of these things I need to be doing something else. For example, I can't just sit and watch a movie if I am alone. I also have to be playing video games. It's like I need a lot going on to distract me from my thoughts.

Then I tend to get depressed because it feels like I can't enjoy anything properly.

I don't know if I am describing this well. It seems silly to get anxious over entertainment and hobbies. Anybody get this way?",11,2015-05-26 03:45:51 EDT-0400

I don't normally do shadowing or have shadowing over my work with trainees (I work in a call centre, so they stare at me while I talk on the phone). Sometimes I am asked to do it, and in the past I've done it no problem.

I thought I dealt with the situation as best as I could. I politely excused myself to go to the washroom, and just said I had a bit of nerves. The two trainees said, ""no worries.""

I came back, and since I had already done enough demonstration with the trainees they moved onto something else.

I thought my manager's discussion about my anxiety was a little dense. I just told her I was having an anxiety attack and if I could go into break.

Her reply was, ""why did you allow those trainees to work with you if you feel like that.""

I said it normally isn't always an issue, and I wasn't anxious at that moment in time.

She said, ""well you must have made it weird for them when you left.""

I had an anxiety attack is all. I very politely explained to the two employees I was going to the bathroom. I didn't run out of the room like it was on fire.

Now I feel anxious about talking to my manager as she seems kind of unapproachable to me.

595,[AM I RIGHT?] ADHD and Anxiety. Working together like a bunch of a-holes.,"This is my take on anxiety and ADHD. I cycle pretty hard and I'm just trying to figure out the best way to stop the cycle. Am I right? Am I close? 

Here's how my anxiety and ADHD work together like a pair of a-holes. Thanks. 

Step one. Your ADHD mind lets something slip. You are late or forget a deadline.

Step two. Your ADHD reminds you of all the other times you made this mistake. It's like the worst montage ever.

Step three. Your anxiety launches. Not only the anxiety of the mistake, but this great leftover doggie bag of all the other times you messed up. It's like anxiety inception. 

Step four. Due to the anxiety you have (and perhaps other people being upset) your ADHD runs rampant because you can't manage anything right now. Our Executive Function, the manager of our brain, the command center just takes a nap on the couch. 

Step five. Now that you can't manage, your ADHD is running the show, you are worked up, you continue to make mistakes and so your ADHD mind leaps back to step one. 

Let me know if I'm missing a step. Just trying to get this @)(*#$ figured out. ",6,2015-05-25 22:40:46 EDT-0400

Holyshit. I can't believe the difference it has made. My anxiety levels have dropped by at least 70-80%. Give it a shot if you haven't already.",29,2015-07-02 19:36:12 EDT-0400

611,"I have have severe health anxiety, and although declared healthy, I can't keep from checking my pulse all the time.","I've been diagnosed with anxiety and chronic hyperventilation. I suffered from it a couple of years now, with ups and downs. Last summer I had an ongoing up, which was great. I felt stress free, I could do any kind of exercise i wanted, I ate and drank what wanted, etc.

Since a couple of months I've hit rock bottom again. I don't sleep wel, I undereat, I lost a great deal of the stamina and energy I built up last summer. And above all, I'm afraid of my own pulse.

I can't stop checking it often. I did notice that when I get anxious or when I'm breathing weird again, when I check my pulse in my neck it feels like my veins contract very hard and my heart also, which makes me really anxious.

It's like my veins and heart are really squeezing together sometimes, and it really winds me up. It disables me from working out and getting into a better condition, although when I'm working out and breathing steadily it's not really contracting that hard but just going fast. An elevated heart rate also makes me anxious because I'm afraid it's going to stop at any given moment.

I'm a total mess. It really prevents me from going full on during physical activities. Even drinking a beer can put me into a panic and give me palpitations and chest pain. I'm in my mid-twenties, I used to do loads of sports until 8 months ago, and doctors and cardiologists told me I'm fine, yet I continue to live this mentally destructive lifestyle.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I tried counseling, but it's really, really hard to convince myself there is nothing wrong with me when I'm having this heavy contracting pulse, chest pain, arm pains etc.",25,2015-07-04 18:09:19 EDT-0400
612,"Anyone else have parents with anxiety, in addition to having anxiety themselves?","So both my parents have pretty serious anxiety issues, though they refuse to get themselves diagnosed. My mom has what I believe is social anxiety, which she likes to take out on me by telling me it's inappropriate to talk about certain things with family friends (I don't have any friends of my own to talk to). This makes a bit of sense when you consider the fact that I have Asperger's Syndrome, and thus, have had some issues in the past with knowing what's appropriate and inappropriate to talk about, but I feel like she takes her worries about me to an extreme. 

Most recently, my mom got really angry with me about the fact that I dared to talk to one of my dad's friends about the book I was reading, which has to deal with true accounts of people overcoming mental illness. ([Here's the book](http://www.amazon.com/Same-Time-Next-Week-Stories/dp/1937163199), in case anyone is interested.) She thinks that it was inappropriate to talk to him about that book, since mental illness is something to be ashamed of, and hearing about the book made her uncomfortable. The thing is, though, that my dad's friend was genuinely interested in the book, and even took some pictures of it with his phone, so that he could look for a copy himself. And you know what? I **enjoyed** talking about that book with him. It was the first real conversation I'd had in weeks with someone who was genuinely interested in what I had to say. But my mom doesn't care about that, and she thinks that her own personal discomfort matters more than the fact that I was happy. 

My mom has also gotten angry with me about talking to a family friend about the fact that I'm on SSI, since she feels like that's something that I should keep secret, so people don't judge me for it. She seems to be completely and utterly stuck in the mindset of ""we, as a family, should keep to ourselves and try to ensure that no one judges us for anything."" I feel like that mindset just makes me want to isolate myself even more than I already do, and it also causes me to have horrible self-esteem, and that's so frustrating. She also has criticized my appearance before, saying that my pants are too baggy on me (which is odd, seeing as they all fit me really well), and saying that my hair is too messy. 

The difficult thing is that my mom is very kind and loving to me in all other respects (and she's a very apologetic person whenever she does hurt my feelings), so it's not like she's being narcissistic or anything. So I often feel like there are two sides of her: the anxious, controlling side, and the kind, loving side. And I never know when the anxious side of her is going to be triggered.

Then, there's my dad. He has what I'm pretty sure is OCD, though he, like my mom, refuses to get diagnosed. He tends to lecture me whenever I leave crumbs on the table after making lunch, or track dirt into the house. (And I tend to be a pretty neat person in general, so it's not like we're talking about huge piles of crumbs or muddy dirt tracks. We're talking about specks of crumbs and dirt.) He's also lectured me in the past about using too much water when I wash the dishes, which I find to be really hypocritical, since he tends to use a lot of water when he washes the cars. And he also is really big on conserving electricity, and has lectured me for leaving the lights on in a room when I'm not there, and for leaving my computer on when I'm not using it. I just feel like it's hard to do right by him, since he's so sensitive about so many different things.

Then there's my own anxiety. I have social anxiety, general anxiety disorder, and hypochondria, all of which I have to manage pretty much on my own, since my parents are so mired in their own anxiety. And I'm expected to see a therapist and take meds, even though neither of my parents are willing to do either of those things themselves. I just feel really frustrated about how I'm expected to just deal with my parents' anxiety, and to manage my own anxiety as well.

So, anyone in the same sort of situation?

[TL;DR: Mom has what I'm pretty sure is social anxiety, and Dad has what I'm pretty sure is OCD. I'm expected to tiptoe around their sensitivities and am left on my own to manage my own anxiety. I want to know if anyone else is in the same sort of situation.]",17,2015-07-07 18:16:47 EDT-0400

614,NAILED THE MRI TODAY!,"Having severe anxiety disorder, I was forced to go for an MRI yesterday as it turns out I have Optic Neuritis. The doctor said she wants me to take the test asap to see if it might be MS. 

As soon as she said that, I immediately went into a full panic attack gallore. MS and MRI in an enclosed tunnel. 

So I went, the first few minutes was absolute torture. I started shaking, couldn't kept still and suddenly remember my breating techniques. 

A couple of seconds later, I got myself to calm down, imagining im laying on the beach, listening to binaural brainwave music. 

I felt so calm and relaxed, not even the diagnosis could scare me anymore. 

Turned out I dont have MS and it's just intense inflammation on my optic nerve. 

I am very proud of myself for handling this so great!

I can approach anybody now and talk to them with ease, I feel more confident with my movements/walking and people actually come up to talk to me since they enjoy my company. I can't imagine going back to my old life. 

I used to have such bad social anxiety I would go into panic attacks and would have to do shit like crouch in my backyard if I heard one of my neighbors go outside and just stay low/not move/be quiet until I heard them go back in. Also I wouldn't be able to walk past a window if I thought somebody would see me.

Better go browse the Internet to at least do something while I think of what to do. Oh hey my weekend is gone. Guess I'll try again next week. 

Or I'll sit down and start doing something but I feel like I should be doing something else. So I feel guilty and stop doing what I was doing but I don't know what it is that I think I *should* be doing so I wait on the couch until I can figure it out.

Cancer is branded as something that can be beaten, even though most of the time the outcome is not so good. There are innumerable inspirational stories of people overcoming cancer, even the majority lose that battle. Mental health problems are battles, too, but they are often seen as lifelong battles (which they often are, of course), but that's, well, depressing. 

Cancer is depressing; people re-brand it as something to be overcome. Mental health issues need the same treatment in order to increase awareness and move towards more positive public opinions. The benefits of the reduced stigma would be enormous.

We need this for mental health outcomes. Even in the field of mental health, everyone can seem melancholy as though you'll never really get better. There's rarely a ""now go! you're all better now!"" moment. We're always left with the fear of our own minds, and we need a way out of it.

I built a small group of friends when I first moved, but lost them all when my cousin and his girlfriend broke up, because I had met all of them through her, and none of them want anything to do with me. 

I work at a small company with nobody else my age, so work doesn't present any opportunities either.

659,Just got home from a long walk [Progress],"Got my haircut and rather than get a bus or taxi home, decided to walk as it is a nice day. Plus it would force me to confront some things I'd been avoiding for months.

First thing is that ugly beast, agoraphobia. Not so much being outside but more away from my home with no quick way to get back. Wide open spaces in general have been a no-no, so I deliberately chose a route that would take me through the local park where there's a couple of fields.

Second was to force myself to cope without diazepam on me. I didn't take any with me so any panic and I was on my own. I think I did alright, I only started to feel funny when I got to the end of my street, and that was because I was getting hot and flustered.

The main reason I did this was to try and cause an adrenaline rush (I even had an energy drink to encourage this), much like a panic attack. And then calm down the natural way, rather than through pills. I think it worked somewhat. I'm just relaxing in my room with a cool glass of milk before I have a shower and get some lunch.",12,2015-10-01 16:57:10 EDT-0400

661,My anxiety makes me afraid to take showers. Any advice?,"Hey everyone, 

I'm a female, age 21, and for the past few months I've developed a fear of taking showers. :/ It's not the washing or the water that frightens me, it's more of the vulnerability. 

I always lock the bathroom door, but I'm always terrified that something horribly wrong is happening in the house while I'm in the shower...or that someone's going to pound on the door, or break it down. I usually rush through my showers in a panic (which is a plus for the environment) but often times I nick myself shaving or I forget to wash out the shampoo in my hair.  

So now I get in a terrible cycle of being afraid to take showers because of my anxiety, which results in more anxiety!

I know it sounds stupid, but this used to be one of the only things that could subdue my anxiety, and now it's just creating more stress.

664,"My anxiety had lead me to think that everything was way harder than it is, so my life froze for years.","First I apologize for my non-perfect English, but I am sure you'll understand what I'm trying to say. 

It took me 27 years to realize that I was taking life way more serious that I should have. I started recently recalling all the situations when I thought I was going to fail at something but didn't, or when I totally gave up on something because of fear and anxiety. I don't think I'm less intelligent than most people around me, in fact I think I'm just as average or maybe even possess some skills that other successful people don't. I am just lost in a horrible cycle of anxiety that has overcome my life and prevented me from attempting many **simple** situations and challenges.


I would like to begin by describing that I graduated from one of the most challenging and prestigious engineering schools in my country. During my studies, I thought I would never make it and graduate but I did with the least amount of effort, not because I thought I was smart, but because I thought I wasn't! So I was afraid of studying, I was afraid of attempting assignments and group works. I only studied just before my final exams because I had to! It was a matter of survival. But I passed! 


But you think my fear has stopped after graduation? No it didn't! I started thinking that I'm under-qualified and wouldn't find a job no matter what. I even didn't think about interning because I thought that I didn't possess the qualities and skills of an intern! So I never even looked for a job in my field out of fear and anxiety. So I did minimum wage jobs that I also sucked at because I was always anxious and thinking that I wasn't doing the job right. 


I initialized a break up with a really wonderful girl who was always trying to help and support me just because I thought she was too good for me. I also have an artistic talent that was kind of my sanctuary, I used to create works of art and publish them and I got offers from people to work with but gave up on them because I thought that I was still not good enough to be a professional artist. I even once refused an invitation without giving a logical reason, that the woman who invited me was confused! I did that only because I thought I would gonna screw up. There are many other little situations that anxiety has prevented me from even attempting!


I have now reached nowhere in my life. I'm in my late twenties with no decent job or purpose. I stopped creating art and I stopped seeing people. It was all because of anxiety. The only difference is that now I started noticing those patterns and started realizing that this fear I have isn't logical and it's all due to the damn anxiety! I tried proving it to myself by thinking about returning to my original career path and I am reviewing what I had already studied and forgotten. I am still scared a little but I'm trying hard to get rid of this fear and reset my life to the point where I graduated a few years ago, and then go from there again!


When I think about it, it feel as if I was frozen for many years due to my anxiety... On the other hand I like to think that me realizing that those things were not as hard as I thought they were, could be the beginning of treatment.",13,2015-10-05 17:02:55 EDT-0400

666,Shopped Alone for the First Time in 20 Years,"I am agoraphobic - or maybe I ""used"" to be?  After today I don't care what you call me, because I DROVE my car, and I had everything that could go wrong actually GO wrong, so I went back home and started over.  

I drove to a second-hand store that was about two miles from my home, parked really far from the entrance, and I actually ENJOYED my time in the store!  I was in there for an hour!!!  It was crazy wild to be in a store alone, but awesome, too.  Really, really awesome!  

Building up to it wasn't great.  I started the day by putting my dog in the car (I'm fighting a 15 year driving phobia, too) and heading to a closeby neighborhood to pick up something off of someone's porch that they gave to me.  My dog had her head sticking out of the window in the back and I'm not really familiar with this car because my husband just bought it, so I went to put my window up and instead put hers up - it scared her so bad that she shit all over the back seat then jumped in the front seat and continued pooping!  Oh God it was so gross!  I pulled over and tried to get it all out of the car while trying to keep her from jumping out, AND while trying to console her because she was upset.  I was getting so flustered and grossed out.  

Okay, poop under control...time to go to a coffee shop because that was my goal - pick up the item and go for coffee.  There wasn't a single parking space anywhere and because I hadn't thought it through, I had arrived at the coffee shop at 12:15pm, not remembering that that's when people go for lunch.  Duh.  So I kept circling this tight parking lot trying to figure out where to park, pulled over along side of the road and texted my husband for support, got that, then finally went back and found a space to park.  I didn't want to, but I went in and got that damn coffee!

Then the dog pooped in the car.  Again.

I'd had enough so I drove home and took her into the house.

After cleaning up the car I was like...no.  No - I am NOT giving up.  I'm out of the house FOR ONCE, my son is in school for the next few hours, and I don't care if it kills me I AM LEAVING THIS HOUSE!!!  

And so I did.  I drove.  I parked.  I walked.  I shopped.  I bought two little things.  I drove back home.

667,does anyone else feel as though they have gotten a lot less intelligent because of anxiety?,"I am in my final year of college and my third year of anxiety/depression. For the first two years it was completely out of control - every day I would wake up in a panic that would often last the entire day. 

it could just be placebo or that i get too anxious when i need my brain the most but i just feel... stupider. My thoughts are slower, I can't fully articulate my thoughts even in my own head, and sometimes when thinking about a subject ill get the feeling that there is something more there, but i can't find it. I also have a hard time focusing on anything and my thoughts are very scattered all the time.

I've heard that stress is really bad for your brain. is it possible that i have suffered brain damage from having so much stress? is there any way to undo this damage, or am i going to have to live with it?

674,Harrassed by Younger Kids,"I've had a pretty rubbish day today, but a particular incident occurred that's really set my anxiety off. 

I was out riding my bike when two younger kids from my school began following and filming me as I was riding. I felt completely powerless as they followed me around, and so I went and sat down somewhere with the hope of being able to joke around with them for a bit until they eventually lost interest and I could escape.

This didn't work however, as they sat either side of me on the same bench and made me very uncomfortable - I didn't want to show  any weakness and reveal that they were getting to me, so I just toughed it out, made some jokes, and eventually said that I had to leave.

They got on their bikes and followed me all the way home - luckily my dad was out the front of our house, so they couldn't leave me with any passing remarks, but the whole occurrence has upset and disturbed me greatly.

It's not that I feared for my safety (I could take them in a fight, although I dislike the idea of them knowing where I live) I just felt so horribly trapped for the whole time.

675,Saved my barista from an anxiety/panic attack,"Okay so yesterday when I went to a small express (takeaway) Espresso House (idk if you can find espr house in any other countries than sweden but it's basically just like starbucks except they don't write you name on the cup) I waited for my turn and the customers before me went outside when it was time for me to order. 

There are bigger espr house café's but since I was more or less hurrying to my bus I figured I'd order a takeaway frapino and drink it on the bus. 

Anyway, since it was a really small café really just made for takeaway orders if you don't want to sit outside the café, my barista was working all alone. I saw a pin on her working outfit saying ""new at work!"" so I figured I'd be a little calmer and let her take everything in so that she wouldn't have to stress my order since I was the only one in queue and she was all alone working there. 

When I placed my order the receipt machine stopped working and she attempted to fix it a few times, with no success. I started calmly asking questions like ""has this happened before?"" and ""do you have someone who you can call to fix it"" but by the look on her face I saw panic and stress crawling under her skin. 

I saw a few stressful customers run in to the café and very impatiently left which left her even more stressful. 

By now, I saw she was on the edge of being very very fragile and close to crying so I just calmly said, ""don't worry, I can wait. I know how it feels."" and the look of releif on her face was priceless. We talked a little more and finally she was able to take my order and when I left we said goodbye and I said ""Take care, I hope it works out for you later"" 

When I left I felt so good, and I think she did too. I'm glad I opened my mouth and reached out to her because otherwise she might have started crying and that would have been even worse for her at work. 

And for anyone who might say ""if she's that sensitive maybe she shouldn't work at a stressful café"", no, even though someone works at a stressful job they do not deserve being left alone with an anxiety attack that might embarress them, and especially not at work in the middle of the city. Please, if you see anyone showing signs of a panic/anxiety attack, reach out to them!

676,Last week I conquered my fears and went on a trip to SF alone. Here's a quick montage of my time there. More info in comments,[deleted],32,2015-09-14 00:58:41 EDT-0400
677,"Not only does my mind race when I'm having anxiety issues, but I also get the strong urge to poop, making situations even more awkward.",,32,2015-09-14 17:19:59 EDT-0400
678,Raising a child with anxiety,"I thought I'd write something about what it's like to raise a child who suffers from anxiety.

My eldest was born in 1998.  She was a happy and rambunctious toddler.  She wasn't a particularly difficult child, and always had a huge smile on her face.  Oh sure, she could be a little stubborn sometimes, but nothing unusual for a toddler.  She was the apple of our eye and always lit up every room she was in.

Her sister was born a couple of years later, and while the stresses of raising two little ones were tough, we managed to save enough to buy a house, and with some scrimping we managed to figure out how to make our little family run on a single income so mom could raise the girls herself.  Mom and girls joined groups for toddlers and all seemed normal.

Our eldest started preschool, and while there were some occasional objections about ""how long"" preschool was, mostly she liked playing with the other kids, and always had a smile on her face while in class.  The teachers told us ""she's definitely ready for kindergarten"" when time came to decide.

Alas, this couldn't have been more incorrect.  When kindergarten started, after a few weeks it became clear she did NOT like school.  ""Mom, dad, it's way too long.  I can't make it.  It's too hard.  Nobody likes me.""  Eventually the protests turned into fits of crying in the mornings, and ultimately refusal to get in the car.  We learned that the best way to get her to go to class was to basically force-walk her to the school counselor's office, who would sit with her, talk, and draw.  Within 5 or 10 minutes she would calm down and go to class.  This continued for kindergarten and 1st grade.

At this point, we decided we needed to do something.  We didn't know what was wrong, but we couldn't continue with things as they were.  So, in desperation we open enrolled her at another school.  Initially things got a little better, but within six months, the same behaviors appeared again -- ""It's too hard.  I can't do it.  Nobody likes me.""  This school didn't have a counselor, so we were in a tougher spot.

We thought ""Maybe it's the size of the schools.""  They were both bursting at the seams, and the district had a history of bullying that was pretty well known.  So, at great expense, we decided to look into two things.  First, tutoring to get her back on track academically, and second, private school at a much smaller school.  

This approach seemed to work, at least for a little while.  She formed closer friendships at the new school, her academics improved, and we thought ""Finally we figured this out.""  All was more-or-less normal until middle school.  Things went off the rails in middle school -- big time.

The first indication that we had an issue was academics.  They plummeted.  We noticed notebooks coming home loaded with doodles and pictures -- a lot of sad pictures with people crying or frowning.  I spent countless hours with her on homework -- it often felt like I was teaching her the subjects for the first time each night.  Due to her declining academics, the principal called us and suggested we have a school psychologist sit in her classes and observe (unbeknownst to any of the kids in the room).  After that assessment it became clear that things were definitely not okay.  The statistics the psychologist gathered showed that she was very withdrawn and did not participate with the other students or the teachers.  She suggested it might be a case of ADHD-Inattentive, and referred us to a psychiatrist who did some surveys and met with her, and concluded ""Yes, she does have ADHD-Inattentive, and a touch of anxiety.""  She went on adderall, and overnight it was like a curtain had lifted -- within six months her academics improved, she started forming friendships again, and even started playing basketball.  There were still blips of anxiety, affecting things like her basketball performance, but we hoped that being more engaged with other kids these symptoms might dissipate.  Since the anxiety wasn't completely gone, we thought it might be wise for her to speak with a therapist every few weeks.

Freshman year of high school was pretty good.  She had her first relationship with a boy, which started out quite normal, but ended in a mess that began a downward spiral that she's never fully recovered from.  It seems that the boy in question decided to leave the private school, quickly lost interested in our eldest, found a new girlfriend, and didn't bother to keep our daughter informed -- she found out from a third party.  This truly devastated her confidence.  Sophomore year her academics began to slide again.  At this point the psychiatrist suggested we treat the anxiety with meds, so sertraline was added -- eventually reaching the max dose (200mg).  The anxiety gradually kept getting worse.  Although we didn't get school refusals, we got withdrawal from friends and school again.  The anxiety started making her feel like she was unable to do things like take care of her own hair (mom had to help).  She started wearing the same clothes over and over out of a fear of trying anything new.  By junior year it was becoming very problematic again, and so we changed therapists, hoping that a new face might improve things.  By the end of junior year, she was failing two classes, and we had to work with the administration to figure out a way to help her pass by demonstrating effort on homework.

At the same time, she developed a crush on a boy.  We and the therapist tried to discourage this, as we felt like she really wasn't in any shape emotionally to deal with the drama that typically happens in high school relationships.  The boy is, by almost all accounts, a clone of myself, which probably isn't surprising.  Unfortunately he's also very well connected at the school (popular), and it's rather unlikely that he'll have any interest in pursuing a very quiet, withdrawn girl.  I think in some way my daughter knows this, and is attempting to moderate her behavior -- she joined cheerleading, joined drama, and joined the youth group that this boy attends.  All of those things are wonderful in the sense that they help draw her out, but she's doing them for the wrong reasons, and the setup for emotional collapse is quite evident from an adult's perspective.  That's where we're at today.

Here's what I think many people don't understand.  We're not ashamed of our daughter.  She is still the apple of our eye.  I think people believe that somehow you can parent your way around having an anxious/depressed child.  If that's true, I sure don't know how you do it.  I feel like we've always tried everything that had a reasonable chance of success to help her overcome these waves of emotion that debilitate her ability to make and keep friends and to stay focused.  We've been tough, and we've been understanding.  We've kept our distance so she can be independent, but when she's run off the rails, we've helped get her back on track and tried something different moving forward.  I'm fully convinced that this is a mental illness that no amount of ""willpower"" alone will fix.  That's not something I believed before I had kids and saw this up close.

There are so many wonderful things about my daughter that nobody sees.  She's a gifted artist, but she often hides her work.  She almost always believes the best about everyone (except herself).  She has great hopes when she's not down in the dumps -- dreams of being an animator or fine artist.  I know that the happy smiling toddler who bounded from challenge to challenge is in there somewhere.  I'm not ashamed, I could never be ashamed.  I just wish I could remove this burden from her.  I wish she could see how truly amazing she is.  I wish she could see herself from my eyes and from her mother's eyes.  I wish she could stop imagining that people don't like her before she even talks to them.  I wish others would take a chance with her.  She's quiet and reserved, but there's a great kid under that withdrawn exterior.  Mostly I hope that this somehow resolves.  I don't want her to spend the rest of her life like she is today.  We love her too much for that.",39,2015-09-12 21:39:30 EDT-0400
679,Anxiety is robbing me of my adulthood,"I was a top student in high school and graduated with a 3.8 gpa in the honors program at college.  I started developing bad anxiety in my junior year when I decided against med school.  After college, I couldn't find a job for a year. Eventually I got a job unrelated to me degree but unfortunately and hastily, I quit because of a bad panic attack among other things.  I have went on interviews, tried to volunteer, etc and I have had no luck.  Its been 4 years since college and I have essentially done nothing.  I don't even remember what I studied and I feel like I have zero skills.  Why did I even go? I can't seem to grow up.  I even look 10 years younger than I am.  I also suffered from bad acne so that didn't help.

681,"15 year old here, I would like some help with getting rid of health/death anxiety.","**edit:** wow. I feel a lot better after writing this out. 

I started having anxiety and panic attacks when I was 13 or 14, I can't really remember my age at the time. Everything started from overthinking... life. 

It bothers me that everyone I know, including myself, is going to die. I worry not only for my own health, but everyone else's health as well. I don't like seeing other people suffering - the simple fact that there are people out there suffering needlessly puts a pit in my stomach. 

It seems as if whenever I'm tired or fatigued, I somehow think that I have some kind of debilitating illness. A small pain or a symptom can turn into a giant worry - 

""Oh shit I have a pain in my wrist from playing too much guitar. Fuck. What if it's carpal tunnel.""

 ""Fuck, I'm really tired this morning for no reason, what if it's leukaemia?"" 

""Damn, my head hurts and I feel strange. Anxiety is making me choke on my own words. Am I having a stroke? Do I have a brain tumour?"" 

You get the idea. 

How do I break free of this? My biggest worries right now are:

(holy fuck I feel so silly writing this)

1) Secretly having a brain tumour or some kind of cancer

2) Death. Existential stuff.

3) Life. What is life? What am I even meant to do? What will I do? What about my parents, friends, and loved ones?

4) What if I have a psychological illness? What if anxiety is a sign of that illness?

I sometimes get panic attacks about these things. Admittedly, reading things up on google and WebMd hasn't helped in the slightest, but sometimes the urge to know overpowers me, and I just end up feeling more anxious. (An alternative to webmd which is nice is mayoclinic, which describes diseases in a much more friendly manner, and I don't get that worried when I use it for 'research.')

Sometimes, thinking about having a panic attack causes me more worry than having an actual panic attack would. Whenever I'm on public transport I think about what I would do if I had a panic attack - who would help me, what would people think?

Sometimes, I also get random intrusive thoughts, especially in periods of high anxiety. My mind just explodes with a thousand different thoughts in these situations and it really freaks me out. 

This is what my anxiety is about in a nutshell.

My grandmother is also terminally ill. Seeing my parents upset causes me more pain than watching my grandmother die. This is also a source of anxiety for me. I know my parents, and everyone else is going to die. 

I'm very open to my parents about my feelings, and they've supported me very well. They have also taken me to a therapist in the past, and that did help. I was relatively anxiety free for the past year, but I've had periods in which worrying kept me up till late at night, and I've also had some panic attacks. 

I've started seeing my school's counselor, who is wonderful, and I felt a lot better after that meeting. Among other things, she recommended that I read ""Man's Search for Meaning"" by Victor Frankl. I'm going to go to a bookstore this week and buy that book.

This is turning into incoherent babble, and so I'll stop now. 

Thanks for reading this far.

688,Its dangerous to go to /r/outside alone! Take this!,"Preface: This was created for another redditor after reading her post to /r/anxiety and realizing that sometimes we could do with some tips & tricks to try out.
The following is my personal mantra that I use to make it through each day.  

I often find that I have an initial trigger of anxiety (eg unpaid bill) and then my anxiety increases when I feel anxious about my feeling anxious! (If that makes sense!)

I struggled for several years trying to keep it all inside, and had a mental breakdown. It took several months, but I followed a couple of steps incrementally to reduce the amount of daily anxiety I feel.       

1. 1) Take whatever medication you have to. Tell myself that taking medication for mental health is the same as taking anti-biotics for a bad flu, sometimes the human body needs a little help.  

2. 2) Try to do some form of exercise every day, the minimum being a 30 min walk first thing in the morning. Accomplishing something I feel important at the start of my day really helps boost my day!  

3. 3) As much as humanly possible, eat homemade and sleep 6-7 hours minimum per day. Everything I eat has a noticeable impact on my mood, with junk food being the fastest way to lead to bad feelings and upset stomach. /r/slowcooking has honestly changed my life, so many easy great meals. I need all the help I can get to perform at my best.


4. 4) Accept that progress is incremental, and try to focus day by day. Yes, planning long term is great, but (for me) it leads to overthinking constantly. Focus on the daily habits and skills I want to develop, every day. If its important to me, its a daily habit!

5. 5) I cannot control everything. Sometimes, things don't work out the way we want them to. I try to look at what I did, what I could have done, make a note of any changes I want to make and MOVE ON!! I personally struggle with this, but nobody can be be perfect all of the time. Sitting in my room stewing about the mistakes I have made will not help anyone, least of all myself.

6. 6) Take a big slow breath in from your nose, try to expand your tummy. Slowing exhale from your mouth. Slowly & deliberately repeat. Just focus on the breaths. I mildly hyperventilate when becoming anxious, and this really helps calm me down. 

7. 7) Talk to someone. Parents, good friends, SO, doctor, psychiatrist, cat, dog, anyone who you feel you can talk with. At my worst I would take a walk in the evening after work and quietly talk to myself about what I was feeling and just verbalize the panic/fear/anger. Long term I would suggest talking to a mental health professional, who can give you the tools to help shore up the hole we all dig. And be persistent! It took me 3-4 different psychiatrists before I found someone who I really connected with, and able to call me up on my bullshit and help keep me on track/ recover and keep going. Thats over the course of a year! And it honestly made so much difference to my ability to help myself.

Thats my little set of rules I try to keep to. I struggle and forget and ignore them, but each time I have felt less anxious, its due to these rules. 

Also, the majority of these rules are personalized versions of rules found in this [book](http://www.amazon.com/Anxiety-Phobia-Workbook-Edmund-Bourne/dp/1626252157/ref=dp_ob_title_bk). Its my bible, and I think after posting this I will go re-read a few pages.

Also the [/r/Anxiety/wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/wiki/faq) has tons of great links to resources!

If you have any little rules of your own, please share below and help each other out!

Hope this helps.

693,Anyone else scared of the responsibilities of adulthood?,"A little background:  I'm married, about to turn 29, and I'm a college graduate who works in a small firm as an investment advisor.  

On the surface, I look like a typical late 20s, decently put together guy.  However, I don't feel that way.  My wife an I are looking to buy a house, and I'm petrified of the financial commitment.  I make around $50K per year, and my wife makes around half that, and she has student loan debt of almost $50K.  I just look at all of these financial hurdles in life, and I feel totally overwhelmed.  We're saving a bit where we are now, but I'm almost too scared to do a detailed budget.  My wife and I talked about cutting back on some superfluous things (i.e. how much we go out to eat, etc).  We have $70K in savings, which I know is pretty decent, but I'm still scared all the time.

I think it comes down to low self-esteem, but I'm not sure.  I feel inadequate at my job, even though no one else says so or even seems to think so.  I'm always trying to be the best husband possible to my wife.  I've never thought of myself as someone with confidence problems.  In school, I was always outgoing and well-liked.  These feelings of doubt have only implanted themselves in my adulthood.  I feel like I should be better, I feel like I should be farther along.  I'm terrified of failing at anything.

I guess the moral of the story is, everyone talks about how well I'm doing and that I'm going to be and am capable of being very successful.  I just don't believe them.

696,New Husband (33) has anxiety. Help!,"Hi people of anxiety.

My husbands anxiety has been really peaking lately, and it's getting very hard for me to be patient and kind.

I feel deceived... We were long distance for nearly 2 years. And we have been married for six months. I don't think he intentionally his the extent of his anxiety from me, but he definitely didn't tell me.

Stuff that spikes his anxiety ( he's pretty much at a 3 all the time but this can take it up to a 9- 10):
 Going to to grocery store.
Speaking and getting texts from his family.
Paying bills ( we have plenty of money)
Taking the dog for a walk 
Me watching tv
Me closing doors in a certain way
Me making plans ( he feels like he has been locked into an obligation) 
Me asking him to do a chore ( I really don't understand this)
Social events
Crowds
Heat/uncomfortable feelings
Shopping for clothes 
Any comment of his appearance ( hey could you shave?)

At the moment I try my best to not do any of these things.
I pay the bills, I shop, I stay inside with him and don't plan things on weekends, etc.

But it's getting really hard to be so understanding. I want to help but when I ask he's like ""I don't know if anything helps."" And ""it feels all so hard"" 
This is over the conversation that our friends would like to see us, ( they know and make accommodations for his anxiety). Not even the event itself, the conversation! And it seems there are more and more things that get added to the list that trigger these spikes.

I'm trying to get help for him (dr and therapist) but I need some help too.
Any suggestions?

698,Scared shitless of my wisdom teeth surgery tomorrow.Could Lorazepam help sufficiently with my anxiety? (x-post from r/Advice),"I will get my impacted wisdom teeth removed surgically tomorrow. Unfortunately, in Austria it is very uncommon for oral surgeons to offer sedation (neither N2O nor any other drug, just local anesthesia), the only option for people with anxiety that is offered is general anaesthesia, which is not covered by insurance and is extremely expensive.

I am scared shitless and I could ask my doc for Lorazepam to calm down a bit tomorrow. But I'm worried that it won't be sufficient to prevent myself from being completely alert and having to hear all these awful noises, including the cracking, bleeding, pulling and the bone saw...Jesus Christ, I'm gonna shit my pants tomorrow.

NOTE: My surgeon said that the intake of benzodiazepines is not a problem for the surgery, so it's my choice to take them or not.

EDIT: *You guys helped me so much with my fear. It really feels so good to get so much support and so many kind words. You people are great. Going to sleep now, my surgery is in 10 hours. Got some Lorazepam and I'll go for it.*


EDIT2: Back from my first surgery (next week the next 2 teeth will be removed). It was ok, the noises are indeed awful, the only painful thing are the sinjections. Other than that, it went really fast and the nurse was holding and stroking my hand (me beind a 23 year old big baby haha.

713,Quitting caffeine,"Hi everyone,


I posted awhile back on here about quitting caffeine and I did it.  I was a daily coffee drinker, couldn't miss a day - quite addicted. I quit cold turkey and it has been somewhere around 3+ months now.  I wanted to give you all my experience with this as it relates to my anxiety.  First of all, I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember.  Since quitting caffeine, my anxiety levels have gone down tremendously.  Also, I have had sleep problems for years- mostly would have trouble falling asleep; it would take me nearly an hour to finally fall asleep and during that hour I would have racing thoughts and feel as though I couldn't ""turn my mind off"".  Now, I lay down at night, and I'm asleep within 15 minutes... and those racing thoughts? Gone.  I never thought that caffeine could be so incredibly impactful on my daily life- and I had never really thought it was the caffeine triggering my issues.  I thought ""oh, it's just caffeine - it's legal, that's not a significant reason for any of my anxiety issues""... wrong.  I am so glad I have figured out one of the main triggers for my anxiety after all this time.  I only wish I had quit much sooner.


Also, as an experiment, on Friday I had a regular latte (yes, caffeinated).  Two hours after it, I was sweaty and nervous.  That wore off, but when I went to bed Friday night I could NOT fall asleep for about an hour+ and had the racing thoughts problem.  Coincidence?  I don't think so.


Anyway, what I hope you all will take away from this is that if you are taking in caffeine on a regular basis, please please try to take it out of your system completely.  Yes, it is hard.  Caffeine is an addictive drug, and you will feel bad for quite a few weeks before you start feeling better; but, the anxiety (for me) started dissipating within about a week and a half of quitting.",26,2015-11-22 20:35:47 EST-0500

726,If you're having a bad day,"Hey.

I know it's hard. I know it's exhausting and seems like you're never going to really feel okay. Anxiety can just be this constant, terrible feeling that something in life is fundamentally wrong. You're so tired of being afraid, of constantly thinking and worrying and never just waking up to feel completely sure that you can handle this day like other people do.

But you are okay. Life is fucking weird and difficult. I know you might not realize it, but everyone is afraid of something. Even those people who seem to really know what they're doing. Think of all your favorite people. Do you think they always feel normal? And during the times they don't, aren't they still valuable, important, beautiful people? Like you?

I don't know exactly what your fear is. But no matter what, you are not alone. I know it sucks, but I hope that a year from now, you look back at this time and think of how proud you are of getting through it. Whether you still feel this way in the future or not, just remember that you will have good days too. And the good days are what really matter. Happiness isn't the lie, anxiety is.",24,2015-05-11 14:26:14 EDT-0400
727,"If you're thinking that you're wanting to quit your medication cold turkey, don't.","Alright so here is the deal friends. I've been on some anti-anxiety medications for a few years. A few months ago I had been feeling pretty good. I was at the point where I was just kind of tired of taking meds every morning, and thought that I could get it over with by cutting it off cold turkey, and getting over the side effects. 

I mean, they couldn't be that bad right? Just a day or so of feeling a little bad, then it would pass. Totally doable right? Nope.

That was probably one of the worst decisions I had ever made in my life. For about a week I was constantly dizzy, had nausea, diarrhea, head was constantly spinning and had motion sickness. Any time I stood up I thought I was going to fall down and throw up. Extreme paranoia set in which made everything worse. I was an absolute trainwreck of a human being. A blob on the floor too afraid to move or do anything. 

After about 2 weeks and feeling like the pain would never end, I caved and went back to taking my meds. Eventually I ended up going back to my doctor and now we are in the process of having me weaned off of them instead, which is a much more pleasant experience.

So just a heads up people. If your taking anxiety meds, for the love of god don't quit them cold turkey ",44,2015-05-08 19:13:35 EDT-0400
728,Something I wrote for my husband to help him understand my anxiety,"This is what it is like for me just about every day….

I am walking down a nice lovely little path, which I walk down the same every day. When suddenly there is a small bump in the road. Most people may think “So what?” or not even notice it. Others may notice and wonder or even worry “Hey why is there a bump there? Someone may trip.” but they continue to walk on letting it be forgotten easily.

Instead I panic. “Why is there a bump here suddenly? Where did it come from? What does this mean?”  Alarms start going off. I worry. I freak out. The fire alarm was suddenly pulled; warnings are being thrown around in my head like fireworks exploding. I compare it to chicken little, the sky is falling, the absolute worst is about to happen.

Of course that makes no sense. I do not purposefully jump to the absolute worst conclusion. I’d much rather let it go like everyone else and be quite content. My mind doesn’t work that way, it doesn’t let me just let it go so easily. All of those alarms FEEL 100% real. My mind and even my body are telling me that the world is ending and I should panic, that I should be scared. I have a tricky fight or flight switch and that thing keeps getting hit to on. 


It can be difficult to understand because obviously you can see that it is just a little bump and nothing to be worried over, or at least not as worried as I am. You try to use reason; you try to say “Hey calm down it is nothing”. But that doesn’t just *poof* make everything better. It doesn’t turn off those alarms. It is as if I see a giant spider that no one else can see, and I am terrified of spiders. Sure tell me it isn’t there but my eyes are telling me it is.


What is worse is that I partially do agree with you. I have a little quiet whisper of a voice who speaks up from the back; “Hey there, the sky really is not falling. The world isn’t going to end. Everything will be ok.” I can use reason and logic and tell myself there is nothing to worry about. There is no giant spider because that is absurd. But really try telling yourself that when you can obviously see it right in front of you. It is a pretty big argument to have with yourself. I am not saying it is impossible.  Some days I can talk myself down but it is a real struggle. 


For every little whisper telling me not to worry there is a million other voices pointing out why I should worry. They are not a little whisper either. They scream. They shout. They make a huge fuss that is hard to drown out. They tell me that yes indeed the sky is falling. The world is going to end. It is more than likely my fault. I must be stupid. I am definitely a horrible excuse for a human. The universe is out to get me. Everything just goes so wrong. Why do I even bother? Why do I even try? And honestly they often make very good points that are easy to be swept up by. You know this has happened before….because it has or something similar had. So why shouldn’t I believe it isn’t happening now, again? Or they tell me that I am horrible and undeserving and no one likes me and brings up a million reasons to support this. Every little flaw, every stupid thing I have done, every mistake. They make a nice little link of cause and effect, because if abc happens then it is going to lead to xyz.
 It all makes sense at the time. I have fireworks & alarms going off in my head, fighting amongst myself. I am in full panic mode. It is so much to take in at that moment. It is scary.


So when things go wrong, when there is a kink in my schedule or my plans it sends me into a panic. So if for some reason I miss my favorite show because of something you did, then that must mean that you hate me. You obviously do not care about me or my feelings. And I have to wonder what I did wrong? Why am I such a horrible wife? Are you going to leave me? I am going to be all alone. I am all alone. I am sad and lonely and miserable and just want to die. 


It is dark and scary and spirals out of control so quickly.
I remember once my mom’s schedule got messed up and I was going to have to go into work hours early. I freaked out and people acted like I was selfish and a horrible person. But for me it was completely terrifying. My comfort got shaken up. I was going to have to go to work early and just hang out and wait. People who worked with me might see me and wonder what I am doing. They might think I am weird or judge me somehow. What would I do just waiting? I would be bored. My mind would wonder which would equal even more bad thoughts and panicking. 


It seems silly. I know that. People would just say, don’t worry about what others are thinking. But I just don’t have a switch to turn my crazy mind on and off. I constantly worry over everything. I try so hard not to. To tell myself everything will be ok or just wait it out. But the voices in my head just don’t shut up. I have to constantly fight with myself. It is so tiring and so hard.


Just imagine if someone followed you around 24/7 and told you how horrible you were. They brought up every mistake you have ever made, reminded you of every embarrassing idiotic thing. Whenever anything happened they would try their best to make you believe the worst was about to happen and that it was your fault. That is how I feel.

737,Does anyone else have strictly school/pressure-related anxiety attacks? Would just like to turn to someone.,"I've caved and I'm finally acknowledging that my shaking/sweatiness/heart palpitations are actually not normal when I check my grades, think about my grades, or take an exam. I know people, to some degree, get nervous when doing any of the three. I'm just now acknowledging that my reaction is ""too far."" I need help. 

Long story short, I broke down from school. The pressure to do well was too great. I wasn't doing that well. It became a cycle, and I fell to the pressure and went through depression when I failed my first exam. Perhaps it is over-dramatic (as someone else said) ...but I had to see a therapist regardless. My grades have tanked incredibly since then. I had a 3.4, and it is now going to be a 3.0. I get anxiety attacks during the exam when I feel unconfident. When I know I'm on the cusp of a A/B or even B/C, I realize how important this test is, the pressure builds up, and I have a very low-key panic attack - My thoughts are cloudy, I'm sweating, my heart is beating, and I'm on the verge of tears. 

Sometimes it doesn't happen. I can pull high As on exams. I was doing well in one class. Then, I was underprepared for one exam, and I panicked. I got a 55. Now I'm fighting to just get a B in that class and I'm hurting myself over my lost grade I was doing so well in. 

This is happening in all my classes. I thought it was normal, but I really cannot stay calm anymore when I think about grades, pressure, and the future. 

Sorry for the small rant. I just wanted to turn to someone who may have gone through the same thing. I'm trying to think of what I'm going to do next. Probably therapy? But do I want to take medication? Would I have to even take any? Can I avoid it? Who do I go to? I'm thinking through all of this right now. 

Oh, and grad school. Almost broke down when I realized my anxiety is literally destroying my grades and I might not get into grad school anymore.

738,Does anyone else use suicidal ideation to calm down or am I just a total weirdo? [Trigger Warning],"To be clear, I haven't been actively suicidal/serious about suicide since childhood. I've been struggling with anxiety, OCD, and depression as of late, but it's by no means unbearable. Yet, I do use suicidal ideation to relax/calm myself down after a really stressful episode of panic and/or during the depression that often follows. 

Back when I was actively suicidal, the real appeal was the perceived relief that would follow death. But even just *imagining* myself preparing to comitt suicide, planning out the details of my death, writing the goodbye notes in my head, imaging the funeral and all my loved ones' responses...for some reason, this gives me a very peaceful, temporary sense of relief and for a few brief minutes, I feel like I am free of all my problems, anxieties, and worries. I have a good cry over my imagined suicide--maybe with some sad music on--and after that, I feel refreshed in mind and soul, ready to take on the world once more. I've never talked to anybody about this coping mechanism--not even my bf or counselor--because I am afraid someone will think I am *actually* suicidal when I'm not. I am just using the fantasy to gain some relief.

Just wondering if anyone else does this or if I am a total weirdo? :/",25,2015-05-13 20:33:08 EDT-0400

750,For those of us whose anxiety never gets better no matter how many times we try to “face our fears”...,"So does anyone else struggle with the advice to “face your fears/anxieties because once you actually experience them, you’ll realize that it isn’t so bad? And it’ll get easier!” Because whenever I try to do this, it actually *is that bad*. And it never gets easier for me. This pretty much applied to me all through schooling, like I had a lot of anxiety about tests but I took them anyway and did well, yet the tests never got any easier. I used to work part time in food service, and it was the worst thing ever and I dreaded every day going in just as much as the first day (actually the first day was the easiest because I didn’t know what to expect). Or even something as small as posting on reddit. Okay, yeah, I’m super anxious about making this post. I’m super anxious every time I post or comment. And no matter how many times I post, that anxiety is just as strong as the first time.

My therapist told me something useful about this today that I wanted to share with the rest of you if you have a similar problem as I do. Like, anxiety about stuff you haven’t experienced before is normal. Usually, when people experience it, they then notice that it’s not so bad, and then next time, they’re not as anxious. This is why for people without anxiety disorders, telling them to “face their fears!!” can be helpful.

But when you face that anxiety over and over and it never gets any easier, it kind of becomes a problem. Our problem. And we suffer for it, and people without anxiety don’t understand us and get confused. Which is why a lot of anxiety “advice” about “just suck it up” doesn’t work well for some people, or just makes it worse.

So, apparently the reason it never gets any easier is because we have this problem where we keep reinforcing our own anxiety. It’s not because we *want* to be anxious; heaven knows anxiety is the bane of our existence. For whatever reason, though, our brains have learned to create this go-to place to blame ourselves whenever something bad happens. Chances are, we already know we’re doing this. But our brain is a lot more powerful than we think it is, and this works in both helpful and non-helpful ways. Fortunately, we can change our brains because they’re really powerful! Unfortunately, since we’ve been used to this our whole lives, it’s going to take just as long or maybe even longer to change that train of thought.

For example, one of my go-to places is this automatic thought process that I’ve been using my whole life: I’m disappointing people. Say I go to work one day dreading it, thinking, “Oh god, I’m going to fail. I’m going to screw up, the customer is going to yell at me, my boss is going to yell at me, and I’m going to disappoint everyone. I’m going to be anxious the whole time.” So I go into work, I stand there being anxious the whole time. We get customers, I continue being anxious. I make drinks and because I’m super anxious, I forget the recipe and have to look it up. We get more customers. I’m a little slow, but otherwise okay. I get anxious about all the waiting customers. This goes on for 3 hours. I end work, feeling super relieved. Instead of thinking, “that wasn’t so bad,” I think, “Wow. That was absolutely terrible. I basically failed, I made all those customers wait, I forgot the recipe, and I’m never going to remember it. And on top of it all I just stood there with 3 hours of anxiety and it was the worst thing ever.” Or something along those lines. Even if I do try to make myself think, “that wasn’t so bad,” it’s pretty much impossible because I’m lying to myself and I know it. Okay. Phew. Even typing that out gave me horrible flashbacks to that food service job, and I’m starting to get anxious again.

This go-to place was somehow learned in childhood to deal with certain things: maybe it kept me emotionally safe from parents or siblings or whatever, but now it’s causing us a lot of grief and anxiety and is not helpful anymore. But we still use it because it’s the only thing we’ve learned. We get caught up in this spiral of negative thoughts and think either 1. We are caught in the negative thoughts and can’t do anything about them; or 2. We must resist the negative thoughts as much as possible.

The first option is kind of what we’ve been doing our whole lives, which worked up to a point where.. it didn’t work anymore. Now we’re on our own, and the good thing is, there’s no one there to to tell us, “It’s your fault, you better be sorry, look what you’ve done.” The bad thing is, when we say it ourselves, there’s no one there to tell us, “It’s okay, I forgive you, it was just an accident.” We’re just left believing that it *is* our fault and then just feeling shitty about ourselves.

The second option still leaves us at the mercy of the negative thoughts: we spend all our energy trying to resist them, and when we fail, it reinforces the first option: we’re just stuck here and can’t do anything about it. *Plus* we’re a failure for even having them in the first place, they’re all in our heads, they’re “fake”, so why is it so debilitating? And then we punish ourselves more ): (btw, anxiety is *not* fake. All your thoughts and emotions are real and valid.)

Mindfulness is something I’ve learned about hundreds of times in DBT, CBT, family therapy, etc etc. But sometimes the way it’s explained is kind of abstract and difficult to apply to real life. The bare bones of mindfulness is that it’s the skill of noticing or being aware of your own thoughts.

I guess the strategy I learned today is very similar to mindfulness. When this spiral of thoughts starts happening, instead of becoming entirely engulfed by them or struggling to resist them, try to *just notice them*. My therapist told me to try to think: “Oh, there are those negative thoughts again,” as if you’re standing on a shore, watching a raging river. Part of you might still feel like you're *in* the raging river, being swept away. But the important thing is that now a part of you is also standing on the shore, watching yourself get swept away. The first step to changing something is awareness that it’s happening.

Which sounds *a lot* easier than it is. Try to think: “There I am, getting swept away by this river of thoughts.” That in itself is like throwing a branch or a rock into the river, slowing it down just a tad bit. Try not to think about stopping it all at once, because it’s way too difficult and way too raging. After all, you’ve spent [insert your age here] years making that river faster and faster, not because you chose to, but just because of circumstances.

I’ve heard this a ton of times. I’ve *tried* this a ton of times, and kept getting discouraged when I wasn’t able to do it.

But I noticed another thing that helped me today: I get this raging river of negative thoughts *a whole heck of a lot*. Almost every time I interact with a living being, the river starts raging. That sounds familiar. Whenever I interact with living beings, I get anxiety, too. I realized, wow I have *a lot of anxiety*. It’s really shitty. My therapist has been pointing this out to me for like a year.

And right when I noticed this today, coupled with my therapist’s advice, I actually felt…a teeny bit hopeful. I noticed that, well, since it happens so much, it doesn’t matter if I succeed at noticing the river every single time. *It’s okay not to notice it every time*. The good part about having such debilitating anxiety (lol I know right) is that this raging river happens probably once every 10 minutes or more. So if you miss out on noticing it once, welp, it’s fine because it’ll probably happen again in the next 10 minutes. ಠ_ಠ

Then, I began to think of it as a game. I began to look forward to my anxiety, just a tiny bit. I told myself, every time I notice that spiral, I’m going to give myself a pat on the back, like a point or something. I’m going to try not to punish myself for having it, or to punish myself for not being able to resist it, or think: “Oh god I’m stuck here forever.” Just noticing it washing me away. (And if I *do* start punishing myself, then there’s just another opportunity to notice it happening.)

Even if you’re on the shore for only a fraction of a second, and then you’re back in that river; that fraction of a second is still a million times better than not noticing it at all.

Where we go from here, I have no idea. Changing something only works if you do it a single step at a time. And our brains are super powerful, so however old you are (I’m 21) is how long you’ve been dealing and suffering with this anxiety, which is a long fucking time. And we need patience to be able to change a thought process that has been our automatic go-to place for decades. And I’m not even sure if I’ll be able to do it, or if it’ll even work or not. Heck, I only came to this mini-realization today, and I’ve only been practicing it for… *checks watch* like an hour and a half.

But this is the first time I’ve felt hopeful for anything in a while. This is the first time I’ve actually *looked forward* to “facing my anxieties”. Because this, to me, is not really “facing them head-on” like what we assume people without anxiety disorders must do. Well, we have this disorder, and it sucks, but we have to take a different approach. And that approach starts with just experiencing the anxiety and being aware of it. Being kind and compassionate to ourselves and giving ourselves a lot of opportunities to mess up or fudge it, which is completely okay. Because every time I experience anxiety, aka the coursing river, even though it’s fucking horrible and makes me want to crawl into my bed and hide, it’s also another opportunity to notice the internal thought process that’s reinforcing it.

My disclaimer here is that for some unknown reason, I feel fucking good today. Tomorrow I might wake up feeling like complete shit and not wanting to interact with people, or apply to jobs, or think about the future, or do any of the million things that give me anxiety.

But, hey, I’ll probably punish myself (as usual) (: And then I’ll be able to notice me punishing myself, and then cheer myself on for noticing that. Which is different than trying to swim against the current and resist and struggle against my anxiety all in vain. This is what I’ve always been trying to do, and failing at it, and making things worse. Now with what I’ve learned today, I can try stepping out, watching my anxiety happen, and taking the path on the shore instead.",24,2015-11-17 20:37:58 EST-0500

761,Cant take this anymore,"Rant incoming.

Im done with this shit. 
Im done laying awake every night till 4 am and waking up at 8 covered in sweat. Im done getting sick from appointments.  Im done getting sick if I need to travel. Im so fucking done.

I cant even visit my girlfriend who lives 45 mins away, and I cant handle a job.


I have a dentist appointment coming up and its killing me. Even if I try to relax is bouncing in the back of my head making sure that I keep getting ill. And the worst is the nights.



God I hate the nights. Laying awake with a feeling to puke every second. In the dark with eyes wide open feeling like complete shit.


It ruins me, it ruined friendships and its ruining my health. I cant even feel when I have to eat again and i cant imagine the feeling because of the stress and anxiety that follows.



Tbh something im ashamed of is that even when I get intimate with my girlfriend I get the flirty feeling in my stomach, but in turn that makes me ill too. My head spins everytime it happens and I get desperate for solutions in this situation. Im honestly walking with that one thought in my head to just end this shit. End the contact with everyone and just finish it off. Its also not a thought that comes just one or two times. Its spooking thro my head and it scares me but also comforts me.

Been to a doctor. Its stress,I gotta relax. I just cant. It kills me from the inside and I cant keep up anymore. Everything is failing. Im a dropout, cant get a job, canteven get my dick up and more. Its a neverending negative spiral and I cant seem to get grip on it.


Go outside they say, go do stuff. I cant walk outside without feeling judged by everyone, without me feeling sicker every step. Its a goddamn struggle. Im a man but fuck me im crying like a bitch these last few months.

Im fucking 20 why the fuck did I deserve this. I have no family to turn towards too. (People with Autism werent accepted apparently) and the few friends I got are also miserable fuckups who wont help me in anyway because they have their own shit.

Im just sitting here for the last two years playing games and fighting anxiety attacks that are caused by the most stupid shit. Please someone tell me im not alone. Im really thro with this. I cant do it anymore.


Edit: thanks everyone for the responces. This is more then I wished for and im glad yall have solutions for me. Today is another day and imma start fighting again.",19,2015-11-15 02:10:54 EST-0500
762,Here's a list of everything that made a huge impact on my anxiety. Hope this helps!,"Hey guys! Ok so I've had issues with anxiety for a while, and until recently its been a 24/7 thing for me. I just wanted to share what helped me out recently because if I knew these things earlier, I would have prevented a large chunk of my anxiety.

**The first 2 are cliche, but they need to be brought up**

**1)** Meditation really was the first thing that got me to calm down. It was the first thing that got me to breathe normally, and it finally gave me SOMETHING to do to shut down at least part of my anxiety. Cant stress this enough.

**2)** Seeing a therapist that **SPECIALIZES** in what my issues changed everything and sped up the whole process. If you have issues with addiction, abuse, whatever, it helps sooooooooooo much when you can speak with someone that actually knows about that specific problem. When they are specialized they know patterns, symptoms and thoughts associated with the topic, and they have real experience with the topic. I mean, they actually see people with your exact problems on a DAILY basis. Now I dont want to say that this is necessary, but my problems were VERY specific, and seeing a specialist helped a bunch. (you might be surprised how specific some therapists specializations are). But most importantly, find a therapist that youre comfortable with. I actually look forward to therapy because my therapist's optimism is so contagious that it gets me leaving session with a smile on my face.

**Here are the weird suggestions that you probably haven't heard of**

**3)** Go to a doctor if you have putting off stressful medical checkups. I know this might sound like a no-brainer, but the apathy that comes from depression paired with the paranoia that comes from anxiety, paired with poverty, can keep a person from checking out some scary shit. I say this from personal experience. I kept thinking that i was being a hypochondriac, so i kept avoiding medical check ups and this turned into me being waaaaay more anxious than I was aware of. I actually got used to the nervous feeling, so I just went about my day, being constantly stressed out. I didnt even realize how much i was stressing out until left my first appointment and felt this huge sense of relief. Then the benefits started to snowball and i actually started to lose a lot of my anxiety. Also, if youre broke like me, you might be surprised to see how much obamacare can cover. I havent paid a dime for blood tests, xrays, , prescriptions, and even MRIs. Check it out ASAP.

**4)** Probiotics: So i tried posting about this a while back and i got a weak response, but basically I chug 2 cups of Kefir when im nervous and it calms be down quite a bit; sometimes to the point where I have cancelled plans to call a friend of family member to tlk about my enxiety. On a realllly bad day, ill actually race to the grocery store and buy some. It still does the trick to this day. if you want to try it out, just drink it in the morning before you eat and let it do its work. You arent supposed to drink if after eating, but ive done it regardless and it has helped a bunch. It actually makes me FEEL calm, rather that feel less anxious.

**5) This one is time sensitive and it really depends on where you are at with your mental health. I dont think everyone should do this, but if therapy has made you comfotable with your depressive or anxious thoughts, then you should try this out. TO CLARIFY: This is not a healthy suggestion if you still experiencing continuous thoughts of self harm because sometimes it is good to stay distracted.** 

Internet: I had to stop hours of impulsively going on the internet. It had my mind racing, and because of reddit, i was spending a long portions of my daying thinking intensly and constantly reading about international news. I know this might sound obvious but I dont think our brain is deisgned to look at post after post after post of ISIS, global warming, etc. I also think it isnt designed to experience hours of cats posts, funny videos, and comment section debates. It really takes a toll and it prevents you from calming down. Now I dont think everyone has this problem, but if you do feel like you IMPULSIVELY go on reddit for hours at a time just  this can really make an impact. Try just sitting down with out tv or internet and just let your thoughts go loose. Trying this out calmed me down a ton. It is important to note that I can only do this now because my depression has calmed down enough to where I can enjoy my own thoughts, rather than be stressed out by them. My brain fog has also gotten a lot better.

**6)** This last one is kind of silly but I noticed that looking at artbooks when im anxious helps. It feels like it gives my thoughts a place to go and it really helps when im thinking a mile a sec because now I have something that I can analyze and it gives me a safe place to think.  Now this might just work for me, but it actually does the trick and it actually calms me down enough to the point where I end taking a nap lol.

Anyways so thats the list. Hope some of this helps someone!

TL;DR
1) Meditation
2) Seeing a therapist that specializes in your situation
3) Go through with delayed doctors visits
4) Probiotics
5) (Can't TLDR due to disclaimer)
6) Artbooks

774,Overwhelming fear about going to a concert after Paris attacks.,"So I won tickets to see one of my husband's favorite bands tonight. I was so excited, until yesterday. Now I'm completely losing it. I'm not sure I can do it. I have OCD and I've been having horrible intrusive thoughts. Flashes of carnage,  except not in Paris, but involving people I know at the concert tonight. I've tried justifying it; it's a small venue, I live in the deep south, it's a small state that is not diverse, the chance of ISIS members being at this concert is small, but I just can't shake this feeling. 

I guess I just wanted to share that. I'm trying not to let my anxiety and OCD get in the way of doing things I want, but it's really hard. I also feel obscene for going and having a good time while so much of the world is in mourning.",15,2015-11-14 21:49:26 EST-0500

779,"DAE feels like their current life is so messy and filled with tons of tiny mistakes, so they want to abandon it all and start fresh for a perfect one?","I sometimes feel like that, even though I have a pretty comfortable life. Good job, happy marriage, healthy self and family, enough money to get by every month, cute pets, etc. Nothing can be perfect, because we're all humans, I know that.

But I can't help myself sometimes, I think there are too many small mistakes that takes away the perfection from a lot of things. Past arguments, wasted money, wrong decisions, broken hearts... I dwell on them a lot. I constantly ruminate. They're all in the past, but when I stop to think about even one of them, I feel like a total failure and want to start fresh. I can usually calm myself down and seperate anxious thoughts from my real feelings, but when I'm down, I'm *reaaaallly* down.

781,"There are moments of panic that you can work through, and then there's the deep, aching anxiety that don't go away.","I've had anxiety my whole life. I learned what the word ""anxiety"" meant when I was diagnosed with ""severe anxiety"" at age 7. I was on antidepressants when I was 11. I stopped seeking mental health care when I was 16 because I was going through a major life change and we thought it was getting better (surprise! it didn't). I'm 20 now and we're working on getting me back into it but it's taking time to find somewhere that can accommodate my insurance and scheduling needs. 

I do alright (not great, just alright) with situational things. If I'm afraid of making a phone call or using the oven, I'll be upset, but eventually the need to do that thing will go away. 

Then... There's the stuff that doesn't arise normally. It's the low, drumming ache of anxiety that follows me around and knocks me out. This is what I can't manage or work through because there is no specific thing it affects. I get upset over the past or worried about the future or angry that I am who I am and you don't just get over that. 

The only thing that helps with those feelings is having my boyfriend around, and I can't keep him around all the time.

787,I just met the kind of person I want to be,"This guy was really nice.  He was cheery.  He had a genuine smile that never left his face.  He just had a real positive energy about him.  And everything he said was affirmative, thankful...geez, here I go and we probably only talked for like a minute.  But he made an impression.  

That's what I want to do.  He also just kept talking.  I might never be that chatty.  I'm never going to be exactly like this guy, I know that.  But there were aspects of his character which I admire and I'd like to emulate.  I think because I've been so sad and depressed for so long it's seeped into every aspect of my persona and people can't help but be put off by that.  Nobody really seems to want to be around someone when they're be negative all the time.  But if you're hurting really badly and you don't know how to express it in a healthy manor it only gets worse and the problem exacerbates itself.  But if you can break the cycle by being positive and outgoing (even when you want to be sad or anxious), I think you might get better results. 

I won't ever be a social butterfly, and that makes me happy actually.  But I can still be a social being and put my best effort into everything I do.  That's what you have to do...this is going to be hard.  Thanks for reading!  I hope you discover good things about the people around you too that you can make a part of yourself.

When I get stressed out my head starts to kind of ache sporadically in different places at random (this happened before when I was recovering from a concussion and was equally as stressed). I immediately start assuming it's some form of cancer or tumor. 

Also those medical problems I talked about. Turns out one of my spinal disks has become misaligned and I have to see a neurosurgeon and get an MRI to see if I need physical therapy or surgery. Now my mind is racing thinking what if I have a tumor there, or in both my head and back?! This in turn is making my head feel worse.

Ive had a massive turn around in my outlook (from negative to positive) towards my condition. I can already feel that things are improving and are only going to get better. 

CBT has given me a more helpfull way of analysing everyday situations. Jogging has reduced my baseline anxiety enough so that I can manage my anxiety in situations where it is provoked. There is still a long road to recovery but this is the best I have ever felt in my life.

799,Speech classes may as well be one of the circles of hell.,"I just needed to vent a little before I attempt to not humiliate myself in 8 hours. We have to give our first speech of the semester tomorrow and it isn't looking like it'll end well.

My social anxiety can be really intense. When I was in high school I literally bolted out of the classroom several times when I'd attempt a presentation. I'm better than that now, and was able to give several presentations in a in a psych class a few semesters ago ***but*** that was because we could simply read our entire speeches or presentations.

I can't do that for this class though; all we get is one page worth of notes we can bring up with us. And when I get in front of a crowd I literally can't think. At all. The only thing I'm able to do is read. I actually couldn't even practice my speech in front of myself. No matter how many times I tried I'd get about 5-10 seconds and totally freeze. And that was with no audience at all! I'm going to be taking copious amounts of Ativan beforehand (more than I've ever taken before) but even that I don't trust will take the edge off enough.

I'll probably have to stop shortly through my speech and say that I can't continue or I'll have a panic attack.  Which will leave me with a horrible horrible grade. Maybe I'll be so drugged up that I'll hardly remember embarrassing myself which would be a small silver lining. I actually took a small amount of Ativan tonight to help me be able to practice my speech but I still wasn't able to do it. It did loosen me up enough to post on here though...

UPDATE: My speech went well! The actually speech wasn't  the best because it was 3-4 speech about myself. I couldn't even get to a lot of my points because I was running out of time. So it seemed a bit disorganized and rushed.

But I did it with confidence! I stood up and looked around the room and felt 0 nervousness looking at all my classmates. That's the biggest thing my Ativan does, it makes me not anxious about being in front of so many people. I can then get up and speak like I'm having a regular conversation

808,When something seems to be going okay... my anxiety will jump from that issue to another issue that's unresolved... anyone else deal with this?,"So, I used to have huge anxiety issues about being able to find a job and support myself. I've gotten a few temp jobs and recently a perm one (but who knows.. stuff could change).. I guess the point is that I feel more or less not as anxious over this as I was 6 months ago.

But.. I noticed my anxiety just... leaps to some other issue that I have, if what it attached itself to is no longer adequate. Now, I suddenly start feeling tense and worried during the mid afternoon about another totally unrelated issue I tend to worry over.

It's just an absolutely shitty horrible feeling. It's like there's no fucking escape. Even if one area turns out to maaaaaybe be.. okay.. it just fucking HOPS back to some other area to fuck me up there.

Just. it's so frustrating. I just needed to vent. And the stupid funny thing is that I know if this job goes south and I go back to searching for work, my anxiety will probably just jump back to that insecurity! ",19,2015-07-14 04:35:16 EDT-0400

815,Simple fix I've found for anxiety,"Hi I'm a long time lurker or Reddit and a long-term sufferer of anxiety. The first step is to educate yourself on what anxiety is caused by and then how you can deal with **your body**


I have found only just recently that learning to control your breathing and completely filling your lungs slowly through your nose and then exhaling slowly throughout either your nose or mouth. 


Keep in mind that you must breathe slowly and not force your lungs to intake or let out more or less air than they need, just find the sweet spot. I believe focusing and trying to maintain this breathing pattern during a panic attack or general anxiety gives your body a chance to regulate its O2 thus regulating heartbeat and blood flow to your brain and body.


It may not be easy at first but please believe that it will be okay and give itbthe time it needs and if you just keep trying to maintain that beathing pattern.


If it helps, sing it in your head like how Dory from Finding Nemo sings-

Just keep swimming
just keep swimming
just keep swimming swimming swimming
what do you do you swim swim swim."" 

A few things that I read that gave me some insight:

-[1](http://www.helpguide.org/articles/anxiety/panic-attacks-and-panic-disorders.htm)

-[2](http://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/panic-disorder-agoraphobia/symptoms)

-[3](http://www.anxietycoach.com/causes-panic-attacks.html) This one really helped me

-[4](http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/coping-with-anxiety)


Now the reason I made this post was to just share some already widely known information. I really believe that learning to breathe properly again gives your mind the chance to think for itself instead of being stuck. If I could even help one person out and change how they view their body and their overwhelming anxiety. 


The biggest problem I am faced with is the general publics understanding of, and many other mental disorders,  is that people remain ignorant and lack the understanding or empathy for the people who just don't get it because they never knew how to control it. The worst thing is that the general media plays it off as a breakdown or a meltdown and that can really mess with the way people think about it if they don't really know. The hardest thing to do is to help yourself when you're not thinking clearly, so stay safe, stay hydrated, keep eating, keep breathing, and kids.. don't do drugs.

816,Best way I have found to calm down,"The trick is you need to zone out and regain situational awareness and control.

1) Take a deep breath

2) Drink a small glass of milk (I get heart burn with anxiety and this helps a lot)

3) Lay down with your head elevated

4) Place a quarter (or a pebble, sticky note, etc.) on your forehead

5) Breath slowly and focus any negative feeling and pain on the quarter

6) When you feel like all of it has gone to the quarter, remove it from your head.

7) Slowly return to the day

This works by taking the focus away from what is causing the anxiety and allowing you to cool your head to think straight again. It doesn't always work, but it is a nice way to calm down.",6,2015-07-10 19:49:55 EDT-0400
817,Fuck this shitty feeling. Fuck being me.,"I have always been an introvert/socially inept and have anxiety but I could actually talk and make some friends. In the last 3-4 years, after a significant breakup, it has gotten way worse. I have made 0 friends and haven't had a serious girlfriend and the mild depression i have has turned into a struggle too keep out of my head. I long for a long term relationship and feel lonely as fuck but my social skills have completely disappeared. My social anxiety got worse as a result, to the point where I have dreams of people rejecting/judging the fuck out of me. I'm a hermit compared even to what I used to be socially. Recently (about 6 months ago) I got pissed at my self for being a bitch about this whole thing and made an attempt to wonder out of my shell. I started talking to people but made an effort to talk to more girls as to maybe find someone I got along with and maybe turn into something serious. Fuck was I wrong. Still 0 friends and the anxiety tells me they are going to hate me before I start talking or even approach them and during the conversation I'm constantly judging myself and all the stupid shit that comes out of my mouth. I met a girl not too long ago who showed to be reciprocating; needless to say, she wasn't interested; i know this because the next day she showed up at the gym with a male friend/SO (I met her at the gym at university) something she never did for the couple months I had seen her until I worked up the courage to spend more time talking to her than the usual ""hello"" and small talk. I know it's fucked to base my worth on other people and what they may think of me but this experiences wrecked my self confidence. I can't fucking even cry anymore. I can let all this frustration/anger/sadness out of me. Fuck this FUCKTHIS FUCK THIS feeling. I can't fucking breath. There's a big knot in my throat. I just want to get the fuck out or my body and cry; just cry all this shit out. Scream, trash things just release. Somebody just fucking help.",18,2015-07-08 07:51:20 EDT-0400

820,"I've had a horrible day. Please send hugs. (really long, sorry)","So. I woke up this morning nervous. The trunk of my car was open, which may have been an accident, but it made me worried because it's a brand new car. I didn't have anything valuable in there, but my god if something happened to it, I would feel horrible. My boyfriend bought it after we sold my old neon because it was falling apart and gave me the ownership of it.

Then this afternoon I had an intake appointment to start some weekly counseling. Last time I did counseling sessions was before I was diagnosed and the student counselor didn't listen to me at all. I explained I was having panic attacks and could barely leave the house, and he just wanted to talk about my family and history instead of giving me intervention help. For today, I showed up early, filled out a form, then waited. And waited. 20 minutes after my appointment, she finally comes out, even though I filled out the paperwork 30 minutes before the appointment started so I was on time and ready. So I had the time waiting to think of every worst case scenario that could happen. She will think that I'm being dramatic, she won't believe that I have anxiety, she will tell me that the wait list will be too long and I won't be in until school starts even though I'm trying to get some tools before school starts. Well. The appointment starts, and I KNOW she was just doing her job, but I felt interrogated and that I had to do more than just explain my anxiety, I felt like I had to justify and defend it. I KNOW I was oversensitive because of being nervous and snowballing/worst case scenario freaking before the appointment. I felt like the intake counselor I had last time was much softer, more empathetic and understanding. I felt like this counselor was more like a job interview - like if she doesn't like me, I won't get counseling, even though I have 6 more sessions free with my degree. When it came time to the ""male or female counselor?"" question, I said I didn't care either way, BUT I wanted to make sure that I didn't get a student this time. I talked about it with my psychiatrist last week and he said it's totally within my right to ask for a fully registered psychologist for a counselor. Did I mention this intake counselor was an intern? As soon as I said that, it was like I offended her. She started defending the students and the need for openness with having a student counselor. I said that I understand (I'm a psych student myself hoping to go down that road!!), but I'd feel more comfortable with someone who has more hours under their belt. Then she asked me about interns instead of students. At that point I just basically said whatever and I just wanted to leave. She had to ask me if I was okay with video taping (I did it last time, it's just pointed on the counselor, only my voice is included in the tape). I told her not at this time because I think I'd be more worried about what I was saying than being honest. Well THAT was the wrong answer and she gave me a speech about how it really helps them and it doesn't make it worthwhile to have a client who refuses videotaping. I wanted to cry. Eventually I was able to leave, and I ended up in tears in my car. 

Not long after I left, I got a call from my parents saying that my grandparents' home had been broken into. They left for an hour and someone or a group of people had kicked down the door, stole several family heirlooms, my great grandmother's jewelry, the entire Swarovski crystal collection with some passed down from my great grandmother after she passed away. These figurines have HUGE history in our lives. As kids we would pick out our favourites and we would stare at them totally amazed at how beautiful they are. My grandfather's professional camera was taken. His watch. Some cash he had in his drawer. They opened my grandmother's clarinet and left it in pieces on the floor. Just absolutely heartbreaking. I ended up crying again because of my connection to many of the things as I was very close with my great grandmother, but was next in line after my grandmother to receive many of these sentimental pieces. Then I realized that their door was locked, kicked in and everything was gone within the hour that they had left the house. Someone had to have been watching their house. It's now 2:30am and I cannot sleep because I'm terrified that it could happen to me. At least 2 other instances in their area (not far from me) have been reported this week. I have dogs, which is a good thing, but that doesn't stop someone from watching your routine. I'm terrified and panicking.

If that wasn't enough, on my nightly walk with my two dogs and boyfriend, our newest rescue who had recently just had surgery to remove porcupine quills got loose of my grasp and chased a rabbit. We knew she loved them, but she had never been so aggressive with wanting to chase one before. She chased it all around the field and it was not a ""hey this is a lot of fun!"" chase, it was a ""you look like dinner"" chase. The rabbit lead her across a fairly busy road (keep in mind, it was almost 11pm when we were out and mostly dark except for street lights and she is a dark GSD/Black Lab X), where a car nearly hit her. I was a mess. I had grabbed our other dog's leash from my boyfriend immediately as she started running and he chased after her. Then I ended up kneeling in the grass, completely hyperventilating and crying because I thought I was about to lose my dog. Even now I'm getting really worked up. My boyfriend was able to tackle her finally and everyone is okay, including the bunny. Every time I start thinking about how close I was to losing this silly, amazing dog I feel like I'm going to fall apart. I spend more time with my dogs than I do any other person and they mean the world to me. They are my rocks, they calm me down when I am losing it with hugs, kisses and resting their heads on my lap. I can't imagine losing one.

I'm sorry for the long post, I guess I just needed to rant and beg for empathy. You have all been so wonderful before, I could really use you now.",14,2015-07-14 12:40:42 EDT-0400
821,"/r/Anxiety , let's have a talk. (I need to vent)","Gonna lay it out here, I am currently kind of (definitely am) a mess at this time.

I work 12s, 6pm-6am, often with little to no contact with much in the form of people. I am staffed with another individual but their social behavior varies greatly between whoevers on schedule.

My mom was diagnosed with cervical cancer last week and is bleeding out - flying home to see her tomorrow. 

Recently transitioned from military to civilian side and the culture shock sent me to the ER thinking I was having a heart (really panic) attack. Still kind of an open wound there.

I essentially wake up and am dealing with stress throughout the day, work starts and things pick up with this waxing and waning effect that comes and goes as it sees fit. I sit in my little office seat and struggle to deal. I am worried of having another panic attack. 

I was talking to my wife about divorce while separating and then she got pregnant, so I am still married and expecting. She's actually a wonderful person, I just didn't want this life with my career choices (deployments/travel)

I deploy in 2 weeks. child will be born while im gone, if my mother dies while im out of the country - I don't know if I can handle the stress. 

Not looking for pity, I understand people have it far worse in other walks of life. I just needed to get this out as I really don't have a healthy way to vent this shit. Feeling better now. Thanks for reading.",6,2015-07-12 12:27:24 EDT-0400

I'm afraid that I use anxiety and depression as a way to justify my lazy lifestyle and all the shitty terrible things about myself because at least if I have anxiety/depression there's a slight excuse for all the wacky crap I do, say, think, and feel. I also feel like some people have it way worse than I do with their mental health struggle and me trying to say I have these illnesses takes away from the weight of what they actually are and discredits them. Sometimes I come in this sub and as I read the comments and posts I start to really feel like I can relate, and then after a while I start to feel guilty for intruding on people who really suffer and struggle deeply each day. I don't know and I'm sorry and I appreciate you guys even If I don't fit in here because sometimes I don't know where else to go.

Edit: Today I got up, had a panic attack, and then laughed at myself and went and enjoyed my town's fair. I feel better today and I really appreciate everyone's thoughts. Sometimes the outside perspective is necessary when I get stuck in my own head. ",12,2015-07-11 11:50:14 EDT-0400
823,Is anxiety emasculating for anyone else?,"It bums me out. 

I feel like society in general have the belief that men can't be weak or show vulnerable emotions, be scared, etc. I'm not saying all people hold this view, because I know there's a lot of people who are understanding of it and i'm so grateful for them. 

But I can't but help to feel weak when I can't even go into stores anymore without getting panic attacks and doing the most minimal thing gives me anxiety. I'd feel like a burden to anyone I was with and like they had to take care of me. I want to be able to take care of them if they need it, be there for them. And anxiety is such a selfish illness that it makes it impossible.

I hope this didn't come off as sexist or anything. It was just mostly referring to society's view on men and how they might be deemed less attractive when they have anxiety because of the traits that come with it.

831,"I stood up for myself and won, and it feels amazing.","This story starts with the funnest of alarm calls: A knock on my door where I find our landlord who has not communicated with us at all during our tenancy, telling me that we are being evicted in 5 days unless we get rid of 3 of our cats...

This was completely heartbreaking for one, and angering for another thing and I had absolutely no idea what to do. I knew he had no legal ground to do this on such short notice, he never even gave us a warning, had he come to our door 2 weeks earlier with a warning maybe I could sympathise but he decided to give zero warning, show up at our door without any paperwork and try this bull.

We have dealt with the tenancy board more times in the last 2 years than anybody should, because we cannot seem to land anything but the worst of slumlords.

But I knew my rights, and after collecting myself and stewing for a couple of hours I opened my always handy copy of the Residential Tenancies Act and a highlighter and started my homework, I highlighted sections of our lease, and the relevant sections of the Act and marched up to the jerkoffs door. I calmly but authorititively told him ""If you want us to get rid of any of our animals then we are going to be leaving anyway, however I did want to discuss some things with you, firstly here is our lease, it specifically states that under Section 10 of the Residential Ten....blahblahblahblah""


Moral of the story? We have till the 30th to get out and we are not paying a cent of rent for this month. Even that is technically bending the law but I'll take it. We win, he loses, and I am not fucking giving up a part of our family.

My health has been gradually declining, both physically and psychologically, and I've been worried I've contracted something more serious than just anxiety making me sick.

Well, when I went in to see him, I finally said, ""I think it's time to book some blood panels later on.""

To which he replied, ""Oh, let's do it now!""

Of course, I could've freaked and jumped out the window, but the window is pretty solid glass and I didn't want to die :P So I waited and in came the phlebotomist to take care of me. She's a super cute (I'd totally date her) lady that was very, very comforting, let me rest back on the exam table and got me a pillow and everything. Finally, when she went to draw blood, she was incredibly gentle and quick. I didn't even have time to panic before she announced she was all done. She even hid the vial and syringe from me afterward (I was looking away during the procedure itself). 

So, I did it! I was squirming and super uneasy after it was over and had to rest a while, mostly because it felt like my skin was crawling from it, but I made it all day without having a full-blown panic attack, and managed to get myself actually excited to hear back about what they may have found.",13,2015-11-04 00:26:41 EST-0500

842,"walked out on a job from anxiety. need some advice, please help me!","Tonight i walked out on my job after vomiting from the anxiety of being there. i work a very high stress job where lives are constantly on the line (literally). i took the job and am in way over my head. my co-workers are terrible and seem to be bullies and i have a hard time thinking they aren't talking about me.

the job is a contract job through a staffing company. i signed up for a 20 week contract but had the option of signing up for a 13 week. i have approximately 8 weeks left on my contract. my last job of 5 years before this i got fired for faking my time card when i left without permission because of anxiety. getting this job after being fired from my last was a very good thing, especially so because i'm at a top 5 in the nation facility for my field, so it would look extremely good on my resume.

i can take this job no longer. i have panic attacks driving to work just thinking about it. i'm not sleeping well but also cannot take benzos for the anxiety while working because i'm working night shift and need to stay awake all night (12 hour shifts from 6pm-7am three days a week). since i started working nights i have switched my entire life to be nocturnal and stay up at least until 6am and sleep until 2pm or so, even on my days off. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to end my life, especially while at work. it would be *so much* easier to just sleep and never wake up. 

i have a fairly good support system and could probably get assistance with money for living should i be out of the job. best case scenario would be to never return, switch back to a regular schedule, and find another less stressful job once i'm back on my feet, so to speak.

does anybody have any suggestions about how to make this happen? could i get my psychologist or psychiatrist to say i medically cannot do this job any longer? how can i get out of this contract? i have no idea what the repercussions could be or anything. would this pretty much expunge the highlight of my resume and turn into another asterisk just like getting fired from my last job was, or could i just explain that i left due to medical reasons?

846,Was carefree. Started uni 5 weeks ago. Been full of nervousness and worry since.,"About half a week before uni, I had my first anxiety attack. For most of fresher's week I felt really shit. Things gradually got better, with a few ups and downs. I even had a couple of days where I was fine. But the past few days have been really rough. I have felt what seems to be a large adrenaline rush - often feeling on edge, feeling nauseous, panicked, heart palpitations and hot sweats. They are typically worse for the first few hours after I wake up. I went to a councillor a few weeks ago, and felt worse for a few days after. In short: when will it end?",17,2015-11-01 17:47:22 EST-0500
847,"I quit caffeine, nicotine, and Modafinil. My thoughts.","I've had anxiety for 7 years now.   I decided recently that quitting stimulants was the right thing to do.  I was chewing about 20 mg of nicotine gum and drinking 4 cups of coffee daily.  I was also self-medicating with Modafinil so I could focus at work.   Week one, I quit Modafinil.  Week two, I started tapering caffeine and nicotine.   Week three, I stopped altogether.  This is week five.

**Bad things**

I got absolutely nothing done for two weeks after I quit Modafinil.   Zero motivation.  Anyone who takes this and thinks it is not addictive is delusional.

Moodiness.  Until about a week ago, I was snapping at people and crying spontanously.

Panic attacks.   Constant for two weeks.

Headaches.   Unbearable some days.   I still have a very small headache when I wake up in the morning.

Weight gain.   I gained 15 pounds in one month.

**Good things**

Smooth ride.  I still have ups and downs but the magnitude of them seems to be getting smaller.

Sleep.  Last night I fell asleep naturally at 9 pm and stayed asleep all night, something I haven't done in months.  I wake up feeling rested.

Tolerance to stress.   I still feel panicky, but it's much less pronounced.

Motivation feels like more of a choice.  Like I can choose to do a task or choose to procrastinate.   Before, it felt like the choice had already been made for me.

Overall, I'm glad I did it.   I still have cravings every day so it takes a lot of willpower not to give in.   My mood seems to be getting a little better with every passing day and I'm slowly getting back my ability to concentrate at work.   I'm going to maintain for one more week and then focus on losing those 15 pounds.

850,A few simple suggestions my psychologist gave me that have really made a difference,"Hi friends. I recently decided to seek professional help for my anxiety and depression, and boy am I glad I did. I avoided going for many years, as I was apprehensive about being given a label or being put on medication. But yeah, therapy is nothing like I imagined, and I have noticed a big difference over only two sessions (up and down like a yoyo, but still an overall improvement).

ANYWAY. The really simple tips we've run through already:

- Buy lavender fabric softener and wash your bedding with it. Lavender is naturally calming. I'm typing away in my room and it smells like heaven in here.

- Grab some lavender oil! You can put this in your bath, and oil burner, or apply to your temples/back of neck/forehead. It's also nice to put a few drops on your pillow cases.

- Walk in the morning (6/6:30am) and walk after work/in the afternoon. WITH MUSIC. This drowns out those horrible intrusive, self destructive thoughts.

- Establish a bedtime routine. I now drink a cup of 'sleep time' tea, read and meditate (simple guided meditation - try applications Headspace and Smiling Mind). Note the best sleep you get is before 12am. I am trying to go to bed earlier, and rise earlier. 

- When you feel up to leaving the house and visiting the supermarket, stock up on super easy (but healthy) foods. Cheese, nice bread, frozen veggies, fruit, eggs, yoghurt etc.

I hope these tips help you as much as they have helped me.

852,I defeated a panic attack tonight,"My biggest fear is of something being wrong with my heart, due to a family history of heart disease. I woke up about 12:30AM with some pain in my chest. While my rational mind was saying ""it's just muscle pain,"" my irrational mind freaked out. Heart started racing, got sweaty, etc. Typical panic attack symptoms. 

I just laid in bed and did some deep breathing and mental exercises...thought about taking a Xanax to calm me down, but I wanted to stare this attack down and come out on top. 

And I did, about 30 minutes later or so. Chest pain went away, heart rate went down to close to normal, and I feel OK now. I'm wide awake - I think from all the adrenaline - but feel good otherwise. 

Being able to get control over an attack and ride it out without Xanax is s big step forward for me. ",56,2015-02-16 10:53:51 EST-0500

857,"I did something really, really fucked up and don't know how to calm myself down","I'm mostly just looking for people to talk to... I need to get this off my chest.

Last night I went to a Mardi Gras party at one of my (very new) coworkers places. Our restaurant chain is all intertwined and I know many of the people who work at the other stores. We've never hung out outside of the restaurants and I don't know them very well, but they happened to all be there last night and I wanted to make good impressions.

Well that didn't happen... I had forgotten to refill my Zoloft prescription for 3 days and finally took it two hours before the party. As some probably know, SSRIs make alcohol affect you much, much harder, and on top of that we were all drinking heavily and having a good time. 

Somewhere in the night I went dark. I wake up in my bed today, vomit on my sheets, and a missing phone. I INSTANTLY felt like something was very wrong and ran to the bathroom where I started hyperventilating. I had NO recollection of the night past a point but I had this feeling in my gut that something bad happened... And apparently I was right. 

I called up my best friend (who was there) from my house phone and she told me and I quote ""you caused a scene. You should probably apologize to some people."" I felt my blood just go cold and started crying again. She then refused to tell me anything else ""while I was being hysterical"" so I hung up and proceeded to have an hour long fucking breakdown. I couldn't move onto the bed, couldn't eat or speak, I just curled up on the ground and hated myself and cried until I gagged.

I knew I had to do damage control so when my friend (with benefits... It's a weird situation) called my house, I instantly apologized and told him I don't know what I did but I know it was bad. He told me yes, it was a shit show where I apparently tried to drag another guy into the bedroom after just hooking up with him, sobbing uncontrollably, screaming back and forth at him, and refusing to leave. He said he had to FORCE me into my coworkers car so they could take me home. 

Then, as he gets me inside my house I go sit on the floor, cuss him out, and start hitting him and biting him (explains the massive bruise on my palm). I apologized sincerely and told him that I don't know what is wrong with me, but that I'm done with alcohol for a LONG time. He told me he accepts my apology and is not upset anymore, just worried because it seemed like I was drugged. My best friend and her boyfriend who drink with me OFTEN also said they've never seen me go off the deep end quite like this (I've been known to cry), but I wasn't drugged. That would that make a nice excuse if I was, but no.

I'm not a violent or hateful person sober. I'm reserved, perpetually anxious, level headed... And I've been drinking for years! I've NEVER been an emotionally disturbed drunk until recently, with all the crying and now this. I have no idea what's going on or how to make this right with everyone. I apologized to my coworker when she brought me my phone at work, and she said ""everyone was worried... It was bad."" I won't be surprised if I'm never invited to her place again. 

My best friend had texted my mom in the middle of the night expressing concern for me and my state. Her boyfriend (also my coworker) made fun of me all night at work for it. I can't show my face in the other restaurant anymore.

Please someone tell me you did something stupid at some point too and it all got better :( my mind won't stop replaying it over and over and over ",53,2015-02-19 13:49:55 EST-0500
858,5-4-3-2-1 Exercise,"Hey, /r/Anxiety 

I'm a constant over thinker and have been for as long as I can remember.  In some aspects, it's actual very helpful, but in others it is a curse.  I just wanted to take a minute and share an exercise that was taught to me.  I've found it helps ground me in times of panic or while perseverating on a negative thought and keeps me in the current moment.  I tend to be a very practical person who has difficulty doing things like imagining peaceful scenes and the like, so this exercise with it's concrete instructions is really helpful.

I hope it's as helpful for you as it has been to me!

I learned this strategy from someone and it is really, really helpful for me when I need to focus on becoming more mindful of the present moment. She called it ""5,4,3,2,1"" and it goes like this:

Either say aloud or just think:

5 things you see

5 things you hear

5 things you smell

5 things you feel (physically)

4 things you see

4 things you hear

...

Until you get to 1.




At the end of this exercise you'll be much, much more focused upon the present moment and will hopefully be less focused upon perseverating on a negative thought or in a state of panic.

Edit: I'm glad to see that this exercise has helped so many people!  Thanks for taking the time to read!",31,2015-02-17 01:33:58 EST-0500
859,Phone calls make me insanely anxious. Anyone else? Any advice?,"I have no idea why, but the idea of talking on the phone with a stranger fills me with paralyzing fear.  It's been this way for years.  I have no problem talking on the phone with people I know--I frequently call my wife, my mom and my grandparents for example.  But when it comes to talking to someone I don't know, it's like night and day.  I almost always avoid answering the phone when I get a call from an unknown number--which has caused me problems in the past as you might imagine, but I can't seem to stop doing it.  Answering the phone in that situation feels like trying to talk myself into jumping off something really high--I know I probably won't get hurt, but every instinct in my body is screaming at me that it's dangerous.  I just found out that I have to call someone for work this afternoon, and added to the anxiety of not knowing him is the fact that I don't really feel equipped to discuss the issue I need to talk to him about.  I've been battling flight-or-fight response for the past hour but I just don't see any way out of this.  I feel shaky right now just writing about it, I really don't know how I'm going to do this.",18,2015-02-18 22:43:50 EST-0500

I'm so glad I have what I have, I am where I am, and in the end, whatever happens at work is just temporary, and in the long term, it is even meaningless. So I should enjoy the process instead of stressing. I should be happy and mindful.

Well, I just wanted to vent. I feel better and I trust my ability to control my anxiety. I always end up controlling it. Everything, including my anxiety, is temporary.",14,2015-02-17 10:35:47 EST-0500

872,Did you always have anxiety? Or did something trigger it one day? What happened on that day? How do you cope now?,"All of my life, I was a pretty outgoing person. I had a care free soul, and lived life to the absolute fullest. But that dreadful day on November 15th, 2014 changed everything. Up until then, I never gave much thought to anxiety or any mental illness for that matter. But when it struck me for the first time, I couldn't believe how awful and life changing this affects a person. 


It was honestly the most frightening moment of my life. When an anxiety attack strikes you for the first time - and you have no idea what's happening since you never experienced it before... I have never been so scared. 


I had been struggling with a ton of stress in my life for a magnitude of reasons, and for reasons I am ashamed to admit, dabbled into a cocktail of drugs on the night that it happened. Doing the drugs is what definitely set me overboard, and my brain finally just stopped and said ""I can't take this anymore!"" and thus, the beginning of my anxiety began.


I remember going to the washroom of the party and I looked in the mirror and I couldn't recognize the person in the mirror. I freaked out at my alien figure and started panicking. My neck tensed up and I could barely breathe. I fell to my knees and began blacking in and out. I started feeling intense brain zaps and felt like I was either a) having a seizure/stroke or b) I was about to die.


I ran out of the house, past my friends, and into my truck to drive myself to emergency. As I hopped into my truck, I started experiencing everything in 3rd person view. It felt like I had come out of my body and was observing myself from an overhead view of me panicking inside my truck. Was I fucking dead?!?! I didn't know at this point. Suddenly I came back into my body. And for some reason I was focused on the clock on my dashboard illuminating back at me. ""2:44"" it showed. I kept saying over and over again ""Time of death 2:44, time of death 2:44.."" I kept repeating that for some fucking reason, and all of the sudden I snapped back into reality... and I realized I was driving on THE HIGHWAY THE WHOLE TIME and was almost at the hospital. I have zero recollection of even driving from my friends house to the hospital. In my mind I was still in my friends driveway at the party just sitting inside my truck looking at the clock. 


I pull into the hospital and I hop out. Another wave of panic hits me. My neck begins to tense up. I fall down to my knees again and look up at the hospital and tell my brain ""You just gotta get through those doors."" I was fully convinced the hospital staff was going to find my dead body in the parking lot. I managed to get to my feet though and I walk into the hospital doors clenching my neck with my hands very tightly. I didn't realize that I was actually choking myself more than my neck was actually tense. The doctors see my state and get me into the ER. They sedated me immediately as I was in a huge fit and next thing I know I am waking up in hospital with a heart monitor attached to me and a nurse monitoring my vitals. Everything that had happened previous to that, just felt like a bad dream, but it all actually happened and I couldn't wrap my head around it. The kind doctor explained to me what happened, and they let me talk to a therapist for an hour, free of charge, and he explained to me what anxiety was and how it happens. They gave me anti-anxiety meds and I felt a million times better.


Ever since that dreadful evening on November 15th, 2014.. I still battle the odd anxiety. The antidepressants I am on really help in keeping my mind in control, but now that anxiety has been triggered, I feel like it will never quite go away. It will always linger in some degree. I've had attacks since, but I have been able to keep a rational head. However, I have develop hypochondria, and am always awfully aware of my own heart and what my brain is doing/thinking. It's safe to say I'll never be the same again, but I like to think this horrific thing that happened to me, and that has happened to all of us, will only make us better prepared for whatever we may have to battle in the future. 


**TL;DR** For those who want to skip my story, basically what I'm asking is, have you always had anxiety? Or did something happen on a particular day that triggered this horrifying mental illness on you? Have you learned to cope with it and manage your attacks?

I have figured out through therapy that it is a coping mechanism for dealing with my Anxiety due to growing up in an abusive and dysfunctional atmosphere as a child. These addictions make me happy when I am stressed, but the problem is they consume me. I will become to the point where I am obsessive about another individual. I think about them non stop and constantly want their attention, and when I don't get it, it's agonizing. I hate this about myself, and as you can imagine it causes me lots of problems in my personal life, especially so because I am married. I do not want this, but I am having a hard time battling it. I recently opened up to my Husband about it, and we are working on it in Therapy. I just want to know if anyone else out there has dealt with this, so perhaps I don't feel so alone.

879,I think I beat my panic disorder!,"I started Viibryd last November, after being on Lexapro, Brintellix and then Pristiq. All of them helped in various ways but after switching to Viibryd it was like life in color again. I got out of my shitty manipulative 2 years relationship, I was no longer depressed and seeing the world in gray. My GAD is also really under control. And most of all I stopped having panic attacks. My biggest trigger used to be getting hit on in public or catcalled. Strangers scared me, especially males, after a sexual assault several years ago. I also would panic if I got yelled or spoken to by an authority figure, for example talking to a professor about a test grade would almost always send me hyperventilating in a bathroom. I used to be scared to leave my house to go to class because guys would whistle at me on my bike.  
My last panic attack was in January when I got spit on by a homeless guy. I think that was a pretty extreme situation that warranted a panic attack though, and even so it wasn't my worst. Since I stated Viibryd my ""activation energy"" for panic attacks has increased, meaning it takes me a much more severe situation for me to panic. But this last month I was able to go to Vegas, got catcalled all over the place, and none of it caused me to panic. A year ago I would have had a meltdown if a guy looked at me the wrong way. So it has officially been more than six months since my last panic attack. 
I'm no longer afraid to leave my house in case I have a meltdown. I know my case isn't that extreme, but hopefully this gives some of you hope that it gets better and you can conquer your anxiety!! ",8,2015-08-02 03:06:33 EDT-0400
880,Even this is giving me anxiety but.. Hello,"Hello everyone I'm a 24 year old male and some of my earliest memories are of anxiety and panic attacks, like panicking that my parents have died if they were out of my sight as a toddler or fear that I would forget to breath or choke on my food and so on. As I got older my anxiety just got worse and worse and by the time I was in 1st grade I went through a number of therapists and nothing scared me more than thinking I was a broken human being and that something was severely wrong with me So I lied to my therapist so I didn't have to see them anymore and I lied to my parents so they wouldn't be disappointed in having a worthless son (my mentality in 1st grade was pretty bleak but I remember that exaxt feeling clear as day.) I feel lying to everyone and trying to hide my real self from everyone brought more issues and since I tried to convince everyone around me I was a normal functioning human being, there was absolutely no leeway to act on my panic attacks and acknowledge my anxiety attacks which in itself lead to further panic and further anxiety, It was like an axietyception. By the time I was 18 I meet a girl that was pretty, smart, and most of all mean (or mentally abusive, which I didn't realize at the time) it was only logical that I should stay with her because I figured it's normal for people to act the way she did at the time so I couldn't break up with her out of anxiety and the wish to be a ""normal"" man.. Yes, man, I was 18 that's legally the age to vote, become fully responsible for yourself graduate grade school. So naturally I wanted to fit in... This is something I believe is wrong with society as well. You shouldn't pressure someone that young to feel like they're adults and responsible for yourself... Because when you take it to the point that I do it becomes completely devastating. I moved out of my parents house to a different town all together and not only that I had a child.. Not to mention I couldn't work a job to save my life. fresh out of high school that I didn't understand, fresh in a relationship that I never understood and being a fresh father... You get the picture.. And that's still just a fragment of my complicated mess of a life that I feel (or stress) could have been different If I would have just acknowledged the fact that I needed help and I wasn't meant to fit into normal society and but that just leads to anxiety of thing things I can't change, an anxietyception, but it's okay not to fit in. I guess what I'm saying is never feel like you're worthless, like I did, or you have to fit in with this society if you truly do not (like I tried and miserably failed.) because accepting yourself early will be a heck of a lot easier than accepting yourself down the road.

886,Has anyone ever quit a job without a backup with success?,"Hi there!

I've been at my job for 4 1/2 years and in April, my company had layoffs, letting go of my boss and my other team member. To replace them, someone was moved from one department of the company to being my boss, even though she has no experience in my department. Since April, I have been absolutely miserable in my position. I feel that she completely disregards my experience and input, being a ""shut up and do what you're told exactly as you're told to do it"" boss, whereas before I played an instrumental role in the decisions made in my department.

I've spoken with her directly about my grievances and is just defensive and hostile about it, blaming me for my worries. I've addressed HR on multiple occasions with no outcome or even scheduled followup to see if there has been a resolution. (Related: HR at my work isn't very dependable in general; there's video evidence someone is stealing food from the kitchen and has been for months yet HR doesn't want to see or hear about it).

I'm at my wits end. I've tried looking for a job on and off with little success but I feel that if I had some time dedicated to searching, it may be more lucrative. I've had multiple panic attacks at the office, my depression is at a low, and I feel that I've made every effort to fix my problems but that effort isn't being reciprocated. 

A good vent has helped somewhat, but I am still shaking in my desk knowing that I have 5 more hours before I can go home. I want to hide in my car, rather than take a lunch break, just so I can get off of the office for even a moment.",38,2015-08-03 20:03:02 EDT-0400

893,"[Health Anxiety] Part of me thinks that my anxious brain is exaggerating my symptoms, and that nothing serious is actually wrong with my health. But another part of me worries that I might be ignoring a serious health condition by dismissing it as ""just anxiety"". How do I find the middle ground?","Context: I occasionally have pains and other symptoms in various parts of my body, which I am hyperaware of. These things could easily be benign conditions, but they could also be signs of something serious, the thought of which makes me restless.

As I'm sure people with health anxiety understand, I have spent countless days worrying that I have MS, ALS, sinus cancer, colon cancer, testicular cancer, cardiomyopathy, other heart conditions, kidney disease, autism, celiac disease, liver disease, and a few others that I can't remember at the moment.

The most common advice I see here is ""find a therapist"", ""find a psychiatrist"", ""it's just anxiety"", and generally to deal with the *thoughts* first. This might be my anxiety speaking, but I feel like thinking this way means ignoring something important my body is trying to tell me.

If I ignore my symptoms, I will always be worried that I could have a fatal disease without knowing for sure. If I play along with my health anxiety, I will end up spending all of my money and free time visiting doctors and going through medical tests. With my anxiety, I no longer know which symptoms I should see a doctor for and which ones I should just take a deep breath and relax for. So how do I find the middle ground?

897,First time seeing a doctor after my last one told me that Jesus is going cure my anxiety.,"I'm not looking for advice, per se...I just need to get this off my mind because I'm freaking out right now...Thanks in advance for reading.


When I first started having anxiety, I had the horrible knot in my stomach that wouldn't go away. I had never felt anything like it before so I panicked. I went to a super cheap urgent care because I couldn't afford anything else. As the doctor was checking me, he started asking if I go to church. I said no. I'm not religious at all. He told me that I should start going to church because Jesus will cure whatever I had. And that was the end of my visit.



I'm going to a different urgent care in a bit for something  unrelated to my anxiety but I'm starting to have an anxiety attack just thinking about it. I did my research and all this time around. The center I'm going to this time around has an average of 4.8/5 stars on Yelp so I know I'm going to be fine. I talked to the receptionist this morning and she was *extremely* knowledgeable and helpful but my stupid anxiety is killing me. 



Before anyone says anything, I know I should've reported the doctor but it didn't cross my mind at the time because I was shocked at what he told me. I don't remember his name or where exactly he was practicing at because this happened years ago.",11,2015-08-04 03:34:09 EDT-0400

901,Drink more water and consume less sugar.,"You've probably heard it a million times by now, but your diet and overall health have significant effects on you both physically and mentally.

For the longest time I turned to soda and sweets as a means of cheering myself up when I got low. Little did I know that this had a significant effect on my recovery process and ultimately threw me into a vicious cycle.

Last month I decided to cut out sugar except for the occasional snack. I stopped drinking soda entirely and now even a cup of it makes me feel like poop. I cut back my coffee intake to a single cup (6 oz. glass) a day with dairy creamer and no sweeteners.

I feel so much better. Unless you do this there really is no way to tell how you would actually feel when you do it. I would recommend you do so. Without a proper amount of water your body isn't functioning how it's supposed to. Sugar changes your bodily functions and in large amounts can have very negative effects on you. Without it I've felt happier than I did with it. My anxiety has gone mostly unnoticed which is a huge improvement.

I'm not saying drop all sugar or drink nothing but water. But what I am saying is give it a shot.

This may sound elementary, but this is the one thing I would recommend you do take to heart.",68,2015-09-06 16:48:57 EDT-0400

904,I recovered from anxiety,"I used to come here all the time and I had so much anxiety that I couldn't even read the posts because they made me feel worse. I never really saw too many people post in here that said that something good came out of having anxiety. Last year around this time anxiety hit me like a ton of bricks so bad in fact that like many of you I didn't want to leave my house. I've always had some form of anxiety but just over night it seemed like it overtook me I had so many fears that I didn't have before and didn't know how to explain it to my family. 

From one day feeling completely normal to the next day feeling like I'm a different person was the most terrifying aspect of this. I couldn't sleep because my anxiety was so bad I in fact would stay awake for days on end. I still went to work everyday but I just barely made it. The second I would get home I would get back into bed while worrying about what the next day held. I gave up all hope on returning to a normal life. I couldn't go out on the weekends unless I got drunk and my wife had to basically drive me everywhere. 

I finally went to the Dr and got some medication. As most of you know getting on medication does in fact make your anxiety worse (for awhile) but after a month or two things got better. It was all baby steps I started driving myself, I actually wanted to go out and meet friends again. Eventually, I even booked a vacation out of the country and I had an absolute blast. I'm not scared to go to work and I even picked up old hobbies. I'm running a half marathon next week I never thought I would be able to do that again. 

I've been going to therapy and it's really helped me a lot and I know it's unpopular to say on reddit but I started praying I wasn't sure what to but it does calm me and make me feel better. Fact is, I just hope this helps one person that's struggling. You can get your life back and you can make things better just trust the process. Basically don't worry about tomorrow just focus on today. 

TL;DR I never thought I would live a normal life and through medication and hard work I came out on top. Things will get better just never give up. ",27,2015-09-02 20:16:24 EDT-0400

914,When death anxiety becomes crippling,"This is probably the first time I have ever opened up like this online, but I feel I have to do it. 

I'm going to make it as short as possible to get to the point;

I've had 2 major heart surgeries in my life. One when I was 3 months old, and one just a few years ago (When MJ died) where I had to get a mechanical heart valve.
Now I'm permanently on warfarin, a blood thinning medicine. I have to take blood samples regularely with my own machine + the hospital to check if the values evens out. 



I have a much higher risk of inner bleeding because of these medications as well. Sometimes when my blood value is too high, I can get a nosebleed from tilting my head. I also have aspergers syndrome (a mild version) ADD, and alot of anxiety. I also have PTSD that makes me go into another dimension of reality when it gets triggered. (This PTSD can get triggered by a certain light that reminds me of waking up from my last surgery. It's images that uncontrolably flashes in my head and idk if they are memories or dreams.)

I'm also super dependant on my mom. She has always been there for me fixing literally everything cause I'm not that capable of taking care of myself with making phone calls to hospitals and such. I'm 23 years old.



-The point--




So, last time I was at my annual heart checkup my doctor said they suddently had to preform a new type of checkup. Turns out I have a small leak in my heart valve again. And if that leak grows out of control I will need to have another major heart surgery, which might literally be the death of me. My heart and chest also hurts randomly several times a week, and everytime I ask the doctors about it they say its normal and nothing dangerous. I don't think having chest/heart pains that regularely is normal at all. The new checkup they are going to do, is putting a tube down my throat to get better images of my heart valve. This procedure has never been needed before so it makes me really nervous. They won't tell me anything either if they suspect something bad.

Me and my mom had a talk in the car the other day about me dying if I have another surgery. The talk was short and she just said ""that's something I chose to not think about"" and it got to me really bad. We usually mock death and laugh at anything so I was really afraid when things got that serious. I'm actually crying right now just thinking about it. Suddently I had the thought ""what if my mom dies right now, or tomorrow or the day after, I'll become completely crippled and I won't be able to take care of myself anymore"". Me and my mom are really close, so I dread the day the inevitable happens. She has chronic migraine and intense fatigue. She needs to take several pills and medication everyday to get through the pain. It also worries me. 

Anyways, my mom just called me and said she'll call my main doctor and ask about the new procedure and if they suspect anything. I'll get an answer hopefully by the day to calm myself a bit. 





About the anxiety;


I worry alot. Too much for my own good. I worry so much that I think I can summon fake pains and other symtoms because I manipulate my brain into thinking I'm more ill than I already am. I worry about worrying as well. And if I actually get a hold of these thoughts and shove them away, another thought invade my head. ""What if the pains are real this time, and you're overseeing them? What if your intestines explode or your heart bursts ?"" really over the top thoughts like those. Every day. 

It's not better during the night either. I have weird stomach ""pains"". It feels like something is moving in my stomach. Sometimes it feels like something is exploding from within, and I feel a warm shock go straight to my head. 
My pulse accelerates when I try sleeping on the right side of my body, but calms down on the left. I have no idea why. 

If I'm having a good day, the anxiety can come back at any moment. ""What if..."" is what it says. All the time. 

""What if...""

I died?
My mom dies?
My dog dies?
My heart explodes?
My organs stop working?
My heart can't go back to normal?
The leak is growing?
My medication suddently stops getting produced?
The doctors are holding back information to spare me?
I never get to achieve anything?
Never get to grow old?





That's another feeling I have. The weird sense of that I never will get to the age of 40 +. It's like I have ""psychic senses"" that tells me I'll never get old because of my heart. My mom said she had the same thoughts. But then it just keeps going. What if I'll never be 50, 60 70? And I'll keep thinking that untill I actually die, and I had lived far more than I originally thought. 

These thoughts, feelings, weird pains is what I go through every single day. I haven't had one day where everything was alright in probably 6-7 years. There is always one tiny thing that fucks it up, so the thoughts come back. 




I'm thinking about getting help, since I don't want to be on more medication. I also have a mutated gene that causes me to have more side effects on medicine. This happened when I tried out medication for my ADD. I waited almost a year top get it, just to be disappointed because my warfarin went nuts when I took the ADD pills. My blood value went over the roof and I had to stabilize my doseage all the time. So I had to quit it. I also became fatigued and lazy from those pills, lying braindead on the couch.

So anxiety medicine is out of the question. 

I have no idea what's going to happen next. I wonder what the doctor will say about the new procedure. If they don't suspect anything bad it might make me feel alot better. If they just told me 6 months ago I wouldn't feel so terrible. I have enough anxiety and worrying as it is on a regular basis...


The death anxiety has become so cripling that I can barely do the things I love anymore. I can't focus enough to draw, to eat, to clean my apartment etc...

This post kinda went everywhere but I absolutely needed to get it out. I somehow feel abit better. 

Thank you for reading.

915,"Does anyone else have severe anxiety about time (appointments, events, and even random activities)?","I'm not sure if this question has been asked before...I did a quick search and found some threads about the PASSAGE of time and not meeting certain goals/expectations, but my issue doesn't really fit that type of anxiety. 

So, one of my worst anxiety triggers (if not THE absolute worst) is related to time. Now, I have both GAD and OCD, so I'm not sure which one is responsible for this one...it's probably a combination of both. 

Anyway, I am absolutely obsessed with getting places on time. Even if there's no definite time I have to be somewhere (like going to the county fair for the day or something), I kind of make up a time in my head and get more and more frantic if I haven't left by that time. My work allows for a flexible schedule, but I never deviate from getting there around 7/7:15 because if I do, it feels ""wrong"" to me and just ruins my entire day. 

When I find myself in a situation where I might be late to something, I get so much panic. This triggers the worst physical symptoms of anything else that makes me anxious. I get such an upset stomach and racing heart, and I honestly feel like I'm dying. 

Now, the biggest issue that I have with this is that I'm married to someone who is by nature an overall laidback, late type of person. Not only that, but she also has several chronic illnesses/autoimmune disorders where her sicknesses will delay her significantly because she is having bathroom difficulties, joint pain, or other related issues. 

I am trying really hard to work on this issue in therapy. It causes the biggest strain on our relationship because we inevitably have an argument when we have to be somewhere at a certain time...I keep obsessively looking at the clock, then I start nagging, then she feels like I'm controlling her, then we have an argument that delays us leaving even more. And I feel like the biggest jerk ever because a lot of the time, she CAN'T control her body making her late to stuff. 

So, yeah, I am doing my best to work on this...but even if I don't outwardly nag my wife or cause a fight about this, how can I stop my HORRIBLE feelings on the inside? I have a lot of advice I tend to give anxious people, things that I find help me with most of my anxiety (in particular, spending time with pets or playing music), but even doing those things doesn't really make me feel better with this time issue. 

Can anyone relate or help? Like I said, I am really trying to change, but I've been backsliding a LOT the past few weeks for some reason, and it's putting strain on my relationship. ",12,2015-09-04 04:31:15 EDT-0400
916,I get very anxious in situations where I'm forced to choose one thing over another. My biggest fear is making the wrong choice and living the rest of my life in deep regret.,"I always have a very hard time at restaurants when ordering food. I see two or three options that look good, and I get nervous because I can't decide which one I want to order. I usually take a very long time, flipping back and forth and carefully weighing the pros and cons of each option, while my brain goes dark and I start to feel like I'm taking a timed calculus exam. I freeze up and my eyes go out of focus. When the waiter arrives, I decide to just go with any one of the three choices I was originally considering, completely at random. After he leaves, things like *""Shit, I should've ordered that other thing""* and *""Dammit, this isn't going to taste as good""* are followed by *""Wow, my life sucks. I'm such a childish loser. I can't make my own fucking decisions. I'm going to waste this money on something I'm not even going to like""* in my mind. The way I think about these things, it's like I'd just signed an irreversible contract to kill one hundred million people.

I feel like this about almost everything - choosing a university, choosing a future career, choosing a hairstyle, just EVERYTHING. Hell, it took me an hour to type this post because I wasn't sure which words to choose. I wish I didn't have to make choices - I wish I could just try everything at once. The realization that if I choose A, I'll be missing out on the wonderful aspects of B, and if I choose B, I won't get to experience A is just so mentally and emotionally crippling.

I identified in therapy that it is anxiety because I become very agoraphobic and restless. I quit the last job I had after only working two days largely because I simply couldn't leave the house.

924,"I get anxiety around my house and where i live, but i'm very comfortable away from home.","I'm starting to notice things about my anxiety that are super weird. Firstly, it seems to be agoraphobia but with weird variations. The farther i get from home, the better i get. When i go downtown into the city, i feel fine, and am able to function normally around large crowds of people.


If i am alone around another person back at home, i freak out a bit. Being around some people give me tremendous anxiety, and some none at all. I am a very social person, and still love to socialize. It's like i have a strong desire to be around other people even though i have anxiety.


This all occurred after some trauma that happened to me, so i don't know if it's more along the lines of ptsd. I'm going to seek a therapist soon. This is also the weirdest thing. At my job at a museum, i have to stand in front of HUGE crowds of people, and scream directions at them. I am the center of attention and must help many different types of people. I feel SO comfortable doing this job. I don't understand. 


I get freaked out just walking down the street where i live sometimes, but being in front of those people is probably the most comfortable and freeing activity i do in my life. I'm not even this relaxed being at home. Anyone experience anything like this?",17,2015-09-07 21:51:26 EDT-0400

928,I Conquered my Biggest Fear and Flew for the First Time on Friday,"So I have been posting here for years asking for advice on how to fly with panic disorder. I used to have panic attacks almost every day to the point where I didn't like to leave the house. Throughout the last 7 years, I have gotten much better with them and conquered little fears here and there. The one that I had not conquered yet was flying on an airplane. I had built it up to the hugest fear I could imagine. Even thinking about being inside of an airplane made me start panicking. I had a huge fear of being so high up in the sky in this small tube with a bunch of people with NO way out. There was nothing scarier than this to me because obviously when I have a panic attack, I just want out. 

I had turned down trips for years and everyone knew I was the 27 year old who has never flown before. The more years that passed, the more the fear grew. I have finally reached a point in my life where I feel like life is just too short and I need to see the country/world. I was offered a chance to go on a work trip this month. It was going to be from LA to Boston. I thought about it for 2 weeks and last minute I said yes. Leading up to the flight there were many sleepless nights, anxiety, and stress. Not only was this a 5.5 hour flight but it was a red eye. Oh, and it was also 9/11. 

I walked onto the plane and took my seat. I looked around and immediately started panicking. I couldn't believe how small it was inside the plane and how small the seats were. We didn't even start moving yet and I started having a severe panic attack. I told my boss that I didn't think I could do it and almost got off the plane. Then I thought that I had come this far and I NEED to conquer this fear so I stayed. Take off was the most fear I think I have ever felt in my whole life. I was having a panic attack and I just needed to get out but I had no place to go. I had taken xanax before the flight but it seemed like my adrenaline was overpowering it. After about an hour, the xanax kicked in more and I found myself a little more calm. I tried to distract myself as much as possible and my co workers were amazing at making sure I was okay. 

It was the last hour of the flight and I started getting so happy and excited that I actually did it. I conquered my hugest fear. It was really tough but I actually did it. 

The flight home was a little better because I knew what to expect and I took a little more xanax. I don't think I will ever enjoy or look forward to flying but at least I know now that I can do it. I now feel like I can do anything after going through this. Thank you for reading! I just had to share this story with people who could relate. ",37,2015-09-17 02:37:13 EDT-0400

I wish I could speak this bluntly to my boyfriend - he is so good and caring and always tries to help and encourage me - but when you are depressed and anxious is it hard to see things from their point of view. If I can't get out of bed no amount of ""you have so much to be happy about"" or ""you can do its"" seem to help. I have just come off my meds as I don't want to rely on them but I am finding it hard. My boyfriend says how well he thinks I'm doing without them and how he thinks I don't seem too bad - if he knew what went on in my head he would probably think differently.

941,"I have to write this down; something I want everyone who I pass on the street, everyone who notices my existence. I need to apologise.","I live a life I don't deserve.

Not because I'm better than it, but because of the inverse. I have a life where I'm free to do whatever I wish. I have people who support me, people who put up with me, and people who provide for me. But why do they do it? Because of unconditional love. My family are the only ones who tell me I'm okay, because they are the only ones who has the obligation to care. In reality, I do nothing for them. Because I am incapable, unworthy. I deserve less than I get because I am worth than less I get. They slave away all day to but me the things I need and want, and I don't deserve any of it. Just today my mum asked me to do the dishes, but instead I didn't and instead slept. I am capable of doing it, so why didn't I? I don't know. I couldn't, because that would make sense. So I didn't, and instead chose to do as I always do, and that is nothing. Because I'm so caught up in my own self pity I can't assist the only people who still care enough to tell me I'm worth something. But I'm not. I can't even go to school. I can't even go outside. I can't clean my room, I can't take care of myself so at what point can I take care of others? I can't. I inconvenience all those around me, but I keep telling myself that suicide will be worse to them than what I already inflict.

No parent should outlive their child, no matter how useless they are. Unconditional love is what drives them to put their life above the ones they foster, even if it is so untrue. They see that I am worth something; to them, I may be. To the rest of the world I'm not. I'm just another self loafing prick, and I don't deserve any of what they give me. I can't put my Grandparents through the same grief. I can't. So what can I do? Nothing. Because I am incapable of helping anybody. I am broken before I have even been created, and my only calling is death. But I can't do that, because for some reason my life extends beyond me. So instead I am forced to live a life that I can't comprehend. I'm stuck in a body of an awful person, and I can't eliminate the pain that causes so much self hatred. Soon, my books and games won't be enough to put my existence in a purgatory state where I can justify my decision to not end my life. Soon I'll have to face the facts. Either live a life where I slave away like that of my parents, and be miserable. Or stay where I am and face the same fate. Either of those is not a life I want to live, so soon I'm going to have to make a decision, and I will most likely make one that cuts away the leeching cancer that is my useless existence.

948,Breaking up with psychiatrist?,"I've been seeing my psychiatrist for about six months. Overall I've been pleased with him, but I was disappointed to learn that our ""sessions"" were only related to medication and didn't involve any kind of talk therapy whatsoever. After a couple months I asked if he could refer me to a good therapist in town. He gave me a few names, but none of them accepted my insurance. After trying unsuccessfully on my own to find another therapist, I contacted my insurance company and they gave me a list. 

From a list of 12 therapists: five never returned my calls, four didn't actually accept my insurance, and two didn't accept ANY insurance. The one woman who was accepting phone calls and new patients was also a psychiatrist. I scheduled an appointment with her. Our first session was yesterday. 

I liked her immediately. She is extremely direct and seems very knowledgeable. She disagreed with one of the medications I was put on (trileptal, which I'm really struggling with). She said she'd like to take me on as a patient but that I would obviously need to stop seeing my original psychiatrist. 

Of course, I am having an extremely difficult time actually making the phone call. Their respective offices are literally within eyesight of each other. In fact I believe psychiatrist #1 used to work in the same practice that psychiatrist #2 works from. She referred to him by first name while we were talking about him, so I assume that they have at least a professional relationship. 

I guess my question is this: since I've only seen this guy for six months, will it look bad to drop him out of the blue? I've never expressed any sort of displeasure with the treatment I'm receiving, but I also haven't had much success, especially with the trileptal. Has anyone had to break up with a doctor? What did you tell the office when you called? Does it seem like I'm making a really dumb decision here? ",19,2015-09-15 16:49:10 EDT-0400
949,Wondering if people experience anxiety the same way I do. (Or if there's a name for it),"Hey all. I try to reign in my anxiety as much as I can, but I could do better. I think understanding how it works--and sharing experiences with others--gives you perspective on it. 

For me I think the most apt term to describe it is ""avoidance"". I don't really overthink much (well, I do think quite a bit, but not anxiously), and I don't really dread about the future. I don't worry. I do swimmingly in social situations. But for whatever reason, there will be tasks that I *cannot* do. 

For example, I have a pile of clean clothes on my bed right now. What I should do is put them away where they belong. Every day for the past week I have neglected to do it. Not because I forgot. But because I have a HUGE mental block about doing it. In the moment when I am experiencing the anxiety, putting my clothes away would be akin to asking me to shoot myself with a gun or jump off a building. My body *literally* feels as though it's the worst thing possible and I should avoid it at all costs. This is of course at dissonance with my conscious mind; putting away clothes isn't that bad. It'd be relieving to have them put away finally instead of carting them from the bed to my computer chair every night. But here we are. 

What's weird is that the tasks I feel this way about will change over time, coming and going. They range from the mundane (putting clothes away, making a phone call, going to the store) to vital tasks (work, school, medical care). Often it gets to the point where I do the things I need to only because I perceive the consequence of not doing it (ie, becoming unemployed) as outweighing the intangible ""badness"" I feel about doing the task. Unfortunately some things never reach this threshold, as their consequences never seem immediate or imminent. (RIP my middle 2 years of college).  Of course some days I don't have these problems at all and I'm utterly bewildered as to why it was ever an issue. 

What's your anxiety like? Is there anyone out there like me? (If you beat it, or have more info on it, I'd love to know). ",16,2015-09-16 06:11:00 EDT-0400

***Edit:* Thank you for all the kind words! Seeing as so many wanted an update I thought I should deliver.** 

So session one went well, the hardest part was definitely making sure I didn't bail at the last minute (I almost did, really glad I made it). There are 8 of us in the CBT group, so some basic introductions were made and some pretty important ground rules were outlined i.e. No judgement, confidentiality etc. 

The counsellor talked us through the plan for the next 5 weeks, got us to consider how we felt and to set a realistic improvement target.

The session itself involved working in groups of 4 and brainstorming about various topics such as:

* Family and outside events that might lead to low self-esteem.
*  Your feelings and behaviours that have resulted from low self-esteem.

Overall, I am glad I took the plunge with a CBT course; it is still early days and I'm worried I am one of those people it doesn't help. Not going to give up though! Expect updates from me in the future about how the whole course goes.

I can't keep up in class. I can't do it. It's too. Damn. Hard. It's too hard oh my god.

I was so codependent on my boyfriend, it was a toxic relationship but now that it's over, I really have nothing. No goals, no self-esteem, nothing. I'm lost. No plan. I had no friends in the area and still don't.

Yesterday was my birthday. You know what I did? I went out to meet an acquaintance I made in class, we had even hung out over the summer (same internship), I get there and she never showed. Bailed on me. Even though I planned it weeks in advance and she said she was going but not only did she not show, she didn't text me or call letting me know she wasn't coming or what was going on. She only responded to my one text today with ""sorry I was tired"" hahahaha. So I hooked up with my ex now I feel like I can't give him up, not because I think it'll work, but because he is literally the only person who cares about me.

My sister lives in SLC, where you're basically fucked if you're not Mormon (and I'm not and never will be). I lived there for 2 years myself and hated it, I couldn't make friends or date because I wasn't religious and it *always* came back to religion and converting me and it was incessant discomfort. My parents live on a ranch in the back-end of nowhere, 1 hour to the nearest grocery store, I'm fucked going out there living with them, there's nothing out there for me, even less than here. I would become a basement person and they would kick me out.

Trying to go to therapy but the campus counseling center is so booked they can only work me in twice a month. I'm on waiting lists for the 2 other places in town offering therapy and it's been months and I've never gotten a call. Fuck.

I have enough credits to graduate with an Independent Studies degree but that's a joke, I might as well drop out right? Drop out and move far away and become a waitress or work at Staples and just live even more anonymously until I finally go out, buy at least 3 sturdy boards, lay them across my cabinets, toss a rope over them, lay down a tarp underneath me so my rotting corpse doesn't stain the tiles and hang myself. And I would rot too because not a single fucking person around here even knows I exist, let alone would check on me.

It's thoughts of suicide every waking moment. It's gotten worse and worse over the past few months and all my therapist says is ""take a de-stress day, try going to yoga."" Well I de-stressed my grades into the fucking hole because even the thought of homework makes me sick so instead of doing it I do yoga. Also I've eaten my weight and vomited it all several times in the past week and it helps a little with the stress.

I'm a train wreck. A week ago I called the suicide hotline and this woman, I kid you not, would pause so fucking long that I had to ask ""Are you there?"" several times to get her to say something. I go on about my situation and she says, ""What are your hobbies?"" I tell her I don't have any and she does another long pause and says, ""Well there isn't a magical solution to all of your problems, like there's no magical wand you can wave and everything will work out,"" and I'm like *are you fucking kidding me.* I ask her what to do. What can I do? I'm so fucking exhausted and tired. She says, ""Well talking helps a little bit, right?"" Well if talking helped I wouldn't be in this fucking mess holy shit.

What do I do? What can I do? This semester I'm doing nothing but re-taking classes I've already failed, *and I'm failing them again holy christ.* It's like I go into lecture and my whole body gets full of white noise, I can't hear the professor, my heart races and my gut froths up.

Fuuuck. Fuck fuck. My life is over, right? It's fucking over.

**Update:** Wow I can't believe these responses... you guys are amazing. Today I was able to think more clearly, although the panic still came back around a few times. I reached out to my family; my parents were very helpful, they encouraged me and helped me make a little game plan and they didn't judge me for getting back into contact with my ex, but my sister was angry about that (she hates him), so that made me feel quite bad, but I'm still a step up from where I was. I still don't know what to do about a lot of my issues, but I've calmed down enough to realize I don't have to figure everything out immediately. Your posts made me think about the options. Also, to those saying it's alright for me to pm you, I might actually do it, so be careful what you offer 😪",22,2015-02-09 21:50:05 EST-0500

963,"[Rant] I would very much like for my heart rate to stay completely normal, thank you.","I was minding my own goddamn business this morning when I suddenly and inexplicably started experiencing some weird symptoms. These symptoms immediately made me think, ""oh fuck, I'm going into cardiac arrest."" It was pretty damned stupid of me to think I was about to have a heart attack, but that's what it felt like.

For the longest time, I've had this problem where my heart rate would increase for no reason. Out of the blue. In addition to that, I'd get lightheaded and usually found it very hard to breathe. I didn't know that this was an anxiety issue until this morning, when I asked my roommate about it. She said she experienced the same thing and explained why it was a thing that happened. Up until I'd asked her, I just thought I was in some serious shit that had nothing to do with my anxiety.

I knew I had terrible anxiety (diagnosed and all that good shit), but I just wasn't ever told that these random symptoms that make you think you have a heart condition were a part of that. I feel pretty dumb. I should've known. This whole fucking time I was scared that I had like, *arrhythmia* or some other heart condition that was going to kill me someday. No idea why I never saw a doctor about it, but now I'm glad I didn't. Because this morning I learned that it was just a fact of my goddamn anxious life. I would've felt pretty damned stupid walking into a doctor's office and freaking out about a nonexistent heart condition. God, I do work myself up over these things an awful lot.

I don't know, guys. It's just annoying. It's really fucking annoying. I hate it. I'm considering biting the bullet and getting some meds. I don't know if I can handle this anymore. It's been a problem for years, and it hasn't gotten any less terrifying.

I just want to be able to relax without my heart feeling like it's about to explode. Seriously, I was having a nice and quiet evening to myself. Fuck this shit. Fuck anxiety. As soon as I can, I'm going to get on meds.

**EDIT:** All of you are supportive and amazing. Thanks for sharing your experiences. I'm sorry I didn't respond to everyone's comments, but I just woke up and I'm not awake enough. I appreciate you all taking the time to respond, though.
In any case, I'm going to go seek medical help just in case! There are a couple things that, after reading this thread, I want to get checked for. I'd like to 100% know what's going on with me so I can better cope with the anxious feelings this gives me. Once again, thank you all for sharing! I appreciate it.",15,2015-02-08 16:09:02 EST-0500
964,"My wife suffers from anxiety, I brought up the idea of us seeing a therapist and she's furious at me and doesn't wanna talk to me anymore. Help?","So my wife suffers from anxiety. We're recently married and it's been getting worse lately. She usually has really bad attacks right before bed and she doesn't usually fall asleep until 2/3 a.m. 

I do not suffer from anxiety. I am very happy-go-lucky. I go with the flow and am normally a very happy person. I love interacting with people and making new friends. 

My wife is the exact opposite. It's very hard for me to make friends because she doesn't want to hang out with them and when I suggest that I hang out with them by myself she gets very upset because she feels like I'm ditching her. 

I try my best to help her. I do everything I possibly can to help her. I talk to her about her problems and I try to keep her mind off things that trigger her anxiety. Most of the time she stays quiet. She doesn't wanna have loud, exciting conversations like I do. She just wants to be quiet, and I respect that. I give her her space. 

Lately it's been particularly bad. I asked her if she would be okay with seeing a therapist. I told her that I needed help to help her and I think we would both benefit from talking to people. She took that and got pissed. Furious. She was so mad at me. She stormed out of the room and hasn't talked to me sense. I need help. Its getting hard for me and I want help too.

967,[Meds] Medication made me myself again,"I thought I would share my experience with my medication in the hopes that it may help someone, or at the very least resonate with people. 
I had anxiety pretty much my entire adolescent life, but it really came to a head my first year of university. I was constantly having attacks, and I was so worried about everything that I would just shut down and do nothing. I skipped classes for weeks on end because they were just too stressful. I also was in constant fear of people judging me, which made me not want to leave the house for fear that I would say something stupid, or wear something atrocious, or even be wearing the ""wrong"" lipstick. 
I had been seeing a psychologist to try and deal with it, but it didn't seem to be quite enough. It got to the point where I didn't want to do anything but be in my room and watch movies (which is so not me, because I am highly extroverted). 
Finally, I mentioned to my doctor about all this, and she recommended that I try a low dose of cipralex, which is technically an anti-depressant but works for anxiety as well.
WELL. Within a week, I started to feel like myself again. I actually wanted to go to class, hang out with people, and spend time outside of my room. The little things that were stressing me out stopped scaring me. I stopped being worried about what other people thought of me, and started speaking in class.
I've been on Cipralex for about 2 years now. The best part is feeling like a normal human again, and feeling like **myself**. Obviously medication isn't for everyone, but it definitely saved my life.",19,2015-02-08 21:42:17 EST-0500

980,The Best Advice I've Gotten For Anxiety Was From A Dream...,"All my life, I've been a vivid nightly dreamer. Also, since adolescence, I've dealt with anxiety in many forms, but primarily in the form of social anxiety. In fact, my social anxiety was so bad that in some situations it felt like it became full fledged paranoia.

As I've grown older, I've learned to manage it, and just through life, it has become less intense, or at least less frequent, but I still deal with it.

So I had a dream one night maybe a year or so ago. I was at a huge outdoor party (similar to what I may have been at in high school/college, and a situation that was a major anxiety trigger for me). Literally almost everyone I've ever known is at this party, and many that I don't as well. The anxiety is so intense, it's like an eerie paranoia, weaved into every molecule of the air around me. I watch people form into smaller groups of naturally flowing conversation, sitting together in the grass, or standing in circles,while I stand there alone, feeling so weird and uncomfortable in my own skin. Every fiber of my being...on alert...feeling weird on a universal level...as intensely anxious as it gets, to the point you feel it goes beyond something comfortably labeled 'anxiety' and into an unknown mental realm of a possible disorder, or worse, on a grand scale (of note, I tried psychedelics such as lsd and ecstasy a fair amount of times in high school/college, and it sometimes seemed to intensify my anxiety, so I have in real life had this intense anxious, paranoid experience in a large social setting before, it wasn't just invented in the dream).

Of course, in this dream I also see my wife blending right in to the social flow, so effortlessly, and I feel so much more isolated, even from her. Its like they can all hear some grand music being played at a frequency I just can't detect.

So in this permeating sense of uncomfortable-ness, I wandered to the fringes of the party, slightly down a grassy hill, and see a guy busy on his own, who looks confident, free from the sense of what I'm feeling. He approaches me and I feel drawn to him, and I don't remember if I verbally expressed my feelings to him or he just knew, but he understood me. He showed me that he was working in a garden on the hillside, and he kept reinforcing to me...just 'tend to your own garden'. 

And I understood what he meant.

He was telling me to keep my mind not focused on the minds of all these other people, not the whole perimeter of the party. But not to focus deep in my own head either. Keep my attention focused in the immediate area around me, on myself but not in myself, and mind to this own immediate area of myself and what I was doing.

And we started talking, just me and him, and I'm just focused on my immediate area around me, the conversation I'm having with him, but not beyond that. Not into his head about how he is perceiving me, not into what anyone else was doing or thinking. Just tending to my little garden. 

Next thing I knew we had walked, almost unnoticed to my attention, back into the party. People were around us again, but I was relaxed. We were sitting near others, I was even conversating briefly with a few other people who had ended up near us, and I was relaxed, comfortable in myself, not worrying what anyone else was thinking or doing. Tending to my garden. Mine only, and not everyone else's, as I typically would. 

I remember my wife approaching, the group growing larger, and still feeling relaxed. Comfortable in myself. When my wife was closer, I proclaimed how I loved this guy that I had met, how he was awesome, and I said it aloud with out repercussion, suddenly finding myself acting in the natural flow like everyone else. 

I had this profound sense of gratefulness for having met this guy, who had understood my problems and taught me what I needed to know to change them.

When I awoke, the feeling of gratefulness and confidence and satisfaction was still there. The dream stuck with me - it stands out as one of those dreams that is so vivid, so real when compared to a typical dream, that the experience feels maybe even more real than real life. And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the guy I met looked very much like myself.

So now I'm in my mid 30s, living in a new city where I haven't really made any real friends of my own yet, and I took a day to myself to spend downtown. Normally, now at my age, I'm confident and enjoy doing things by myself. But I guess the thought of not having friends got to me in this place. I did smoke some weed before I left my house, which may have enhanced the situation, but after taking the train downtown, surrounded by people who were mostly not alone, this anxious feeling creeped back in. As night fell, I'm walking down a busy street, and I feel it swarming over me, the anxiety, the paranoia, the weirdness and isolation amongst all these people.

Then I remembered my dream. 'Just tend to my own garden.' And it changed my perspective immediately. Instead of letting my mind jump to focus on whatever or whomever I saw, I kept it to myself. I focused on what I was doing, where I was going, what I wanted, etc, and it worked. I enjoyed the rest of my night, staying busy and enjoying myself for several more hours before going home, when I could have easily packed it in.

So I thought I'd share in the hopes that this experience may be beneficial to someone else.",15,2015-12-23 22:11:09 EST-0500

987,DAE feel like you have the mental development level of a child?,"Because I do. Everything that I do, the ways I think, etc, just seems more fitting for a five year old rather than an adult.

I keep forgetting things I need to do because I get carried away easily. I'm a frequent victim to irrational thought patterns and am afraid of things only naive children should be afraid of. 

All of the above makes me feel childish and immature. I'm an adult; I feel like I should have my life all sorted out by now. But I just don't. It's like my anxiety has stopped my brain from maturing beyond a certain level and I was never able to learn all the life skills that ""normal"" people have acquired.

I couldn't focus; I felt antsy; I was shaking; my breathing was haphazard; I just wanted to go into a quiet corner and be left alone. My stomach started to ache so badly to the point I started to gag. I went outside on an empty patch of grass and threw up three times.

I felt so debilitated. Even afterwards, my coworkers gave me water and a blanket to rest for a bit. I still shook, and any light, noise or interactions made me feel woozy.

993,I never even realized how much anxiety controlled my life until I smoked weed.,"I know this is weird but I learned my sister was a huge pothead and she offered me some. I was kind of in a down state and said, ""Fuck it, why not?"" I will say that being high was an interesting experience because that was truly the first time I relaxed in my entire life. What I never knew was how much anxiety had a grip on my life. I'm so socially inept because of it. I miss so many opportunities with friends because I'm always scared and I always choose to do something with them based on anxiety. Every fucking choice revolves around anxiety and its so awful. I lived with anxiety my whole  life without realizing it. I ignore so many opportunities because of anxiety! I don't even know what life means to me because of this realization. I make choices so I ignore anxiety even though the other choice is what I was supposed to do. One specific example that runs in my head is yesterday me and my friend decided to go driving so we can just talk. I decided screw it let's go to this trampoline world and have some fun. While i was on the way to the place (30 minutes away), I was kind of getting a little panicky and decided to not go because of anxiety. This isn't even a mild case, I've done this so many times that I can't even think about other cases What baffles me is that anxiety controls my life so much that I'm not thinking what will generate anxiety, as I'm mainly purposefully making decisions based off of anxiety.

This post may not make much sense but for the past couple of days, I've been in such a depressive state that nothing makes sense anymore.

1007,Zoloft rocked my world,"I never thought medication was for me.

I felt like my anxiety was a character flaw, that I was too weak or not trying hard enough to simply control my own emotions. I didn't feel like I ""had anxiety,"" and in fact I would have felt like an impostor labeling myself as such - because I thought my feelings were stemming from my own weak personality, not a genuine problem in my brain.

Even though all along I fully believed that anxiety *is* a genuine disorder, that people with anxiety didn't choose to have anxiety, and that for some people medication does wonders, I wasn't able to identify as one of those people, and so I never even considered that medication could help me.

Then I went to a psychologist for help with my CSP which was getting out of control (https://www.reddit.com/r/compulsiveskinpicking in case you're interested) and I was put on Zoloft (it's commonly used for OCD and anxiety  as well as depression) to control the CSP and the anxiety that can trigger it.

It changed my fucking life. I used to have this feeling that I had no personality because I never had much to say to anyone. But now that I don't feel too panicked to think when I talk to people, I realize I actually have a lot to say. I'm able to actually make friends for the first time since age 12 (I'm 18). I went to a party where I only knew one person - not only did I not feel terrible shame and panic, *I had fun*. When I say something awkward to someone, I used to get flashbacks to that where I felt such intense shame and self hatred, but now it doesn't seem like a big deal. When I see strangers I no longer feel like they feel hostile or judgmental to me. Basically, I feel like **Zoloft has opened my eyes to see the world clearly for the first time, and without the anxiety clouding my vision it is a nicer place then I could have imagined.**

**I am not saying that medication is right for everyone. But I am begging you not to automatically write it off as an option *for you*.** Give it real thought. I regret how much enjoyment I missed over the last 5 years just because I never realized meds could help, and I don't want others to miss out in the same way.

EDIT: I know I'm very lucky that the first drug I tried worked so well for me (there were some side effects, but I added Wellbutrin about 2 weeks ago and I think it's helping :D) I also know that a lot of drugs don't work for a lot of people, and some of the potential side effects would make them not worth taking. I hope it doesn't seem like I'm trivializing that. All I mean is, if you choose not to try medication, *make sure its for a good reason.*",70,2015-11-07 23:37:45 EST-0500

1014,First day of therapy completed,"Hi All,

I'm 29 with a history of social and generalized anxiety. Mine manifests through panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, you name it - with depression added for taste. 

Everything from leaving the house to answering a phone to going out with friends causes me anxiety and I'm trying to get a job. I've been unemployed for 3 months due to a total breakdown during my last job. Have tried 6 different SSRIs over the past 10 years and I'm currently trying a SNRI. 

With two interviews lined up over the next 4 days, my road ahead is pretty overwhelming but today I finally went to therapy...I've been putting it off for 10 years and even though I didn't want to do it, I finally went and I'm glad I did. 

Just wanted to share.

1016,"Does anyone else have ""depression attacks""?","I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety but not the panic attack kind (I think), so please let me know if this is insensitive, and I sincerely apologize!

I don't know what else to call them. Generally I live day to day just feeling very 'blah' and flat. I distract from my thoughts by chatting online, reading reddit, playing videogames, taking care of siblings and dog. Then at some random point, something will just set me off. My dad's wife will tell me to clean the table or do the dishes or something, and then my thoughts spiral out of control. I just think, ""I should've done that before she asked. Why haven't I done it yet? My stuff takes up so much space here. I should just live in the attic. I shouldn't even be here. She probably hates me. I'm just a complete waste of space."" I start wanting to cry, but I have to hold it in and am about 50% successful, if not I just go to my room and cry for hours or something, just feeling so incredibly and intensely *sad*. Not like panicked, though part of the sadness is definitely fear. It's just some emotion so intense I get pain in my chest and belly, and I want to scream or sob but I'm not a very expressive person so it's just like this tight pain and I tense up and shake and then I get a really bad headache after I'm done crying. It just feels weird feeling such intense emotions sometimes that I can't even name because 90% of my life is just so meh, and then something will trigger a 'sadness attack'.

Admittedly crying is better way of dealing with it than other destructive coping mechanisms I've used to handle anxiety in the past, but I'm just wondering if anyone else has sort of the same thing? They've come and gone since I was a kid, but have been happening more often lately maybe because I've been trying hard to get rid of the harmful coping skills and now idk how to deal.",7,2015-11-07 23:26:08 EST-0500
1017,"Maybe I should just let myself suffer, succumb to worst fears, be hospitalized and give up. (note not suicidal)","I have therapists, I have xanax to stave off the worst panic attacks and the like. I go to the gym now each day (granted three days successfully in a row) and I have a lot of reading, journals and things to make myself better each day. 

But I want to give up. I've been dealing with this for over 20 years off and on. And I'm at my breaking point. I can't take this anymore. I do what I'm supposed to do and then one morning I can wake up feeling good and I can take on the day, then today (carry on from late last night) has been a nightmare.  For some reason I get this in my head that I can't breathe well (despite the fact I have no wheezing, no shortness of breathe, just tension and my sinuses close up totally anxiety induced I believe) and I couldn't get to sleep each time  I was about to drop off I was uncomfortable and my thoughts raced like mad and it felt like I was going to pass away in my sleep. 

Woke up today, and this just is just a nightmare. I don't care about life, I'm not feeling effected by anything, nothing is cheering me up, nothing is relief. I am just so exhausted being in a miserable mind that thinks it's dying, has cancer, i going crazy or can't hold it together, and these can all happen at once in seconds).  I told myself I will take this xanax (I either take a .25mg or a .25 and a half of one) before the gym so I can get it done. And luckily I have. But todays Xanax almost made no effect, my mind won't stop, my body wont settle I'm fucking miserable. 

I just sit watching the clock go by and hope tomorrow is better.  I am terrified of meds, I have Cipralex still in it's bag waiting for me. And yet each time I'm on here I hear of the side effects from people, how it's made them worse and etc. Or they have to keep trying meds back and forth back and forth.  

I can't even handle 10 mins of this nightmare anymore. I'm just so tired. How can I even try meds if that happens to me. I don't like this anymore. I don't want to die miserable and my last days were a nightmare. 

I don't know what to do or how to go on anymore. ",5,2015-11-08 23:42:26 EST-0500

1020,I get anxiety while playing video games. I feel like there's something wrong with me.,"Hello everyone, this is my first time visiting this subreddit so I apologize if I do anything against the rules. I'll do my best to fix it if something happens. (Also I'm on mobile, hopefully the formatting is ok.)
I'll just start off by saying I love video games. For me it's not really an addiction, but more like a fun hobby. I tend to stick to some select games because I don't ever seem to get bored of them (Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, Super Mario Sunshine, to name a few.) 
I just started playing Borderlands. I wanted to branch out to FPS games, and my BF recommended it to me. I am absolutely in love with this game! The characters, the skags, the artwork, the mission-based storyline; I'm having a blast (lol) with this game. However, while I'm playing my anxiety builds up until I can't stand it anymore and I have to take a break. I feel exhausted when this happens, so I lie down for a bit and browse reddit until I feel better. Then it's back to the game, and the cycle continues. I have a suspicion that for Borderlands in particular it's something about the ""enemy encounter"" music and also a slight fear of getting surprised by enemies. (As soon as I kill the enemies though, I feel better. Still anxious, but slightly more relaxed than I was when I had a Badass Psycho barreling towards me.)
This cycle has happened with my other games, and the anxiety was especially harsh in the beginning. But as I repeatedly played them, my anxiety levels went down, and my breaks were more about resting my eyes than calming myself down. Has anyone else experienced this? I've always believed that games are supposed to be a source of fun and relaxation, but for me it's more like fun and panic. I feel like there's something wrong with me and I wish it wouldn't happen... I just want to play my video games. :(
TL;DR: Shooting bullets and sweating bullets while using my Xbox. Is it weird to have fun playing a game but go through cycles of anxiety? Advice, stories, or general support is greatly appreciated.",14,2015-11-08 12:47:04 EST-0500
1021,I don't have the willpower to spend several hours to only get so little done. How can I get over that?,"I get an assignment. If I know how to do it, I get it done quickly. If I don't know how to do it, I look up example and attempt to understand those. If I can't understand the example, I look at my notes/textbook chapter. If I can't understand the notes, I look online. If I don't understand the online resources, I look at how much time I wasted trying to find out how to do a single problem. When I do that, I look and see how many problems I have left. When I do that, I think of all the other work I have to do and the sheer amount of time it will take to finish it. When I realize it will take me longer to do something that I want it to, I panic. When I panic, I go into four year old mode (cry, shout, throw things around). When I go into 4 year old mode, I lose all desire to do anything productive (in spite of the sheer amount of work I have to do) for several hours. When I lose all desire to be productive, I try to pity myself, especially if I can even give the slightest amount of blame to something (shitty professor, shitty class). When I do that, I go online looking for a pity party. The cycle continues. I've been trying to get out of it for years, but I can't. I have the bad habit of correlating how much I know how to do something with how quickly I can do it (kind of like a shark, if I don't swim fast enough, I choke). If I can't do something quick enough, I panic. 

I don't know what to do at this point. Bitching on reddit isn't going to get anything done. But shit, I just want fucking As so I can have a GPA higher than a 3.4 and actually do something with that useless piece of paper called an Engineering degree.

1023,I quit every job I get because of my anxiety. How do I get over this?,"I'm 20 years old and working toward an associate's degree at my local community college. I've had four jobs, all of which I have quit via no-call/no-show because I got too freaked out to come into work one day, too freaked out to even call them and say I'm sick or something. Four times, every time is the same. The most recent one happened today after less than two weeks of work. 

Why can't I hold down a job? The customer service jobs that I have been working are difficult because of my social anxiety, but I've never been fired for not doing the job. Sometimes, I just get ""paralyzed"" and can't leave my apartment to go to work. When I'm not at work, I'm thinking about work, worrying about the next time I'm going to be going in and counting every hour of my free time that passes, not actually relaxing like I should be, but letting even the most menial of jobs consume way more than 40 hours of my week.

When I was a teenager, it didn't matter if I quit, because I didn't have any bills to pay. But now, I don't have a job, I have bills, and I don't have enough savings to just sit on.

What do I do?

1024,[Happier Update]I really need help. I haven't left my home in 5 days.,"So long story short I tried to get help last week because I realized I had become completely non-functioning. It didn't go great and I was feeling hopeless as ever. 

I made an appointment with my doctor for this week though, and it was really difficult not to just cancel and stay in bed but I went. And it went so so much better. My doctor is wonderful she is really great at making you feel normal and okay about needing help. 

As it turns out I am suffering from severe depression and anxiety. Fun stuff! I'm trying out medication for the first time in my life and will also be starting group and solo therapy sessions (once the medication starts working my goodness is the thought of talking to more people painful right now). 

It would be inaccurate to say I feel better. My teeth still feel like they are falling out when I even think of opening the front door. That other me is still yelling at me about how much of a piece of shit I am. What changed is I don't feel like there's no point anymore. I was very much ready to give up, and I don't like the prospect of all the painful effort ahead of me, but I do feel like I can try a little longer now.

He understood exactly what I was taking about and broke down. He started crying on my shoulder because he always thought he was crazy. It makes me sad to know he felt alone this entire time.

But, if your cat enjoys it, you have a gift. Because it is the most awesome thing. I felt more serene than I had felt in an entire week rubbing my cat's belly and hearing him purr contently while reaching his paws to the sky. If you feel shitty, pet your cat.

1052,Advice from my therapist I never thought of before.,"So after starting therapy a little over a month ago I found myself presented with a strategy of dealing with my anxiety that I never thought of before and I figured I'd share it with all you lovely people. He told me that instead of trying to fight the anxiety every time it comes creeping up on me I should befriend it. I tried it and I have to say it's very strange but it's working quite well actually. I've found that instead of trying to fight against it or run from it, actually talking to it as if it's someone who's just there with me is kind of comforting. The idea behind the whole thing according to my wonderful therapist is that to truly begin to face anxiety head on is that you have to know that it is a part of you and you should stop trying to fight yourself. Be friends with every part of you even the parts that scare the shit out of you. Just thought I'd share something that could possibly help some of you righteous people!",38,2015-02-25 08:34:55 EST-0500

1056,I'm being denied an appointment at my docs office and it's all because the new front desk girl.,"I called my psychiatrist office on Monday to obtain an appointment for tomorrow, which I was given, no problem. I haven't been in six months due to being unemployed and not being able to afford it, my doc was aware of this the last time we met. I received a phone call this morning from the new front desk girl stating they would need to cancel my appointment for tomorrow because after six months I'm considered a new patient and new patient appointments don't start until April. Needless to say I flipped. I told her this was not a routine follow up or a new issue but more of a ""I need to get back on my meds because things are getting worse type of deal"" (I'm waking up in the middle night having panic attacks) She didn't seem to care and continued to deny me my appointment. I asked to speak to the office manager who according to her, was not there. Ok, I asked to speak to my doctor herself, the response was ""I'll leave her a message.""

I've had emergencies in the past where I've left this doctor messages and she has promptly responded within a few hours, this time there's been no return phone call. I just called again and the receptionist says ""oh shes gone for the day"" I say ""well I was advised I'd be receiving a call back"" to which she replied ""I gave her the message."" End of conversation.
I used to work in the medical field and if your patient called and said they needed to see the doc and it was an emergence type of visit and the front desk turned them away, you'd be in some trouble. That's a huge no-no. Plus, this particular doc has let me come in twice before with no scheduled appointment when I was having panic attacks and needed to see her (this was prior to the new girl).

My question is, would I be a complete crazy person if I showed up tomorrow and asked to speak to my doctor? I feel like I wouldn't but I need some advise. 

Thanks guys! <3

EDIT: Ok, I'm off to my non-existing appointment! I'll follow up with you guys a bit later! 

EDIT #2: So it wasn't a very pleasant visit. I arrived at the office before anyone got there, it was just me and the receptionist. I calmly explained to her that I need to see the doctor and that I promise I'm not trying to make her miserable, I can clearly see she's super annoyed. She basically tells me to have a seat and then just ignores me, 15min later my doc walks in, tells me to follow her into her office. Once I'm in her office she tells me that it's irresponsible of me to just quit treatment for six months then demand an appointment. I explained to her everything that happened yesterday. She had no response to that but continued to tell me that she would see me today but that I would need to find a new doc, that she can no longer treat me because I lapsed in my care. Seriously? I asked her if she honestly thought I wanted that to happen because I didn't, I'm the one paying dearly for it now as my condition is a million times worse. All I got was a ""of course not, but.."" Anyway, she treated me, gave me meds to last three months and now I have to find a new doc. Hooray. It was a shitty experience and made me feel shittier than I already felt. Fucking ridiculous.

Whenever I see someone I know in a ""bright"" place it's hard for me to have a conversation and I'll sometimes completely freeze up like an idiot. However, if the lights were dimmed just enough then that same conversation wouldn't be a problem at all.



Another example are bright rooms in houses. At parties I'll find myself staying in the living room where it's typically dimmed (so I hold anxiety-less conversations) as opposed to the kitchen where lights are blazing full force.

1060,"How do I find a career and become financially independed from my parents, despite mental illness?","*Independent. I hate my phone and stubby fingers.

I'm xposting this from r/findapath, I probably shouldn't have bothered them. I am a 23 y/o female with severe depression and anxiety. I've been in and out of therapy since I was very young, but I haven't had much progress. Social situations, new people, crowds, and conversation scares me, sometimes to the point of self harm. 

My dream is to be able to support myself without help from my parents, in some home of my own. I currently work in a quiet small business making about $400/month. Obviously no one can live off of that sort of money. I live in my moms house, and she pays for groceries, food, health insurance, pretty much everything I can't afford.  I dropped out of college due to anxiety, and have been at this job ever since.

You're first reaction is probably ""Well, you need to get healthy first."" I agree. I do need to solve my mental health problems. But I'm also looking at this realistically. My family isn't going to be around forever, and without their financial support, I'd be lost. I may never be truly healthy, but I'll always need a roof over my head.

So where do I find a career? Where do I find a job that I could support myself from, but not end up losing it or hurting myself in the long run? For some back ground, I live in a rural part of PA. I would say most people in this town work in the factories in the area, and make less than $30,000/year. I can't work in a factory, guys. Not because I'm better than that, but because it's truly better than me. I'm not a lazy person, and I don't expect to coast through life. I'm very ill, and very self aware of my situation. Any advice is appreciated. If this isn't the place for this post, I really apologize. I'm looking for help to find a job to support myself, not asking for mental health guidance.",40,2015-02-28 18:08:54 EST-0500

The lecturer was like ""okay so what did you mean here?"" pointing to it and I explained what I meant, and he said, really bluntly, ""right okay, well that's not what you wrote.""

I instantly started panicking.

Started feeling myself going flushed and red, 
Started getting shaky, 
Couldn't think straight at all, 
Was SO aware of everyone staring at me, of what everyone might have been thinking.
Probably ""shes so awkward"", ""why is she getting so worked up"" etc.

Out loud I was saying; Oh God what did I write? What did I mean?
What am I doing?

and I honestly could not think straight enough to think of how I'd written it wrong. I was getting really flustered and panicky to the point where I felt super self conscious and embarrassed and basically almost had a panic attack.

To make matters worse; the LECTURER said ""calm down"", as did some of my classmates. Must have been at least 2 or 3 people in total saying ""jeez calm down"" out of like 7 students.

This means that to add to how horribly anxious I felt, they all NOTICED how visibly panicky I was, and also probably thought I was overreacting, in turn making me insanely more panicky and embarrassed.

Thing is, when you're practically on the verge of a panic attack probably the worst thing someone could say is ""calm down"".

or so I thought.

a friend of mine, who knows I suffer from panic attacks, adding SO much more insult to injury, said

""jeez don't have a panic attack"".

nope yep thats definitely the worst possible thing you could say.

fuck.

I was shaking for hours after.

TL;DR: Lecturers should really read your medical profile to make sure they don't aggravate mental health issues before unhelpfully telling you to ""calm down"" when you start to panic.",34,2015-02-24 01:18:50 EST-0500
1067,Mild panic attack on weed. Can anyone relate to this event?,"When you're stoned, you tend to enter a panic attack the same way you enter a dream. You just suddenly find yourself there and it's impossible to remember where it started. I do remember not being able to sit still. I was in the back of a car and I was swaying back and forth in my seat. I would say something and it would echo back in my head until my voice became distorted and ugly. Sometimes an unbearably high pitched shrieking. My laugh would come out very high as well. I leaned forward and back repeatedly. 

I became ""self-aware"" and went on a horrifying inner monologue about how I am different from everyone else to the point of being a freak. I decided that my friends pitied me and everyone else resented me. A lot of that stuck with me after the high and increased my anxiety. I still think it's true as I am, in my eyes, exceptionally ugly, but that's beside the point as it has nothing to do with the panic attack itself or the factors that brought it on. These thoughts intensified those areas of self-perception.

""You're just having a panic attack, you'll be okay""

""Panic disorder is very treatable"" 

""You're going to get better""

Man, fuck that. 

I've been having panic attacks since I was 16 years old. I'm turning 25 this year. I've tried a lot of medications. I've seen therapists. I've altered my diet. I've tried yoga. Everything is a miracle cure apparently. I'm envious of you people who have found reprieve in something, but the truth for me is I don't think I'll ever get better from this. Honestly, I'm frustrated by the optimism, and by saying this I'm sure someone will think I haven't tried. Fuck you. I have tried. I try every day. I'm trying. 

I've asked for help since the beginning of this mess, I'm constantly looking for help. Lets cut the bullshit about how looking for help is a step to getting better, for some of us it's a fucking circle. An endless loop of medication, therapy, and anxiety that just sends back to where we were before, sometimes worse off. 

Anxiety is treatable. Sure, there are ways to make it *less* bad, but the truth is, there is no cure. That is reality. That is the truth. There's no cure. And somedays are worse than others, but there are days like today that remind me I'm stuck with this for life. I'm damaged fucking goods. How can I be with someone, if I can't even be with myself? How will anyone be able to accept me for me? 

I've got dreams, and hopes that I see pass by me as the years go by. I've loved and I've lost, and I'm tired of living this fucking life with a handicap. I know things could be much worse, I know, I know, *I know.* and by writing out this huge thing I just feel like I'm whining, but I'm just so frustrated.

I just kind of needed to get this out, and for someone to read it. There is no hope for me I don't think. I'm not a suicide risk, so I hope you don't think that. The truth is, despite all my pain, I'm too scared of a death to be. No I'll sit here and wait till it's my turn to go, I just wish it wasn't so lonely. I just wish I could be the person I want to be.

Apologies in advance for the long post.


I am 25F and I have struggled with various anxiety disorders since childhood (OCD, GAD, depression). My disorders severely worsened around the age of 15-16, and my general health has suffered since then. For the past decade or so, it has been incredibly difficult for me to build a routine and show up to work/school. Throughout my undergraduate degree, my attendance rate was probably about 5% (I still graduated with good grades, thanks to self-study and the school's understanding). I graduated in 2012 and have since enrolled into two graduate programmes - both of which I had to withdraw from due to my health. In 2014, I decided to switch to psychology in order to understand myself better and to help others. However, my health and academic performance continued to suffer and I was cycled through multiple types of medication for my disorders, some of which made me really sick. I felt trapped, almost imprisoned, in my bedroom and felt intimidated by life. Was I ever going to feel okay?


In August this year, I adopted a little rescue puppy. She has changed my life. My health, both mental and physical, is better than it has been in years despite several hiccups in my life. For the first time in 5-6 years, I am able to live without *any* psychiatric medication. For the first time in about a decade, I have not missed any classes, assignments, or exams, for a whole school term. My quality of life has improved dramatically and I have more energy that I've had in a while.


I don't know what it is about her precisely that helps me so much. Maybe it's the fact that she is always incredibly happy to see me, that I know she will never judge me, that I will never disappoint her as a person. I still struggle with my disorders, but she has done more for me in a few months than any medication or therapy has in years.


It really disheartens me when people dismiss Emotional Support Animals as silly or superfluous, because I fear that it discourages others from considering one. Not all disorders or disabilities are visible. Nobody truly understands your experiences other than yourself. Ironically, it gives me even more anxiety knowing that people will question the legitimacy of my Emotional Support Animal when I bring her to places with me, or even ask about why I need her. At the end of the day, your Emotional Support Animal is for *you* and no one else.


Does anyone else have an Emotional Support Animal or a Service Dog? Has anyone had similar experiences? To anyone who is considering one, please feel free to ask if you have any questions. :)",33,2015-12-05 08:16:02 EST-0500

Also, if you know of any resources to share with people to explain anxiety and how real and serous it can be can you please share them?  Thanks",35,2015-12-05 23:58:53 EST-0500

1096,I got a job...,"And my anxiety made my skin break out ridiculously bad. It went from clear to polka dot within days. I also got cold sores, drumming headaches, difficulty sleeping I've gained 7lbs from comfort eating and lost 5lbs from not wanting to eat and I'm exhausted. (I have major self image issues and this all did not help) 

But I'm proud of myself for actually getting out and achieving something, even if it's just a part time minimum wage job. 

I'm hoping the anxiety will decrease the longer I am there and that my depression will get a bit better now that I've actually left the house. 

Fingers crossed! ",13,2015-12-04 21:58:26 EST-0500

1100,A few simple suggestions my psychologist gave me that have really made a difference,"Hi friends. I recently decided to seek professional help for my anxiety and depression, and boy am I glad I did. I avoided going for many years, as I was apprehensive about being given a label or being put on medication. But yeah, therapy is nothing like I imagined, and I have noticed a big difference over only two sessions (up and down like a yoyo, but still an overall improvement).

ANYWAY. The really simple tips we've run through already:

- Buy lavender fabric softener and wash your bedding with it. Lavender is naturally calming. I'm typing away in my room and it smells like heaven in here.

- Grab some lavender oil! You can put this in your bath, and oil burner, or apply to your temples/back of neck/forehead. It's also nice to put a few drops on your pillow cases.

- Walk in the morning (6/6:30am) and walk after work/in the afternoon. WITH MUSIC. This drowns out those horrible intrusive, self destructive thoughts.

- Establish a bedtime routine. I now drink a cup of 'sleep time' tea, read and meditate (simple guided meditation - try applications Headspace and Smiling Mind). Note the best sleep you get is before 12am. I am trying to go to bed earlier, and rise earlier. 

- When you feel up to leaving the house and visiting the supermarket, stock up on super easy (but healthy) foods. Cheese, nice bread, frozen veggies, fruit, eggs, yoghurt etc.

I hope these tips help you as much as they have helped me.

1102,I defeated a panic attack tonight,"My biggest fear is of something being wrong with my heart, due to a family history of heart disease. I woke up about 12:30AM with some pain in my chest. While my rational mind was saying ""it's just muscle pain,"" my irrational mind freaked out. Heart started racing, got sweaty, etc. Typical panic attack symptoms. 

I just laid in bed and did some deep breathing and mental exercises...thought about taking a Xanax to calm me down, but I wanted to stare this attack down and come out on top. 

And I did, about 30 minutes later or so. Chest pain went away, heart rate went down to close to normal, and I feel OK now. I'm wide awake - I think from all the adrenaline - but feel good otherwise. 

Being able to get control over an attack and ride it out without Xanax is s big step forward for me. ",56,2015-02-16 10:53:51 EST-0500

1107,"I did something really, really fucked up and don't know how to calm myself down","I'm mostly just looking for people to talk to... I need to get this off my chest.

Last night I went to a Mardi Gras party at one of my (very new) coworkers places. Our restaurant chain is all intertwined and I know many of the people who work at the other stores. We've never hung out outside of the restaurants and I don't know them very well, but they happened to all be there last night and I wanted to make good impressions.

Well that didn't happen... I had forgotten to refill my Zoloft prescription for 3 days and finally took it two hours before the party. As some probably know, SSRIs make alcohol affect you much, much harder, and on top of that we were all drinking heavily and having a good time. 

Somewhere in the night I went dark. I wake up in my bed today, vomit on my sheets, and a missing phone. I INSTANTLY felt like something was very wrong and ran to the bathroom where I started hyperventilating. I had NO recollection of the night past a point but I had this feeling in my gut that something bad happened... And apparently I was right. 

I called up my best friend (who was there) from my house phone and she told me and I quote ""you caused a scene. You should probably apologize to some people."" I felt my blood just go cold and started crying again. She then refused to tell me anything else ""while I was being hysterical"" so I hung up and proceeded to have an hour long fucking breakdown. I couldn't move onto the bed, couldn't eat or speak, I just curled up on the ground and hated myself and cried until I gagged.

I knew I had to do damage control so when my friend (with benefits... It's a weird situation) called my house, I instantly apologized and told him I don't know what I did but I know it was bad. He told me yes, it was a shit show where I apparently tried to drag another guy into the bedroom after just hooking up with him, sobbing uncontrollably, screaming back and forth at him, and refusing to leave. He said he had to FORCE me into my coworkers car so they could take me home. 

Then, as he gets me inside my house I go sit on the floor, cuss him out, and start hitting him and biting him (explains the massive bruise on my palm). I apologized sincerely and told him that I don't know what is wrong with me, but that I'm done with alcohol for a LONG time. He told me he accepts my apology and is not upset anymore, just worried because it seemed like I was drugged. My best friend and her boyfriend who drink with me OFTEN also said they've never seen me go off the deep end quite like this (I've been known to cry), but I wasn't drugged. That would that make a nice excuse if I was, but no.

I'm not a violent or hateful person sober. I'm reserved, perpetually anxious, level headed... And I've been drinking for years! I've NEVER been an emotionally disturbed drunk until recently, with all the crying and now this. I have no idea what's going on or how to make this right with everyone. I apologized to my coworker when she brought me my phone at work, and she said ""everyone was worried... It was bad."" I won't be surprised if I'm never invited to her place again. 

My best friend had texted my mom in the middle of the night expressing concern for me and my state. Her boyfriend (also my coworker) made fun of me all night at work for it. I can't show my face in the other restaurant anymore.

Please someone tell me you did something stupid at some point too and it all got better :( my mind won't stop replaying it over and over and over ",53,2015-02-19 13:49:55 EST-0500
1108,5-4-3-2-1 Exercise,"Hey, /r/Anxiety 

I'm a constant over thinker and have been for as long as I can remember.  In some aspects, it's actual very helpful, but in others it is a curse.  I just wanted to take a minute and share an exercise that was taught to me.  I've found it helps ground me in times of panic or while perseverating on a negative thought and keeps me in the current moment.  I tend to be a very practical person who has difficulty doing things like imagining peaceful scenes and the like, so this exercise with it's concrete instructions is really helpful.

I hope it's as helpful for you as it has been to me!

I learned this strategy from someone and it is really, really helpful for me when I need to focus on becoming more mindful of the present moment. She called it ""5,4,3,2,1"" and it goes like this:

Either say aloud or just think:

5 things you see

5 things you hear

5 things you smell

5 things you feel (physically)

4 things you see

4 things you hear

...

Until you get to 1.




At the end of this exercise you'll be much, much more focused upon the present moment and will hopefully be less focused upon perseverating on a negative thought or in a state of panic.

Edit: I'm glad to see that this exercise has helped so many people!  Thanks for taking the time to read!",31,2015-02-17 01:33:58 EST-0500
1109,Phone calls make me insanely anxious. Anyone else? Any advice?,"I have no idea why, but the idea of talking on the phone with a stranger fills me with paralyzing fear.  It's been this way for years.  I have no problem talking on the phone with people I know--I frequently call my wife, my mom and my grandparents for example.  But when it comes to talking to someone I don't know, it's like night and day.  I almost always avoid answering the phone when I get a call from an unknown number--which has caused me problems in the past as you might imagine, but I can't seem to stop doing it.  Answering the phone in that situation feels like trying to talk myself into jumping off something really high--I know I probably won't get hurt, but every instinct in my body is screaming at me that it's dangerous.  I just found out that I have to call someone for work this afternoon, and added to the anxiety of not knowing him is the fact that I don't really feel equipped to discuss the issue I need to talk to him about.  I've been battling flight-or-fight response for the past hour but I just don't see any way out of this.  I feel shaky right now just writing about it, I really don't know how I'm going to do this.",18,2015-02-18 22:43:50 EST-0500

I'm so glad I have what I have, I am where I am, and in the end, whatever happens at work is just temporary, and in the long term, it is even meaningless. So I should enjoy the process instead of stressing. I should be happy and mindful.

1122,Did you always have anxiety? Or did something trigger it one day? What happened on that day? How do you cope now?,"All of my life, I was a pretty outgoing person. I had a care free soul, and lived life to the absolute fullest. But that dreadful day on November 15th, 2014 changed everything. Up until then, I never gave much thought to anxiety or any mental illness for that matter. But when it struck me for the first time, I couldn't believe how awful and life changing this affects a person. 


It was honestly the most frightening moment of my life. When an anxiety attack strikes you for the first time - and you have no idea what's happening since you never experienced it before... I have never been so scared. 


I had been struggling with a ton of stress in my life for a magnitude of reasons, and for reasons I am ashamed to admit, dabbled into a cocktail of drugs on the night that it happened. Doing the drugs is what definitely set me overboard, and my brain finally just stopped and said ""I can't take this anymore!"" and thus, the beginning of my anxiety began.


I remember going to the washroom of the party and I looked in the mirror and I couldn't recognize the person in the mirror. I freaked out at my alien figure and started panicking. My neck tensed up and I could barely breathe. I fell to my knees and began blacking in and out. I started feeling intense brain zaps and felt like I was either a) having a seizure/stroke or b) I was about to die.


I ran out of the house, past my friends, and into my truck to drive myself to emergency. As I hopped into my truck, I started experiencing everything in 3rd person view. It felt like I had come out of my body and was observing myself from an overhead view of me panicking inside my truck. Was I fucking dead?!?! I didn't know at this point. Suddenly I came back into my body. And for some reason I was focused on the clock on my dashboard illuminating back at me. ""2:44"" it showed. I kept saying over and over again ""Time of death 2:44, time of death 2:44.."" I kept repeating that for some fucking reason, and all of the sudden I snapped back into reality... and I realized I was driving on THE HIGHWAY THE WHOLE TIME and was almost at the hospital. I have zero recollection of even driving from my friends house to the hospital. In my mind I was still in my friends driveway at the party just sitting inside my truck looking at the clock. 


I pull into the hospital and I hop out. Another wave of panic hits me. My neck begins to tense up. I fall down to my knees again and look up at the hospital and tell my brain ""You just gotta get through those doors."" I was fully convinced the hospital staff was going to find my dead body in the parking lot. I managed to get to my feet though and I walk into the hospital doors clenching my neck with my hands very tightly. I didn't realize that I was actually choking myself more than my neck was actually tense. The doctors see my state and get me into the ER. They sedated me immediately as I was in a huge fit and next thing I know I am waking up in hospital with a heart monitor attached to me and a nurse monitoring my vitals. Everything that had happened previous to that, just felt like a bad dream, but it all actually happened and I couldn't wrap my head around it. The kind doctor explained to me what happened, and they let me talk to a therapist for an hour, free of charge, and he explained to me what anxiety was and how it happens. They gave me anti-anxiety meds and I felt a million times better.


Ever since that dreadful evening on November 15th, 2014.. I still battle the odd anxiety. The antidepressants I am on really help in keeping my mind in control, but now that anxiety has been triggered, I feel like it will never quite go away. It will always linger in some degree. I've had attacks since, but I have been able to keep a rational head. However, I have develop hypochondria, and am always awfully aware of my own heart and what my brain is doing/thinking. It's safe to say I'll never be the same again, but I like to think this horrific thing that happened to me, and that has happened to all of us, will only make us better prepared for whatever we may have to battle in the future. 


**TL;DR** For those who want to skip my story, basically what I'm asking is, have you always had anxiety? Or did something happen on a particular day that triggered this horrifying mental illness on you? Have you learned to cope with it and manage your attacks?

These addictions make me happy when I am stressed, but the problem is they consume me. I will become to the point where I am obsessive about another individual. I think about them non stop and constantly want their attention, and when I don't get it, it's agonizing. I hate this about myself, and as you can imagine it causes me lots of problems in my personal life, especially so because I am married. I do not want this, but I am having a hard time battling it. I recently opened up to my Husband about it, and we are working on it in Therapy. I just want to know if anyone else out there has dealt with this, so perhaps I don't feel so alone.

I literally screamed and shouted at myself and punched a mirror. I threw every thing that I could get a hold of across the room, and I flipped my chair upside down. I turned my room into a shipwreck, all because I'm too much of a perfectionist and anxious fuck to accept that people make mistakes sometimes.

1135,"I DID IT! I auditioned, and I made it in!","So for the past 3 weeks or so I have been freaking out and practicing constantly on my double bass.  Not long before I received an email saying that a jazz/rock group wanted me to audition for them, and I also got an email from a local orchestra saying that they wanted an audition too. At first I was super excited, as this was huge for a new bassist like me (only 2 years playing so far)! But then I remembered that I would have to audition, and that meant playing solo pieces in front of people who are judging my every move. Ohhh man, that did not sound like fun. But even though I was scared, I decided to do it. I dedicated the next few weeks to practicing every night.

Then the first audition came for the orchestra. I was so, so nervous. I had my piece, but in my mind it wasn't perfect yet. So I reluctantly dragged myself over and when it was my turn I was sweating so much. As I played my song, my hands shook, so it wasn't that great sounding, but it wasn't terrible either. When I was done I glanced at the people judging me and they just said ""We'll get in touch with you"". Then I shakily left, feeling very disappointed because I wasn't sure what that meant. I assumed I didn't get in. It didn't help that I never received the email, either. I had to write them an email saying ""Excuse me, but did I get in?"" on the night of the first rehearsal because I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to show up or not. Turns out I did get in, they thought they made it obvious, but I guess in my anxiety-ridden mind I didn't notice. I was (and am) so happy! I played at the rehearsal that night and while it was a bit lonely being the only lower-strings player there, it was fun, and I can't wait to go again this week.

Then, only a couple days ago, I had my jazz audition. This one was almost more stressful because I knew that this was pretty much exclusively a university band, and here I was still in high school. Thankfully, the leader of the band was very kind and helped me carry my bass downstairs and was pretty chill throughout the whole audition. When I made a mistake on my second (arco) piece he actually helped me with it. He even said I had great sound! Then he said I should stay because the rehearsal was in a couple minutes so I could see if I liked the repertoire and their style. I stayed, and though the songs were a lot more difficult then I was used to (rhythm-wise, because jazz is weird!) it was nice having a challenge. He told me to take the music home and I'm going back next week, so I guess I made it into this one too!

I'm so happy. I can't believe I only started two years ago yet I've made it so much farther than I ever imagined. My only worry is school work - Practice and playing is going to take up most of my free time, but maybe I can work something out with my teachers.

1138,I have severe anxiety and need to turn in my two weeks' notice so I can start a better job. I'm panicking about talking to my manager and could use some advice.,"The idea of turning in my notice at work has my anxiety through the roof. One of the biggest triggers for my anxiety is feeling like I'm disappointing someone or letting them down by having to give bad news. My anxiety has been even worse than it normally is because I was raped last year and am currently in therapy for it. 

In mid-August, I got a job as a sever and bartender at a small restaurant. On paper, the job was perfect: walking distance from home, good atmosphere, early closing, etc. I've been here over a month and I feel like I'm being taken advantage of by my coworkers, who are all women in their 40's. I'm the only employee in the restaurant without manager privilege (which is fine), but I basically am the whipping girl because they blame things on me and randomly assign me shifts that conflict with my therapy schedule (which I told them about) because they want to take random days odd. I'm fine with having to deal with shit as the new girl, but I've had to miss 3 therapy sessions and another one tomorrow. I'm also making no money because I'm given tiny sections. I'm lucky to make fifty bucks a week. 

I applied for a job on a whim and found out that I got it. It pays extremely well and I know the owners, and I'm being offered amazing hours and benefits. At first I thought I'd just work two jobs, but the benefits of staying at the bar are outweighed by the benefits of quitting to focus on the new job. I start the new job in a week and I know I need to give notice. 

The idea of telling my manager, who is extremely intimidating, is making me almost ill with worry. The last time I turned in notice, I practiced talking to my manager for a week.  I quit my last job when a manager threw coffee at me, so no need there. 

I understand logically that it should be easy and I just need to get it out there. I'm not stupid, I get that. Knowing that doesn't make me panic any less. I guess I'm looking for help communicating succinctly and professionally (I'm an anxious rambler) and minimizing the panic as much as possible, if that's a thing. ",12,2015-09-28 06:26:23 EDT-0400

1148,I got into a car accident last night.,"I've had a stressful week and I just need to talk. 

It's mostly been good stress because I have a job interview today for a new position at my company. I've been preparing like a madwoman. 

Now this has nudged my anxiety a little, but it's nothing I couldn't manage. 

For all the technical jargon I have panic disorder and agoraphobia. The panic disorder is exacerbated by potential medical issues and thoughts of mortality.  This leads to lots of obsessive thoughts. One in particular is when I drive I sometimes have thoughts about what would happen if I was in an accident and died.  Those thoughts started about 5 years ago and fed into the development of agoraphobia. I can proudly say that I caught that early and I have been managing my anxiety with medication ever since. It feels great to have my life back and my dose is high enough so I can function regularly without the obsessive thoughts but low enough so that it doesn't give me the stereotypical side effects of being a zombie. I still get anxious from time to time and I deal with it in healthy ways. 

But last night. 

My boyfriend was at a meeting and had forgotten some important papers and asked if I could drop them off. I was cat sitting so I had to go out anyway. I agreed. I've never been to the location before and it was dark out. I drove past it and pulled into a parking lot to turn around. 

I waited for a couple cars to pass (I had to turn left back out onto the road) and saw a motorcycle approaching. 

I can't remember everything clearly and maybe he was speeding, I just remember calculating that I had enough time. 

I didn't. 

I realized right away and halfway out I slammed on my breaks. He swerved but clipped my front corner and lost his balance. He went about 20 feet and was thrown from the bike.  The collision (for me) was mild and I just lost part of my bumper. There was no whiplash or anything. I was stopped when it happened. 

I was out of the car and calling 911 instantly at his side. 

His foot was fucking cocked sideways but he was conscious. People came and helped. It wasn't until I started talking to the police officer that it began to sink in. And I started shaking. When I called my boyfriend I was sobbing. And I cried for hours. 

The guy was okay,  thank God. He was fully protected. Helmet, gloves, leather jacket, pants, etc. I see so many people without helmets. I can't even imagine. His ankle is broken. That's all. I am so relieved.  

It was determined that I was at fault because my car was in the road, obstructing traffic - for lack of better term. Because he hit me with the side of his bike there was virtually no damage to that so they cannot determine if he was speeding. I will tell you, the skid mark on the road wasn't very long. 

My state has a law where when there is an accident resulting in death or serious injury all parties involved have to submit to a blood draw to make sure everyone was sober. (If he was drunk, apparently I'm still at fault.) 

So off to the hospital I went. By now my boyfriend had shown up and was able to drive me.  I got one of those nifty puke bags in the er. And I still have it by my side because my stomach still hasn't settled. 

I gave the blood but was floored that they didn't want to know any medical history (like current medications) remember the panic disorder. I felt an anxiety attack coming on because when the doctor rolled up the cart I was dizzy. But I managed because I find that projecting my feelings like that to be embarrassing. And I had already been seen sobbing by so many people.  So I breathed and the anxiety passed. 

I went home with a migraine and my boyfriend and I cried and were relieved that I was okay. He tucked me into bed and I passed out pretty quickly. 

I woke up at 2:30. It's 5am. I can't sleep. 

Things are bothering me. 

His name is John, he's 40 and married.  I (dumbly) asked him if he was okay when I first crouched next to him. He snapped no. Duh, I should have asked any other question. 

I never got to apologize to John.  Insurance takes care of all the dirty work so well never see each other. It's so odd how people come into each other's lives so briefly and that's it. I feel like there should have been more but I didn't think it was appropriate to try and reach out once everything was all said and done. I had a long day, John had a longer one.  So, John I can't even begin to express how sorry I am.  I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive. I hope you recover quickly and I hope you are not afraid to get back on your bike. 

I know I'm afraid to get into my car. 

I was scared when my boyfriend drove. 

And in a few hours I have to go sit in an office and pretend that everything is stellar and wow the managers. 

I only live five minutes from work but I know that it's going to feel a lot longer than that. 

How do I move forward?  If my driving anxiety becomes as bad as it used to be again what can I do to help nip it in the bud?  My panic disorder makes taking strong sedatives a challenge because I panic over the side effects. 

Any advice on moving past a traumatic event when you suffer from anxiety?

Thanks for reading. 

EDIT: thank you all for the amazing support and advice. I will be replying to each of you as I can. I've been pretty drained the past couple days but I'm doing a lot better.  I nailed my interview (I had to interview with 4 different managers). I should know about the job in a couple weeks. The drive to work was fine.  Since I had been up all night and the interview lasted 2 1/2 hours I crashed when I got home.  Yesterday I tracked down my license plate. The body shop that picked it up was 20min away. I had to get it or get one reissued since my state is a 2 plate state. That drive was a little nerve wracking. I tried to get out of it by my boyfriend and friends were working and I didn't want to risk the plate getting tossed.  Also I owed it to myself to go.  I think I was mostly anxious because the driving was accident related and not so much that I was driving. 

My dad has graciously offered to deal with our insurance company for me so I don't have to go through that stress. I think the police also sent info to them as well. I gave the officer my insurance card. I am still on my fathers insurance (I'm 25, were holding off as long as we can to keep rates down) and the car is still legally his but I'm the primary driver. So hopefully when it comes to that mess all I'll have to do is pay my deductible and watch my rates go up again. It's funny because like 3 days before the accident I was talking about the last time my rates went up. It was in 2009 that I got busted with transportation of alcohol by a minor. I was saying how it's almost been long enough that it should no longer affect my rates/driving record/employment/etc and then this happened. Ha. 

So my silence has not been anything serious, I've just be exhausted. I will reply to you all over the next few days. Thanks so much for your love and support. I love you all!",7,2015-09-22 13:10:42 EDT-0400

1152,"If you understand your SO's anxiety and help them to cope, you're the best!","I just started experiencing anxiety about 2 months ago. It was super scary when I first had an attack and all the physical affects afterwards because I had no idea what it was. After two trips to the walk-in clinic and some blood work, I figured out I am healthy and just have anxiety. I started doing a lot of reading into it and tried to understand anxiety. I saw multiple things all over the Internet where people said anxiety put strains on their relationships because their SO's did not understand. This worried me a little. 
This past week was bad for me anxiety wise and I was constantly going to my SO for support. I felt needy and I was worried it would push him away. I would tell him every time I started to feel bad or anxious like he could fix it in some way. He didn't always know what to do, but he will still there for me. 

This past weekend he messaged me one night after I had left and asked me exactly how I feel when anxiety comes on. He replied asking me if I get a ""feeling of urgency euphoria and slight tingling in the body, stiffness cramp muscular tension hot flashes, and emotional sensitive to changes in environment."" I said yes, that is exactly how I feel. He used to LSD a long time ago and said that is how he felt 20-30 minutes after taking. He completely understands how I feel now and is much better/more sensitive to me when I tell him it is happening.

1160,Does anyone feel as if they have lost their identity and personality because of anxiety?,"About 2 years ago, in the summer between 9th and 10th grade, I developed social anxiety and panic disorder out of nowhere. At that time I was taking some extra classes at a community college, and I took the bus there everyday. When I was on the bus I started thinking that people where staring at me, and when people spoke to me anywhere, I would freeze and take a long time to talk. I had never experienced anything like this before, and after a few months of having anxiety, I became depressed. When 10th grade started I realized that all of the inside jokes and things that I used to talk about with friends didn't come to mind anymore, and I began to OCD (which I had since 5th grade but much more mild) excessively in an effort to cure my anxiety, but as a result became mentally exhausted afterschool. By the end of the semester my GPA was a 2.7 and for some reason, I didn't care that much anymore like I used to. Before I had anxiety, my GPA was a 3.8 and I dreamed of going to an Ivy League and taking more challenging courses throughout my highschool career. In the past two months, I have realized that I have lost my direction in life and sometimes the world and my former self, seem so unfamiliar to me. I feel like I mimic the thoughts and actions of other people because I have lost mine, but I can't remember who I used to be. I am currently in 11th grade and doing much better in school since I have received treatment for my OCD, but I feel like my way of speaking has been ""dumbed-down"" in a way and that my true personality is trapped beneath this layer of anxiety.  Does anyone else notice that they don't speak like their unique selves and that they can't speak as quickly or intelligently as they used too?

1169,"People on anxiety medication, what was your ""aha moment"" when you realized it was working and you should keep going?","Was diagnosed a few months ago with dysthymia and anxiety and have been on citalopram. Had to adjust to a higher dose over the holidays. It was tough. It's been tough since the beginning, but I want to get better so I've been trudging through it without feeling like anything's changed. 

Today I had my first real ""aha"" moment that maybe the citalopram and talk therapy are working so I should keep going with this path of treatment. I want to share and see what yours was, what was the first positive change you noticed that helped you push forward?

I'm now living with two new people in my house after 5 years of living with my (now ex) boyfriend. For the past couple years I had routines and systems and things were done a certain way. For instance I had a system to my dish cupboard and it used to bother me when things weren't put away ""my way"". It was something so trivial but would set me off. I would have to reorganize it right away because if I sat on the couch, I'd know the glasses weren't right. I'd get anxious and annoyed. Not a major anxiety attack, of course, but definitely not the response of a normal person who found that the small glasses were switched around with the tall ones.

Today my newest houseguest decided to be nice and empty the dishwasher. She's only been here a couple weeks so she doesn't know where everything goes. Most of the glassware and plates had been washed up,so the cupboards were blank canvasses.I opened the cupboard to find she put it away completely differently than I would have. And I just grabbed a glass and closed the cupboard.

It's something small, not earth shattering, but something that 12 months ago me would get worked up over. Even six months ago I would have taken everything out and put the dishes away "" in the right place they belonged"" because the anxiety of having my order upside down would upset me. But today it didn't bother me, and I thought, ""this is progress.""

It's enough to keep going at it. I can see that if I'm not spending so much time letting little things lead to bigger anxiety issues, I am letting go of some of my triggers and can focus on more positive things.I can see it starting to work and it gives me some hope.

***tl;dr*** I finally saw that my medication is working with my anxiety when I didn't freak out over dishes not being put away how I was used to. Interested in everyone else's first realization that maybe things were getting better?",36,2015-01-09 05:43:33 EST-0500

It's as though they think people with anxiety are incapable of doing certain things, when that is not true. It's unfair to question someone's mental health because it doesn't fit your description of how they should act. 

I am medicated for anxiety, have gone to counselling and therapy, do meditation and yoga, and yes, because of that there are times when I feel like I can push myself into doing things that require confidence. Those are the good days, and I am grateful for them, while this person uses it as ammunition to invalidate my problems. 

Has anyone else encountered this? ",95,2015-08-17 21:27:07 EDT-0400
1179,Does anyone else's anxiety make them feel like everyone else's life is much better than yours?,"This is something I've been having a lot of trouble with, but basically, even though my life is objectively quite good, I feel like all of my friends are having a much better life than me. To the point where if one of those friends tries to talk to me about them having their own anxiety, I don't believe them and I think that they're just putting it on or are over-exaggerating their symptoms (and I don't know their lives, so I can't say that).

Reddit, for one, has me convinced that everyone in every other country has life better than me because I live in the US. I will admit that living here has some downsides (harder to travel to different countries, have to pay for medical insurance, Republicans), but my life has certainly never been bad. I live in a city with 3% unemployment and I'm in college on a full ride. Shits great. But I feel like my situation would immediately be improved if I were to move to any other country in the first world.  I feel like it would ""heal"" my anxiety the same way moving to the desert can ""heal"" allergies, in a sense. Even though I like where I live and definitely don't feel like uprooting my life. 

So when my friends from other countries tell me about their anxiety, I offer support but I have a lot more trouble buying it on a personal level. The same happens with my richer/prettier/smarter friends living here in the US. I had a younger friend who absolutely idolized the shit out of me and emulated everything I did. One day, she came to me nearly in tears about how she felt like she was a failure because she procrastinated sometimes. She asked me if that was okay. I was like ""Yeah, I've definitely done the same thing, but I still get good grades"" and her eyes got real big and she said ""*You* procrastinate?? I never would have ever thought that. I've been studying diligently as much as I can every night to be more like you because I felt insecure about my abilities compared to you"". I was so shocked. This girl, in my opinion, is way smarter than me, and she looked up to me. I was so doubtful of that. It seemed impossible that anyone would ever want to be like me or live a life like mine. 

I feel ungrateful. I am ungrateful, and that makes my anxiety worse, but I can't be happy with my life for some reason. I also have OCD, so I'm always obsessively looking up negative things about my country/city/school/race, you name it. I am literally obsessed with that.

1182,Anyone else here that can't even enjoy their weekends because anxiety from job?,"I just started a new job. Tomorrow is my first day without having help immediately available.

My palms are sweating even typing this. This whole weekend, and weekends while training, I couldn't even enjoy my time off because my anxiety causes me to stress even when I'm out and supposed to be enjoying myself. I'm watching movies til 3 or 4AM just to keep my mind occupied. When it ends, my heart sinks and I start into panic mode.

I spoke with my employees about it and they laughed it off like why are you worrying about something 2 days away?

I can't help it and I'm so annoyed by it. I don't even want to go to bed tonight. I've been having dreams that are obviously stress related and I wake up every hour on the hour, in anticipation of having to wake up.

It's not just this job, it's been every job. But with me being new I feel like I won't pick up on it quick enough and have an embarrassing crying/panic attack.

1183,An anxiety cause and effect checklist (I know how much you guys like lists),[deleted],7,2015-08-20 00:44:45 EDT-0400
1184,"How I Crushed Anxiety, in the hopes it helps or reassures you all :)","Hey everyone!
I'm new to Reddit and found this sub, how I wish I know it was here when I was at my worst. Anyway, the last few months I have finally overcome my Social Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder, it was a long, exhausting and arduous process which I thought would never end, but it did, so here's my tale.

I don't want to get too personal but a fair amount of distressing situations occurred when I was in my late teens and early twenties. I started to develop these weird feelings before leaving the house, no matter where I was going. I would feel nauseous, dizzy, I would cry for no reason and many other symptoms I'm sure you're all familiar with. As months went on these escalated, I would be out in public when suddenly my body would shut down, my arms and legs would go numb and I would pass out cold right there on the street.

When I woke up from these panic attacks I would feel as if I was on deaths door, but I didn't know they were panic attacks and being the repressive person I was, I ignored them.

Eventually I realised I had anxiety. I'm a *fixer* so I wanted to beat this as quickly as possible, which is not exactly the right attitude but it got me started.

I started going to therapy for an hour every week, getting tips on mindfulness, meditation, exercising and did this for a year. My second year in therapy I felt basically no better, I decided to try medication as well. Well this was an extra adventure! I went on Mirtazipine, which made me gain weight and a bunch of other side effects with small progress being made, as well as adjusting doses and having to be incredibly patient as these drugs take time. After six months on this medication I stated being able to be social again, I still had symptoms of anxiety but the full blown panic attacks were gone, so my confidence rose each time I went for a walk or caught up with a friend (which was still very rare and included a lot of last minute panic bails on my part).

This year I started my third year in therapy and I've been on Mirtazipine for a year. After only four weeks my therapist cut the cord and told me to go live my life. I was shitting myself.

But, the amazing thing was I was crushing it. Three years ago I couldn't walk down the street without my mind screaming, my body doing it's whole crazy show and dance and having to run home.

But I've gone to parties, social events, exhibitions and even a job interview and four hour job trial with basically no anxiety at all. My confidence is back and I am so so proud.

It may take time, it may take resilience, practise, patience, commitment and most importantly it may take help. But if I can do it, you can all do it.

Everything is temporary and this too shall pass. That was the best line I ever heard on my journey; ""this too shall pass."" 

You will get your confidence back, you will be yourself again and you're not going to feel this shit for the rest of your life. You can come out the other side and fucking high five yourself with every little bit of progress you make. It all counts, every little step forward is a huge accomplishment so be kind to yourself and reward your victories.

If you have questions fire away, like I said I'm a noob so I might be slow to reply but I will reply.

I wish you all the best and truly truly hope you can come out the other side of this like I did.",11,2015-08-15 15:45:49 EDT-0400
1185,9 things I wish people understood about anxiety.,[deleted],9,2015-08-21 04:24:37 EDT-0400
1186,just wanted to say thank you for existing /r/anxiety,"i found this place a few days ago and since then i looked thru some posts, i was really surprised at how much i could relate to you guys, people around me don't seem to struggle with the things i do and knowing that somebody out there feels the same, makes me feel less alone ",18,2015-08-20 23:44:55 EDT-0400
1187,Insecurity about my intelligence and anxiety is stopping me from moving onto the next stage of my life,"A bit of background: I'm a recent graduate from a prestigious college with a strong STEM degree and have moved back to my hometown whilst applying for jobs. During high school I was confident, had lots of friends and a girlfriend. I've always done quite well academically and feel as though this is where I got a lot of my confidence during my teenage years.

Since going to college my confidence slowly started to decrease as my anxiety increased. This last semester I went to around 5% of my classes and just studied in my room or in the library which probably made me miss out on many opportunities to meet new people. During my graduation a few weeks ago I was surrounded by very smart people and I felt like an imposter. I felt as though I was only there because of the huge amount of work I put into my studies as opposed to any natural intelligence I thought I might have. I guess this insecurity is the result of being used to being a little smarter than my peers at school to becoming completely average at college. These people at college seemed to be living awesome lives while still bossing their studies.

Since being home I've done absolutely nothing with my time. I leave the house 1-2 times a week to see old school buddies but that's it. I really have to psyche myself up before leaving the house and feel very anxious when doing so because I'm afraid of what people will think and expect of me. I keep having family/friends congratulate me on my graduation, telling me how smart I am and how successful I'm going to be. I know they are being sincere but I hate it. These people seem to think I have my shit together and that I'm a confident young man ready to conquer the world. These expectancies combined with the fact I'm really insecure have stopped me from applying to jobs because I think they'll just see through me at the interview and realise that I'm not as smart as my resume makes me out to be. I'm 21 and should be moving onto the next stage of my life but these insecurities have put my life on pause.

I'm not entirely sure what I expect from posting this, but as a lot of people say it is nice to write it down and vent a little. Plus if you made it this far thank you for taking the time to read my post.",12,2015-08-19 06:17:57 EDT-0400

1190,Why do I have to be cursed with anxiety?,Why do I have to be cursed with this bullshit. Why do I have to doubt everything even my amazing relationship with this girl. Why do I have to live with this bullshit that takes over my life in ruins everything. Why do I have to struggle to keep me going. Why do I have to have thoughts of ending it all because I can't deal with this anxiety. Why do I after two months with feeling normal for once have to have everything to come back and make me now want to live do to anxiety. Why do I a 16 year old teenager have to have a mental illness like GAD. WHY do I have to deal with this bullshit and constant stress and shouldn't just stop living?

1191,How can I overcome social anxiety? I'm so lonely.,"I'm 16 years old and I'm going to be a junior in high school. Ever since last year I've been incredibly anti social. The few people I'm friends with I do talk to and enjoy talking to them, but when it comes to meeting other people my age I'm horrible at it. I'm only good at talking to people like 20 years older than me. All of my friends have things to do. Girlfriends, visiting family, going out with other friends. And I'm stuck with nothing. I try to arrange plans with some of my close friends but they're all living their own social life. It doesn't help that I'm 6'5 and people always stare at me, it just makes my anxiety worse. I can never approach girls because I'm afraid they'll view me as creepy and I don't want to take the risk. The few girls that have decided to come up to me were immediately turned off by how socially inept I am.

I'm seriously thinking about receiving medical help for this. Any advice?",29,2015-08-20 04:06:38 EDT-0400
1192,Sugar: the main cause of my anxiety was (literally) under my nose the whole time,"I wanted to share this with this subreddit, because although I haven't posted much here, it's been the thing that helped me out most on some particularly bad days, and was the original reason I started realising there was a name for the ohgodeverythingisshitwhyme feelings that only I seemed to get. It's a bit long, cos I wanted to get out my story once and for all in the hopes that someone out there is struggling in a similar way and it could help them. 

So I have anxiety. I guess I always have had, although as I've gotten older (early twenties now) got more responsibilities (a job, serious college, a flat, money) and more to lose (an excellent boyfriend, a damn good life), it has gotten significantly worse. I also have a problem with worrying about the past and unfortunately the older you get, the more past there is to worry about.

My anxiety could be about anything, but typically is focused on insecurity and needing to be in control. My boyfriend is the one who knows the worst of it - the crying fits because I burnt the eggs one morning after him making jokes about me being a terrible cook, for example. Inside my own head is where it's really bad though, the constant obsessive thought patterns going over and over the same things to the point where I can't concentrate on anything else. You all know the drill, probably. 

So for the last six months I have been trying to get this under control, as I started to realise there was something ""wrong"" with me. I have all the tactics that there is out there, to do with obsessive thought patterns and anxiety. I could even get them to work sometimes, even a lot of the time on good days. I would say I went from 90% anxious thoughts to about 70%. But it still wasn't enough. I would still be calmly watching TV in the evening and then suddenly spiral into a pit of despair because of one of my regular thoughts coming back to me. It was better, but still hell. 

I went on a trip with the aforementioned boyfriend for a week, and was amazed to find how relaxed and happy I was. But seeing what it was like to not be wound up like a spring the whole time, then having to come back to ""normal life"" and get thrown back into the anxiety just made everything worse. I made the decision that I hadn't wanted to reach the point of: I was going to get on meds within the next month. 

Then I was browsing the internet one night and came across an article linking sugar to anxiety. Figured it was bullshit, but did some more research, and found a lot of things supporting it. This was interesting, you see, because I am a coke addict. Not that kind, the coca cola kind. At my worst I could drink a 2 litre a day easily, but about a year and half ago I gave that up for the sake of my health. For a while I gave it up entirely, but just replaced it with sprite or lucozade, because I felt sluggish and tired without any sugary drinks. So when I read this article I had been falling off the wagon a little, and for the past 2-3 months had been having at least one, if not two, cans/small bottles of coke a day. 

So I decided I would give them up completely for a while and see.

The next day, I skipped my normal lunch-time coke at work. Twenty minutes later, I got a splitting headache which didn't go away until about eight pm. I figured this would happen, but it was still shite. I drank only water. The morning was the same, I got all caught up worrying about small stuff. But the afternoon, that was when I noticed the difference. Even if a usual worry came to mind, it was much easier to brush it aside and see the situation rationally. And that was just after one missed regular sugar fix. In the evening after work, I was much calmer and relaxed, (and, bonus, didn't crash in front of the telly at ten o clock like I normally do). I'm sure I must have skipped sugary drinks at some point in the last couple of years, (although it's very possible that I didn't...) but this was the first time that I'd paid attention to how it affected my anxiety. And I saw what a big difference it was making.

I have kept it up for two weeks now. The headaches stopped after a few days. In the first few days I would also still get a few small episodes of genuinely worrying about something, but the more time went on, the more I was able to relax. 

I'm so much happier and calmer...over such a stupid reason. I'm genuinely annoyed at myself for not seeing it sooner. If a brain is naturally prone to overthinking and worrying, why would I think it was a good idea to provide it with excess energy that a desk job or college work just wasn't going to burn? As a side note, I think that's what happened on the holiday to make me so relaxed - it was chock-full of physical activity to burn off the sugar I put into myself. 

Sugar may not be the actual cause of my anxiety, that's just how my brain is wired, but it has clearly been acting as a fuel for it for a long time. And being on a constant sugar crash afterwards was probably causing the negativity I seemed to always feel. Taking away the sugar doesn't completely take away the anxiety, but it makes it a hell of a lot easier to control. I would say I'm at around 20-30% anxious thoughts now.

So there you are. It's not going to help everyone, but I can't be the only one who is overly sensitive to sugar like this. If it sounds this could be you, just give it a try, because it's the best thing I could ever have done for myself.
