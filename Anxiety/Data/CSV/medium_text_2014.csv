On silence and Marshawn Lynch,"Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch didn’t talk to reporters all year. It’s Super Bowl week, and now he’s talking… but not really. (He’s getting assistance, if that helps.)The Pro Football Writers of America aren’t happy. Specifically, they are “extremely disappointed.”Let’s discuss this:This is in Marshawn Lynch’s contract. He is required to meet with the media. That has to be placed in bold; speaking with the media isn’t optional, it’s contractual. There are monetary penalties for all players who refuse to speak to reporters.When players snub reporters, it makes them look bad and it makes the team look bad. If a player continually snubs reporters, the reporters go right to the team’s brass — or, if need be, the reporter’s bosses go right to the team’s brass. Sponsorship and advertising deals are significant, the media reminds the team. Getting reported on and receiving positive press is a privilege, not an expectation. The media-team relationship is a partnership with mutual benefits.That said, let’s step away from Lynch and talk personality types. There’s extreme shyness and fear of attention and anxiety and all sorts of other traits that arise in a situation like this. The fear of public speaking is one of the most widespread in the country, right up there with fear of snakes and heights.Look at the player’s perspective on Super Bowl Media Day, via Richard Sherman’s lens:Can you blame a player for getting even a little uncomfortable in the face of that crush? It’s claustrophobic. It’s frightening. You can understand why a player would prefer a simple one-on-one in comparison.My Lansing Lugnuts had a player, a good one, who would receive interview requests. They made him anxious; whenever he could, he would turn them down. Every now and then, he would sigh and uncomfortably say yes. It was painful.*So, in conclusion: Marshawn Lynch, like every other player, should talk to the media… but I understand why he would really rather not. He’s most definitely not alone among athletes.The media, being the media, is naturally sympathetic.EDIT: Oh yes, very sympathetic.",2014
"When You Can’t Connect, Don’t Fix It; Let The Fire Take You","Originally published at stronginsideout.com on February 23, 2014. Hey, Strongies. I wrote this a couple weeks ago, but debated posting it as I always do with posts like this. As much as I write about depression and struggle, opening up here while I was in it seemed particularly frightening this time around. After a few weeks mulling over whether I should or not, I decided to share this with you because I think it’s good for me to show you all that I don’t feel strong all the time. I still struggle, and I still fight. But there are times when I just need to sit back, stop “fixing” it, and let the fire take me… ***** Today, I want to talk about the heavy stuff. I want to talk about when you try to get excited for celebrations or holidays because you see that other people are, but you just can’t connect to the smile. There’s a dead space between you and emotion. The fuse just refuses to fire. I want to talk about when you just think about connecting, you get the same kind of feelings that you would if you considered trying to stick your hand in a wood-chipper. It feels like the threat of a frighteningly uncomfortable event that you’re absolutely sure you won’t enjoy, and that you’ll regret later. I want to talk about the heavy stuff because I’m in it right now. Last night, I went to a yoga class that started out amazing. I had been looking forward to a yoga class to open myself back up again. I was feeling very closed off, unproductive, and just plain depressed if we’re going to go for buzz words. The teacher was refreshingly funny, and also great at cuing and being present with the class in the movements. Moving my body and reconnecting with myself, I felt free for the first time all day. I felt alive for the first time all week. …until she said, “Grab a partner.” …and I immediately got furious at her. “How dare she interrupt my time,” I thought, alight in rage. I stared at the others like the kid on the sidelines of the playground who prefers to play with his toys all alone. After the partner exercise was done, she asked the class, “Now wasn’t that fun?” Everyone nodded, eyes wide with enthusiasm, as I sat staring at the floor. “Wasn’t that exciting?!” she egged them on. This time people responded with woops and hollers as I stayed silent, pretending to be terribly interested in the stretch I was doing. “That’s right!” she continued. “And it’s all from making that connection. You have to be open to connecting, to the joy of the connected experience.” I think my eyes became flame throwers at this point in class. I certainly wasn’t one with my pranayama breath, I’ll tell you that much. The rest of class I fought back tears (at least I was feeling something again). My insides fought like angry animals, a manifestation of the shame and embarrassment I felt for having been one of the only people who declined to participate. When we finally hit savasana, I let the tears roll down my temples and soak into my hair, dripping in dull thuds on my mat. All I was thinking was this: “What’s wrong with me?” What’s wrong with me? Sound familiar? Any time we feel something deeply negative, we search for how to fix it. Something must be wrong with us. We must be doing something incorrectly to be in this state. After all, everyone else is happy but you, right? Right? I’ve built Strong Inside Out around the idea that you can control much of your mental and physical well-being by taking action, which is the truth. There reaches a point, however, in which you just need to stop “fixing,” and let the fire burn out so that you may rise up again. Here’s the truth… you may not be ready to accept it: you’re going to feel all the heavy stuff sometimes. You won’t understand what’s going on, and you’ll fight with yourself to rediscover “normal.” You’ll be disappointed when you can’t tap into it immediately. You’ll look at people around you, wondering how they can chat light-heartedly, talking so easily with other people. You’ll think that you’ll never be able to do that again, that it will be like this forever. But you will. Eventually, you’ll come out of it. This, too, shall pass. These feelings are not wrong. In fact, they’re necessary. If you never struggled, how would you grow? How would you ever become the strong fighter you are working to be without first facing something that teaches you how to be strong? Strength without struggle is like fire without kindling. You cannot rise from the ashes without burning up first. [tweet] Though it’s heavy and dark and smothering while you’re in it, the struggle gives you the opportunity to grow stronger. It’ not something to be “fixed,” it’s something to be lived through. Let it be what it is, and you’ll come out clearer, more grateful, and with more fight than you went in with. I know I’m not alone right now, even if I can’t connect with anyone around me. This fire won’t burn forever. ***** I made this image back when I was feeling this way to keep my head up in the flames. I hope it can help you the next time you start burning, too. All my love, support and fire go out to you, whether you’re heavy right now or not. I’m all smoldered out, and now I’m on the rise again. You will be soon, too. Stay strong (even when you’re not feeling it), Am Amy Clover is a speaker, writer and mental health advocate.

Getting over anxiety and staying calm in the digital world,"But we’re just hurting ourselves when we let such stimuli run rampant in our minds, aren’t we? How does one slowly climb back up from the fall? Charlie Hoehn explains how to do this in his post, “How to Systematically Cure Your Anxiety.” In his article, he itemizes a list of to-do items to attempt in your next month. Some of it will seem like common sense if you’ve attempted to better yourself through diet or adjusting your psychology. Even so, they’re excellent reminders to keep at it. I’ll summarize with a quick list below, and you can check out his article for the nitty gritty details. 1. Take away negative stimuli and replace them with the positive (stop watching the news if it depresses you, unfollow online contacts who consistently write negative posts, etc.) 2. Make sure you get enough quality sleep (keep your phone away from your bed, keep your room dark, maintain optimal 68–70 degree temperature, install Flux to optimize your computer screen’s brightness, eliminate caffeine after 5pm, shut down electronic media at 9pm and get ready for bed at 10pm) 3. Engage in social sports or any workout that’s fun for you (bonus points for frolicking outdoors) — I personally like running and find it meditative… It’s a solo endeavor, but, oh, well. 4. Eat better (eliminate sugars and gluten — I’m not so stringent on this one — and drink up to 1/2 cup of coffee in the morning, eliminate junk food, take B vitamins and fish oil, eat lunches and dinners comprised of meat + veggies + healthy sides like nuts and berries, no alcohol, skip breakfast — not sure about this one either) Personally, I’ve cut out sugars, junk food and most simple starches, but I’m not about to give up grains entirely (I just don’t keep them at home). I also recently realized that I ought to cut out some coffee during the week as it induces nervousness and triggers the release of adrenaline, which stimulates the fight-or-flight reaction in the brain. I don’t think I need much adrenaline unless I plan on facing a bear in the woods. (Don’t get me wrong; I’m pro-coffee if you can handle it.) I’ve just downloaded Flux and find it very soothing. It changes the temperature and brightness of your computer display as time progresses throughout the day. I plan on shutting my electronics earlier (it’s currently 8:19pm, so I’m not off track yet). I don’t plan on skipping breakfasts. As for alcohol, well, I’ve been cutting back a bit as well. I stick with red wine whenever I can and avoid going over the two-drink limit for guys. Key word is “avoid,” so I still have to work on that. What do you think about these suggestions? Leave a comment of what works for you and maybe I’ll try it out.",2014
50 Seconds to Presence [+ Audio],"Originally published at stronginsideout.com on February 9, 2014. Many of the problems we face in everyday life stem from being caught up in everything but the present. Depression and anxiety, two of the most common ailments amongst Strongies, is caused by worrying about things that have occurred in the past or that might occur in the future. Might. Mindfulness is the key to taking back control of your life from these energy-sucks. It’s time to be happy already. And here’s the good news: it really takes no time at all. In fact, we’re going to do it in 50 seconds max. It’s a really simple exercise that–with practice and consistency–will prove utterly invaluable to your sanity. I started doing this exercise when I was working my way through cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD treatment. When I would walk away from a trigger situation without performing a behavior, anxiety would smother me like a wet wool blanket. I’d feel incredibly panicky, and it would be hard to breathe. With the help of my therapist, I’d practice this mindfulness exercise to root myself in the present. Though it was a bit different for me because I was working on specifically stopping certain behaviors, the structure of the exercise will be the same. Try it for yourself when you feel depressed or anxious. Here’s how my 50 seconds to presence: Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Focus on what’s actually happening now (not the thoughts you’re having). After your breath has slowed down, ask yourself if there’s anything you can take action on immediately that would ease what you are worrying about. If there is, open your eyes and go do it. It will make you feel better to take action. If there isn’t anything you can do, drop it. Breathe out of it. You’re not making it any better by worrying about it. ***** With practice, this exercise will become 30 seconds to presence! For newbies, however, I suggest taking the full 50 seconds if not more, to really breathe into it. Start practicing it every day when you catch yourself worrying or obsessing and stay consistent for long-term results. Because you’re probably not going to take this post with you everywhere, I’ve made an mp3 recording of me taking you through it so that you can keep it in your phone for emergencies. It’s totally free; all you have to do is click below to download it. Show that stress who’s boss and take back control of your mental state. You’re strong enough.

15 Easy Ways to Beat Anxiety Now,"Technically, anxiety is apprehension over an upcoming event. We anticipate the future with sometimes scary predictions that don’t necessarily have any basis in truth. In everyday life, anxiety’s physical and emotional symptoms can mean an increased heart rate, poor concentration at work and school, sleeping problems, and just being a total Crankasaurus Rex to family, friends, and co-workers. Anxiety and stress are physical and emotional responses to perceived dangers (that aren’t always real). And since most of us aren’t running from tigers or hunting and gathering in the woods, it’s often the little things that put us over the edge: an over-loaded email inbox, morning rush hour, or losing those keys before running out the door. Luckily, it’s easy to beat this kind of stress with just a few easy changes added throughout the day. Note: If you feel like you might be dealing with a serious anxiety disorder, please talk to a medical professional about treatment. There are lots of options available to manage your symptoms. But if you’re looking to reduce daily anxiety, these 15 tips will get you on your way to being calm and collected in no time. 1. Get enough sleep. Inconsistent sleep can have some serious consequences. Not only does it affect our physical health, but lack of sleep can also contribute to overall anxiety and stress. And sometimes it turns into a vicious cycle, since anxiety often leads to disruptions in sleep Sleep and anxiety disorders. Mellman, T.A. Department of Psychiatry, Howard University Mental Health Clinic. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America 2006 Dec;29(4):1047–58. . Especially when feeling anxious, try to schedule a full seven to nine hours of snooze time and see what a few nights of sweet slumber do for those anxiety levels throughout the day. 2. Smile. When work has got us down, it’s a good idea to take a quick break to get some giggles on. Research suggests that laughter can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, so consider checking out a funny YouTube clip to calm those jittery nerves Effects of humor and laughter on psychological functioning, quality of life, health status,and pulmonary functioning among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a preliminary investigation. Lebowitz, K.R., Suh, S., Diaz, P.T., et al. Department of Psychiatry, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University. Heart & Lung 2011 Jul-Aug;40(4):310–9. 3. De-clutter the brain. Physical clutter = mental clutter. A messy workspace can make it more difficult to relax and make it seem like our work is never-ending. So take 15 minutes or so to tidy up the living space or work area, and then make a habit of keeping things clean and anxiety-free. It’ll help us think rationally, and there won’t be as much room for anxiety. 4. Express gratitude. Studies have found expressing gratitude helps reduce anxiety, especially when we’re well-rested The Differential Effects of Gratitude and Sleep on Psychological Distress in Patients with Chronic Pain. Ng, M.Y., Wong, W.S. City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. Journal of Health Psychology 2012 Mar 12. [Epub ahead of print]. . Start a gratitude journal to get in the mindset of appreciation, and out of the mindset of being overwhelmed. 5. Eat right. Anxiety can throw our bodies totally out of whack: Our appetite might change, or we might crave certain foods. But to give the body the support it needs, try eating more of foods that contain nutrients such as vitamin B and omega-3s, plus some healthy whole-grain carbohydrates. Studies have linked vitamin B with good mental health, and omega-3s may help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety Association between folate, vitamin B(6) and vitamin B(12) intake and depression in the SUN cohort study. Whole-grain carbs help regulate levels of serotonin, the “feel-good” neurotransmitter that helps us remain calm. And even though our cravings might be telling us otherwise, research suggests that eating sugary and processed foods can increase symptoms of anxiety Chronic stress and obesity: a new view of “comfort food.” Dallman, M.F., Pecoraro, N., Akana, S.F., et al. Department of Physiology and Neuroscience Program, University of California, San Francisco, CA. Proceedings of the National Academy of Science 2003 Sep 30;100(20):11696–701. 6. Learn to breathe. A useful tool to prevent panic attacks, the breath is also a great marker of where your anxiety level is at throughout the day. Short, shallow breaths signify stress and anxiety in the brain and body. On the flip side, consciously breathing, plus lengthening and strengthening the breath helps send signals to the brain that it’s okay to relax Respiratory and Cognitive Mediators of Treatment Change in Panic Disorder: Evidence for Intervention Specificity. Meuret, A.E., Rosenfield, D., Seidel, A., et al. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 2010 Oct;78(5):691–704. 7. Meditate. By now most of us have heard that meditation is relaxing, but what scientists are also discovering is that meditation actually increases the amount of grey matter in the brain, essentially rewiring the body to stress less. A number of recent studies highlight the positive effects of meditation on anxiety, mood, and stress symptoms Complementary medicine, exercise, meditation, diet, and lifestyle modification for anxiety disorders: a review of current evidence. Mindfulness-based stress reduction, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and Zen meditation for depression, anxiety, pain, and psychological distress. Marchand, W.R. George E. Wahlen VAMC and University of Utah, Salt Lake City. Journal of Psychiatric Practice 2012 Jul;18(4):233–52. Meditation is also a way to observe the brain, letting us figure out how our mind generates anxiety-provoking thoughts. And understanding the brain’s thought patterns can help create distance from those thoughts. 8. Create a vision board. If the future seems big and scary, try changing the thoughts about what lies ahead. Sometimes the mere act of setting concrete goals can take the edge off anxiety about future unknowns. Take an hour to produce a vision board that creates excitement about projects and possibilities to come. And for those who aren’t the crafty type, try making an e-vision board using Pinterest for some Pinspiration. While making the board, try using the T.H.I.N.K. tool: Is my thought true, helpful, inspirational, necessary and kind? If not, dump the thought. 9. Play around. Kids and animals seem to have an innate ability to play, without stressing about their overflowing inboxes. Until business offices give us recess breaks, we’ll have to take responsibility for our own playtime. Offer to take a friend’s dog out for a walk, or babysit for an afternoon to get out of your head and let the careless creatures lead by example. 10. Be silent. Plan for a time when you can completely disconnect. Start with increments of time that seem sustainable and doable for you, even if it’s just five minutes. That means phone off, no emails, no TV, no news, nothing. Let other people know they won’t be able to reach you so you can veg worry free. There’s some evidence that too much noise can boost our stress levels, so schedule some sacred silent time among all the ruckus of daily life. 11. Worry. Yes, we can cause ourselves to freak out, but only for a certain amount of time. When something weighs heavily on your mind, or you believe something terrible is most definitely going to occur, commit to only creating that worry for 20 minutes. Think of all the possible outcomes of the scenario, figure out some game plans, and then quit thinking about it after 20 minutes go by. Have a friend call after the allotted time has passed to avoid the temptation of going over the time limit. Or schedule some of that playtime right afterward. 12. Plan ahead. Fight anxious thoughts in advance by preparing for the day ahead. Try making a schedule or a to-do list and develop habits that increase productivity. So instead of spending 10 extra minutes every morning frantically looking for those keys, make a habit of always putting them in the same place when you come home. Lay out clothes the night before, pack a gym bag and leave it by the door, or make lunch ahead of time. Focus on how to “un-think” the anxiety-producing beliefs by prepping before they pop up. 13. Visualize anything positive. When confronted with anxious thoughts, take a moment to visualize yourself handling the situation with calm, ease, and clarity. Try not to pay attention to the current mental state; just focus on the feeling of smooth-sailing through the storm. The technique is called “guided imagery” or “guided visualization” and can help reduce feelings of stress Guided visualization interventions on perceived stress, dyadic satisfaction and psychological symptoms in highly stressed couples. Rogers, K.R., Hertlein, K., Rogers, D., et al. Department of Marriage and Family Therapy, University of Nevada-Las Vegas. Complementary therapies in clinical practice 2012 May;18(2):106–13. . 14. Smell something relaxing. Try sniffing some calming oils. Basil, anise, and chamomile are great choices; they reduce tension in the body and help increase mental clarity. 15. Hang out. People who have lots of social support tend to react less negatively to stress than those who fly solo. That’s probably because socializing stimulates the production of the hormone oxytocin, which has an anxiety-reducing effect Social support and oxytocin interact to suppress cortisol and subjective responses to psychosocial stress. Heinrichs, M., Baumgartner, T., Kirschbaum, C., et al. Department of Clinical Psychology, University of Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland. Biological Psychiatry 2003 Dec 15;54(12):1389–98. . So the next time a freak-out appears on the horizon, grab some pals and go for a walk or just have a quick chat. In an ideal world, we wouldn’t come up with thoughts that produce stress or anxiety. But we’re human and inevitably worry about things. So when we do start to freak, there are lots of little steps we can take to change our thoughts, calm the brain, relax the body, and get back in the game. And, as always, be sure to check with a psychotherapist if these tips don’t cut it and you need a little extra help tackling a more significant anxiety issue!

So when we do start to freak, there are lots of little steps we can take to change our thoughts, calm the brain, relax the body, and get back in the game. And, as always, be sure to check with a psychotherapist if these tips don’t cut it and you need a little extra help tackling a more significant anxiety issue!

Signing this Petition can Save Mothers’ Lives,"Written by Dr. Walker Karraa Pregnant women in America and many developed countries are screened for just about every health condition that puts mother or baby at risk– diabetes, high blood pressure, STDs and even super rare genetic disorders. They’re not, however, screened for the life-threatening condition that impacts one in seven and is the leading cause of death for postpartum women — maternal and postpartum depression. Dr. Walker Karraa is petitioning to get women the help they need. Dr. Karraa holds a PhD in philosophy, is program Co-Chair for the American Psychological Association (APA) Division 56 Trauma Psychology and sits on the training committee for the Los Angeles County Perinatal Mental Health Task Force. We sat down to talk about the petition she hopes will change the way mental health is addressed for all pregnant women. The petition is titled, Every mother, every time. Universal mental health screening for every pregnant and postpartum woman, Dr. Karraa’s petition lives on the We The People Whitehouse.gov site where supporters can create an account (as easy as providing your email and name) and sign the petition. If 100,000 signatures are gathered before April 4th, 2014, it would mandate that maternal and mental health experts must explore options for screening all pregnant and postpartum women for depression, anxiety and other serious mood disorders. EMC: Dr. Karraa, tell me why you started this petition? Dr. Karraa: The petition stems from the Obama administration’s decision that the public can petition the government regarding issues that are important to them and if you receive 100,000 signatures, then, by law, there must be a discussion or task force to further explore that topic. I started it On March 5th, the day after Ebony Wilkerson [the pregnant women who] drove her van full of her children into the ocean. When Miriam Carey was killed in Washington DC, I started an online blog in her honor. When Ebony had her experience, lots of people contacted me. I just thought — what if? If every mom who has ever been in a mini-van with her kids and every mom who has ever suffered from a mental illness, signed the petition, we would get the national exposure we deserve. What would the petition do? Mental health is a human right and maternal mental health is sorely neglected in this country and abroad by all stakeholders. The petition proposes universal mental health screening for every pregnant and postpartum woman. Suicide is the leading cause of death for women in the first year following childbirth. As we get more data, we’re realizing we need to focus our screening efforts in pregnancy. Some people misunderstand that if the petition is signed then boom, it’s a law and then at every single prenatal visit they’re handing you Prozac. That’s not true. If we have those signatures, we would gather experts and have a conversation. We already screen for everything else, one wonders, what’s the big deal? Yes! We already run screens for every other condition that might harm the mother and baby and we know depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders put women and their babies at risk. We know if a woman experiences a perinatal mood or anxiety disorder, it crosses the placenta. Fourteen studies show a direct correlation between mothers who’ve had anxiety in pregnancy and children who develop attention deficit disorder. We know there’s a huge risk. We know it causes preterm birth and it’s a leading complication in pregnancy. But nobody screens. What would screening look like? There are lots of debates about which screening tools would work best. Right now ACOG recommends two questions — two little questions! But they’re not mandatory. How hard is it to ask two questions? What are they? Over the past 2 weeks, have you often been bothered by: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things? Yes No 2. Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? Yes No If they answer yes, then there’s a more complete screening questionnaire. This petition is not about specifics though. It’s about having a conversation. We’ve f’*#d around for a long time having debates and it’s the physicians who are in charge of those debates. Women are at risk and we can’t wait any more. You’ve been working in this field a long time. What are women saying about screening? I did my own research on suicidal ideation. In an anonymous online survey of 485 women, over 60% (297 women) said they had thoughts of harming themselves or others during postpartum depression. Over 40% said they were not screened. This is nothing new. We know women don’t get screened. For women seeing a primary care physician instead of an OB-Gyn, they don’t screen for mental health issues at all, much less during the prenatal period. Then it’s on the woman to say, “I have a family history or a previous history myself.” That’s bullshit to force a woman to push past the stigma herself. Do you think women aren’t being screened because we don’t have the framework for dealing with mental health? That’s what everyone’s asking. Are we not going to do this because we don’t have the infrastructure? A colleague said, “Obama could have said the same thing about healthcare.gov.” Is the infrastructure working beautifully? No! Is there a tremendous need? Yes! Are there enough evidence-based tools, experts and data that traditional western science needs to start it? Yes, there is. What else do you think we need to tell readers to motivate them to sign this petition? When you’re at school drop-off with your kid, when you’re with other women at the PTA meeting or your workplace — look at those women and think, one in seven of those women is going to want to commit suicide during the postpartum year. That’s not an exaggeration. We know the kind of suicide women commit in the postpartum year is associated with thoughts that are very violent. Women plan for it to work. It’s not that they want to die. It’s that they want the suffering they’re experiencing from post partum mood disorders to end. Imagine any mom during that first transition of welcoming a new baby home. There’s the lack of sleep, physical pain and recovery from birth. There’s a whole life adjustment. Even figuring out how to put a baby in a car seat to go to a postpartum check up is challenging. Now, imagine doing that with a severe life threatening disease that no one is going to ask about. No one will ask how you’re doing. What symptoms should women and their families watch for? A postpartum mood disorder is a traumatic life event. It’s like seeing yourself in a car crash. You have physical pain and uncontrollable crying. You can’t eat or sleep. Your emotions are all over the place. You can’t concentrate. You’re hyper-vigilant about the baby. You can’t sit still. Out of that group of symptoms grows a feeling that you can’t do it and your baby would be better off without you. Imagine how much suffering a woman experiencing that goes through. You don’t know what’s happening because you haven’t been screened and you weren’t given the information. You’re on your own to figure it out. As mothers we have to support our sisters who are experiencing that right now and they’re not going to get that support if we don’t mandate some sort of national conversation.

Whirring And Clicking,"Who taught me to hope and why would they do something so cruel? Hope is an illusion. It’s a silly thing, like trust or faith, a gossamer dream, fragile and incomplete. Hope is a promise broken. I am the face of mental illness. I am what depression looks like. I am struggle and fight and lies. I am hidden and I am shame and I do not want you to be uncomfortable so I remain this way. I wear so many masks for you that I forget who I really am. I lull myself into a false sense of security until I too start to believe in the lie. I want you to be happy. I do not want to upset your balance. I want your truth to be unbroken, but the prison of your expectations is killing me. It is not your fault. You do not ask me to be anything other than what you expect me to be. It is tacit, your part in my play. You go about your business and you live your life the best way you know how and for that I commend you. You are kind. You are generous and very, very busy. You are courageous. You are seeing things and connecting dots. Your brain is clicking and whirring and formulating ideas and you have plans and a future and you are very, very busy and it is not your fault. My brain also whirs and clicks and it screams and burns and is filled with snakes. There is something very beautiful about the way my neurons fire. Something very beautiful about looking in a mirror and seeing a shadow. My brain does not often tell me the truth. It is sneaky and false and very, very busy. I try not to blame my brain for its lack of compassion or its endless need to be running, running, running… but it is not easy. I have a vague understanding of chemicals and causality. I have accumulated the language of this condition and learned words like Serotonin and Sertraline. I know what an SSRI is. I know that the big orange pill should be taken with food and that I may have trouble achieving orgasm and that I should try to stay out of the sun. I know, but I do not understand… I do not understand why it is a struggle to get out of bed in the morning. I do not understand the constant battle that wages between the things I say to myself and the reality of who I am. I cannot be the monster that is presented to me. I cannot be useless and lazy and unlovable. I cannot be surface and reflection. I am not the illusion I present to you, but i must be some part of it. I do love. I am loved. I trust and am trusted. I have people who care about me. This is what depression does. It grinds you down. It swallows you whole and blocks out the light. It crushes those silly things, like faith and trust and hope. It breeds cynicism and fosters hate. It drowns your dreams in a river of self doubt and delusion. Yet, something… This flicker of light that bounces at the corner of my eye that I assume to be an Angel. The way my fingers move around the keyboard and find the words.",2014

Overcoming stress with stretch,"Stress is part of all of our lives. In fact, a little stress is good for one. A violin string in an un-stretched state can’t produce a note. Tightening it to an optimal tautness, however, the string produces the quality tone that it was designed for in the hands of a violinist. Likewise, some stress keeps one on one’s toes, helps to focus one on the important issues at stake and stimulates one to apply energy to achieving one’s goals. It was James Bilkey who suggested: “You will never be the person you can be if pressure, tension and discipline are taken out of your life”. On the other hand, the over-tightened violin string snaps — so also with too much stress where we find ourselves panicking, fearful and with feelings of being out of control. The never-ending stream of bills, inflation, family responsibilities, the demands of developing our careers, business requirements and perhaps a dysfunctional relationship all weigh heavily on our lives, with feelings of stress being the inevitable result. Stress left unattended will probably multiply in terms of its negative impact, so dealing positively with stress becomes an unavoidable skill that we all have to acquire. This skill is all about “stretch”. The ability to overcome and conquer stress lies chiefly in our skill to stretch ourselves in four areas: Stress will probably never be eliminated out of one’s life, but it can be managed. Overcoming stress requires our exploration in four areas of stretch (mind, body, emotions and spirituality) — a holistic approach to dealing with the issues we face repetitively or from time to time. Decisive action needs to be taken, however, if we are to succeed. The suggested stretch does imply change — either a change in the situation or a change in our reaction. Proactively stretch yourself and make the necessary changes. Originally published at https://www.stretchforgrowth.com on May 12, 2014.",2014
The Anxiety of Returning Things,"For Father’s Day, my dad asked me if I could help him clean his house. “Would you mind picking up some gloves and cleaning supplies at the store?” he asked. I said sure, dropped by a discount retailer to buy a bunch of things, and then swung by my dad’s place ready to scrub. My father opened up a box of gloves, and showed them to me. “Son, this pair has two left-handed gloves in it, can you go back to the store and exchange them?” I paused for a second before saying yes. I got into my car and headed back to the store. “You can do this,” I whispered under my breath. “You can return these gloves.” Ever since I’ve had money in the bank and the purchasing power of a consumer, I’ve been bad at returning things to the store. I’ve bought things online that weren’t what I expected them to be, and left them in a corner of my closet, waiting for them to be put in a donation box one day along with some brand new clothes I’ve never worn because they didn’t fit me quite right. The same for gifts: “If you don’t like it, you can return it because I included a gift receipt!” friends and family members have said. I’ve never returned anything using a gift receipt. It’s weird, but I have “returning-things” anxiety. The thought of it overwhelms me — the lines, the dealing with customer service reps, I suppose the entire process in general — and I know I shouldn’t feel that way. And yet, I take comfort in the fact that I know that I’m not the only one. On socialanxietysupport.com, there are entire threads related to this experience: I’m not 100% sure why this is the case for me, but I’ve always found it difficult to return items, even if I made a mistake or have every right to due to a defect. It feels like I’m admitting failure or something walking back into the store, telling the cashier why I don’t want it. I just can’t do it. Yesterday I was changing the air filters in the house and noticed a vent that never had one. I measured it a 14in x 24in and went to the store to buy one. I get there and they only seem to have 14 x 25 so I get one of those, assuming that I must have measured it wrong. I get home and of course it doesn’t fit. I didn’t even take off the plastic yet so returning it would be no issue, but the idea just stressed me out so what did I do? I threw it in the garbage…What a waste of money. Writes another poster: Yeah, a lot of times I have refused to take back damaged or broken items to the stores for a refund or replacement because I feel far too embarrassed. I feel like they’ll refuse to believe me or something. The “I Hate Returning Things” is also a common post written by busy parents. They usually go like this: I bought something, but it didn’t work out. Instead of returning it, I just ordered another thing because I’m a busy parent and my time is more important to me than getting a refund for this thing I bought. Similar confessions can be found all over Twitter: ungh i hate returning things. i am the worst returning-things-person in the world. the WORST. — Tahereh Mafi (@TaherehMafi) July 6, 2011 Few people know that I have this kind of anxiety. But my dad definitely knows about it. When I was in high school, he bought me a baseball glove that didn’t fit quite right, and then sent me back to the store to return it while he waited in the car for me with the engine running. I must have taken a long time conjuring up the courage to make it to the counter, because the next thing I know, my dad is in the store pushing me in front of a cashier and saying, “For god’s sake, son. Hi there, my son needs to exchange this because it doesn’t fit, can he get a new glove?” We walked out with a new baseball glove within minutes. “Now was that so hard?” he asked when we were back in the car. So, I was back at the store, with a pair of gloves to return. The baseball glove memory was fresh in my mind. The next thing I know I’m in front of a cashier. “I was just here,” I said. “Yes.” “And you see, I bought these gloves but when I opened the box there were two left-handed gloves in it and — “ I was talking a mile-a-minute. “Oh wow, I’m sorry you had to come back because of that!” the cashier said. “Did you want to return them or exchange them?” “Exchange, yes, oh god, thank you.” “Okay, I’ll keep these, and just go grab a new pair.” “That’s it?” “That’s it!” I was out of there in less than a minute. Later, back at my dad’s place, I found my dad in the kitchen, scrubbing the floor with his glove-less hands. “I thought I might as well get started,” he said. “Did you exchange the gloves?” “I did,” I said. “You did,” he repeated back at me, his eyes sparkling, perhaps remembering.

How to Make Edits to the Search Engine of Your Mind,"It’s 8:30. Your brain starts having an inner dialogue with the Caps Lock on because your alarm didn't go off. “$#*& !!!” Sheets go airborne. You have to be at work at 9:00 and you’re normally out of the door, showered, dressed and presentable by now. Oh god, oh god, oh god. Panic sets in. You’re already in your pants while feet are finding their way into shoes and fingers are finding their way to guide buttons on a shirt. Within 5 minutes you’re out the door, operating a motor vehicle and carrying a bagel around in your mouth like a golden retriever with a tennis ball. Let’s break the above story down in brain speak. The hypothalamus woke up you up. Your cerebellum gave you attention and activated a procedural memory of checking the clock. When you saw the clock, your cerebral cortex engaged your attention and slapped you with some adrenaline. The cerebrum got you moving. Before your attention begins to wane, the real question is … why did all this panic happen in the first place? In order to understand that, we must look into a section of our brain called the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe makes assumptions of future consequences by pulling the memories of previous actions and external influences. When you plan, predict and build intentions you can thank the frontal lobe. Basically, this part of your brain is constantly remembering <what happened> the last time you did <X behavior> and using that information to make an assumptive outcome on <what to do next>. If it helps, think of your frontal lobe like your internal Google, your memories are the search results and your intention is what you plan to do based on the findings. For example, in the story above, you likely have a memory (or more accurately a lot of memories) of the assumed consequences of being late. So then it goes like this: Stimulus: I’m going to be “Late to work”. Recall: Your frontal lobe then quickly searches: “Being late to work”. Results: About 1,382,382 results (.083 seconds) Top result: “Being late to work is bad.” Source: WhereIWork.brain A blog entry about the last time your co-worker, John, was late and the female boss backhanded him with her ring hand. This memory and many like it are then brought to the surface in a collaborative pattern. The most relevant one is at the top and when combined it is quickly (.08 seconds quick) added to the other results and converted into an intention of action. In this case, the action caused a chain reaction of panic and anxiety because the likelihood of arriving late to work became suddenly probable. Of course, in being late for work we should be thankful that we are motivated as it may have saved our job. In negative instances, however, where we may have traits we would like to distance ourselves from (fear, anxiety, procrastination etc..) we are hit with memories that cause the feelings that we experience. Understanding this is understanding that our minds live in the past. Breaking this down: past memories will prompt any new assumptions and those assumptions drive all of your future actions. So what would happen if that memory didn't exist? What if your internal Google returned zero results? To extrapolate the above question, let’s put ourselves into an experience where our frontal lobe arrives two different memories and the knowledge associations with each. When you suddenly feel a sharp pain in your left arm you may be in two different camps regarding what to do next based on the memories your brain has already indexed. If you've been previously informed of heart attack symptoms you may begin to worry in alignment with those thoughts. Suddenly; panic, fear, anxiety and the chemicals associated with those emotions flood your brain. For further consideration of an “intellectual curse” you may be familiar with a more modern phenomenon called “cyberchondria” where like hypochondria, the person believes they are always ill, usually because they are overly informed. Looking at this from another angle, lets say you’re not aware of common heart attack symptoms. Your internal Google will default to a first memory which could potentially be anything from pulling a muscle while working in the garden yesterday to that football injury you received in high school. Simply, the same fear brought on by the first example never occurred. Your search results were not conclusive enough to initiate a subconscious presumption of panic. The outcome of this story is not important. If it helps you feel better, sure, it was totally the football thing the whole time. What is important, however, is using the example provided to help demonstrate how your subconscious brain reacted to the stimulus based on previous experience(s) and the associated knowledge brought to light (search results). Because of the way our minds work, by pulling associations from previous events, you are always living in the past. Even in new experiences, if you are being provoked by old memories, your motivations and intentions are not a part of the present. How do you live in the now? By understanding the science outlined above, it helps us recognize that the outcome can be different even if our minds are forcing us into certain preconceived notions, assumptions, motivations and fears based on the subconscious search results of previous memories. As an example of “living in the now” your brain would instead consider: “Just because you asked one girl out and she slapped you last time doesn't mean that all girls will slap you and transversely, just because the last girl you asked out said yes doesn't mean that the next one will either.” The unfortunate aspect of this new line of thinking is that you must be overly observant (some call it mindfulness) in order to provoke it. Soon, if you use your frontal lobe as a guide instead of handcuffs, your mind suddenly changes. You have the power to veto any subconscious assumptions and you can be fearless as long as you are aware. The question then remains, is being fearless better than being fearful? The answer is the careful balance between anxiety and performance. In 1908 scientists Yerkes and Dodson found out that a steady life creates steady performance. This is partially because our brains are stress averse they will make attempts to steer you away from (assumed) occurrences where the (assumed) outcome could cause stress, panic and anxiety. After prolonged behavior such as this we hit our comfort zone. Ahhh comfort zone. The words have sounded so cushy, friendly and warm ever since Judith Bardwick first used them back in 1991. Routines, patterns and predictable outcomes live here and chances are you do to. It’s a magical place where nothing is unexpected, fears never make an appearance, everything given can be achieved with small amounts of effort and life just … happens. Mmmm. Damn that. What if you want to be in the mental place where you become your most powerful self and awesome things happen? If you’re asking yourself “Is there an awesome zone?”. Actually, YES. Let me help put the down payment on that place for you. First, lets enter a cognitive phenomenon into our lexicon called optimal anxiety, (also Yerkes and Dodson, 1908) or: … performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of arousal become too high, performance decreases. When levels are too low, performance decreases. Thus, an outcome where your internal Google is simply unequipped to default a 100% positive outcome assumption. A challenge, or as some say, being out of your element, is going to cause cognitive stress because your internal Google is unable to accurately display assumed results. The amount of stress caused is dependent on (to beat a dead horse) the memory associated with prior outcomes. For example, if your boss says “Make this sale or you’re fired” it may cause your level to be too high to reap any benefit. However, if your boss provides you with a challenge of “You made five sales last month. This month I want eight.” Bam. Optimal anxiety. Finding something that is difficult to accomplish but not so difficult that it is impossible. The balance should be as likely of chance for both the positive and negative outcomes. This experience will then rewire you for future experiences. In this spot, your performance and alertness goes up. In fact, your performance and alertness are very, very low if your mental arousal and anxiety states are either too low (cushy, warm comfort zone) or too high (panic, nerves). Like a bell curve, the slopes are the steps of worry on one side and the stairs of complacency on the other. So now that we understand a comfort zone (on the left side of the above scale) is generally due to the subconscious refusal to take on difficult challenges because of unknown or expected negative outcomes. Allow me then to be the first person to say it’s not your fault if you don’t want to spend every day running up a hill. Challenges cause stress, our minds don’t like stress (and any possibility of an unknown future) so again, we become subconsciously challenge averse and over time. Again, not your fault. Fears are a type of emotional memory that inhibit action because of the hard work the frontal lobe is doing all the time. If you have a memory of a predominantly negative instances rise to the top when your brain does its “search”, chances are you don’t want to do that action again. Also, if you’re being forced into that action panic happens well before the event even occurs. Statistically, a good example for most would be public speaking. Just the thought of it will likely cause many of you to have elevated heart rates and your brain steers you back into your comfort zone. The problem for modern man is that comfort kills productivity and therefore we have to find a low impact balance between stress and complacency. The scientific term for breaking out of your comfort zone is called exposure therapy and yes, while exposure therapy may be one option, it is simply tackling one problem at a time instead of tackling all the problems at once. Instead, lets use what we have learned here about memory patterns, our search brain and the subconscious results to our advantage. If packaged correctly we can use this science to add to our own mental arsenal. Do you remember the heart attack guy above that panicked simply because he was equipped with knowledge of heart attack symptoms? By understanding that your memories are subconsciously manipulating you, we can create a new memory that manipulates us positively and rise to the surface at will. In “You are the Placebo”, Dr. Joe Dispenza talks about how our minds are an underutilized tool in many of our battles with health and wellness. He further writes that sometimes simply obtaining a new set of knowledge can lead changing who you are by understanding the way your brain makes connections. (His extremely valuable TEDx talk here.) Therefore, according to Dr. Joe, what we are about to try will work as long as you are able to maintain it. Essentially what we are doing here is “search engine optimization” for you geek types. Or perhaps more appropriately, a Google AdWords advertisement that will be above every search result in the future. Visualize in your mind the ad going up there. The advertisement reads: Your “search brain” is potentially misleading your next move. Your current intention is only due to a pattern of previous memories. You have the power to veto memories that influence you. There. With this, you should now be free to approach the girl across the room as if you've never struck out and also never won. That way you will have no fear of consequences holding you back nor the expectation of a win driving you forward aimlessly and without provocation. This is of course just an example as the advertisement is not simply reserved to wooing the opposite sex of course. Perhaps you can now talk confidently in front of a group of your peers. It should be noted here, however, that snakes are still poisonous, wearing a seat belt is advised, clothes are required in public places, you cannot fly etc.. Also please note that this is not hypnotism because you are still completely in the drivers seat of recall with exception given to your subconscious mind and finally, this requires a small amount of recall in order for it to be effective. So now that you find yourself equipped with this new outlook you could potentially conquer the world. Or, at minimum, be able to make the choice of freeing yourself of prior inhibitions long enough to make a solid attempt at it. So, what do you want to tonight, Pinky? When I was a kid, maybe eight or nine, my grandfather had a poster on the wall in his basement workshop. I’m sure many of you have seen it before; a distressed fluffy kitten barely grasping from a branch while the idiom reads “Hang in there!”. I used to sit starting at that poster for far longer than I would like to admit. I have a memory of thinking very strongly: You’re going to fall! Don’t just “hang in there”! The longer you stay there the more tired your little cat arms are going to get and the less likely you’re going to be able to pull yourself up! (or something like that) Take what you have learned here and stop “hanging in there”. That is of course making the assumption that you want to use your little cat arms to get back up on the branch, climb across to safety and build yourself the most awesome Swiss Family Robinson style tree house the world has ever seen. Memorize this pattern: Your decisions are first intentions. Your intentions are first memories. Memories are the past. The past can mislead the now and ruin what could have been.",2014
FROM ANXIETY TO ADVICE,"What makes me expert enough to dole out advice? Nothing. Not a damn thing. I’ve spent a fat chunk of my life fucking up, fucking around and fucking off. Then one day, I got too damn tired of it; my body got too damn tired. It wasn’t a heroic choice to change, I just started having panic attacks. For most people panic attacks are enough to shock them into re-evaluating their life, but me. To wake me up it took having a panic attack on top of extremely high blood pressure while I was suffering from an excruciating infected tooth. My blood pressure is now regulated by pills and my tooth pain was taken away with a drill, but I was left with the anxiety. Anyone who has had anxiety knows that it is different then stress. Stress is a reaction to being over-stimulated and over-burdened. Anxiety is an all out war in your body for no discernible reason. Anxiety is shortness of breath, electric shocks in your body, chest pain and utterly uncontrollable terror. Anxiety is a hyper-alert state where you can actually hear your blood pumping and it’s pumping fast—too fast. You begin to feel that the only thing holding that imaginary blood clot or heart attack at bay is moving the right way, sitting, standing, pacing, breathing; that the only thing keeping you alive is the sheer power of your will. Now, everybody’s experience with anxiety is unique, but I’ve yet to meet a person who said it was fun. It’s monstrous and it doesn’t just go away on its own. You have to deal with it. You have to make changes in your lifestyle. You have to evolve. But, this isn’t an article on how to murder anxiety. There are plenty of great instructions on meditation that will help dramatically, but finding relief is an individual journey, just like the anxiety itself. This is an article about dealing with life after experiencing a very tangible, looming fear of death. This is an article about getting things done before they’re throwing dirt on your face. This is even an article about knowing goals and dedicating yourself to them. This is an article about 8 ideas that I have, that I’ve stolen, that are clichéd; 8 things I’m trying. This is one that I fought for a long time. I hate doing it. I dread it. It’s just so damn boring, but I do it. I do 30 minutes every morning before I shower or even eat. I avoided exercise for years, and I can tell you that going back to base-line healthy after reaching a certain age is a lot more difficult. You don’t put on muscle nearly as fast, the soreness lasts longer and the fat—well the fat seems to have claws in your bones and just won’t let go. So here’s the thing, once you start exercising, you don’t need to flaunt it. You don’t need a spandex wardrobe. You need to tweet how far you ran today. Nobody gives a shit. You don’t even need a six pack, just get your heart pumping and sweat. Someone once told me ‘the more you use your body, the better it works.’ I’ve found that to be true. I have more energy, I’m in a better mood and I’m more productive. For a cantankerous procrastinator like me, that’s a huge improvement. It also turns out that the more you use your body, the better your brain works. If those aren’t reason enough, then do it for vanity. Do it so that you don’t get fat or flabby or have weird flaps of skin whose origin you can’t place. Do it so you can still have sex later in life. Do so that you can see your genitals. Do it so that you don’t drop dead on the toilet. Do so that you don’t end up looking like some demented cartoon character, dragging a metal cart into McDonald’s for dinner every night. Read every day. Read for at least an hour. Don’t do anything else for that hour. Put your phone on ‘Do Not Disturb.’ Keep a pen and a piece of paper near you while reading. Every time something occurs to (an idea that the book inspires, the fact that you need milk, a question you have) write it down on that paper and forget it until the hour is up. This allows you to pay attention to the book without forgetting anything. The most successful people in the world read everyday. It’s not just about knowledge, but the more you stimulate your brain the easier is it get things done. Your focus improves and you’re more equipped to solve problems. It doesn’t matter what you read, but don’t limit yourself to one genre. The more you challenge yourself, the better it is for your brain and the better it is for your self-esteem. Reading also makes you a better human being, particularly fiction. Fiction puts you in the skin and circumstances of someone other that yourself. It teaches you about different lives and different worlds and different points of view. It kills the self-centered parts of us. Reading teaches empathy. Reading makes you less of a prick. Ok, stop crying. You don’t have to really break your phone, TV or computer. You don’t have to give up your Instagram, or Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Pinterest, Tumblr, LinkedIn or Google+. Just stop looking at them all day. Stop hunching your shoulders and looking down. That’s the posture of defeat. You’re physically sending depressive signals to your mind and your body. If you have to, look at your social media once a day. Don’t check your email more that twice a day. Limit your TV time to an hour or two. Cutting all this out will give you more time; time for things like reading, laughing, screwing and thinking; time for goals. The more inane shit that you shovel into your head, the more anxiety that you’ll have. That’s a physiological fact. We become junkies for our phones, sucking up endorphins every time we grab them. Is it any wonder that we are all depressed and dissatisfied? Try being present in your life instead of being absent. Keep your phone in your pocket during dinner and talk to the person across the table from you. Skip the news and let other people tell you about it. Don’t just take photos, learn to be in them. My goal is to write and be successful at it. It’s been my goal since I first read Vonnegut & Kerouac in high school. It’s the kind of image that I spent a lot of time cultivating. I found rough, beligerant blueprints in writers like Bukowksi and I made them part of my persona. I drank heavily, smoked even more heavily and I got into arguments about books when I got drunk. I made sure everybody knew I was a writer…but there was just one thing: I wasn’t a writing. I was a barfly who scribbled a few shitty sentences a few times a year. I’d made the image into the goal, but never the writing. I sat around hoping for inspiration to goose me under the table. I spent most of my time drinking, smoking, socializing and eating the worst food possible. It’s no wonder that exercising is such a bitch now. Of the four, the hardest to stop was the socializing, because well…socializing isn’t bad for you. Not when you know great people. But writing is hard work and getting good at writing requires a lot of goddamn time and effort. It requires reading, writing, editing and quiet contemplation, all of which are mostly solitary exercises and are in direct conflict with a very active social life. I had to learn to say no, which sounds like a simple thing. It’s not. It’s a bitch. I’m still learning it. People get upset. They take it personally and as flattering as that is, you need to be willing to sacrifice if you want to achieve. Maybe what you want doesn’t require solitude, but something in your life will come up against your goals. You’ve got to be willing to kill it. You got to be willing to slay the dragon. You got to be will to leave the world and freeze in an ice cave. You’ve got to be willing to shun the world. Learn to talk less. Learn to listen. Learn to accept that you aren’t the center of the universe. I suck at this one. I love talking. I have an opinion on everything. I’ve actually been described that way. I interrupt. I just sit waiting to talk; waiting to topple down the little tower of words you just built. That all just makes me an asshole. Talking and conversing are two different things. Conversation requires more that just you. Conversation requires exchange. So, zip it and try to understand what the other person is saying. You don’t need to believe it but try at least to get what their words mean. We spend to much time deluding ourselves into thinking of conversation as things that you win. We spend to much time fearing that other people’s opinions will infect us. Don’t get stuck in the cycle of always trying to prove people wrong or top their stories. Listen, particularly to people you disagree with, because it’s important to humble yourself. The people who speak less are heard more when they do speak. The people who speak less aways seem to know more about their thoughts than the rest of us know about our own. The people who speak less have calmer minds, smile more and they probably get more dinner invitations and hand jobs than the rest of us. Try being honest. Just try it. I dare you. Skip the big lies. Skip the small lies. Skip the itty-bitty white lies. Accept who you are and how you feel and don’t waste time hiding it. Just say it. I’m not advocating radical, brutal honesty because that just makes people into a douchebags who swing the truth through the air like a big, fake cock. Truth can be eloquent. Truth can be sensitive. And if there’s no way to say something true without being cruel then don’t say anything. Go back to idea number five and just shut-up. We spend to much of our lives lying to ‘spare people’s feelings’, but in reality we’re just being cowards. When we tell people the truth, we open up communication. We open up the possibility for a conversation. Rather that being vulnerable, we chose to lie, because it’s quicker and easier. On the other side, don’t apologize unless you’re truly sorry. We apologize for little shit everyday. We apologize for things that don’t have anything to do with us. We throw out sorry’s for no damn reason everywhere we go. Our lawns are littered with dried, up apologies. We rarely even feel true regret because we don’t analyze our actions. We simple throw out an “I’m sorry” and move on. What could be a real conversation becomes a practiced ritual that means nothing. We know that ‘I’m sorry’ will induce an ‘It’s ok,’ and then we wash our hands. Only say you’re sorry when you truly feel it, and express it with emotive words. The rest of the time, leave out the apology…or better yet don’t do shit that you need to apologize for. Everybody should have two lists: a list of people who support you and a list of people who don’t. This isn’t to be mean or vengeful. This is simply to conserve energy. We only have so much brain juice and we can only maintain so many relationships before the other ones break down from neglect. It’s even been suggested by studies that empathy is not an inexhaustible resource and that it runs dry. So don’t waste time on ingrates and users. Is someone always asking you favors but never extending any to you? Is there somebody that you text or call, that never replies? Well, fuck em. Chuck em. It’s important to know upon whom to expend your precious energy. Take the energy that you’re wasting on self-centered dickheads and focus into supporting those who have supported you. Foster stronger, more rewarding relationships with people who reciprocate. They’re your real friends and they deserve it. Take a risk on love. Take a risk on business. Take a risk by writing a blog on life advice. Expose yourself to failure and criticism. There’s nothing specific to learn here, except that you will survive. You can’t live your life in fear because fear chains you. There’s no such thing as security, so take chances. Don’t be afraid of anything and learn to laugh when you fall on your ass. “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.” — Samuel Beckett Originally published on my website",2014
Does Worrying About Money Make You Better at Money?,"The act of worrying actually hurts, not helps. … worrying about money hurts your ability to think clearly about everything else in your life. In a separate study, researchers found that financial worries affect cognitive abilities. The article goes on to call fretting “a useless habit” that you might be able to curtail by asking yourself simple questions, like, “What am I really worried about? Is it something in my control?” and “If it’s not in my control, do I gain anything by worrying about it?” To which I say: … maybe. Some people are anxious! It’s a hard habit to shake and sometimes it goes deeper, into how we’re wired. But even leaving chemical imbalances aside, most of us who worry do not expect to gain anything by worrying; we worry because it’s how we interact with the world and the seemingly gleeful way it throws surprises at us. Still, it can be freeing to hear Science say, in that resounding, definitive voice Science uses, that worrying doesn’t help. It allows us to say, “Why bother?” And then maybe say it again, with a smile, and again, until we begin to believe it. It’s kind of like how hearing that doing exercise you hate doesn’t make you thin. WHY BOTHER WHY BOTHER WHY BOTHER have an ice cream sandwich and take a yoga class instead.

The Nutrition-Anxiety Link,"Understanding the link between anxiety and nutrition, and making health changes to eating habits, should be part of a first-line approach to supporting anxiety reduction. Here are some simple nutrition strategies to try if you or your child struggles with anxiety: Processed foods have ingredients and chemicals that can agitate the brain and body, causing symptoms of anxiety. Artificial sweeteners, food dyes, and MSG are some of the worst offenders. Reducing or, ideally, eliminating consumption of these ingredients can improve anxiety symptoms quickly and dramatically in some people. Caffeine is an alerting substance that can quickly increase anxiety, particularly symptoms such as heart palpitations and overall restlessness. Reducing or eliminating caffeine consumption is an important step in reducing anxiety symptoms. Protein is an incredibly important part of a healthy diet for many reasons, and most people don’t eat enough of it early in the day. Research has shown that starting the day with high quality protein sources can improve many symptoms, including anxiety. Options include eggs, meat, fish, nuts/nut butters, or dairy products. Most children eat breakfasts full of carbohydrates and sugars; but protein is a far better choice, especially for children who are anxious. Fruit juices, sports drinks, and sodas are full of sugars and chemicals that can increase anxiety symptoms. Reducing intake of these beverages and increasing water intake is an important step in overall anxiety reduction. You can add some berries, lemon slices, or other fruits if you want a little extra natural flavor. Most people consume far more sugar than is healthy each and every day. High sugar intake can exacerbate anxiety symptoms such as restlessness, heart palpitations, and dizziness. When a person with anxiety feels these physical effects, it causes anxious thought processes to increase. Lowering sugar intake is a good idea for improving overall health and wellness, but can be specifically helpful to reduce levels of anxiety. If the above list feels overwhelming for you or your family, start with one specific change and build from there. Taking action on any or all of these diet changes will support anxiety reduction. There are solutions to anxiety, and nutrition definitely plays an important role!",2014
The Gift of Life: Part One,"At age 7, I was singled out with a handful of other students, tested, and labeled as “gifted and talented”. By who’s standards? For the remainder of my grade school years, our group met weekly to hone our “gifts and talents”. I never really thought much about it though. It seemed normal enough at the time. We all looked forward to an annual convention of the G&T called Odyssey of the Mind. From early elementary and onward, we did things like build balsa wood bridges to see who could engineer the strongest one. We also wrote, acted in, and directed our own plays -soundtracks included. We practiced brainstorming, had philosophical discussions and polished up on our problem-solving skills. It was a non-stop mind challenge. Outside of school, I grew up in a household that was quite violent and very tense. There was lots of shouting, which I always ran and hid from, and even sometimes when it was really intense, there was throwing and smashing of various objects. There were often forceful physical assaults, which I was never once involved in, only a witness to on numerous occasions. I have always had a photographic memory. It is a curse and a blessing. I can remember things from at least 25 years ago in fine detail. The good, the bad and the ugly. It was extremely useful in school when it came time to take exams. I would have a flash of the exact paragraph in a textbook where the answer to a question was. I have pretty much everything from the last 32 years of life stored in my visual memory. On a regular basis now, random moments in history pop up in my consciousness. Things that I didn’t even consciously know that I saw or experienced at the time. What people were wearing, the music in the background and what the weather was like on any given day. As a child with extremely high sensitivity to other people’s (and animals’) energy, I struggled with all of this. A LOT. I learned the habit of emotional eating from my parents. So I became the chubby kid. My big brother teased me relentlessly and had cruel nicknames for me until I was a teenager, when I finally joined sports teams, ate healthier and slimmed down to normal-ish. I also cried often as a kid. Pretty much daily. I was often very sad and so afraid for myself, my family and our pets. I was always the overachiever in the family, much to my two siblings’ dismay. I was a straight-A Honor Roll student most of my 12 years of school and was always striving to prove myself to the world. Somehow though, nothing any of us did was ever good enough for our father. Why weren’t the A-minuses A-pluses?? He had (and still clings to) extremely high hopes for me. He told me repeatedly that I would make a great doctor or lawyer someday. I knew he was wrong. Those things were not in my destiny. At least not this time around. Finally one day in grade 11, at age 16, I couldn’t cope with the violence and pressure at home and at school ANY. MORE. My body, mind and spirit started to crumble. I developed severe anxiety, including a debilitating fear of traveling in enclosed vehicles with other people (cars, buses, airplanes, subways, etc) regardless of who they were. When IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) was a brand new discovery back then, I was labeled with that, too. I felt just awful! I quit attending high school a few weeks before grade 11 final exams, and I insisted on homeschooling myself for grade 12. It took a boatload of convincing but I did it, with the help of a very supportive tutor and his wife, who became my second family for that year. My closest friends had no idea what was happening because I was really embarrassed and very confused at the time. I spent nearly the entire year of grade 12 holed up reading and writing and spending tons of time in nature. I was constantly asking myself “what is the meaning of all of this?!”. I knew that my life just had to be about more than this ugliness that I had experienced so much of for those early years of life. My search began for the answers to some really tough questions: “Why am I here? What can I do to make my world a better place? Is this the reality that everyone experiences? Is life this scary for other kids? How did I end up in this family? Am I going nuts? Will I wake up and realize that this was all a bad dream?” To be continued…(it was too long to fit into one blog post.)",2014
Getting past my insecurities by talking,"As a person I am very insecure. I struggle to introduce myself to people I haven’t spoken to before and this something that has often left me feeling isolated. This is especially the case when going to development meetups where often I haven’t known anybody. In this situation I really struggle to introduce myself so the majority of people I have spoken to at events are those who I have either seen speak (so I can ask a question to start a conversation), those that introduce themselves or I have been introduced too. I think part of this stems back to being bullied in high school, so much so that I changed schools at the beginning of year 9. This was a terrible experience and it was during this time I changed from being someone who would express his emotions to someone who kept them to myself. since then I have had to relearn how to not keep these feelings bottled up inside and to express myself better. This hasn’t really helped with my inner confidence at all, while outwardly I may come across as a confident person, I still have these deep down insecurities which leave me often feeling worried unnecessarily about things. Where there is one place I am confident however is in my coding, since I was 9 years old learning BASIC on an Acorn I have loved to code and I have been confident in speaking to others about it. After changing school at the beginning of Year 9 I found a book in my new schools library about HTML and I then launched my first website, which as I was 13 was aptly named Jonathan’s World. Ever since I have loved the web, I even attempted running a web hosting company when I was 15, then by time I was 17 I realised their was no money in it unless you can do it on huge scale so I got out of the hosting game. With this confidence in talking about technology, I have tried to get past the awkwardness of attending an event by starting to talk at them. So far I have spoken five times, across three different web development events in London and not only have I had the opportunity to share with others what I know but I have also been able to build my confidence. What this has done is helped me break down this barrier as rather than having to introduce myself, I have done it as part of my talk and then people often approach me, whether to ask me questions or just to say thanks. With this I have been able to start real conversations, and make new friends which in turn has meant I have been introduced to many new amazing people I wouldn’t have otherwise met. As a developer there are many different places we can talk about what we do, there are online forums, sites like Reddit, Twitter and even through GitHub but nothing quite compares to the interactions you get and the knowledge that is shared at a meetup or a conference. The bringing together of like minds is amazing, and it give you an amazing opportunity to share problems you might have faced, learn from one another and talk about the cool web things you are passionate about. I love to attend meetups like London Web Standards, London Web and Front-end London and if you find yourself at one of these events and you see me their, I would love it if you introduced yourself, and I myself will be looking to try being more confident in my ability to introduce myself as well. If your running an event like a meetup or a conference and you want someone to come and talk, I am always looking for places to talk so just get in touch, I am very easy to get hold of either through this site or on Twitter. From talking to other people in the development community, I know there are others who went through bullying and/or are in the situation of feeling awkward and out of place when going to development events and as a community we have a duty to try and ensure everyone is included. So next time you see someone at a meetup or conference who you think might be feeling to insecure to introduce themselves, maybe you should introduce yourself to them, start a conversation because by being at the same event you clearly already have one thing in common, that you share an interest in whatever the talk is about. I think its up to the development community to make sure everyone feels welcome and valued because without the people that make up the community, there is no community.

Stick Around,"When I was 17, the hottest kid in the entire world was this guy I knew at Governor’s School (basically an academic summer camp funded by the state). I’ll call him Kevin because he was Irish and that seems like a good Irish name. He was really smart and popular and athletic, and he had the most beautiful face and an amazing body. I had never seen anyone so good-looking in my entire life. He was one of those people who is so attractive that it’s actually kind of disconcerting to look directly at him. It was like looking at the sun. He was a superstar. Blinding smile. The high school football hero times ten, plus a big brain and heart. It was stupid, how smart he was. He was nice to everybody and all the girls liked him. Some of us nerdier folks also grew to resent him, because he was so perfect. You know how those seemingly perfect people are really annoying, with their perfect teeth and perfect hair and perfect way of moving in the world? You ever known somebody like that? Everything just seems to go their way. It’s hard being friends with somebody like that, sometimes. Especially when they’re always upbeat and positive and you feel all mixed up and confused and dorky and, well, teen-ish. Or adult-ish. Or whatever-ish. You can feel “less than” at any age, I guess. He used to volunteer at a convalescent center for nuns. FOR NUNS. When we were at camp, he’d go on these non-required trips to tutor local little kids. They would climb all over him. They loved him. I mean, COME ON. And after we left camp and went back to our regular lives, he started at a new high school. I heard he got nominated for Best Looking and Most Likely to Succeed HIS FIRST YEAR AT THE NEW SCHOOL. When the hell does that happen? He was also elected lacrosse captain and football captain. Now let’s use the present tense, even though we’re talking about something that happened years ago. Because if I’m going back there, I want you with me. It’s months after camp ended. I hear Kevin got into Boston College on a football scholarship. A smart Irish Catholic kid’s dream if you come from the East Coast — the perfect spot for the perfect guy. I’m not surprised. This kid is bound for glory. I’m almost past the point of envy (I didn’t get into my first choice school, Chapel Hill) because it’s Kevin. This is just how his life is. And he’s a good guy. If anybody deserves it, it’s him. And then one day Kevin watches Jeopardy! with his grandmother, and when everybody goes to bed, he walks into the garage, fills a Gatorade bottle with gasoline (or maybe it’s lighter fluid, I forget now) and he locks himself in the bathroom and he drinks some of the stuff and he pours the rest on his body and he lights himself on fire. His family smells him burning. The emergency services people come and they break down the door and they lay him down in the living room and they ask him if he can hear them. He indicates that he can. He’s alive. He’s airlifted to a hospital and he dies a few hours later. He is 17 years old. It’s the first time I’ve ever known somebody who died, besides my grandmother and my great-grandmother and this one little kid’s dad who I maybe had met once who died in a plane explosion over some place called Lockerbie. It’s the first time I’ve ever known somebody who died young. It’s the first time I’ve ever known somebody who died when they weren’t supposed to (except that one kid’s dad, and I can’t for the life of me remember if I actually did meet him or just heard about it). It’s the first time I’ve ever learned that perfect is impossible. Perhaps, in the end, this is the most upsetting thing of all — not Kevin’s death itself, not the manner in which he chose to go (or was it a choice?) but the absolutely decimation of a cherished, easy belief that life is in fact very easy for people who look the right way and act the right way and do the right things. It turns out life is a lot more complicated than I thought. The day after I hear about Kevin, I leave on a trip to the land of my great-great grandparents — Sicily — and promptly have a full-on nervous breakdown. There is grief and then there is panic, and I am awash in both. I lose it — not for the last time in my life. But you never forget your first. As I’m laying on an exam table at a hospital near the sea, drinking the sedative the nurses have provided me, I wonder if Kevin is there somewhere. He’s not. And now let’s move to the real present tense — this moment, here, today, in real time. I’ve been thinking about Kevin a lot the past few days. His death taught me this above all else: everybody has pain. Everybody. Maybe the best among us carry the most pain of all, sometimes. I don’t know if I believe in God or angels or anything like that. I do believe that we’ve got to make the most of the time we have here. I have fallen short of this goal but I do not believe Kevin fell short of it. I do not believe Kevin was weak or that he was less-than or that he was selfish or a coward. I believe that Kevin did what Kevin needed to do while he was here, and we’re lucky we had him for as long as we did. Check on your kids. Check on your friend’s kids. Check on your kid’s friends. Check on your friends. Check on your parents. Check on your grandparents. Despair knows no age limit and depression does not discriminate. Just let them know you’re there. I wish I had. It’s not anybody’s fault, of course. It’s never anybody’s fault. Or maybe it’s everybody’s fault. Think of it however you need to think of it. Think of it however makes sense to you. And then stick around, please. I can’t give you easy answers why. I believe you’ll find them yourself, in time, so long as you never stop looking. You don’t have to be perfect and you don’t have to be good, even. You just have to stick around, even when it hurts and the pills don’t work and you feel like shit. No one ever said this was supposed to be easy. Stick around with the rest of us. We’re not so bad, most of us. And neither are you, to be honest. Every time I’ve wanted to not stick around — which has happened a lot in my life — I’ve always been glad, minutes or days or weeks or months or years later, that I chose not to go. Something awesome will happen, and I’ll take a moment and go, “Shit, I’m really glad I stuck around.” And then I forget how good it feels, and I want to kill myself again, and I don’t, and the awesomeness arrives in its own due time once again. Yesterday I spent five minutes pondering how many times I should blink while looking at the wall in order to stave off certain doom. It gets tiring living in this brain sometimes. But I stick around, because it also gets awesome. Stick around. Please. Thanks. Photo by Pierre Andrews.

The Advantages of Being a Packrat,"I never thought I’d change my opinion about the spilling piles of paper, magazines, and other random things my mom kept all around the house. They were annoying; they made the house look messy and if anyone tried to throw something out, my mom would get mad. Mostly, I didn’t understand the appeal of holding on to ephemera. Ephemera is supposed to be transitory; it’s there and then it’s not. Old advertising, museum brochures, movie tickets, scribbled notes, fortune cookie messages. Ephemera: a polite word for junk. But when your mom passes away, your perspective shifts. Your sense of normal — which included having your mom in your life until you were at least middle aged — is altered. You reevaluate your expectations and priorities. Several months ago, my dad and I started going through my mom’s stuff, and I found myself confronting these piles again. This time though, the piles weren’t annoying. They were actually kind of comforting, reminding me of what life used to be like before. Still, I didn’t expect to find what I found. Mixed in with the long-expired coupons, disintegrating cough drops, and balled up Kleenex, I found things I had never seen before. I had no idea she kept the front page of the newspaper from the day I was born. Brochures on breastfeeding and eating for two. Graduate school papers, response cards from my parents’ wedding, one of her job’s information packets, home movies from her childhood. Poems, drawings, every letter she ever received from her childhood friends, from the age of 12 when she left Michigan, until the last year of her life. Drawings my brother and I made when we were little, some of our toddler clothes, report cards. She had saved her memories. It wasn’t a memoir, like my grandfather wrote, but it was a peek into her world. Because she saved things she liked and wanted to remember, I’ve been able to get to know the younger version of my mom, seen her as a person first, and my mom second. I’ve come to understand her more, appreciate her more. Miss her more. Yet I’m still conflicted by these piles. She didn’t just save things she liked, she saved things she couldn’t bring herself to throw away. To get to the things that really meant something, I had to weed through the things that my mom forgot about. It’s a lot easier to miss the good stuff that way. The piles also mean that I have to make the choices she never did. I get to decide what was important to her and what wasn’t. That’s a lot of responsibility to place on another person, especially when that person is still grieving. Inevitably, this process has gotten me thinking about my own mementos. Because I don’t want the decisions I didn’t make to speak for me — I want to speak for me. I’m not nearly as inclined to keep things as my mom was, but I still do have some of my old toys, essays, Kid City magazines, and random tchotchkes. And for now, I want to keep most of those things. They represent the person I used to be and trigger childhood memories. I know I can pare my stuff down further though. I’m pretty sure no matter how many She-Ra books I have, I won’t forget how awesome she is. I doubt I’ll regret getting rid of the doll I never liked and the random ugly trinkets. So I’ve been culling down my current collection of memorabilia, and taking a more critical look at the things I choose to keep. Now before I indiscriminately toss or keep something, I take a moment to ask myself what I want to remember. Will I want to look back at old cards? Which projects are worth taking up space? Should I get rid of the 1930s hat that I love but rarely wear? In other words, what is important to me? I think of it as curating my life. As the expert on all things me, I’m the best person for the job. RACHAEL RIFKIN was inspired to become a ghostwriter/personal historian by her grandfather, who wrote a memoir about his time serving as a medic in the Korean War. Her blog, Family Resemblance, features selections from her grandfather’s memoir as well as stories about the traits we inherit, whether genetically or environmentally, and the qualities we only find in ourselves.

Never be nervous speaking again — Tips for anxious presenters,"If you have an important presentation coming up at work soon and your are nerves are getting the better of you there is a great deal you can do. Firstly, it’s important to remember that it’s our thoughts that dictate the way we feel that influence the way we behave that lead to our results. This universal principal and psychological fact applies to us all which once we understand, accept and know how to manage can change everything. It doesn’t matter whether we are considering approaching a member of the opposite sex to ask them out on a date, going for a job interview or presenting to our team at work, the one thing guaranteed to either help or hinder us are our thoughts. We become what we think about and so does our presentation Your partner is late home from work. You knew they were going for a quick celebratory birthday drink with a colleague at work but now it’s getting really late. You are worried and anxious, because you fear the worst; they have been attacked on the way home from the station, had too much to drink and stepped out into the middle of the road. Your anxiety becomes heightened even further by your thoughts that perhaps the reason for their absence is an affair. Your mind has made a quantum leap from a frenzied attack to a sordid affair, how did that happen? The more you play those thoughts in your head the more vivid you make the image and the more real the movie becomes. Now you’re upset and its completely unfounded because the only reason they are late is because they stopped for something to eat on the way home and their battery was dead on their mobile phone so couldn’t ring home. What movie do you play over and over again in your mind when it’s time to give an important presentation that causes your mouth to turn dry, butterflies to dance the tango in your stomach and that feeling of panic and dread? If you suffer from any of these symptoms then your anxiety is related to your thinking. That’s right; your thinking, no one else’s. The sweaty palms, racing heartbeat and galloping stomach are nothing to do with the ‘real’ world but a perceived world you have created in your own mind. It’s likely that your thoughts are related to some of the following: I’ll make a fool of myself They won’t like me I’ll forget my words I’ll drop my notes They’ll think I’m boring To tell you to stop being such a sissy and change your thoughts would be like telling someone who has a terrifying fear of flying to pull themselves together at 40,000 feet whilst being pelted around in their seat by turbulence. It’s futile so I won’t insult you. Here’s what I will tell you instead to control those nerves and turn them into your ally rather than your persecutor. Be prepared — Practice, practice, and practice some more. I don’t mean memorize, memorize and memorize, I mean get to know your material. Rehearse in front of the mirror, friends, family or even next doors dog, just know your stuff. Breathe — Allow yourself the time and space to improve the flow of oxygen to your brain to help you think more clearly. It’s impossible to hold more than one thought at a time so if your thought is focused on your breath then you will instantly begin to feel more calm and relaxed. Don’t be selfish — Stop focusing on yourself for a moment and think about your audience. Think about what they need and how you can help them instead. Don’t focus on whether your audience can hear you stuttering or can see the red blotches on your neck, think about how you can give them what they need. Play to your strengths — If you have a gift for telling stories then use it, or a talent for engaging through eye contact do that; if you know you can make people laugh then make them laugh or if you simply have a strong clear voice then use that to your advantage. Find your strength and play to it, just make sure you don’t overdo it! Be a number — Imagine confidence on a scale of one to ten with one representing the lowest level of confidence and ten the highest. Hold a high number of your choosing in your mind and choose to be that number whilst you speak. An eight will serve most people well and even though we are not actors we all subconsciously know how to be an eight; we just have to hold that number and image in our mind. Play a movie you like — Before you present, picture yourself in your mind presenting as you want. Imagine yourself standing there speaking fluently with your audience smiling being really supportive. If that’s too difficult then at least imagine yourself lying on the beach, doing something you love or perhaps that incredible moment you passed your driving test; remember how it felt. Change your thoughts and you’ll change your emotional state. Get perspective — Remember you probably know more about your subject than anyone in your audience so take comfort in that. If you don’t, then remember you have been asked to present for good reason; they could just have easily asked someone else but they chose you. Watch your language — Watch out for negative self- talk and replace it with positive thoughts about how good you really are and all that you have achieved in the past. Don’t beat yourself up in your mind; be kind and gentle with yourself, use words of encouragement. Learn from the best — Model yourself on excellence. Watch TED talks (http://www.ted.com/) and https://www.youtube.com/ videos of some of your favourite presenters; take on board what you admire the most and adapt what you like to suit your personality and style in a way that will work for you. Move -Try not to stand as though your feet are nailed to the floor, use your energy and own the platform. Move around with purpose, not just for the sake of it. Own the stage -The whole stage is yours, so show your audience that by owning it. If you have a flip chart be sure to move it to a position that suits you, if there is a screen then touch the screen, move the laptop, tables or chairs wherever you want them to show them it’s all yours. Look the part — Dress for confidence. If you look good it’s highly likely you will feel good too. Smile — Smiling makes you look more attractive, it’s contagious, will make you feel good and make other people feel good too.

You can have public speaking anxiety and still give a great speech,"At Mindful Presenter we are at very successful at helping people to overcome their public speaking anxiety because we know that you can be very nervous and still give a great speech. The history books are full of speakers who by their own admission tell of how they were quivering, nauseous wrecks even moments before an important speech. Many are very open in talking about how they thought they would never get through it yet somehow managed to not only do so but also deliver their message with power and impact. The world is full of people who perceive themselves to lack the public speaking prowess and confidence to inspire an audience into action yet often that is all it is, a personal perception; a belief. We all know how the mind can he help us to conceive and achieve our greatest dreams or confine us to limitation and misery, and its no different when it comes to speaking. I’ve lost count of the number of times I have personally coached individuals who consider themselves to be excessively anxious when speaking and believe their nerves to be to the detriment of their presentation. On occasion that may be the case but for the most part when those same people see themselves on video they cannot see any evidence of the stress that plagued them. The key to overcoming such anxiety is intent. That is having a sincere, honest and heartfelt intention to share something that you believe will be of real value to your audience. You may not necessarily have full confidence in yourself but you do need confidence in your message and in your intent. Take J.K. Rowling’s Harvard commencement address as you can see on the video. She begins her speech with the opening line: “The first thing I would like to say is ‘thank you.’ Not only has Harvard given me an extraordinary honour, but the weeks of fear and nausea I have endured at the thought of giving this commencement address have made me lose weight”. After rapturous applause and laughter she settles into her stride and not only immediately connects with her audience but is moments away from winning them over completely. How does she do it whilst openly claiming such angst? She endears herself to her audience through 3 of the most powerful communication tools known to man since the advent of public speaking. Self disclosure — which in its simplest form is the process of opening yourself up a little to your audience while accepting the feeling of vulnerability that accompanies doing so. In the case of J.K. Rowling she humbly lets her audience into her personal world as she shares some of the challenges she faced on her journey. Story — the greatest way to connect with your audience is through the power of story. Watch how J.K. Rowling achieves this connection with her audience as she shares hers with them. Message — it’s through the power, clarity and belief in our own message that the fear, doubt and confusion dissipates and leaves us free to deliver our point authentically and with sincerity. In this case as you can see J.K. Rowling more than admirably delivered hers: “I have decided to talk to you about the benefits of failure. And as you stand on the threshold of what is sometimes called ‘real life’, I want to extol the crucial importance of imagination.” I really hope you enjoyed this post.

"“Everyone is Secretly a Little Insecure No Matter How Confident They Seem,” Believes Local Idiot","“Everyone tries to put on a confident smile in public, but the truth is we all deal with self-doubt, and it’s important to remember that,” said Dentler, the only man in his friend group without a six-figure salary and a satisfying marriage. “Heck, I bet other people look at me and feel insecure,” the hopelessly delusional man continued. The dimwit went on to reason that although his dead-end job and obesity are certainly cause for concern, the issues are no more of a nuisance than those faced by the countless other successful, thoroughly content people he knows. “Whenever I feel self-doubt, or wonder if I’m acting ‘cool’ and if people will like me, I remember that everyone else feels the exact same way and is self-conscious of their behavior,” he speculated, incorrectly. At press time, Dentler’s wife is seeking a divorce. Listen here: [soundcloud id=’166168718']",2014
“It’s OK to be sad.”,"When we moved to New York City back in March, there were so many new and exciting things to look forward to: our apartment, new restaurants, walks in Central Park, new jobs, meeting new people, exploring New York City. We were so excited to experience life in NYC and try something different. There were also many unknowns and so much uncertainty that accompanied our move from rural New England to bustling NYC. I want to share some thoughts on the not-so-thrilling part of our quick decision to move and completely change our lives in a very short period of time… After a few weeks in the city, I caught myself obsessing and worrying about everything. What if I can’t find a job? Are we paying too much for rent? Is Bruiser OK living in a new space? Where will people sit when they come to visit (we don’t have a couch!)? Will we make friends? Was it the wrong decision to move? Most of the time, though, I was fine and happy and excited about this time in our lives; I was myself. Other days, I woke up in the morning in a weird mood and couldn’t shake it off for the entire day. A whole day in our new city — wasted. I felt guilty for feeling that way because we had moved to this amazing city — which was something I really wanted for us — and I had an amazing husband, supportive and loving family, great apartment, and a growing network of people to help me move forward with my career. But there were days when I felt insecure about our future and where we were in life. I was overwhelmed and frustrated. One afternoon, while hanging out in Central Park, my cousin Katie, who was in the city for work, said to me, “It’s OK to be sad.” I wasn’t sharing many details about why I felt down, but I know Katie could sense my apprehension. We talked about how life can throw you curve balls; one minute you’re on a high, and by the next minute, you feel like everything is out-of-place and just wrong. Initially, I didn’t think much about Katie’s comment. But later that day and over the following days, her comment kept coming back to me. “It’s OK to be sad.” It’s such a simple but powerful statement to say to someone who is dealing with something — anything — no matter how big or small that thing might be. We can be so hard on ourselves. It’s important to give yourself permission to be sad. It’s OK to let yourself feel the feelings. There is so much we learn about ourselves during times of insecurity, sadness, failure and those things are important to understand. I think those times of pain and suffering help us. You need the lows to truly appreciate the highs. For me, there are times when I am so focused on trying everything possible to get myself to not feel sad or guilty or whatever that I totally skip over the part when I listen to my feelings and reflect on them. Why am I sad? How did I get here? These are the questions I should give myself time to think about. Instead, I think: Snap out of it — I’m being ungrateful! What’s wrong with me? But if I strive to constantly be in a state of happiness — just a flat line — how can I truly appreciate life? How do I differentiate between the good times, great times, bad times, and every time in between? We’re all capable of feeling this huge range of feelings. If we miss out on the majority of our feelings because we’ve picked one feeling and put it on a pedestal and declared it as THE one we want ALL OF THE TIME then we become this annoyingly edited version of our true selves. Whatever your situation is, reflect on it and don’t rush through that time of reflection; don’t rush the process — trust it. Everyone is different, and everyone takes different amounts of time to work through their issues and emotions. Give yourself permission to feel whatever you’re feeling whether it’s sad, angry, lonely, confused, unsure. And try your best not to let guilt creep in. I know — way easier said than done, right? Maybe a better way of thinking about it is: try your best to be conscience of guilt creeping in. This is something I struggle with. The thing is, guilt adds this whole other element to the scenario and ends up taking away from your time of reflection and learning and growth. One last note: As I remember that afternoon in the park with my cousin, I can’t help but think that Katie must have gone through a similar time in her life, a time when she was feeling down and unsure and overwhelmed. If she hadn’t gone through something similar, how would she have known to say to me, “It’s OK to be sad.”? If anything, maybe we go through these rough times in our own lives to then turn around and help others get through their own hardships. To honestly and openly identify with and share the feelings of others. Empathy. What about you? Have you experienced these waves of anxiety and insecurity accompanied with an exciting/major life change? Have you been able to offer words of comfort to someone else experiencing a hardship? I’d love to hear your thoughts. xo (Dan took this picture of me last spring at the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens.)",2014
Immunity From Anxiety,"“Anxiety is a thin stream of fear trickling through the mind. If encouraged, it cuts a channel into which all other thoughts are drained.” Arthur Somers Roche “Its not stress that kills us, it is our reaction to it.” Hans Selye “Don’t let your mind bully your body into believing it must carry the burden of its worries.” Astrid Alauda Fear sometimes has to do with our feelings of inadequacy. So many times we believe we simply don’t measure up to others. This can be in expectations they have of us, or that we have of ourselves. The fear might also creep in, when we constantly review issues we blundered our way through. It may be totally in our own minds, but that is the only place it has to be to cause us anxiety and doubt. I can’t figure why we are all subjugated by fear. We can go someplace and be confident one minute, but then a word, look, gesture or criticism sets us tumbling to the ground. It is easy to tell ourselves we are being foolish, and it doesn’t mean a thing. It is also silly we realize, to allow another such power, to ruin our day or night. Having confidence in ourselves, doesn’t mean we don’t or can’t make mistakes. It means we have faith, in our ability to be successful, but not necessarily perfect. As far as I am concerned, I must not be as self-assured as I give myself credit. I am the unwilling victim, on numerous occasions.. I question why, I allow another, to put me off my game, and make me feel inept. I don’t believe many of us are so filled with pride, that we can withstand an onslaught of sharp jabs to our egos. I know I am probably the easiest person to knock down. As many times as it occurs, just as many times I admonish myself, and convince myself to do better, trust again, and stand up for me. It works until the next time. So we are left with why we keep repeating the same reaction. The bottom line is to get to the bottom of the problem. Certainly a fair amount of confidence, and a stronger armor to cover the heart, might do the trick. Then again, I can’t see shadowing empathy and love, so I refuse to let my heart be protected. This permits my heart to be painfully available, to possibly get hurt some more. I need a new attitude or mindset. Truthfully we all suffer those weak moments. We all hate the feelings brought on from an encounter with an individual, capable of eliciting such a reaction. Maybe we need to take a different approach and attack our problem in an alternate way. Instead of looking at ourselves, maybe it is time to view the other person. They are the people who bring painful experiences to our day. Perhaps it is their problem in the way they treat us. My questions might be, why do they do it, how are they feeling inside, and are they hurting so much, they lash out at others to feel better? Does their pain spill over into a bitterness that can’t be controlled anymore? The result of this overflow, is the painful interaction we experience. This can be from people we know well, to people we have recently met, to strangers. I am beginning to understand it a little better. Perhaps the negativity builds up, and they most likely would prefer to lash out at those that are close to them. Their actions can be damaging to other living creature. Cats and dogs are not exempt from becoming a target. This being the case means, there are many people in an angry and anxious state of mind. They relentlessly release their worries onto others, who become the victims ob blind injustice. The result is now two unhappy people, who are releasing anxieties on others. The ripple effect continues I honestly don’t think the majority of people, choose to deliberately hurt another. It is just like a faucet running with a plugged sink. Eventually the water overflows. Maybe it is a compliment when someone close to us, dumps their burden on us. If they feel comfortable to relieve some of their tension, by using us as a relief valve, then I would venture to say we may have done a good deed. Better to see it as a good deed, rather than as a hurtful experience. We might ponder the same questions, when it is us who have the desire to lash out at others. Maybe we must release some steam. If we can do it slowly, and silently, no one will notice our built up anger. Being in tune with our minds and hearts may help. When it is time to take a break, we must take it. Otherwise our bodies will find their own ways of releasing pressure. The confusing part for any of us to fathom, is that we all share in the moments of insecurity. No matter the person or the ability to hide it, we understand that it is always present. All of us have the capacity, to bring it out in others. Whether we mean to do it, or it happens accidentally, it should inspire us to pay better attention, to monitoring our need for reflective time. We may find answers, have relief and find truth. Rather than assuming what others are doing, when nothing could be further from reality, alleviates some painful experiences. In the long run, the less we dump on unsuspecting people, the less we will infect others, with our negative fearful attitude. Being allowed to maintain their friendly, carefree and positive mood, will likely allow them to influence others with their happy thoughts. If we think about it in all honesty, we comprehend how much our own frame of mind interferes with another. With that kind of power, shouldn’t we all be actively transmitting love, rather than fear? We all have bad days and even weeks. Let’s stop making everyone else pay the price. Perhaps when others are feeling low, maybe they will reciprocate. Our frail hearts can only hope. “Stress is the trash of modern life — we all generate it but if you don’t dispose of it properly, it will pile up and overtake your life.” Terri Guillemets “Be soft. Do not let the world make you hard. Do not let pain make you hate. Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness. Take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree, you still believe it to be a beautiful place.” Kurt Vonnegut “I promise you nothing is as chaotic as it seems. Nothing is worth your health. Nothing is worth poisoning yourself into stress, anxiety, and fear.” Steve Maraboli Originally published at pamreynolds.me on September 8, 2014.",2014
Frustrated with Things You Can’t Control? Here’s How to Deal,"A version of this post was originally published at stronginsideout.com on October 20, 2014. Today, I’m sitting at the Virgin terminal at SFO, which is awesome. Healthy food, wide open bright space, comfy chairs, lots of outlets… It would be even more awesome if I wasn’t supposed to be halfway to NYC by now. My flight is delayed 3 hours. I’m sitting here, knowing I won’t be getting to my hotel until 3 AM and I’m teaching an event tomorrow. My blood could be boiling right now. I could be throwing a fit at the customer service desk. I could be calling Virgin America, demanding a ticket credit or a free hotel stay! There are so many instances every day that are just completely out of control like this, but what do we do? We fret. We worry. We get frustrated and angry and we let that fury conquer our day. I feel myself starting to be pulled in that direction right now. But I refuse. In fact, I used to get all up and arms, huffing and puffing, complaining to anyone and no one at all. Now I watch other people do that while I sit back and wait. Now I see it from the outside and recognize it for what it is: useless. A lot of the energy we spend on worrying and frustration is useless. We think that by dwelling on the situation we’ll come up with a solution, and sometimes we’re right… if it’s a situation we have any control over. Knowing the difference between things you have control over and those you don’t is the key to saving yourself tons of time, sweat and tears. Some things just won’t be fixed by frustration. Today, I want to give you the tools to start feeling better no matter your level of control. First off, let’s learn how to tell the difference between the things we can’t control and those we can. Whether you’re religious or not, you’ve probably heard The Serenity Prayer or a version of it. It goes like this: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference.” Whatever you believe in, this prayer holds something for all of us. To know the difference between what you can and cannot control dictates where you perceive your power to be held. This might not make sense, but hear me out. When you struggle and fight something that you cannot control, you prolong the nasty feelings that come along with it. You might get angry that you don’t have control, you might think you’re weak because you can’t change it. You might even lash out and hurt someone else emotionally because of something you couldn’t change in the first place. When you realize that it is out of your control, however, you have the opportunity to take your power back. Strength is not determined by your circumstances, but by what you do with them. To separate the things we can control from those we cannot, all you have to do is ask yourself: Using my example of my super-delayed flight above, my answer would have to be “my reaction to it.” I couldn’t make the plane leave faster. Everyone was delayed, so I was out of luck in switching flights. I came to the conclusion that it was out of my control. Let’s say for the purpose of comparison that I was getting frustrated about my weight. Asking myself the same question, I would answer: “the way I eat, the amount I move, my attitude about my weight.” This situation is one I can control. My frustration stems from my choice not to do anything about it. If your only answer contains reactions to the situation instead of ways to remedy the situation itself, you are dealing with an event you cannot control. But what if the line isn’t so clear? Now, let’s take a situation that many of us are a little fuzzy about: depression. A lot of us deal with this frustration all the time with depression or anxiety. Much of it may be out of our control–the fact that it happens to us, that it comes in uninvited. We can avoid the triggers that we know lead us to depression, but in many of us, something like not getting enough sleep can be enough to set it off. And that’s not our fault. Our actions, however, we can control. We can choose to stand up and protect ourselves with self-care, or we can let it take us away. I advocate fighting for your health and taking positive action to stay standing, but I want to make sure I’m clear about this next part: fighting your depression in terms of pushing it down, pretending it’s not there or being angry at yourself for going through it at all is a waste of time. That is not the “fight” that I’m promoting. The “fight” I teach is the refusal to be dragged away with it, to maintain hope in the fury of chaos. You can get angry at it. You can be disappointed that it’s happening again. But the more you try to stuff it down, the stronger it gets. You can learn to live in spite of these storms. With practice they may lose their power, diminishing from hurricanes to gentle rains. And if they don’t, you’ll get stronger at holding your ground and living your life no matter how much they blow. Let the storm pass, and stay standing with some of these tips. You’ve already diagnosed that you have no control over this situation. So why struggle against it when you can be spending that energy on making yourself feel better as you go through it? The first step to dealing with situations you can’t control is accepting them. Acknowledge that they’re here, and that you may struggle through this, but also that it will teach you something. Be mindful, be present and be curious about this situation. It doesn’t mean you have to give up your power to it; you just have to acknowledge that it’s there. By doing, you alleviate a lot of the frustration, anxiety and helplessness that comes with an event you can’t control. By carefully selecting your reactions to this situation, you can take quite a bit of the suck out of it. If I’m being hit with a wave of anxiety out of nowhere, I’ll go to one of my 3 proven ways to start feeling better and ride it out: I’ll talk to my husband, one of my besties or a therapist. Saying my worries out loud helps me gain perspective on the situation and is highly likely to alleviate the anxiety right away. I’ll go for a slow run or do a yoga class. Getting mindful and doing repetitive movements that my body is familiar with allows me to zen out into my moving meditation. I’ll focus on helping someone else. A proven tactic for relieving depression, shifting your thoughts to someone else’s wellbeing helps me to worry less about my own stuff and get some distance on my stressors. I often come back from this with fresh eyes, able to see that what was bothering me wasn’t really a big deal at all. Why is this happening? Is there a silver lining? I found out the reason for my flight being delayed- mechanics were replacing the brake system. My frustration got a slap in the face. Thank God they found it and we didn’t leave with a faulty system! It’s a good thing they weren’t rushing through it! Look for the why behind the event, and it might make you feel better. If you can’t find it, have faith that it’s there. Ok, so those things above are great for when you’re not fuming and ready to explode from frustration. Sometimes it goes too far too fast before we realize what’s happening. When that happens, try this exercise. For at least 10 rounds: Here’s why it works: When we’re descending into the chaos of frustration, sometimes all we need is space and stillness. This exercise that gives you just that. The only way you’re going to stop feeling this anxiety and frustration is if you take action. If you’re not willing to take the action, you must accept the situation and look for other ways to find serenity within it to save yourself from constant frustration. Hold onto your frustration without a way out, and you’re provoking stress in your life, which can wreak havoc on your body and mind. If you can control it and it’s making you unhappy, you have to take responsibility for yourself. If your surroundings, friends or habits promote a negative mindset or body, you’re the only one who can change them. You choose where you spend time, who you spend it with and what you spend it doing. If you’re unhappy and it’s something you can control, it’s you who’s keeping it that way. I say this to help you realize that it’s just a switch. It’s just a choice YOU make. It’s just the acknowledgment of the strength lying dormant within you. You have everything it takes to stand up and live, to have joy in spite of struggle. When you don’t do anything about your current state, you give that up. Fight to stand back up. Fight to stay you in the storm. And thank the struggle for what it’s teaching you: that you’re strong enough to wait it out.

Is the Tiger in the room?   ,"Is the Tiger in the room?  Two nights ago I started to worry about the possible negative outcome of an event that was happening in my life. I felt the worry rising and as I allowed my thoughts to run riot they turned from a simple worry to a deeper anxiety. I caught myself in the midst of this and knew that I was ‘future thinking’ (always a dangerous place to go with thoughts!). So I asked myself, ”Is the tiger in the room?” Imagine that your worries, stresses or anxieties are a tiger on the prowl. When we feel like this tiger is coming to attack (something bad is going to happen), it sends us into stress mode and our bodies can’t tell the difference between this perceived/imagined ‘tiger’ or a real tiger about to pounce! The body reacts in the same way it would to protect us from real danger, releasing all kinds of stress (fight or flight) hormones, raising our heart beat, shortness of breath, sweating & flooding us with unpleasant emotions. Most of the time, however, when we are feeling worried, stressed or anxious we are NOT in imminent danger so next time you feel these negative emotions, ask yourself “Is the tiger in the room?” The answer will probably be “No”; in fact the tiger probably isn’t even at the door, there may not even be a tiger at all, just an imagined, possibility of a tiger coming at some point in the future. Filling your mind with thoughts of possible future dangers (or problems) is a sure fire way to live with fear and anxiety in your life. As a general rule if ‘the tiger is not in the room’ be grateful for that, move on with your life and let your thoughts & fears go. Two nights ago when I asked myself “Is the tiger in the room?”, surprise, surprise, the tiger wasn’t in the room, it never came into the room and the ‘tiger’ never happened! PLEASE NOTE: This does not suggest that we should be completely passive about possible problems in the future. If you can take prudent, positive actions towards preventing or managing a problem then of course do so, but if there are no actions that can be taken (as with many future, perceived problems), then just let those thoughts go knowing that you are safe in this moment. If you have any questions or would like to look more deeply into anything mentioned above, please get in touch sarah@selfspace.co.uk",2014

Death by a Thousand Emotional Microtransactions,"How much do you care what people think of you? How much do you care what people you’ve never met think of you? How much do you care what people you’ve never met think about any individual choice you make or opinion you share? How much do you care what people you’ve never met think of the specifics of the format, timing, wording, tone, or technological means of the opinion you’ve shared? If you use Twitter, or social media in general, you already kind of know the answer, or at least you’re learning it. I have been learning some lessons myself about social media; how it can be used either passively or with intention; how it informs our personal identity; and how I have allowed it too much unfettered access to my nervous system, among other things. Clearly, for all its benefits, Twitter is also an enormous source of potential stress, eliciting what I call the Torrent of Feelings. I won’t get into the myriad factors that make this so. Browse this here blog, and you’ll see other ruminations on this subject. What occurs to me lately is that a lot of the stress that Twitter (et. al.) engenders has to do with our perceptions of being judged. The more you present yourself on one of these platforms (and I’ll just use Twitter for now, since it’s my traditional platform and I’m tired of typing provisos indicating “et cetera”), the more you have your sense of self and identity wrapped up in it. And that can make one sensitive to the scrutiny that comes with such exposure. Freddie deBoer recently put it like this: “You’re doing it wrong” is the internet’s truest, most genuine expression of itself. For whatever reason, the endless exposure to other people’s minds has made the vague feeling that someone, somewhere, is judging you into the most powerful force in the world. But what is being judged? The more I think about it, the more I think the answer is “everything.” And not “everything” in the sense of one’s whole self. That is happening, but it’s piecemeal. Very piecemeal, granular in the extreme. Because of course no one can encapsulate their whole selves in a tweet, or even a series of them, so judgment comes in small units. The hyperscrutinization that people experience (I know I do) on Twitter happens tweet by tweet, and on down. Of course you can be called out for the substance of your opinions and choices, whether deservedly or not. But you can also be derided for your word choice, the timing of your tweet, your grammar, your nuance, your lack of nuance, your hashtag use, your frequency of tweeting or lack thereof, what client you’ve chosen to tweet from, and so on. And in those instances, though they are highly focused, the effect on the recipient is to add it to the collections of judgments about themselves as people. As Boone Gorges puts it, “A life spent on Twitter is a death by a thousand emotional microtransactions.” And while I strongly advocate using Twitter and social media with great intention, there’s not much you can do about this micro-judgment phenomenon besides not using Twitter. That’s because Twitter is used by humans (usually), and humans, even the ones we really like, also tend toward the shallow and the knee-jerk response in an environment that fosters that kind of thing. Gorges again: Every tweet I read or write elicits some small (or not so small) emotional reaction: anger, mirth, puzzlement, guilt, anxiety, frustration. I’ve tried to prune my following list so that when I do find myself engaging in a genuine way, it’s with a person I genuinely want to engage with. But there’s a limit to how much pruning can be done, when unfollowing a real-life friend is the online equivalent of punting his puppy across the room. So all day long, I’m in and out of the stream, always reacting to whatever’s coming next. And there’s a domino effect. Especially during times of collective stress (such as the siege on Ferguson, the death of someone notable, etc.), those on the periphery peek in, see the Torrent of Feelings swirling around them, which causes them to judge the validity of that. Erin Kissane writes: In the flood of information and emotion from something like Ferguson (or war crimes or an epidemic) … there we all are, gradually drowning. So people get huffy about the volume emotion that these events arouse — angry that others are angry about the wrong things or too many things or in the wrong register. … (I am properly angry, you are merely “outraged.”) It should be noted that of the three writers quoted here, all three have left Twitter. DeBoer’s been gone for a while I think, and the other two announced their exit in the quoted posts. Now, I’m not leaving. I have too much invested socially and professionally in Twitter to foreswear it. I will have to make do with diligent pruning, and accept that it will require a degree of fluidity: maybe I mute or unfollow certain people at certain times, and then bring them back to my feed at other times, for example. I will probably screw some of it up. All of this is to say that Twitter is valuable, but we human beings are so damned vulnerable. The Twitter service does not care at all about this vulnerability, and probably thrives as a result of it. But I think we can do a lot to both harness Twitter’s positive value while being highly mindful of its power to kill by a thousand cuts (and this is before we even get to outright abuse, harassments, and threats, which is a related problem at a much higher temperature). I’ll be thinking about these things as I tweet and react, but also as I take in the reactions of others to me. It won’t be easy. — Image by Shutterstock.",2014
It’s Worth Focusing on My Own Happiness,"Consider this headline: “A wife’s happiness is more crucial than her husband’s in keeping marriage on track.” Now savor the summary: “When it comes to a happy marriage, a new study finds that the more content the wife is with the long-term union, the happier the husband is with his life no matter how he feels about the nuptials.” Lovely. Just lovely. I love science. So what if the laundry isn’t all done? So what if there’s dust in my house or the yard isn’t immaculate? I am doing everything I can to take care of my family and myself. Putting into practice the idea of prioritizing my own happiness, I set aside a couple days this week to not work but still took my daughter to daycare like normal. One morning I focused on cleaning part of the house and steaming the carpets. Shockingly, a baby and two dogs mean that the carpets get dirty more quickly than when there are just two adults living in the house. It may sound odd, but it was incredibly therapeutic to clean while music was playing. The OCD part of me is quite satisfied that cleaning occurred, and since I was able to take my time (I had no deadline or anything that *had* to be done today), it was peaceful. Then I watched The Daily Show while eating lunch. I can’t remember the last time I was able to eat lunch by myself and focus on enjoying it. What a small miracle. I ran a couple errands that afternoon, and I wasn’t rushed or frantic. I could weep for happiness at the peace and relaxation that this day off gave me, and the fact that I was so happy about having a day like this to myself just emphasized to me how stressed I had been (breaking into tears the night before was also a clue). There have been many nights in the past few weeks when I had an hour or two at night to try to relax, but I physically was unable to do so. It was like an itch. This day went a long way towards restoring a more positive mental (and therefore physical) state. I still got stuff done (cleaning , errands), but I didn’t have anything that “had” to be done and I was able to be on my own for a bit. As a very introverted person, this solitude was something I had been missing recently. My happiness matters, and it matters not just for my own sake but for that of my family.

How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Mosh Pit,"One cold, January night while I was walking in my college town of Santa Cruz, CA, I noticed the marquee of the local concert venue read, “FIDLAR + Pangea*.” Both bands got popular in the local garage rock/punk scene in Los Angeles, and are associated with the semi famous (and very hipster) music label, Burger Records. My friends in LA had been talking about them nonstop for months at that point. The show was on a Saturday night when I had nothing to do and it’s was less than $10 so I thought, why not? I had a new roommate and we bonded instantly over our shared music taste. It was routine for us to introduce each other to new bands, so it didn’t take much convincing for her to come with me. I hadn’t really listened to either band, but that week from Thursday to Saturday her and I did nothing but listen to Living Dummy and FIDLAR (Pangea and FIDLAR’s albums, respectively). I can assure you two people have never fallen in love with two albums more quickly. When we weren’t looking up the lyrics and screaming along to the songs we were debating which band members were the cutest. To say we were obsessed would have been an understatement. The night of the concert we were faux moshing in the living room, bursting with excitement. On the walk to the venue, my good mood started to evaporate. My anxiety refused to hide itself any longer and I started to freak out. Moshing with my new friend was fun, but with other people? Strangers I didn’t know? In a place I didn’t know? The thought of a situation where I had zero control was absolutely terrifying. About a year prior to that cold, January night, I had seen the band Sleigh Bells and when a mosh pit unexpectedly started, I had an instant panic attack. They had been playing for no more than 90 seconds when I was finally pulled out of the pit by security with tears streaming down my face. By the time I calmed down, the show was almost over. It remains (remained?) one of my most shameful moments. I had experienced panics attacks before but never in public. On top of feeling scared and exhausted, I was humiliated. I was so ashamed of my own fragility. My anxiety was just another thing on a long list of Shitty Things About Me. At the time, it was getting in the way of my romantic relationship, my own sanity, and now it was threatening to ruin my favorite thing: music. The summer before that concert in Santa Cruz, FIDLAR and Pangea were just starting to get popular. They were constantly playing free shows all over Los Angeles, and it seemed like my friends were at every one. I declined every invitation to join them, making up some excuse or another. I hadn’t told anyone about my mosh pit debacle and frankly I was hoping to carry the experience to my grave. I would just smile and nod when they talked about the show the next day, silently kicking myself for missing something that sounded so fun but still terrified to repeat experience. As we turned on to the street of the concert, I felt angry at myself for having turned down all those opportunities to see these bands, only now to realize I how much loved them. I was really angry at my anxiety for messing up my life up. Again. I vowed this time would be different. I pushed the worried thoughts out of my mind as we arrived at the venue. At the beginning, my friend and I stayed on the outskirts of the mosh pit. The opening band was loud and fast and poppy, and we found ourselves jumping around together on the edge of the pit. I watched the audience and noticed they embodied the complete opposite of anxiety: they were spontaneous, messy, carefree. I suddenly felt a pang of jealousy — they looked how I wanted to feel. When Pangea started playing, I couldn’t stand it any longer. How can you not mosh to a song called, Too Drunk To Cum? My friend and I jumped into the mosh pit, and I couldn’t believe how fun it was. Holding hands and screaming with my new friend, listening to my new favorite band and not giving a single solitary fuck was the greatest feeling I never knew I needed to feel. I didn’t feel anxious. I wasn’t worrying. I was punching strangers and getting their sweat on me…and loving it. By the time FIDLAR came on we were drenched in sweat, exhausted, and so incredibly happy. I don’t think punk music can cure anxiety. It sure as hell didn’t cure mine. It still takes me 45 minutes to fall asleep at night because my thoughts just never stop racing. Sometimes I rehearse what I’m going to in my head half dozen times before I say it (“Hi, do you sell MUNI passes here? Can I get one please? Thank you!”). But I do think that night represented a fundamental shift in how I feel about myself. My new found love for moshing and garage punk feel less like early 20s rebellion and more like self care. I’ve learned that crappy feelings and panic attacks always pass. I’ve learned that the messy parts of myself are okay, and if there are parts I really don’t like, I can change them. Whenever I leave a mosh pit sweaty and exhausted after shoving people bigger than me for an hour and a half, I’m reminded of how weak I used to feel and strong I truly am.",2014
Dealing with a Mental Disorder in the Workplace — The Bold Italic — San Francisco,"Imagine a large, oddly shaped box with an unevenly distributed weight. You can carry it on your side with the help of your hip for a while, but eventually it gets uncomfortable. So you switch it to the other side, hold it over your shoulder for a bit, then put it on your head and drag it on the floor, trying out every position possible. It’s super-annoying, but you can carry it around with you if you have to. That’s what living with constant anxiety feels like, especially when you’re in an office setting where you have ongoing tasks to complete, meetings to hold and people whose job it is to ensure that you’re hitting quarterly goals and owning your projects. Imagine a large, oddly shaped box with an unevenly distributed weight. You can carry it on your side with the help of your hip for a while, but eventually it gets uncomfortable. I’ve been on various medications to help me function as a “normal” human being since my freshman year of college. Lexapro made me numb to the world; Strattera made me constantly nauseous; and Effexor killed my sex drive (which wasn’t exactly ideal for a newlywed). By the time I tried Wellbutrin, I was just hoping it would wake up my lady parts while still keeping my anxiety at bay. After a month, I started to feel more anxious than usual, and I became convinced that it wasn’t working. So without asking my doctor, I just stopped taking my meds. I optimistically, and stupidly thought, “I don’t need these. I’m smart. Experienced. A top performer at work. I can manage this. I don’t need help.” Two weeks later, as the medication’s effects increasingly dwindled, a wave of panic, exhaustion, racing thoughts and sleepless nights overtook me. At work, I physically couldn’t sit at my desk for more than two minutes at a time. My normal multitasking capabilities had completely disappeared. The tasks, projects and deadlines in front of me raced through my head at a million miles an hour, too fast for me to even sort through them. I felt dizzy. I became tense and increasingly edgy and would snap at my coworkers. I would notice my shortness, adjust myself and try to carry myself more mindfully during my next meeting. Later, I would stare at my list of tasks, feel the weight getting uncomfortable again and go for a walk. The anxiety kept building despite my various attempts to calm myself. I paced back and forth from the kitchen to my desk, to the bathroom, to a conference room, back to my desk, then up again for a talk to my coworker, hoping that discussing pointless things would help. The weight kept getting heavier as I walked back to the bathroom, trying to keep the tears from coming and taking a few deep breaths. Finally, I escaped to the second floor bathroom and, with my head in my hands, silently cried. My normal multitasking capabilities had completely disappeared. The tasks, projects and deadlines in front of me raced through my head at a million miles an hour, too fast for me to even sort through them. I felt dizzy. An anxiety attack this powerful doesn’t exactly make for a glamorous LinkedIn headshot. Human psychology is a weird thing. The issue is not whether you have a mental disorder; it’s where you lie on a spectrum. Or so my shrink tells me. Anxiety, ADHD, bipolar: I have different levels of all these disorders. And trying to explain what specifically I’m struggling with and how it affects my job is complicated. I try to prevent potential distractions as much as possible. I make lists, calendar everything and keep my belongings in specific places since I tend to forget things easily. I bought a discrete pill case so that I don’t look like Cheri Oteri’s Collette Reardon when digging through my purse for my medication. None of these things makes it seem like I’m doing anything different from anyone else, but that’s because I am back on medication. The drug cocktails I take do the bulk of the work to stabilize the highs and lows, allowing me to focus and complete more cumbersome tasks, and they also prevent the anxiety attacks. I’m sure I’m not the only person in the office who has the occasional meltdown in the bathroom, but I often wonder who else is hiding with me without my knowing it. The meritocratic workplace only allows for the occasional conversation about anxiety (the only “socially acceptable” mental disorder to have), and discussions about the issue are usually just humble brags about how important and busy someone is and not really about dealing with ongoing mental health issues. You can’t casually say, “Man, I’m just really hypomanic this week” or “ADHD is just kicking my ass today—I’m forgetting almost everything.” No one wants to be a Debbie Downer and get demoted. Those comfy enough to talk about their various disorders, including me, usually keep it at a surface level. We minimize and talk about it from a mostly conquered place. No one wants to be that guy/girl who has conversations prefaced with “Oh, it’s because I have [insert mental disorder here].” And you would never, ever mention these kinds of mental health struggles to superiors or influencers at work. The meritocratic workplace only allows for the occasional conversation about anxiety (the only “socially acceptable” mental disorder to have), and discussions about the issue are usually just humble brags about how important and busy someone is and not really about dealing with ongoing mental health issues. However, some things fell through the cracks during my month-long medication hiatus. I grew increasingly anxious about my work performance and convinced myself that I was letting everyone in the company down. Maybe I was being dramatic, but the sickly feeling in my stomach was telling me that I was on the verge of getting fired. I was sure my superiors thought my performance was declining in general, instead of it being a temporary issue. A week later, I impulsively asked my boss if I could talk to him. In typical ADHD fashion, the idea of coming clean to him about my anxieties came to me in a moment. I immediately fixated on it and quickly decided this was the best and only plan for action to prevent him from firing me. Yes, explaining your mental health issues to your boss without it affecting their respect for and perception of you is probably something you should think through. But I was feeling classic impulsiveness. “I have anxiety,” I explained. “Well, anxiety-related issues I’m working through. I just wanted to let you know because you’ve probably noticed that I’ve dropped the ball. More specifically, I’ve forgotten a couple of things I was supposed to do these past few weeks, but I’m in between different medications, and I’m working on it. So this is only temporary, but I’m letting you know because I know evaluations are coming up.” I don’t remember much else of what I said; I just know it probably didn’t make a ton of sense and was hard to understand since I was talking at a million miles an hour. Luckily, I have a great boss who is understanding and supportive, and who hasn’t changed how he works with me or removed me from important projects. I know not everyone is as fortunate. No one wants to be a Debbie Downer and get demoted. Those comfy enough to talk about their various disorders, including me, usually keep it at a surface level. Not much changed at work after I spilled the beans to my boss, which is a good thing. I feel a little better now that I’m not hiding what’s going on with me, but I still notice that people flinch when they hear words like “bipolar” and “OCD,” so I carefully navigate professional conversations, hoping to mask any signs of weakness or incompetence. Mostly, I just make light of my disorders like they aren’t a big deal. Which is half-true. They’re more of a midsize deal, but I try not to let them define how I see my career self or rule out what opportunities I can and can’t take. Thankfully, more and more well-known people — Lena Dunham, for instance — have come forward to talk openly about mental illness, helping to remove the idea that people like me can’t have a successful and stable career. I really wish I could tell you that I’ve found the best medication balance; worked through and cured my anxiety, ADHD and mild bipolar disorders; and now live a completely balanced, stable professional life. But in the process of writing just that one paragraph, I have gotten up three times. Once to go to the bathroom, then another to grab a Q-tip to clean my ears, then another to grab some Häagen-Dazs out of the fridge. On top of that, I’ve changed the Spotify playlist I was listening to twice, and I watched three TED talks. OK, maybe it was five TED talks. Some of them were related to mental disorders, so technically they were research for this essay. Yep, I still don’t have it all together. But I will say that through a lot of self-introspection, and with my doctors and support groups, I’ve come to realize that while I may have rough patches throughout my professional career, it’s OK. As comedian Joshua Walters said, “Being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn’t mean you’re crazy. Maybe it just means you’re more sensitive to what most people can’t see or feel. Maybe no one is really crazy, but everyone is just a little bit mad. How much depends on where you are on the spectrum. How much depends on how lucky you are.” thebolditalic.com thebolditalic.com",2014
51 Minutes in a Revolving Door,"Mid-turn, and the whole thing stopped moving. With a sighhhhh. And a click. The person in front of me (hair scraped into a bun and brown coat) was able to squeeze out. As was the person behind me (heavy boots and red scarf). But I was trapped. By three walls of glass. After much pushing and shrugging on my part, the security guard approached holding up a note written on the back of a ticket stub. Are you ok? Door stuck? His name tag said “Bill” and he could not have been older than 19. “I can hear you,” I said. “Yes it is. And yes, I’m fine.” Good, Bill wrote on his hand before, subsequently, transforming these words into a thumbs up. He turned to another security guard: “I think the door’s stuck,” he said. Bill’s Friend looks at the door. And then at me: “Christ.” 10:15 AM: Bill and his Friend start to pull the door. And like any self-respecting young woman living in a post-Liam-Neeson-Taken era, I decided to call… my father. “Dad. I’m trapped in a revolving door.” There followed a crunch of cornflakes. “Is this a metaphor?” My father asked. “Did you want to speak to your mother? You know I’m no good at these sorts of problems.” I tell him it’s real. I tell him it’s happening. I tell him to feed my fish if I don’t make it out. “Honey, [cornflake crunch/ swallow] have you actually tried pushing the door. Push the door. See what happens.” This whole time, museum patrons are trying to use the revolving door/my new glass prison. Puzzled when nothing happens, they look at me. And then exit through the side door to the left. Some of them shake their heads or roll their eyes. I have, they presume, broken the door. Children are crying: they wanted to go through “the spinning” door: “What did the lady do?” A small girl asks her mother. “I can hear you,” I say. 10:20 AM: After five minutes of unsuccessful pushing and pulling, Bill’s Friend approaches the glass with a note: Facilities are coming. I nod: “Good stuff.” Bill’s friend raises his eyebrows, blinks and writes back: How’s your air? Asthma? Oh. Right. Ok. Right. Because *could I* suffocate in here? I shake my head. He smiles and writes: Ok. Stay Calm. Stay still. “I”ll try,” I say as he walks away. So, like they tell you in those high-socked Primary School fire drills, I sat down. In order to avoid the non-existent smoke. All the air is at the bottom of the revolving door, right? Right. Ok. Good. Knees to chin. 10:27 AM: Bill, Bill’s Friend and the newly arrived Facilities Man and Woman all stand in a line and give multiple thumbs up. “She has interesting hair,” Facilities Woman whispers, cocking her head to the side. “I can hear you,” I reply. They nod with big grins: “Keep — smiling,” Facilities Man says through gritted teeth: “Keep — smiling. Keep — her — calm.” After exuberant waves and hammer mimes, the latter two start working on the mechanism to the side of the door. Meanwhile, Bill and his Friend get back on their walkie-talkies: “We have a situation here.” 10:32 AM: All this time, out on the street, people wander past. Students, Christmas shoppers, university staff, museum staff, old, young, prammed, wheel-chaired: they’re all moving. There’s scuffing and shuffling and running for the bus. Loitering and lolling and a man grabs a woman’s hand. They’ve been walking in stride but she yanks her palm away, and places it over her neck, saying something I can’t hear and backing away. A mother leans down to tie a girl’s yellow shoe. A man drops a binder and the papers scuttle over the pavement like one-winged doves: hovering and falling and taken by cars. Alerted by the group of small people around the door, some of these pedestrians smile in my direction. Or stop to stare. “Art installation,” one woman sighs to her companion: “total student rubbish.” 10:33 AM: Cue the arrival of a group of my scarfed students from last term. They wave. “Hi Jess!” Facilities Woman shakes her head and looks up from her position on the pavement: “she can’t hear you.” The students nod in unison and grin. Two of them salute and they all keep walking, arm-in-arm. This predicament, it seems, does not look unusual to them. However, their class was Fiction Writing 101. And — among other things — I made them follow strangers around supermarkets, write about the contents of their shopping trollies and wear each other’s shoes for a day: their reaction here is fair. 10:39 PM: Cue the appearance of French Neighbor. Giselle is beautiful and French and may have been lead to the impression that I, in fact, speak French. “Allo? Jezzie?” She gets right up to the glass and says something to Bill’s Friend. He replies in French and is, with wide eyes, clearly transfixed. She is beautiful and French and the Facilities Man stops working for a second to look at her face. (Leave Giselle! You are too beautiful!). She puts her un-opened bottle of water in front of the door and nods at me. Then — borrowing the pen from Bill’s Friend who is ignoring the (now audible) yelling on his walkie-talkie — she writes a note and presses it against the window. I do not, as it happens, speak or read French. But this all feels too complicated, at this point, to explain through a stuck revolving door. So I nod: “Oui.” She kisses her fingertips and places them on the glass, mimes washing her face and points to the bottle of water. “Au revoir,” she says though, very loudly though so its more like: “OHHHEVVWARRRRRRR.” And she’s gone. Bill’s Friend looks bereft, and watches her turn the corner: a whip of (so gold it’s almost) silver hair around red brick. 10: 45 AM: Cue, of course OF COURSE BECAUSE WHY NOT, my Supervisor and her Colleague. They have nice satchels. And the highest heels. White necks above long, black coats. Small earrings that catch the light. They’ve come from a lecture and are, loudly, discussing the “Poor quality of the speaker.” Supervisor stops mid-step and looks at me. Sitting. In a revolving door. Wearing a strange jumper. Holding a book. That she gave me to read… three months ago. There is no surprise in her voice, rather resignation when she turns to her high-chinned Colleague: “That’s Jess. Over there. In the door.” Colleague nods, knowingly: “Ahhhh.” She accompanies this with an exaggerated sad face at me. “I can hear you,” I say, pointing at my ears. 10:47 AM: With her leather folder under her arm, Supervisor talks to the small crowd working on the door. “How long?” And, “How much?” And, “Who?” And, “What?” And, “Ridiculous.” Her voice, eve outside the office, is sharp and bright. Thin like a knife. Bill’s Friend stammers his replies. He wants Giselle back. I know how he feels. Reaching out with her black, gloved fingers, Supervisor approaches a Suited Man who’s just arrived, clutching blueprints. She takes his elbow and leans in to speak. “she can’t hear you,” Suited Man says, hastily turning the blueprints round and round like a steering wheel. Supervisor asks to borrow his pen and her Colleague’s lecture program. She gets right up close to the door though, she does not bend down so that I should stand to read her note: Ok? My usual interaction with Supervisor’s handwriting involves phrases such as (but not limited to): WHAT? or WHY? or NO or GRAMMAR IS IMPORTANT TO THE REST OF US. I nod. Thumbs up. Supervisor hands the pen back to the Suited Man who is squinting at a folder. “Email me,” Supervisor mouths, typing on an invisible keyboard then, raising her free arm into a shrug: “CHAP-TER? SOME-TIME? SOON?” And she’s gone. 10:50 AM: A tourist takes a photo. I smile? 10:55 AM: A group of tourists pose for a photo. I do not smile. I feel like a panda. 11:00 AM: A — very very very small — boy comes up and puts his hand on the glass. Pink starfish. I resist the urge to put my hand up too. It’s busier now and more people are pointing and talking. This exact situation comprises 34% of my nightmares (add laughter, and we’d be at 50%). It’s warm in the glass with the sun coming in. It’s warm and I take off my coat. It’s warm and the noises are loud. And then, I’m holding my own hand. At this point, I start to lose it. Stuck in the revolving door, this is where I’m going to die. Of course it is, though. Fueled by indecisiveness. Wholly transparent. Locked in frustrated, circular motion. Tights-that-I-thought-were-black-but-that-are-navy. Everything within reach. But nothing attainable. Thin air (?). On my knees. With my laptop. And lots of chewing gum. Goodbye world. I call my father again. “Now honey, are you sure you’ve pushed the door?” 11:05 AM: The Museum Director, I know this because he presses his business card against the glass, is there along with more security guards and what looks like a fireman. At this point, Bill reappears. He gets down on his knees and sits at my eye level: We’re going to break the glass, he flips over his piece of paper with a second message: Cover — your — eyes — with — your — coat. “WHAT!” I say as he motions to the fireman who, only now do I see, is holding an axe. A giant axe. Meanwhile, behind me, two (very large) Cafeteria Staff have been pushing against the frame with their shoulders and — both slowly and suddenly — the hydraulics (extremely asthmatic hydraulics) sigh. And something clicks. The glass moves. 11:06 AM: A few of the people watching jump in to help the Facilities Man/the Facilities Woman/Bill/Bill’s Friend/the Suited Man/the axe-wilding Fireman and the Museum Director pull the door from the other side. Wide enough gap. Laptop through first. Then a knee, then a shoulder, then a head. A cheer from the crowd. The air is cold. And the sun not so hot. But my coat is still trapped. Shrugged down in a corner, abandoned like shed skin. 11:10 AM: Sitting on the pavement, Museum Director is asking “how” I would “rate” the museum’s response to the situation. On a scale of 1–10. Are there improvements the museum could make in the future? Are there adjustments they could make in the coming days? “I felt like a panda,” was all I could say.

Living In Fear Of My Bank Account,"Arguably the first step to financial solvency has to be basic awareness of where you stand with your money. This is the step that I struggle with the most. You might think that the simple act of checking your bank account to look at your recent transactions would be easy, but for me it isn’t. The thought of checking my bank account, regardless of whether I’m in a positive or negative financial state, makes me break into a sweat. I have anxiety, and my anxiety makes me avoidant. I have a tendency to stick my head in the sand and pretend that my bank account isn’t even there. And of course, like any adult task I avoid or put off, the longer I go without checking it the more daunting it becomes. In my last relationship, my ex-boyfriend and I were both generally terrible about checking our finances. This was the relationship that I was in for the bulk of my twenties, when financial habits are usually formed. We had a semi-monthly ritual in which we totaled up and divided what each person had spent on our living expenses as a couple so that we could see what we might owe to one another, and it was always hellish. I say ‘semi-monthly’ because we could never bring ourselves to actually look at our bank accounts once a month, which meant that we’d be peering backwards at purchases made three months ago, trying to remember if it was an individual expense or if it should be shared. This was a deeply clumsy way to address our split costs, and knowing that the process would be painful always made us put it off more. Usually after a totaling session we would find out that I owed my ex-boyfriend money, and I was never good at budgeting for that expense in advance. It was a heavy strain on our relationship. Our mutual reluctance to so much as glance at our bank accounts on a regular basis meant that we were guaranteed a nasty surprise any time we managed to muster the courage to look. That’s the thing about going too long without checking your bank account: it becomes a terrible experience when you finally look. Every time I check my bank account, I sit in harsh judgment of myself. Each purchase seems totally unjustifiable, whether it was for groceries, gas or an impulse buy of something frivolous. I berate myself about each line item and the hideous total of spending. Since I’ve gone so long without looking at the account, all the purchases have piled up and the numbers are so huge as to be practically meaningless. I know that this is what’s waiting for me the second I navigate to my bank’s home page, so I simply don’t look. I put it off and I put it off and I miss credit card payments because I’ve put it off; every time it occurs to me that I should really check it, I shut out the thought, singing la-la-la to myself until the worry goes back into the back of my brain with all the other things I’m avoiding. I live crouched under a boulder of responsibilities that I’m putting off and avoiding, bills I haven’t paid because thinking about money reminds me that I need to check my bank account, overdraft fees that could easily have been avoided if I’d checked my account before making a purchase. I am hard on myself about my inability to look at my finances. Sometimes I feel like I’m always on the run with the specter of my bank account one step behind me, a disembodied voice yelling at me to check it and verbally beating me up when I continue not to. I’ve tried scheduling my banking. It doesn’t work — I just skip my scheduled date. For a while I had text banking on my phone, enabling me to send a quick text message asking for a balance summary whenever it occurred to me, and that worked surprisingly well. I guess it’s less intimidating to the anxiety centers of my brain to look at a text instead of a web page. But when I switched phones, I lost the text banking ability, and I have yet to set it up on my new phone because setting it up would require visiting my bank account. I keep meaning to but, like most things in my life, I haven’t gotten around to it yet. Since I’m no longer in the relationship that resulted in me constantly owing money and since I’m no longer living paycheck-to-paycheck, there is no longer any substantial reason for me to fear checking my bank account. I know this, and yet I still like to pretend that it’s not there. I have to get off my ass and get text banking back on my phone. I have to take a deep breath and log on to my bank despite the fact that it makes my teeth chatter with fear. In fact, I’ll check it later today. No, really, why don’t you believe me?

How to Transform Depression and Anxiety to Happiness,"Feeling depressed about your future? Is anxiety keeping you from enjoying your life? Strong negative emotions can smother the joy and happiness that’s always inside you. While neither of these feelings can be turned off like a light switch, there is a practice that can change your life in dramatic and positive ways over time. It’s mindfulness. [If your feelings of depression or anxiety are more serious, you might benefit from working with a professional who utilizes Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) or Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Both are clinically proven to help those with more severe depression and anxiety.] How can mindfulness turn your world around? Let’s look at its definition: Mindfulness is a way of paying attention to and seeing clearly whatever is happening in our lives. It will not eliminate life’s pressures, but it can help us respond to them in a calmer manner that benefits our heart, head, and body. It helps us recognize and step away from habitual, often unconscious, emotional and physiological reactions to everyday events. It provides us with a scientifically researched approach to cultivating clarity, insight, and understanding. Practicing mindfulness allows us to be fully present in our life and work and improve our quality of life. ~ Mindfulnet.org In a nutshell, mindfulness is noticing without judging. In order to notice, you need to pause all the racing thoughts that seem to constantly dance around in your head. It only takes a moment. A breath. Pausing allows you to be present to whatever is actually happening. It helps you to see the difference between what’s actually happening and the stories you’re creating about what’s happening. Pause to notice: The most important aspect of mindfulness is to do all this without judging. This means that everything simply is. There’s no right or wrong, good or bad, stupid or smart, enough or inadequate, ugly or beautiful. All of that, all the judging, is the story you’re telling yourself. It’s how you’re deciding things are. If these stories help you to feel better, then feel free to continue with them. If the stories make you feel depressed, anxious or any other emotion that you don’t want, consider this pause your opportunity to make up a new story. Many years ago I lived with depression. I grew up in a family where it wasn’t safe to be myself or express my emotions. I learned to stuff my emotions down and eventually forgot how to feel them. I thought that, in so many ways, I wasn’t enough. Regardless of what I achieved, I was never enough. It took years of therapy, personal development and wanting to change in order to live life the way I do today. To change something, you have to be aware of the thing you want to change. Along my journey, the biggest lesson I learned is this: Nothing in your life changes until you change. Let me repeat that. Nothing in your life changes until you change. Of course, I’m human so it took me a while to figure it out. At first I did what I learned from my parents: I blamed all my problems on the people closest to me and wondered why my relationships were a disaster. If only those people would meet my expectations of them, my life would be so much better. I think we all know how well that works. Not! The first time my biggest lesson became evident was when my second marriage hit its first wall. My husband and I were both control freaks, trying to get the other person to be the person we wanted and act like we wanted them to. And we were driving each other crazy. I started working with a therapist and told my husband that I was putting our relationship on hold while I worked on me. While that may sound a bit selfish, it’s the farthest thing from it. It was the best thing I could have done for our relationship. It seemed almost miraculous that the more I changed, the more my husband seemed to magically change into the person I wanted him to be. We didn’t talk much during that period and I certainly didn’t share anything I discussed with my therapist. By deliberately pausing all the drama that had become part of our daily life, I paused enough to begin to see my patterns. I began to see how my thoughts and actions were contributing to all my problems. At first, although I could see my patterns, I had no idea how to act differently. I started to catch myself saying the things that had led to drama. Then I learned to pause before the same old things came out of my mouth. By allowing that fraction of a moment before responding, I often chose no response. I chose to be silent and listen to my husband. With time, practice and lots of experimentation, I started to put the pieces together to understand the kind of person I wanted to be. Then I took more time to understand how to think, believe and act in ways that led to a happier me. Every now and then I feel a little anxious or depressed. When I don’t catch it right away, I notice that I try to smother the feelings in a little too much work or a bit too much wine. (Other people choose shopping, eating, drugs or excessively working out.) As I do these things, I’m now aware of what I’m doing. I’m avoiding facing difficult emotions. I’m trying not to feel my feelings. Knowing how destructive these choices can be and that they never solve the problem, I’ve learned to make new choices. Click here to download the checklist I use to transform my depression and anxiety to happiness. When I’m anxious, I stop and take a few deep breaths. I realize that I’m creating my anxiety by envisioning a negative future that has little chance of becoming real. I slowly and gently say to myself, “Be here now.” I know that everything is just fine here in the present moment. Then I smile. When I’m feeling depressed, I stop and take a few deep breaths. I ask my True Self what’s causing my feelings of depression. Then I pause to listen and feel what comes up in my mind and body. Sometimes I’m feeling lonely, and I feel that in my heart. Other times I’m feeling angry and resentful, and I feel that in my chest. I ask my True Self what I can do to feed and nurture my unmet needs. I no longer hope or expect anyone else to do that for me because it’s impossible. If I don’t give myself what I need first, no one else can do it for me. If I’m feeling lonely, I remind myself that I am loved, from my own heart and from my family. If I’m feeling angry or resentful, I notice that I’ve been doing too much for others and not doing enough for myself. I haven’t been taking the time to do things that feed my soul. Then I make it a priority to bring those soul-filling things back into my life. When I do, the negative feelings dissolve. Our thoughts, and the feelings those thoughts produce, create our realities. If most of our thoughts and feelings are negative, then much of life is as well. Our thoughts cause us deep suffering through emotional or physical pain, loss and impermanence, and ego attachments. However, this suffering is unnecessary. Why? Because most of our thoughts simply aren’t real or true. They feel real because of the way we attach and react to them. Fortunately, we have the power to change our perceptions and end much of the suffering in our lives through the practice of mindfulness. ~ Peace of Mindfulness by Barrie Davenport The next time you’re feeling depressed, anxious or any other unwanted emotion, be gentle with yourself as you walk through these steps: Click here to download the checklist I use to transform my depression and anxiety to happiness.

How I Learned to Fall Asleep in Under 1 Minute,"After day three of lying awake until the wee hours of the night, I sheepishly admitted to her that I was too nervous to fall asleep, and she — the bride, who was sleeping like a baby the week before her own wedding — told me I needed to try the “4–7–8” breathing trick. She happens to be a licensed wellness practitioner who studies meditation, stress, and breathing techniques, and told me it would change my life. You simply breathe in through your nose for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and exhale through your mouth for eight seconds. She explained that the studied combination of numbers has a chemical-like effect on our brains, and would slow my heart rate and soothe me right to sleep that night. “It works,” she told me. “It’s crazy.” I couldn’t wait to put the trick to the test, and to my complete disbelief, I woke up the next morning unable to even remember getting to the eighth second of the exhale because it knocked me out that fast. For the next four nights leading up to the big day, even as my stress increased, I was able to fall asleep the minute I tried the 4–7–8 trick. I also used it to relax in the moments leading up to the speech. When you feel stressed or anxious, adrenaline courses through your veins, your heart beats at a rapid rate, and your breathing becomes quick and shallow. So before I get into the specifics behind how the 4–7–8 breathing trick works, I wanted to explain in my own words what it feels like when you try it. To me, the effect of the breathing technique feels almost like a sedative drug, because in order to hold your breath for seven seconds and then to exhale for eight — when your breath is so shallow and short — your body is forced to slow your heart rate. It has no choice. Holding your breath, and then slowly, deliberately exhaling for eight seconds, causes a chain reaction. It feels like going from a mad-dash sprint to a finish line to a slow, leisurely, calming stroll through the park. When you first start, you’ll be desperate to just take in another breath, or you’ll want to speed up your counting, but if you stick to the numbers (or at least try to), and don’t take any breaks (in other words, consecutively repeat the 4–7–8 without resuming regular breathing), you can literally feel your heart rate slow down, your mind get quieter, and your whole body physically relax. It washes over you like a calming, relaxing drug. I can never remember getting past the first set of 4–7–8. Do you know the feeling of being put under by anesthesia, where you are conscious, and the next thing you remember is waking up? That’s what this is like for me: As soon as I start the practice, the next thing I remember, I’m waking up in the morning and can’t even remember beginning the 4–7–8 count the night before. Crazy. Now to the more technical details: People who are stressed or anxious are actually chronically under-breathing, because stressed people breathe shortly and shallowly, and often even unconsciously hold their breath. By extending your inhale to a count of four, you are forcing yourself to take in more oxygen, allowing the oxygen to affect your bloodstream by holding your breath for seven seconds, and then emitting carbon dioxide from your lungs by exhaling steadily for eight seconds. The technique will effectively slow your heart rate and increase oxygen in your bloodstream, and may even make you feel slightly lightheaded which contributes to the mild sedative-like effect. It will instantly relax your heart, mind, and overall central nervous system because you are controlling the breath versus continuing to breathe short, shallow gasps of air.

Ban Sundays,"As a kid, Sunday meant church — Catholic Mass, usually the 9am service at the modern chapel attached to the K-8 grammar school I soldiered through for half a decade. In smothering heat and piercing cold, our family of six shoehorned into a minivan smelling of Lifesaver mints and drove 15 minutes down Route 24 to be saved. A seventh of my life spent breathing stifled ecclesiastics and shaking hands with strangers, and by 15 it meant nothing to me. I don’t think the Church made me hate Sundays, but it certainly didn’t help. This is not a story about religious disillusionment any more than all stories are about religious disillusionment, at least a little bit. No matter at which altar you worship — kale, Oxycontin, Nike — Sunday is the end of the weekend, a moment awash in the biblical vocabulary of Eden & purgatory, sin & redemption, heaven & hell. Can you believe in the devil, but not a god? On a Sunday afternoon in the dead of February, when the sun hangs weak and yellow in the steel-grey sky, I can. Over at Gawker, Dayna Evans bravely examined her own battle against the seasonal depression that swaddles her each winter in a grim blanket. I wish more people could speak so frankly about seasonal depression. I didn’t bring Evans’ article up just to dismiss it (you should read it), but I’m not talking about seasonal depression. Winter isn’t the reason I hate Sundays, but like Catholicism, it certainly doesn’t help either. Monday’s misery is easy. It’s emails that don’t stop, treadmills that won’t start, commutes that never end. I can comprehend Mondays, and I can beat them. But I don’t understand Sunday’s anguish. How can I defeat something I don’t understand? So no matter how many Mondays I meet head-on, six days later I’ll slide headfirst into the hazy slough of Sunday despond. I’ll skate through apprehensively, wondering how I got there, and what “there” even is. It could be thebooze, or the exhaustion, or the creeping awareness that my twenties are on the wane. It could be all of those things, or none of them. I know what “there” looks like. It’s a boyfriend & girlfriend in sweatpants eating pad Thai & watch Netflix behind closed doors. They’re happy with each other but unhappy with themselves. That’s Sunday: an imprecise malaise borne of the quivering uncertainty that walks hand in hand with every hangover you’ve ever had. Sunday is uncertain. There’s something just over the horizon, hidden equally by the curvature of the earth and the plodding second hand on your watch. At this cusp, vacuous musings gather speed and become vast existential crises, then fracture back to mundane slivers just as quickly. Did I turn lock the door? Am I living the life I’m meant to? I hope it doesn’t rain tomorrow. No one engages in introspection this unhinged at the beginning of something. Sunday is the hospital bed we lay in each week, reflecting on a life lived in six days while preparing to do it all over again. After living through 26 years of this dull, recoverable weekly anguish, I have an idea. Ban Sundays. Rewrite the calendars. Let one week ooze into another without crossing the bleak no-man’s-land that currently separates Saturday & Monday. It’s a radical proposal, I know. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and there’s no more punctual desperation than the one that’s delivered to my doorstep each week like a Sunday paper. Desperate times call for Lifesaver mints and shaking hands with strangers. Desperate times call for a religion, even if it’s just there to become disillusioned with once Monday morning arrives.
