Twenty-year follow-up of adults traumatized during childhood in Armenia,"Background: Most children who experience trauma recover and display resilience; however, there are few long-term follow-up studies of traumatized children and fewer still have examined factors that may lead to resilience. This study is a 20-year follow-up of adults who experienced an earthquake as children. Methods: Nineteen of 25 adults who experienced the earthquake in Armenia in 1988 and participated in the initial study approximately two years later (Time 1) were reinterviewed in 2008 (Time 2). Forty-four Armenian adults aged 22–37 who had not experienced the earthquake comprised the comparison group. All participants at Time 2 were administered the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90-R) and the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index (RI) and also received a clinical interview. Results: The earthquake group had clinically elevated SCL-90-R GSI, PSDI, PST and subscale scores for all but one subscale and had significantly more subscale clinical elevations than the comparison group. All earthquake survivors at Time 2 scored from 1 to 46 on the RI with 4 having probable PTSD. No comparison subjects had experienced an A1 trauma. Limitations: The small number of subjects in this follow-up, our inability to follow the comparison group in the original study and the measures used at the two time points limits the applicability of the results. Conclusions: Most of the earthquake survivors experienced anxiety disorders at follow-up but not high levels of PTSD or depression. Clinical interviews identified resilient factors that may have helped these subjects maintain functional and adaptive capacities despite clinical elevations on the SCL-90.

Subjective recognition of adverse events with antidepressant in people with depression: A prospective study,"Background: While it has been reported that physicians may under-recognize adverse effects of antidepressants thoroughly in clinical settings, subjective bias in recognition of adverse effects (AEs) with antidepressants has not been specifically investigated. Methods: Four-hundred ninety-three participants with depressive disorders (ICD-10) were assessed for the severity of 20 common AEs and their inferred causal relationship with antidepressants, together with the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptoms (QIDS). These assessments occurred twice at the 1st visit (when they were antidepressant free) and 2nd visit (10days after the initiation of antidepressants). ‘Possible AEs’ and ‘under-recognized AEs’ were defined as ‘events with exacerbation in the severity’ and ‘events with negative causal attribution to antidepressants’ at the time of the 2nd visit, respectively. Results: Three-hundred sixty-three participants (73.6%) experienced ≥1 under-recognized AEs. Flu like symptoms (96.5% of participants who experienced possible AEs), sexual dysfunction (94.2%), blurred vision (93.4%), anxiety/tension (91.1%) and sweating (89.2%) were found to be prevalent as under-recognized AEs. Participants with under-recognized AEs had less improvement in the QIDS than those without (27.1% vs. 11.1% decrease, p &lt; 0.001). Limitations: It is intrinsically challenging to exactly differentiate between antidepressant AEs and symptoms of depression. And the severity of depression, that of AEs and causal relationship between AEs and antidepressants were assessed not by objective but subjective scales. Conclusions: An overall trend to under-recognize AEs of antidepressants was found and people with a lesser degree of early improvement tend to understate the causality, which has an implication in interpreting voluntarily expression of AEs.

Correlations between brain-derived neurotrophic factor and clinical symptoms in medicated patients with major depression,"Background: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the nerve growth factor family and plays a critical role in growth, differentiation, maintenance and synaptic plasticity of neuronal systems. Previous studies have demonstrated lower serum BDNF concentrations in major depressive disorder (MDD), with concentrations negatively correlating with the severity of the disease. However, few investigations have examined the relationship between serum BDNF and detailed clinical symptoms. The aim of present study was to clarify the magnitudes of the relationships between various depressive symptom and serum BDNF. Methods: Serum BDNF concentrations were evaluated from 109 inpatients with MDD and 163 healthy controls. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D), and symptoms were categorized into four groups: “anxiety somatization”; “cognitive disturbance”; “retardation”; and “sleep disturbance”. Results: Serum BDNF concentration was significantly lower in patients with MDD compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001). We identified significant negative correlations between serum BDNF concentration and both total score (R = − 0.19, p = 0.044) and “anxiety somatization” sub-score (R = − 0.32, p = 0.001) from the HAM-D in patients with MDD. Limitations: All patients in the present study were on antidepressant medications. Conclusions: These results suggest that serum BDNF level may offer a biological marker for anxiety symptoms in medicated patients with MDD.

Symptomatic subsyndromal depression in hospitalized hypertensive patients,"Background: Clinicians generally agree on the association between depression and hypertension. Less clear is if the nature of the link is direct or indirect and if this should be considered confined only to syndromal forms or if it concerns also subsyndromal affective presentations. This study investigated the nature of the association between hypertension and subsyndromal depression in hospitalized hypertensive patients. Methods: 196 hypertensive and 96 non hypertensive inpatients underwent a SCID interview, to exclude patients positive for any Axis I or Axis II diagnosis. Symptomatic Subsyndromal Depression (SSD) was identified according to criteria proposed by Judd. Psychopathological assessment was performed with Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) and Hopkins Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90). Clinical assessments included blood pressure measurement, evaluation of general health conditions and screening cardiovascular risk factors (smoke, alcohol, body weight, sedentary life style). Results: Hypertensives met more frequently criteria for SSD. They also scored higher on ASI and SCL-90. However, those with more severe physical conditions, if compared with more healthy patients, did not show increased psychopathological severity. Similarly, psychopathological symptom severity did not differ among hypertensives positive for other cardiovascular risk factors, commonly more frequent among depressed subjects. Limitations: Further analyses are needed to explore the potential advantage obtained on blood pressure control by treating SSD. Conclusions: Hospitalized hypertensives, more frequently satisfied criteria for Symptomatic Subsyndromal Depression. These milder affective forms are probably directly linked to the presence of hypertension, rather than being indirectly associated to physical impairment or to higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors.

Electroretinographic assessment in major depressed patients receiving duloxetine: Might differences between responders and non-responders indicate a differential biological background?,"Introduction: Despite intense research efforts, still too little is known about the biological determinants of depression, thus soliciting diverse study approaches. Among others, the electroretinography (ERG) has been proposed even as a putative proxy (retinal) measurement of central dopaminergic activity for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) both in drug-naïve patients and subjects receiving antidepressant treatments. Nonetheless, current evidences are merely preliminary, essentially considering just older classes of antidepressants, thus requiring confirmation studies even with newer agents as duloxetine. Method: Twenty MDD subjects and 20 matched controls received duloxetine 60 mg/day for 12weeks, being monitored both by standard ERG recording and by administration of the Hamilton scales for Depression and Anxiety and the Young Mania Rating Scale at baseline and week 12 (end of the study). Results: ERG mean rod b-wave amplitude significantly reduced from baseline to week 12 in those depressed subjects achieving final response ( p = .024), decreasing from the highest rank values to the ones, substantially unmodified, seen among non-responders and controls. Limitations: Small sample size and lack of multiple assessments. Conclusions: At least some MDD patients responding to duloxetine might exhibit a peculiar ERG pattern, hypothetically indicating a specific biological background. If confirmed by larger-sampled studies, these results might shed further light in the understanding of the biological determinants of different subtypes of depression, ideally showing alternative patters of response upon different treatment interventions.

A comorbid anxiety disorder does not result in an excess risk of death among patients with a depressive disorder,"Background: Several studies have demonstrated increased mortality associated with depression and with anxiety. Mortality due to comorbidity of two mental disorders may be even more increased. Therefore, we investigated the mortality among patients with depression, with anxiety and with both diagnoses. Methods: By linking the longitudinal Psychiatric Case Register Middle-Netherlands, which contains all patients of psychiatric services in the Utrecht region, to the death register of Statistics Netherlands, hazard ratio's of death were estimated overall and for different categories of death causes separately. Results: We found an increased risk of death among patients with an anxiety disorder (N = 6919): HR = 1.45 (95%CI: 1.25–1.69), and among patients with a depression (N = 14,778): HR = 1.83, (95%CI: 1.72–1.95), compared to controls (N = 103,824). The hazard ratios among both disorders combined (N = 4260) were similar to those with only a depression: HR = 1.91, (95% CI: 1.64–2.23). Among patients with a depression, mortality across all important disease-related categories of death causes (neoplasms, cardiovascular, respiratory, and other diseases) and due to suicide was increased, without an excess mortality in case of comorbid anxiety. Limitations: The presented data are restricted to broad categories of patients in specialist services. No data on behavioral or intermediate factors were available. Conclusions: Although anxiety is associated with an increased risk of death, the presence of anxiety as comorbid disorder does not give an additional increase in the risk of death among patients with a depressive disorder. The increased mortality among patients with depression is not restricted to suicide and cardiovascular diseases, but associated with a broad range of death causes.

Prevalence and correlates of major depressive episode in pregnant and postpartum women in the United States,"Background: Little is known about the prevalence and comorbidity of Major Depressive Episode (MDE) during pregnancy in the general population. This study presents nationally representative data on the prevalence, correlates, and psychiatric comorbidities of depression in women during pregnancy and postpartum in the United States. Method: Data were drawn from the 2001–2002 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). The NESARC is a survey of 43,093 adults aged 18 years and older residing in households in the United States of whom 14,549 were women 18 to 50 years old with known past-year pregnancy status. Diagnoses of depression and other mood, anxiety, and drug disorders were based on the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule—DSM-IV version. Results: The overall prevalence of MDE during pregnancy was 12.4%. Among pregnant and postpartum women, depression was associated with younger age, ethnicity other than Latino, being widowed, divorced, separated or never married, traumatic events within the past 12 months and pregnancy complication. Strong associations were found between MDE during pregnancy and postpartum and nearly all 12-month psychiatric disorders. Past-year depressed pregnant and postpartum women were more likely than nondepressed pregnant women to use substances (including alcohol, illicit drugs and cigarettes). Past-year pregnant and postpartum women were significantly less likely to receive past-year treatment for depression than nonpregnant women although not after adjusting for background sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusions: These results indicate that depression during pregnancy and postpartum is associated with a large range of psychiatric disorders. The high frequency of psychiatric comorbidities, the elevated use of any substances and the high rate of unmet needs should be kept in mind when considering the management of depression during pregnancy and postpartum.

Use of auxiliary psychiatric treatment during a 5-year follow-up among patients receiving short- or long-term psychotherapy,"Background: The need for treatment is, despite of its obvious usefulness, a scarcely used measure of effectiveness in psychotherapy trials. This study considers changes in the need for auxiliary psychiatric treatment after starting short- and long-term psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. Methods: Altogether 326 psychiatric outpatients with mood or anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to solution-focused therapy (SFT), short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (SPP), or long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (LPP) while 41 self-selected patients were allocated to psychoanalysis (PA). The patients were followed for 5 years from start of treatment. Outcome measures were use of auxiliary psychotherapy, psychotropic medication, and hospitalization for mental reasons. Results: About 60% of the patients used auxiliary treatment during the follow-up. It was most common in the short-term therapy groups and its incidence was highest during the first year after the start of therapy. The average numbers of all therapy sessions among patients starting the therapy were 60, 70, 240, and 670 in SFT, SPP, LPP, and PA, respectively, whereas the corresponding average numbers of study therapy sessions alone were 10, 19, 232, and 646. Over 50% of the patients receiving short-term therapy received on average 4–6 times more therapy sessions than initially assigned. Limitations: Post-randomization withdrawal was uneven. Conclusions: Auxiliary treatment is usual among patients receiving short- and long-term therapies, and apparently becomes common shortly after the start of treatment. Auxiliary treatment can be used as an outcome measure indicating the need for treatment, should be monitored clinically and considered when interpreting the results of effectiveness studies.

Flourishing or floundering? Prevalence and correlates of anxiety and depression among a population-based sample of adult cancer survivors 6 months after diagnosis,"Objective: To describe the prevalence of anxiety, depression and comorbid anxiety–depression among adult cancer survivors six months following diagnosis, and identify the individual, disease, health behaviour, psychological and social factors associated with psychological morbidity. Methods: A population-based sample of adult cancer survivors was recruited from two state-based cancer registries in Australia. Data for 1323 survivors were obtained by self-report questionnaire and linkage with registry data. Anxiety and depression were assessed by the 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: The prevalence of psychological morbidity was 28% (95% CI: 23%–33%). Specifically, 24% (95% CI: 19%–29%) of survivors were identified as cases on anxiety (irrespective of depression), 14% (95% CI: 9%–19%) as cases on depression (irrespective of anxiety) and 10% (95% CI: 5%–15%) as cases on comorbid anxiety–depression. In addition to mental health history prior to cancer, modifiable health behaviours (physical activity, smoking status), psychological (helplessness–hopelessness, anxious preoccupation coping) and social (low positive social interaction) characteristics were stronger indicators of psychological morbidity than survivors' individual or disease characteristics. Limitations: Psychological morbidity was assessed by self-report screening instrument rather than clinical interview. The extent to which psychological morbidity is age-related versus cancer-related cannot be determined without a gender- and age-matched control group. Conclusion: Although lower than previously reported, psychological morbidity is prevalent six months after a cancer diagnosis and emphasises the need for routine psychosocial assessment throughout the cancer trajectory to identify those at increased risk or in need of immediate intervention. Physical activity, smoking cessation and coping skills training interventions warrant further exploration.

Anxiety symptom presentations in Han Chinese and Euro-Canadian outpatients: Is distress always somatized in China?,"Background: Cultural variations in the relative emphasis on somatic versus psychological symptoms of distress are a common topic in cultural psychopathology. The most well-known example involves people of Chinese heritage, who are found to emphasize somatic symptoms in presenting depression as compared with people of Western European heritage. It remains unknown whether a similar cultural difference is found for anxiety disorders. Methods: Euro-Canadian ( n =79) and Han Chinese ( n =154) psychiatric outpatients with clinically significant concerns about both depression and anxiety were selected from a larger data set based on their responses to a structured interview. They also completed two self-report questionnaires assessing somatization of depression and anxiety. Results: As expected, Chinese participants reported a greater tendency to emphasize somatic symptoms of depression, as compared to the Euro-Canadians. Contrary to expectations, the tendency to emphasize somatic symptoms of anxiety was higher among the Euro-Canadians as compared to the Chinese participants. Limitations: Characteristics of our participants limit the generalizability of our findings. The current study is preliminary and requires replication. Conclusions: Despite the exploratory nature of this study, the results suggest that the popular notion of ‘Chinese somatization’ should not be over-generalized. Our findings also imply that there may be important differences in the cultural understanding of depression and anxiety in both Chinese and ‘Western’ contexts. Future studies should seek to unpack potential cultural explanations for why Euro-Canadian outpatients may emphasize somatic symptoms in the presentation of anxiety to a greater degree than Chinese outpatients.

Psychosocial risk factors for postpartum depression and their relation to timing of onset: The Hamamatsu Birth Cohort (HBC) Study,"Background: The time frame for postpartum depression (PPD) defined in the literature differs among studies — either 4 weeks or 3 months after childbirth. To address potential difference in PPD in relation to onset of the illness, we investigated risk factors for early- and late-onset PPD using a representative birth cohort in Japan. Methods: We evaluated 675 women who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for two to three times within 3months after childbirth. Mothers with an onset of PPD (≥9 points on EPDS) within 4weeks after childbirth were classified as having early-onset PPD, and those with PPD that occurred during the period of the 5th to 12th week after childbirth were classified as having late-onset PPD. We adopted multinomial logistic regression to investigate risk factors associated with each of early- and late-onset PPD, whilst simultaneously allowing for all risk factors a priori selected in the model. Results: The period prevalence of early- and late-onset PPD was 11% and 4%, respectively. Primiparity was associated only with early-onset PPD (OR = 2 .6, 95% CI 1.5–4.4). Younger (&lt;25 years: OR = 3.6, 95% CI 1.2–11.2) and advanced age (≥35 years: OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.1–5.8) of the participating women was significantly associated only with late-onset PPD. Lack of emotional support and a history of depression/anxiety appeared to increase risk both for early- and late-onset PPD. Limitations: Moderate sample size and diagnosis of PPD without use of structured interviews may limit generalisability of the findings. Conclusion: The finding that risk sets for early- and late-onset PPD differ suggests that these two types may have different aetiology.

A comparison of the clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with recurrent major depressive disorder with and without dysthymia,"Background: The relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD) and dysthymia, a form of chronic depression, is complex. The two conditions are highly comorbid and it is unclear whether they are two separate disease entities. We investigated the extent to which patients with dysthymia superimposed on major depression can be distinguished from those with recurrent MDD. Methods: We examined the clinical features in 1970 Han Chinese women with MDD (DSM-IV) between 30 and 60 years of age across China. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between clinical features of MDD and dysthymia and between dysthymia and disorders comorbid with major depression. Results: The 354 cases with dysthymia had more severe MDD than those without, with more episodes of MDD and greater co-morbidity for anxiety disorders. Patients with dysthymia had higher neuroticism scores and were more likely to have a family history of MDD. They were also more likely to have suffered serious life events. Limitations: Results were obtained in a clinically ascertained sample of Chinese women and may not generalize to community-acquired samples or to other populations. It is not possible to determine whether the associations represent causal relationships. Conclusions: The additional diagnosis of dysthymia in Chinese women with recurrent MDD defines a meaningful and potentially important subtype. We conclude that in some circumstances it is possible to distinguish double depression from recurrent MDD.

"The relationship between neuroticism, major depressive disorder and comorbid disorders in Chinese women","Objective: The personality trait of neuroticism is a risk factor for major depressive disorder (MDD), but this relationship has not been demonstrated in clinical samples from Asia. Methods: We examined a large-scale clinical study of Chinese Han women with recurrent major depression and community-acquired controls. Results: Elevated levels of neuroticism increased the risk for lifetime MDD (with an odds ratio of 1.37 per SD), contributed to the comorbidity of MDD with anxiety disorders, and predicted the onset and severity of MDD. Our findings largely replicate those obtained in clinical populations in Europe and US but differ in two ways: we did not find a relationship between melancholia and neuroticism; we found lower mean scores for neuroticism (3.6 in our community control sample). Limitations: Our findings do not apply to MDD in community-acquired samples and may be limited to Han Chinese women. It is not possible to determine whether the association between neuroticism and MDD reflects a causal relationship. Conclusions: Neuroticism acts as a risk factor for MDD in Chinese women, as it does in the West and may particularly predispose to comorbidity with anxiety disorders. Cultural factors may have an important effect on its measurement.

Age at onset of major depressive disorder in Han Chinese women: Relationship with clinical features and family history,"Background: Individuals with early-onset depression may be a clinically distinct group with particular symptom patterns, illness course, comorbidity and family history. This question has not been previously investigated in a Han Chinese population. Methods: We examined the clinical features of 1970 Han Chinese women with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) between 30 and 60 years of age across China. Analysis of linear, logistic and multiple logistic regression models was used to determine the association between age at onset (AAO) with continuous, binary and discrete characteristic clinical features of MDD. Results: Earlier AAO was associated with more suicidal ideation and attempts and higher neuroticism, but fewer sleep, appetite and weight changes. Patients with an earlier AAO were more likely to suffer a chronic course (longer illness duration, more MDD episodes and longer index episode), increased rates of MDD in their parents and a lower likelihood of marriage. They tend to have higher comorbidity with anxiety disorders (general anxiety disorder, social phobia and agoraphobia) and dysthymia. Conclusions: Early AAO in MDD may be an index of a more severe, highly comorbid and familial disorder. Our findings indicate that the features of MDD in China are similar to those reported elsewhere in the world.

Validation of the Brazilian brief version of the temperament auto-questionnaire TEMPS-A: The brief TEMPS-Rio de Janeiro,"Background: Over the last thirty years, Akiskal and collaborators have described and developed operationalized diagnostic criteria for five types of affective temperaments - cyclothymic, irritable, hyperthymic, depressive, and anxious. A 110-item, yes-or-no questionnaire, the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego (TEMPS-A), was specifically developed for measuring temperamental variation. The TEMPS-A was translated into more than 25 languages and cross-culturally valid versions are now available in Italian, French, German, Japanese, Turkish, Arabic, Polish, Hungarian, Spanish and Portuguese. Recent studies in the US and in Europe, however, have suggested that shorter versions of TEMPS-A can be just as efficient as the full ones while potentially enhancing the compliance of respondents. The main objective of the present study was to validate a brief Brazilian Portuguese version of TEMPS-A (brief TEMPS-Rio de Janeiro). Methods: Our main sample consisted of 997 undergraduate students (female=72.6%) from seven different universities located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. An additional group of 167 healthy senior citizens (women=83.8%) was recruited in senior community centers in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. All participants were asked to complete the 110-item, Brazilian translation of the full version of the TEMPS-A. Results: An exploratory factor analysis (PCA type 2, Varimax rotation) vying for a five-factor solution yielded mixed results, with cyclothymic traits, physical symptoms of anxiety and preoccupation with the well-being of a family member loading together on the first factor. When a forced six-factor solution was attempted, cyclothymic, irritable, hyperthymic, and depressive were delineated as predicted by the theory. The original generalized anxious temperament was split into two sharply delimited components, a ""worrying"" subscale and an abbreviated anxious subscale, which included physical symptoms of anxiety and concerns with the well-being of relatives. Based on the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, we proposed that the abridged anxious subscale, which includes physical symptoms of anxiety, represents the ""true"" generalized anxious temperament, while the ""worrying"" subscale corresponds to the ""general distress factor"". The internal consistency of the six subscales thus identified was generally good, ranging from 0.67 (anxious subscale) to 0.81 (worrying subscale), with cyclothymic, irritable, depressive, and hyperthymic subscales exhibiting intermediate values (0.74, 0.74, 0.72, and 0.7, respectively). Limitations: The present study was based on a non-clinical sample that does not reflect accurately the characteristics of the Brazilian population. The relative uniformity of the sample in terms of age and education precluded a more in-depth analysis of the influence of these highly relevant factors. Further, we did not assess convergent, divergent or test-retest validity. Conclusions: We believe that the brief Brazilian version of the TEMPS-A auto-questionnaire will provide Brazilian researchers and clinicians with a psychometrically sound instrument and thus contribute toward the creation of a worldwide research network dedicated to the investigation of affective temperaments.

Impact of stressful life events on the course of panic disorder in adults,"Background: Panic disorder with/without agoraphobia (PD/PDA) is a prevalent anxiety disorder, associated with impairment in quality of life and functionality, as well as increased healthcare utilization. Extant research shows a relationship between stressful life events (SLEs) and the onset of panic attacks in adults who ultimately develop PD/PDA. However, limited attention has been paid to how SLEs might affect the severity of panic symptoms in individuals with PD/PDA. In this study, we examined the relationship between SLEs and panic symptom severity in adults with PD/PDA. Methods: Four hundred-eighteen adults with PD/PDA from the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Program (HARP), a long-term prospective longitudinal observational multicenter study of adults with a current or past history of anxiety disorders were included in this study. We examined occurrence of SLEs and their impact on panic symptom severity 12-weeks pre- and post-SLE. Results: A time-slope effect showed that participants had worsened panic symptoms over the course of the 12-weeks after family/friends/household and work SLEs. That is, their symptoms worsened progressively after the event, rather than immediately thereafter (i.e., significant symptom change within the same week of the event). Limitations: The sample may not be representative of the general population. Conclusions: These findings provide new insights into how SLEs affect panic symptoms in adults with PD/PDA in that household-related SLEs, such as serious family arguments, and work-related SLEs, such as being fired, put some adults at risk for worsened panic symptoms within 12-weeks of the event.

Prevalence and risk factors for recurrence of depression five years after short term psychodynamic therapy,"Background: Follow-up research concerning the efficacy of treatment for depression is scarce and varies widely in clinical and methodological terms. Aim was to conduct a five-year followup study of recurrence of depression after short supportive Psychodynamic Treatment (PDT) alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Methods: Patients who had been treated five years previously for major depressive disorder in a randomised control trial comparing short supportive PDT alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy, were traced. Patients who completed treatment were included. Recurrent episodes in the past five years were identified using CIDI. Severity of symptoms after five years was measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and sub-scales Depression, Anxiety and Somatisation of the self-report Symptom Checklist 90. Results: 52 (37%) patients of the original sample were localised. 42% had suffered from one or more recurrences during the follow-up period. There was no significant difference between the group who had received psychotherapy and the group who had received combined therapy during the acute phase. Young women and patients with more residual depressive symptoms and less somatic symptoms directly after treatment, were more at risk for recurrence. Limitations : Relatively small study population. Furthermore it was not known if patients received other treatment during the follow-up period. Conclusions: The long-term efficacy of PDT (with or without antidepressants) seemed to be comparable with other psychotherapies for depression. But the high recurrence rate urges us to shift the focus of depression treatment to improving long-term outcome and to the prevention of recurrence, in particular for young women and patients with residual symptoms of depression.

Clinical differences between early and late remission in depressive patients,"Objective: Predicting treatment outcome at an early stage is clinically relevant. The main objectives are: to compare rates of remission after acute and continuation phase treatment and to determine the most common residual symptoms among remitted patients; to compare the residual symptoms in early and late remitted and to identify factors that predict early or faster remission. Method: It is a prospective, naturalistic, multicenter, and nationwide epidemiological study of 1595 depressive outpatients. Severity of depressive symptoms was assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Self Rated Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR₃₀). Assessments were carried out after 6–8 weeks of antidepressant treatment and after 14–20 weeks of continuation treatment. Early remitters were defined with an IDS-SR₃₀ score ≤14 at first and second assessment. Late remitters were defined as those scoring IDS-SR₃₀ &gt;14 at first and IDS-SR30 score ≤14 at second assessment. Results: 140 subjects (8.8%) were in remission after 6–8 weeks of antidepressant treatment and 862 remitted (59%) after 16–20 weeks of treatment. The mean number of residual symptoms is significantly higher among patients who remit later. Greater differences between early and late remitters were found in the following symptoms: feeling sad, reactivity of mood, interpersonal sensitivity and pleasure/enjoyment. Multivariate analysis showed that only comorbid anxiety disorder is significantly associated with late remission. Conclusions: Early remitted patients have a better “quality” of remission. Late remission is associated with residual symptoms more related to core depressive symptoms. Residual symptoms in early remitted patients may constitute a new target for the treatment of depression.

The public health impact of antidepressants: An instrumental variable analysis,"Background: There has been a marked increase in antidepressant medication prescription and use over the past three decades with unclear effects on the mental health status of the population. This study examined the impact of expansion of antidepressant use on prevalence and characteristics of depression and suicidal ideations in the community. Method: Instrumental variable models were used to assess the impact of antidepressant treatments on the prevalence of depressive episodes, mixed anxiety and depression states and suicidal ideations in 22,845 participants of the 1993, 2000 and 2007 National surveys of psychiatric morbidity of Great Britain who were between 16 and 64years of age. Results: Increased prevalence of antidepressant treatment did not impact the prevalence of depressive episodes or mixed anxiety and depression states. However, antidepressant treatment was associated with decreased prevalence of severe and, to a lesser extent, mild depressive episodes and suicidal ideations and a corresponding increase in prevalence of moderate depressive episodes. Limitations: The data were cross-sectional and based on self-report of symptoms in the past month and current medication use with no information on dose and duration of medication treatment. Conclusions: Expansion of antidepressant treatments in recent years has not changed the community prevalence of depression overall, but it has reduced the prevalence of more severe depression and suicidal ideations. The findings call for better targeting and more judicious use of antidepressants in cases of more severe depressive episodes which are more likely to respond to such treatments.

Epidemiology of depression in an urban population of Turkish children and adolescents,"Background: In Turkey, studies of childhood depression have been limited to those using only scales. Methods: This is a two-stage cross-sectional epidemiological study. Three schools in Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey were selected by cluster sampling. The study included 1482 students between the fourth and eighth grades. The Child Depression Inventory (CDI) was used for screening in the first stage. According to test results, 320 children were interviewed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version. Depressive disorders were diagnosed in 62 students, constituting the case group. The control group was matched to the case group on school, grade, age, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES). Results: The prevalence rate was 4.2% for some form of depressive disorder, 1.55% for major depressive disorder, 1.75% for dysthymic disorder, 0.26% for double depression, and 0.60% for depressive disorder-not otherwise specified. According to the logistic regression analysis, increasing age, having a working mother and low maternal education were all positively associated with CDI score. Low SES, perception of paternal health and relations with father as negatively, low popularity and behavior subscales of the Piers-Harris self-concept scale, and high trait anxiety were associated with the presence of a depressive disorder. Limitations: Parents were not included in the diagnostic interviews. Conclusions: Dysthymic disorder was the most common depressive disorder. Low maternal education, low SES, dysfunctional interaction with the father, anxiety, and low self-esteem, which were all associated with depression, may be the target of interventions for prevention and treatment of depression.

"Mindfulness, response styles and dysfunctional attitudes in bipolar disorder","Background: This study aimed to examine differences between mindfulness, dysfunctional attitudes and response styles in subjects with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and controls. Method: A total of 192 participants were included in this study: 90 with bipolar disorder, 36 with remitted major depressive disorder and 66 subjects without a current or past history of a mood disorder. Results: After controlling for current mood state and co-morbid anxiety disorders, the groups did not differ on mindfulness or response styles scores, however, those with bipolar disorder scored significantly higher on the Dependency and Achievement subscales of the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale than the other two groups. Limitations: Sample sizes were relatively small for the control and remitted major depressive disorder groups making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Conclusions: Participants with bipolar disorder appear to significantly differ from remitted depressives and controls on certain cognitive styles such as Dependency and Achievement on the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale. Further research may help to understand how these cognitive domains impact on the course and outcome of bipolar disorder.

Common mental disorders and subsequent work disability: A population-based Health 2000 Study,"Background: Work disability due to common mental disorders has increased in Western countries during the past decade. The contribution of depressive, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders to all disability pensions at the population level is not known. Methods: Epidemiological health data from the Finnish Health 2000 Study, gathered in 2000-2001, was linked to the national register on disability pensions granted due to the ICD-10 diagnoses up to December 2007. Mental health at baseline was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Sociodemographic, clinical, and work-related factors, health behaviors, and treatment setting were used as covariates in the logistic regression analyses among the 3164 participants aged 30-58 years. Results: Anxiety, depressive, and comorbid common mental disorders predicted disability pension when adjusted for sex and age. In the fully adjusted multivariate model, comorbid common mental disorders, as well as physical illnesses, age over 45 years, short education, high job strain, and previous long-term sickness absence predicted disability pension. Limitations: The study population included persons aged 30 or over. Sub groups according to mental disorders were quite small which may have diminished statistical power in some sub groups. Baseline predictors were measured only once and the length of exposure could not be determined. The systems regarding financial compensation to employees differ between countries. Conclusions: Comorbid mental disorders pose a high risk for disability pension. Other independent predictors of work disability include socio-demographic, clinical, work-related, and treatment factors, but not health behavior. More attention should be paid to work-related factors in order to prevent chronic work disability.

Seasonality of Chinese rural young suicide and its correlates,"Background: There had been few studies on seasonality of Chinese suicide especially for Chinese rural youths. In this research, we wanted to find the seasonal pattern and the relationship between personal and behavioral characteristics and seasonal variation of suicide. Method: We examined Chinese rural young adults aged 15 to 34 years who died by suicide using Psychological Autopsy method to gather information from the informants of suicide victims. Altogether 330 suicide victims were collected among which 144 were female and 186 were male. The χ² test was used for comparison, and the multiple logistic regressions and Odds Ratios were adopted to analyze the seasonal preferences of suicide victims. Result: Seasonal summer peak of suicide emerged in total population and in each subgroup. Four logistic regression models were constructed: in spring, six variables were included in the regression model, which were Gender (OR=1.627), Pesticide Used (OR=1.622), Life Events (OR=2.764), Suicide Intent (OR=1.641), Marital Status (OR=0.574) and Family Conflicts (OR=0.590); in summer, only Marital Status (OR=1.927) was accepted; in autumn, four variables including Marital Problems (OR=1.924), Trait Anxiety (OR=1.758), Gender (OR=0.518) and Religion (OR=0.534) were retained; in winter, Pesticide Used (OR=0.486) and Suicide Intent (OR=0.614) were retained. Conclusion: Seasonal variations of personal and behavioral characteristics, combined with social activities, might also play very important roles in suicide seasonality.

Prospective cohort study of suicide attempters aged 70 and above: One-year outcomes,"Background: Most elderly persons who attempt suicide suffer from depression. This study aimed to investigate one-year outcomes in suicide attempters aged 70+, and to identify predictors of these outcomes. Methods: 101 persons (mean age 80) who were hospitalized after a suicide attempt were interviewed at baseline and followed for one year by record linkage. Face-to-face interviews were carried out with 71% of those who were alive after one year (60 out of 85). Outcome measures included major/minor depression, Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score, repeat non-fatal/fatal suicidal behavior and all-cause mortality. Results: One half (52%) of all those who were interviewed scored &lt;10 on the MADRS at follow-up. Among those with major depression at baseline, two thirds (26 out of 39) no longer fulfilled criteria for this disorder. Factors associated with non-remission of major depression (MADRS ≥10) included higher baseline depression and anxiety scores, higher suicide intent and lower Sense of Coherence. There were two suicides and six non-fatal repeat attempts. The relative risk of death (any cause) was 2.53 (95% CI=1.45–4.10, p&lt;0.001). Limitations: This is a naturalistic study; participants received non-uniform treatment as usual. The proportion with repeat suicidal behavior was lower than anticipated and the study was thus underpowered with regard to this outcome. Conclusions: Half of the surviving attempters were free from depressive symptoms at one-year follow-up and there were relatively few repeat attempts. However, all cause mortality remained high in this elderly cohort.

Structural correlates of trait anxiety: Reduced thickness in medial orbitofrontal cortex accompanied by volume increase in nucleus accumbens,"Structural deficiencies within the medial prefrontal cortex have been shown in anxiety-related psychiatric disorders such as panic disorder, post traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. In healthy subjects, trait anxiety as the individual's disposition to experience anxiety-relevant feelings or thoughts has been shown to be a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. We aimed at exploring the structural correlates of trait anxiety in normal participants. We acquired high-resolution MRI scans from 34 subjects and used FreeSurfer to obtain a measure of cortical thickness. We correlated cortical thickness with self-rated trait anxiety in a whole brain analysis. Automatic subcortical segmentations of the FreeSurfer pipeline were used to relate nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and amygdala volume to trait anxiety. Trait anxiety was negatively correlated with cortical thickness in the right medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and positively correlated with the bilateral volume of NAcc. Cortical thickness measures extracted from mOFC were negatively associated with the volume of left NAcc. Since, like in anxiety-related psychiatric disorders, in the healthy sample studied here, trait anxiety was associated with a reduction of cortical thickness in mOFC we suggest that this thinning is a structural precondition rather than a consequence of psychiatric illnesses.

Explanations of educational differences in major depression and generalised anxiety disorder in the Irish population,"Background: Social inequalities in mental disorders have been described, but studies that explain these inequalities are lacking, especially those using diagnostic interviews. This study investigates the contribution of various explanatory factors to the association between educational level and major depression and generalised anxiety disorder in Irish men and women. Methods: The study population comprised a national random sample of 5771 women and 4207 men aged 18 or more in Ireland (SLÁN 2007 survey). Major depression and generalised anxiety disorder were measured using a standardised diagnostic interview (CIDI-SF). Four groups of explanatory factors were explored: material, psychosocial, and behavioural factors, and chronic disease. Results: For both genders, low educational level increased the risk of both mental disorders. Material factors, especially no private health insurance, but also no car, housing tenure, insufficient food budget, and unemployment (for men), made the highest contribution (stronger for men than for women) in explaining the association between education and both mental disorders. Psychosocial (especially formal social participation, social support and marital status) and behavioural factors (smoking and physical activity for both genders, and alcohol and drug use for men) and chronic disease made low independent contributions in explaining the association between education and both mental disorders. Limitations: Given the cross-sectional study design, no causal conclusion could be drawn. Conclusions: Targeting various material, psychosocial, and behavioural factors, as well as chronic diseases may help to reduce educational differences in depression and anxiety in the general population.

Intra-individual changes in anxiety and depression during 12-month follow-up in percutaneous coronary intervention patients,"Background: Only a paucity of studies focused on intra-individual changes in anxiety and depression over time and its correlates in cardiac patients, which may contribute to the identification of high-risk patients and point to targets for intervention. We examined changes in anxiety and depression over a 12-month period and the demographic and clinical correlates of change scores using an intra-individual approach in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: Consecutive PCI patients (N=715) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at baseline and at 12 months post-PCI. Individual change scores were calculated and in secondary analysis, three categories of change were identified (i.e., stable, improved, and deteriorated anxiety or depression). Results: The mean individual change was -.16 (±3.0) for anxiety and -.02 (±2.8) for depression. In linear regression analysis, baseline anxiety levels (B=-.25, 95%CI[-.30 to -.20], p=&lt;.001) and baseline depression levels (B=-.28, 95%CI[-.33 to -.22], p=&lt;.001) were significant correlates of individual change scores. Secondary analysis showed that anxiety remained stable in 76.4% (546/715) of patients, while depression remained stable in 81.4% (582/715) of patients. Conclusions: The findings of the current study showed that levels of anxiety and depression remained stable in the majority of PCI patients from the index PCI to 12months post-PCI. Future studies using an intra-individual approach are warranted to further examine individual changes in anxiety and depression over time in CAD, and PCI in particular, as a means to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.

"Complicated grief among individuals with major depression: Prevalence, comorbidity, and associated features","Background: Growing data suggest that complicated grief (CG) may be common in clinical care settings, but there are few prior reports about CG in outpatients presenting with primary mood disorders. Methods: The present study examined rates of bereavement and threshold CG symptoms (defined as a score ≥25 on the Inventory of Complicated Grief scale) in 111 outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 142 healthy controls participating in a study of stress and depression. Clinical and demographic characteristics were also compared for bereaved individuals with CG (MDD+CG) to those without (MDD−CG). Participants completed structured diagnostic interviews as well as measures of CG, depression, anxiety, exposure to traumatic events, and perceived social support. Results: Lifetime history of a significant loss did not differ for the MDD and control groups (79.3% vs. 76.1%), but bereaved participants with MDD had higher rates of threshold CG (25.0% vs. 2.8%). Among those with MDD, CG was associated with a higher prevalence of lifetime alcohol dependence, greater exposure to traumatic events, and lower perceived social support. Depressed women, but not men, with CG also had higher rates of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Limitations: Our findings are limited by the lack of a clinician confirmatory assessment of CG diagnosis, absence of complete information about the nature and timing of the loss, and relatively narrow generalizability. Conclusions: We found high rates of CG in a group of psychiatric outpatients with chronic MDD, suggesting that patients with depression should be routinely screened for CG.

Psychological factors associated with the incidence and persistence of suicidal ideation,"Background: Suicidal ideation has been identified as both a common antecedent and a significant risk factor for suicide attempt and completed suicide. However, little is known about the incidence and persistence of suicidal ideation in the general population and the associated risk factors. Methods: A 12-month follow-up survey investigated 997 of the respondents who participated in the baseline territory-wide survey of adult population in Hong Kong. A set of baseline psychological factors was considered as predictors of first onset and persistence of suicidal ideation. Results: Twelve-month incidence (1.9%) and persistence (6.2%) rates were estimated. Respondents with anxiety and lack of reasons for living were more likely to report a development of suicidal thoughts in the follow-up assessment, while respondents with higher level of average life distress and lower level of hope were at increased risk of continuing to have suicidal thoughts. Depression was found to partially mediate the effect of average life distress on persistent suicidality. Limitations: Retention rate of the follow-up sample was about 50% only. Assessments of suicidal ideation were based on retrospective reports. Conclusions: Psychological factors differentially predict first onset and persistence of suicidal ideation. It is of clinical value that depression partially mediated the effect of life distress on persistence of suicidality.

Impulsivity in anxiety disorder patients: Is it related to comorbid cyclothymia?,"Objective: The relationship between anxiety and impulsivity is controversial and not well explored. In a previous study we compared impulsivity, measured by different rating tools, in patients with anxiety disorders vs. healthy controls. In the same sample we now explore the influence of comorbid soft bipolar spectrum disorders on the relationship between anxiety disorders and impulsivity. Method: A sample including 47 subjects with anxiety disorder(s) and 45 control subjects matched for demographic, educational and work characteristics underwent a diagnostic evaluation by the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI); a symptomatological evaluation by the Bech–Rafaelsen Depression and Mania Scale (BRDMS), the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Hypomania Check List (HCL-32) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI); a temperamental and personological evaluation by the Questionnaire for the Affective and Anxious Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego—Modified (TEMPS-M), the Separation Anxiety Symptoms Inventory (SASI), the Interpersonal Sensitivity Symptoms Inventory (ISSI); and, finally, a psychometric and a neuro-cognitive evaluation of impulsivity by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and the Immediate and Delayed Memory Task (IMT/DMT). The initial sample of patients with anxiety disorders was then subdivided into two subgroups depending on the presence of comorbid cyclothymia (Cyclo+, n = 26 and Cyclo−, n = 21). For the diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder, we used both the DSM-IV-TR criteria and also a modified threshold for hypomania with a duration of 2days. We compared symptomatological, temperamental, personological and impulsivity measures in Cyclo+, Cyclo− and controls. Results: The comparison between Cyclo+, Cyclo− and controls showed that Cyclo+ are the most impulsive subjects in all the investigated measures and are characterized by greatest symptomatological impairment, highest scores in temperamental scales, and highest levels of interpersonal sensitivity and separation anxiety. Cyclo− subjects resulted to be more impulsive compared to controls concerning the retrospective trait measures, but not in the neuro-cognitive test. Limitations: Correlational cross-sectional study. Conclusion: In our patients with anxiety disorders, without lifetime comorbidity with major mood episodes, trait and state impulsivity resulted to be greater than in controls. In particular impulsivity was highest in patients with both anxiety disorders and cyclothymia. In anxious–cyclothymic patients also separation anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity were more severe than in anxious patients without cyclothymia and controls. Our findings suggest that impulsivity, rather than being directly related to the presence of the anxiety disorder, could be associated with comorbidity with cyclothymia.

Damage to the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex induces panic disorder,"Brain imaging studies suggest that panic disorder (PD) is mediated by several brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In the present report we describe a patient who experienced a panic attack during awake surgery (case 1) and another patient who developed PD after surgery and radiotherapy (case 2). In case 1, the patient experienced repeated panic attacks when the tumor at the upper border of right dorsal ACC was removed during awake surgery. In case 2, the patient developed PD at six months after surgery and Cyberknife radiotherapy. MRI examination revealed that the dorsal ACC size was reduced at six months after surgery and that the dorsal ACC was absent at two years after surgery, possibly due to radiotherapy-induced damage by radiotherapy. Profile of mood states (POMS) testing characterized the presence of tension–anxiety as the common abnormal symptom in cases 1 and 2. In conclusion, these results suggest that damage to the right dorsal ACC can induce PD and that this structure likely plays a pathophysiologic role in PD.

The validity of DSM symptoms for depression and anxiety disorders during pregnancy,"Background: The applicability of the symptom criteria for diagnostic mood and anxiety disorders has in recent times been questioned for women in the perinatal period, due to the overlap of diagnostic symptoms with normal symptoms due to the physical changes of pregnancy or postpartum, (e.g., sleep difficulties). Method: 118 women in their second or early third trimester of pregnancy participated in a telephone interview that included the depression and anxiety modules of the MINI diagnostic interview, and an attributional probe question asking the woman whether endorsement of a symptom was due to the physical changes of her pregnancy or due to her mood or worries. Results: 66% of pregnant women who met criteria for major depression reported that a sufficient number of their symptoms were due to the normal physical changes of their pregnancy, such that they would no longer meet criteria for a diagnosis of major depression. Attributional probing resulted in the rate of major depression falling from 6.8% to 1.7%. The impact on anxiety disorders appears to be less. Limitations: An important issue is whether women's attributional perceptions are valid, though the face validity of some of their responses means that credence should be given to the findings. In addition, it would be useful from a validity perspective to undertake the same attributional probing with other populations where symptom presence is most likely due to mood, such as unemployed or recently separated adults without physical complaints. Conclusion: Rates of depressive disorders in pregnancy, using DSM symptom criteria, are significantly over-estimated due to the natural occurrence of many of the symptoms as a result of the pregnancy. Rates of anxiety disorders are also inflated, but to a lesser degree. This means that the validation of self-report mood measures, typically done against DSM diagnoses, is likely to have produced erroneous findings (e.g., optimum cut-off scores). It is probable that a similar finding would be obtained for the postpartum period. Thus future use of DSM symptom criteria for depression and anxiety in perinatal mental health work should use some form of attributional probing question to more accurately understand the applicability of symptoms to a diagnosis in this population.

"Stressful events, stress perception and treatment outcomes in patients with depressive disorders: The CRESCEND Study","Background: Investigations of associations between stressful events and depression treatment outcomes have led to conflicting findings. In a prospective naturalistic study of depression treatment we sought to investigate perceived stress as a predictor of 12-week antidepressant treatment outcome. Methods: A nationwide sample of 580 people with depressive disorders was recruited from 18 hospitals in Korea. Number of stressful events in the last 12months and subjective perception of stress were ascertained, and were dichotomized by median values. Participants commenced on antidepressant treatment were re-evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12weeks later. Assessment scales for evaluating depression (HAMD), anxiety (HAMA), global severity (CGI-s), and functioning (SOFAS) were administered at baseline and at every follow-up visit. Covariates included pre-treatment socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and treatment-related characteristics. Results: Higher baseline perceived stress was significantly associated with worse 12-week antidepressant treatment outcomes in terms of depression, anxiety, and global severity after adjustment for all covariates. However, baseline number of stressful events was not associated with any treatment outcomes. Limitations: The study was observational, and the treatment modality was naturalistic. Conclusions: Depressive patients with higher level of perceived stress at the time of commencing treatment had less favorable outcomes after antidepressant treatment. This may represent a group requiring more specific assessment and more intensive management in order to improve treatment response.

Psychotherapies for comorbid anxiety in bipolar spectrum disorders,"Background: Comorbid anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in bipolar disorder and have been shown to have serious negative impacts on the course of illness. The pharmacological treatment of anxiety can interact with the bipolar disorder and has not been proven effective. As such, many have recommended the psychological treatment of anxiety. This paper reviews the literature on psychological treatments for anxiety comorbid to bipolar disorder. Method: The Medline, PsychInfo and Web of Science databases were thoroughly examined for relevant treatment studies. Results: Despite frequent recommendations in the literature, surprisingly few have studied the psychological treatment of comorbid anxiety in bipolar disorders. Nevertheless, preliminary results suggest that comorbid anxiety disorders can be effectively treated in a bipolar clientele using cognitive–behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive–behavioral therapy or relaxation training. In contrast, interpersonal, family therapy and psychoeducation alone would not seem to be beneficial treatment alternatives for anxiety. Cognitive–behavioral therapy appears to reduce the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and general symptoms of anxiety among patients with bipolar disorder. However, the long-term maintenance of anxiety treatment effects may be somewhat reduced and adaptationsmay be called for to augment and sustain benefits. Conclusions: There is an urgent need for randomized controlled trials of different forms of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders comorbid to bipolar disorder. Until such trials are available, the most promising approach would appear to be the sequential or modular CBT-based treatment of the anxiety disorder.

The influence of childhood adversity on social relations and mental health at mid-life,"Background: Childhood adversity is predictive of affective and anxiety disorders in adulthood, although there are likely to be several mediating factors. Social relations and social networks are potential mediators, and have also been linked to onset and recovery of affective and anxiety disorders in adulthood. This study explored positive and negative aspects of close relationships, their association with mid-life anxiety and affective disorders, and their mediating role in the relationship between childhood adversity and mid-life disorders. Methods: Data from the 1958 British birth cohort were analysed using measures of adversity taken during childhood, measurements of social relations at 45 years, and diagnosis of affective and anxiety disorders at 45 years of age (N = 9377). Results: Childhood adversity was associated with smaller social network size and higher negative aspects of close relationships. Smaller social network size and negative aspects of close relationships, but not emotional or practical support, were associated with higher odds of having affective or anxiety disorder. However, social relations did not mediate or moderate the pathway between childhood adversity and mid-life affective and anxiety disorders. Limitations: Social relations and affective and anxiety disorders were measured cross-sectionally so direction of causation cannot be determined. Conclusions: Negative aspects of close relationships and social network size, rather than emotional or practical support, are associated with affective and anxiety disorders. Childhood adversity is related to later social relationships as well as mid-life affective and anxiety disorders.

"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plasma levels in drug-naïve OCD patients are lower than those in healthy people, but are not lower than those in drug-treated OCD patients","Background: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neural development, and has been implicated in the development of depressive and anxiety disorders. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic anxiety disorder with an unclear pathophysiology. Although genetic studies have suggested an association between BDNF and OCD, the results have been inconsistent. The aims of this study were to determine whether BDNF plasma levels in OCD patients are lower than those in healthy controls and whether BDNF plasma levels differ between drug-naïve and drug-treated OCD patients. Methods: We examined BDNF plasma levels in 22 drug-naïve OCD patients, 52 drug-treated OCD patients, and 63 healthy controls. Individuals in all groups with a current or lifetime history of depression were excluded. Results: BDNF plasma levels in both drug-naïve OCD patients (1.97 ± 1.80 ng/ml, p = 0.00) and drug-treated OCD patients (1.98 ± 1.54 ng/ml, p = 0.00) were lower than those in normal controls (4.09 ± 2.00 ng/ml). However BDNF plasma levels in those two OCD patients groups were not different from each other significantly ( p = 0.99). Length of drug treatment was positively associated with BDNF plasma levels in the drug-treated patients ( r = 0.34, p = 0.03). Limitations: We used treatment length of two weeks and above as the criterion to recruit drug-treated patients. Probably this treatment length is not sufficient to identify drug-associated changes in BDNF levels. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that BDNF is involved in the pathophysiology of OCD, and may be a peripheral marker indicating neurotrophic impairment in OCD.

Age at onset in Canadian OCD patients: Mixture analysis and systematic comparison with other studies,"Objective: This study aimed to determine the distributions of the age at onset (AAO) using mixture analysis and better develop the understanding of AAO as a clinical feature of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Method: Mixture analysis was used to identify sub-groups characterized by differences in AAO. Clinical features were analyzed for differences in AAO sub-groups using mixture analysis. Comparisons were made with AAO cut-offs used in previous studies using the 2-Sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test. Results: Mixture analysis of our sample (n = 196) yielded a combination of 2 normal theoretical distributions with means (SD) of 9.66 (3.12) for the early-onset sub-group and 21.1 (8.36) years for the late-onset sub-group. The sub-groups were divided by a cut-off of 15 years. As expected, a negative correlation was found between AAO and duration of illness. The early-onset subjects had significantly lower age at the time of the assessment and they tended to have more often panic attacks but were treated less often with benzodiazepines and other anti-anxiety medications. The comparison analysis showed significant difference in the AAO distribution between our sample and four other study samples. Conclusions: Our findings support the notion that different AAO sub-groups correspond with differences in clinical presentations of obsessive–compulsive disorder.

"Different white matter abnormalities between the first-episode, treatment-naive patients with posttraumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder without comorbid conditions","Background: This study compared brain white matter integrity in two groups of patients with DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Method: Seventeen patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 20 with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and 28 healthy controls were assessed on diffusion tensor imaging. Results: As compared to healthy controls, increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in left superior frontal gyrus in PTSD patients, and increased FA in right postcentral gyrus in GAD subjects were exhibited. Furthermore, patients with PTSD showed reduced FA in right anterior cingulate gyrus relative to GAD subjects. However, there was no significant correlation between the FA value of any altered region and the severity of PTSD or GAD. Limitations: The sample studied can be considered small. Gender and educational level were not well-matched among the groups. Conclusions: We tentatively speculate that abnormal white matter integrity of right anterior cingulate gyrus is an important neuroimaging marker of PTSD that distinguishes it from other anxiety disorders such as GAD.

Screening for perinatal common mental disorders in women in the north of Vietnam: A comparison of three psychometric instruments,"Background: There is increasing recognition that Perinatal Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) are a major public health problem for women in resource-constrained countries. There is an urgent need for screening tools suitable for use by community based health workers to assist in the identification of people with compromised mental health. The aim of this study was to establish the validity of three widely used psychometric screening instruments in detecting CMDs in women in northern Viet Nam. Methods: Translated and culturally verified versions of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), General Health Questionnaire 12 items (GHQ-12), Zung's Self-rated Anxiety Scale (Zung SAS) and a gold-standard diagnostic tool, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV, were administered to a community-based representative cohort of 364 Vietnamese women in the perinatal period. Post-hoc analyses, Cronbach's alpha, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to identify the optimal cut-off points and to compare the validity of three scales. Results: The Areas under the ROC Curve were: EPDS 0.77 (95%CI 0.72–0.82); Zung SAS 0.79 (95% CI 0.74–0.84) and GHQ-12 0.72 (95%CI 0.67–0.78). The optimal cut-off point for the EPDS was 3/4 (Se 69.7%; Sp 72.9%). The corresponding value for Zung SAS was 37/38 (Se 67.9%; Sp 75.3%) and for GHQ-12 was 0/1 (Se 77.1%; Sp 56.6%). The internal reliability Cronbach's alpha for EPDS was 0.75, for Zung SAS was 0.76, and for GHQ-12 was 0.64. Conclusions: These instruments are suitable for use as screening tools for CMDs in women in northern Viet Nam, but probably because of differences in emotional literacy, familiarity with test-taking and the effects of chronic social adversity require much lower cut off scores to detect clinically significant symptoms than in other settings.

Prevalence and correlates of lifetime deliberate self-harm and suicidal ideation in naturalistic outpatients: The Leiden Routine Outcome Monitoring study,"Background: Deliberate self-harm and suicidal ideation (DSHI) are common phenomena in general and mental health populations. Identifying factors associated with DSHI may contribute to the early identification, prevention and treatment of DSHI. Aims of the study are to determine the prevalence and correlates of lifetime DSHI in a naturalistic sample of psychiatric outpatients with mood, anxiety or somatoform (MAS) disorders. Methods: Of 3798 consecutive patients from January 2004 to December 2006, 2844 (74.9%) patients were analyzed (mean age = 37.5, SD = 12.0; age range: 18–65; 62.7% women). Lifetime DSHI was assessed with routine outcome monitoring (ROM), including demographic parameters, DSM-IV diagnosis, depressive symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, general psychopathology and personality traits. Results: Of the 2844 subjects, 55% reported lifetime DSHI. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, the most important factors associated with lifetime DSHI were being unmarried, low education, high number of psychiatric diagnoses, lower anxiety scores, higher depression scores and the personality trait of emotional dysregulation. Limitations: Deliberate self-harm may have been under-reported in self-report questionnaires; The assessment of personality traits may have been influenced by state psychopathology; traumatic events were not assessed. Conclusions: The findings suggest that DSHI is common among psychiatric outpatients with MAS disorders and that current symptoms and underlying personality vulnerabilities were independently involved in DSHI. Whether symptoms of somatic anxiety are protective should be confirmed in subsequent studies. These findings may help clinicians in identifying patients at risk for deliberate self-harm and suicide.

High and low suicidality in Europe: A fine-grained comparison of France and Spain within the &lt;i&gt;ESEMeD&lt;/i&gt; surveys,"Background: Suicidality risk-factors between countries with similar economic and religious background have been rarely compared, especially within genders. Methods: Lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation, plans, and attempts in the ESEMeD surveys were stratified on four separate groups: French women, Spanish women, French men, and Spanish men. Outcome odds-ratios (OR) were modelled within each group using logistic regression including demographic characteristics, lifetime mood/anxiety disorders, parental bonding, marital status, and health service-use. Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was 3.4% in France (1.1% men, 5.4% women) and 1.5% in Spain (1.2% men, 1.7% women), with a significantly greater gender difference in France ( p = 0.001). Regarding risk-factors, French women reported suicide attempt more commonly with authoritarian mothers (OR = 1.51; 95%CI = 1.04–2.18), unlike Spanish women (OR = 0.77; 95%CI = 0.51–1.15) ( p &lt; 0.001). Spanish men showed more than eight-times higher odds of suicide attempt with overprotecting mothers than French men ( p = 0.03). General practitioner-(GP)-use was significantly protective of suicide attempt among Spanish women (OR = 0.08; 95%CI = 0.02–0.35) with no effect in French women (OR = 1.03; 95%CI = 0.54–2.00) ( p = 0.01). No significant differences in the effect of marital status, any lifetime antidepressant use, mental disorders, or religiosity on suicide attempt were observed between France and Spain within gender-stratum. Limitations: Parental bonding is retrospective and potentially influenced by mental state. Response rate was considerably lower in France than in Spain. Conclusions: Suicidality risk-factors play different roles across genders between France and Spain. Parental bonding dimensions may be interpreted differently according to country, underlining cultural importance. As recommended by WHO, mental health decisions must involve GPs in conjunction with psychiatrists or psychologists.

The insular cortex and the neuroanatomy of major depression,"Background: The neuroanatomical substrate underlying Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is incompletely understood. Recent reports have implicated the insular cortex. Methods: Two cohorts of participants with MDD were tested. In the first MDD cohort, we used standardised facial expression recognition tasks. In the second cohort, we focused on facial disgust recognition, a function associated with the insular cortex. T1 weighted MR imaging was used in the second cohort to test the hypothesis of abnormal insular volume being associated with impaired disgust recognition. Results: Disgust recognition was particularly impaired in both cohorts. In the second cohort, the magnitude of the disgust recognition deficit correlated with reduced insula grey matter volume. Exploring the idea of insula involvement in MDD further, we identified the insular cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex as key neural correlates of core symptoms, in that scores of 3 clinical scales (the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale) correlated with grey matter volume in these structures. Limitations: MDD participants were clinically representative of specialist and academic psychiatric practice in the UK and presented with robust primary diagnoses; we did not exclude common co-morbidities such as anxiety and personality disorders. Conclusions: We propose that cognitive and emotional functions assumed to be associated with the insula are adversely affected in patients with MDD and that this may, therefore, represent the substrate for some core clinical features of MDD. Further exploration of the involvement of the insular cortex in MDD is warranted.

Two-year course of depressive and anxiety disorders: Results from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA),"Background: Whether course trajectories of depressive and anxiety disorders are different, remains an important question for clinical practice and informs future psychiatric nosology. This longitudinal study compares depressive and anxiety disorders in terms of diagnostic and symptom course trajectories, and examines clinical prognostic factors. Methods: Data are from 1209 depressive and/or anxiety patients residing in primary and specialized care settings, participating in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Diagnostic and Life Chart Interviews provided 2-year course information. Results: Course was more favorable for pure depression (n = 267, median episode duration = 6-months, 24.5% chronic) than for pure anxiety (n = 487, median duration = 16 months, 41.9% chronic).Worst course was observed in the comorbid depression–anxiety group (n = 455, median duration &gt;24 months, 56.8% chronic). Independent predictors of poor diagnostic and symptom trajectory outcomes were severity and duration of index episode, comorbid depression–anxiety, earlier onset age and older age. With only these factors a reasonable discriminative ability (C-statistic 0.72–0.77) was reached in predicting 2-year prognosis. Limitation: Depression and anxiety cases concern prevalent—not incident—cases. This, however, reflects the actual patient population in primary and specialized care settings. Conclusions: Their differential course trajectory justifies separate consideration of pure depression, pure anxiety and comorbid anxiety–depression in clinical practice and psychiatric nosology.

"Anxiety and depression in bariatric surgery patients: A prospective, follow-up study using structured clinical interviews","Background: Candidates for bariatric surgery frequently have co-morbid psychiatric problems. Methods: This study investigated the course and the prognostic significance of preoperative and postoperative anxiety and depressive disorders in 107 extremely obese bariatric surgery patients in a prospective design with face-to-face interviews (SCID) conducted prior to the surgery and postoperatively after 6–12 months and 24–36 months. Results: The point prevalence of depressive disorders but not of anxiety disorders decreased significantly after surgery. Preoperative depressive disorders predicted depressive disorders 24–36 months but not 6–12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative anxiety significantly predicted postoperative anxiety disorders at both follow-up time points. Preoperative lifetime and current depressive disorders were unrelated to postoperative weight loss whereas preoperative lifetime, but not current anxiety disorders were of negative prognostic value for postoperative weight loss. Patients with both depressive and anxiety disorders at baseline (current and lifetime) lost significantly less weight after surgery. Postoperative anxiety disorder was not associated with the degree of weight loss at any follow-up time-point; however postoperative depressive disorder was negatively associated with weight loss at the 24–36 month follow-up assessment point. Limitations: Missing data, limited statistical power, self-reported height and weight are the limitations of this study. Conclusions: As opposed to anxiety disorders, the point prevalence of depressive disorders decreased significantly after bariatric surgery. However, the presence of depressive disorders after bariatric surgery significantly predicted attenuated post-surgical improvements and may signal a need for clinical attention.

Implementation of psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in routine practice: Two year prospective cohort study,"Introduction: Worldwide, health systems are improving access to empirically supported psychological therapies for anxiety and depression. Evaluations of this effort are limited by the cross sectional nature of studies, short implementation periods, poor data completeness rates and lack of clinically significant and reliable change metrics. Objective: Assess the impact of implementing stepped care empirically supported psychological therapies by measuring the prospective outcomes of patients referred over a two year period to one Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service in the UK. Method: We collected demographic, therapeutic and outcome data on depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) from 7859 consecutive patients for 24 months between 1st July 2006 and 31st August 2008, following up these patients for a further one year. Results: 4183 patients (53%) received two or more treatment sessions. Uncontrolled effect size for depression was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.88 to 1.29) and for anxiety was 1.04 (0.88 to 1.23). 55.4% of treated patients met reliable improvement or reliable and clinically significant change criteria for depression, 54.7% for anxiety. Patients received a mean of 5.5 sessions over 3.5 h, mainly low-intensity CBT and phone based case management. Attrition was high with 47% of referrals either not attending for an assessment or receiving an assessment only. Conclusions: Recovery rates for patients receiving stepped care empirically supported treatments for anxiety and depression in routine practice are 40 to 46%. Only half of all patients referred go on to receive treatment. Further work is needed to improve routine engagement of patients with anxiety and depression.

Are patient beliefs important in determining adherence to treatment and outcome for depression? Development of the Beliefs about Depression Questionnaire,"Background: Depressive disorders are prevalent and costly but there is a lack of evidence on how to best select treatments for mild to moderate depression in primary care. Illness beliefs have been shown to influence the outcome from physical illness and our previous retrospective study suggested that beliefs may influence the duration of antidepressant medication. The development of a short questionnaire to measure beliefs will allow exploration of the relationship between beliefs, adherence to treatment and outcome for depression. Methods: A questionnaire was designed based on Leventhal's Common Sense Model of illness beliefs (CSM). Data from previous qualitative and quantitative studies as well as formal inventories were used to inform the content of individual items. The questionnaire was mailed to primary care patients with a recorded history of depression in the previous 2 years. Data were analysed by principal component analysis to determine underlying multidimensional structure and derive a shortened questionnaire. Results: Three hundred and thirty-four respondents completed the questionnaire. Fifteen components (subscales) were derived which corresponded to aspects of the CSM dimensions for cause, control/cure, consequences and timeline. The identity dimension was retained as one subscale. Reliability coefficients determined the items which best represented each subscale; 52 items were retained to derive a new shortened questionnaire. Convergent construct validity was demonstrated by comparison with the generic brief illness perception questionnaire (BIPQ) and divergent construct validitywas shown by comparison with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs). Limitations: The study was adequately powered, but the response rate means that response bias cannot be excluded. Conclusions: Beliefs about depression are multi-faceted, but fit the dimensions of the CSM. The derived shortened questionnaire will be used to determine whether beliefs about depression are predictive of outcome in a future prospective study.

Anxiety measures validated in perinatal populations: A systematic review,"Background: Research and screening of anxiety in the perinatal period is hampered by a lack of psychometric data on self-report anxiety measures used in perinatal populations. This paper aimed to review self-report measures that have been validated with perinatal women. Methods: A systematic search was carried out of four electronic databases. Additional papers were obtained through searching identified articles. Thirty studies were identified that reported validation of an anxiety measure with perinatal women. Results: Most commonly validated self-report measures were the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS). Of the 30 studies included, 11 used a clinical interview to provide criterion validity. Remaining studies reported one or more other forms of validity (factorial, discriminant, concurrent and predictive) or reliability. The STAI shows criterion, discriminant and predictive validity and may be most useful for research purposes as a specific measure of anxiety. The Kessler 10 (K-10) may be the best short screening measure due to its ability to differentiate anxiety disorders. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21) measures multiple types of distress, shows appropriate content, and remains to be validated against clinical interview in perinatal populations. Limitations: Nineteen studies did not report sensitivity or specificity data. The early stages of research into perinatal anxiety, the multitude of measures in use, and methodological differences restrict comparison of measures across studies. Conclusion: There is a need for further validation of self-report measures of anxiety in the perinatal period to enable accurate screening and detection of anxiety symptoms and disorders.

The effects of postnatal maternal depression and anxiety on the processing of infant faces,"Background: Postnatally depressed mothers have difficulties responding appropriately to their infants. The quality of the mother–child relationship depends on a mother's ability to respond to her infant's cues, which are largely non-verbal. Therefore, it is likely that difficulties in a mother's appraisal of her infants' facial expressions will affect the quality of mother–infant interaction. This study aimed to investigate the effects of postnatal depression and anxiety on the processing of infants' facial expressions. Method: A total of 89 mothers, 34 with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, 21 with Major Depressive Disorder, and 34 controls, completed a ‘morphed infants’ faces task when their children were between 10 and 18 months. Results: Overall, mothers were more likely to identify happy faces accurately and at lower intensity than sad faces. Depressed compared to control participants, however,were less likely to accurately identify happy infant faces. Interestingly, mothers with GAD tended to identify happy faces at a lower intensity than controls. There were no differences between the groups in relation to sad faces. Limitations: Our sample was relatively small and further research is needed to investigate the links between mothers' perceptions of infant expressions and both maternal responsiveness and later measures of child development. Conclusion: Our findings have potential clinical implications as the difficulties in the processing of positive facial expressions in depression may lead to less maternal responsiveness to positive affect in the offspring and may diminish the quality of the mother–child interactions. Results for participants with GAD are consistent with the literature demonstrating that persons with GAD are intolerant of uncertainty and seek reassurance due to their worries.

Psychometric properties of the dickman impulsivity instrument in suicide victims and living controls of rural China,"Background: We are not aware of any of impulsivity trait for Chinese rural youths. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of Dickman Impulsivity Instrument in suicide cases and living controls in rural China. Methods: The participants, 392 suicide victims and 416 controls were respectively selected, and the psychological autopsy method was used to collect information. The Exploratory Factor Analysis was processed to evaluate the construct validity. The Cronbach's alpha was computed to evaluate the internal consistency, and the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between STAI Trait Anxiety Inventory, Coping Responses Inventory and Dickman Impulsivity Instrument were calculated to evaluate the convergent validity. Results: Dysfunctional and Functional impulsivity were extracted for both samples. The mean of DI scores in suicide cases was larger than that in controls, but it was reversed for FI. There were no significant differences between DI and FI in suicide cases, but in controls the mean of DI scores was significantly smaller than that of FI. The Cronbach's alpha was around .863 and .779 respectively for DI and FI scales in suicides, and it was around .746 and .680 in controls. The DI and FI were significantly correlated with each other. Both the DI and FI were correlated with Approach and Avoidance Coping Response Inventory, and both of the scales were grossly independent with Trait Anxiety Inventory in two samples. Conclusion: The results indicated that the Dickman Impulsivity Instrument was adequate to measure impulsivity trait for suicide victims and living controls through proxy data in rural China.

Shared genetic contributions to anxiety disorders and pathological gambling in a male population,"Background: Pathological gambling (PG) frequently co-occurs with anxiety disorders. However, the extent to which the co-occurrence is related to genetic or environmental factors across PG and anxiety disorders is not known. Method: Data from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry ( n = 7869, male twins) were examined in bivariate models to estimate genetic and shared and unique environmental contributions to PG and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and PG and panic disorder (PD). Results: While both genetic and unique environmental factors contributed individually to PG, GAD, and PD, the best fitting model indicated that the relationship between PG and GAD was attributable predominantly to shared genetic contributions (r A = 0.53). In contrast, substantial correlations were observed between both the genetic (r A = 0.34) and unique environmental (r E = 0.31) contributions to PG and PD. Limitations: Results may be limited to middle aged males. Conclusions: The existence of shared genetic contributions between PG and both GAD and PD suggests that specific genes, perhaps those involved in affect regulation or stress responsiveness, contribute to PG and anxiety disorders. Overlapping environmental contributions to the co-occurrence of PG and PD suggest that common life experiences (e.g., early life trauma) contribute to both PG and PD. Conversely, the data suggest that distinct environmental factors contribute to PG and GAD (e.g., early onset of gambling in PG). Future studies should examine the relationship between PG and anxiety disorders amongst other populations (women and adolescents) to identify specific genetic and environmental influences that account for the manifestation of these disorders and their co-occurrences.

"Does negative religious coping accompany, precede, or follow depression among Orthodox Jews?","Background: Cross sectional research suggests that negative religious coping (e.g., anger at God and religious disengagement) strongly correlates with depression and anxiety. However, causality is difficult to establish as negative coping can accompany, cause, or result from distress. Among Orthodox Jews, some studies have found correlations between negative religious coping and anxiety and depression, while others found that high levels of negative coping related with decreased distress. We therefore examined longitudinal relationships between negative coping and depressive symptoms among Orthodox Jews. Methods: Participants (80 Orthodox Jews) completed the Jewish Religious Coping Scale and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies' Depression Scale at two times. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we compared four models describing possible causal patterns. Results: Negative religious coping and depressive symptoms were linearly related. Furthermore, a model including negative coping as a predictor of future depression fit the data best and did not significantly differ from a saturated model. Limitations: This research was limited by reliance on self-report measures, an internet sample, and examination of only negative religious coping. Conclusions: Consistent with a “primary spiritual struggles” conceptualization, negative religious coping appears to precede and perhaps cause future depression among Orthodox Jews. Clinical interventions should target spiritual struggles, and more research integrating this construct into theory and practice is warranted.

Subtyping depression in the medically ill by cluster analysis,"Background: There is increasing awareness of the need of subtyping major depressive disorder, particularly in the setting of medical disease. The aim of this investigation was to use both DSM-IV comorbidity and the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) for characterizing depression in the medically ill. Methods: 1700 patients were recruited from 8 medical centers in the Italian Health System and 1560 agreed to participate. They all underwent a cross-sectional assessment with DSM-IV and DCPR structured interviews. 198 patients (12.7%) received a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Data were submitted to cluster analysis. Results: Two clusters were identified: depressed somatizers and irritable/anxious depression. The somatizer cluster included 58.6% of the cases and was characterized by DCPR somatization syndromes (persistent somatization, functional somatic symptoms secondary to a psychiatric disorder, conversion symptoms, and anniversary reactions) and DCPR alexithymia. The anxious/irritable cluster had 41.4% of the total sample and included DCPR irritable mood and type A behavior and DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Limitations: The study has limitations due to its cross-sectional nature. Further, these findings require additional validation in another sample. Conclusions: The findings indicate the need of expanding clinical assessment in the medically ill to include the various manifestations of somatization, irritable mood, type A behavior and alexithymia, as encompassed by the DCPR. Subtyping major depressive disorder may yield improved targets for psychosomatic research and treatment trials.

The identification of unipolar mania subtype based on anxiety comorbidity,"Background: Unipolar mania is a controversial topic. Clinical research has focused on establishing specific characteristics that allow it to be distinguished from bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: Experienced and carefully trained clinicians evaluated a clinical sample of 298 patients with bipolar disorder using structured instruments to analyze the clinical and socio-demographics differences between people with manic episodes over the course of a 15-year illness compared with participants with histories of manic and depressive episodes. Results: According to adopted criteria, 16 (5.6%) participants presented unipolar mania (UM) and 282 participants presented manic and depressive (MD) phases. UM patients reported significantly more hospitalizations and medications, as well as more frequent psychosis at the first episode in the UM group than compared to the MD group. The UM group showed worse overall functioning, although differences in mood status between groups were not identified. Comorbid anxiety disorders and anxiety symptoms occurred significantly less frequently in the UM group. Limitations: Because of the cross-sectional design, determining causal relationships was not possible. Furthermore, the retrospective nature of the UM diagnosis could not exclude a future depressive episode. Conclusions: The presence of anxiety disorders can differentiate patients with unipolar mania from those with bipolar mania.

Symptoms and behaviors prior to the first major affective episode of bipolar ii disorder. An exploratory study,"Background: Few studies have investigated the initial prodrome of bipolar disorders, and none has explicitly addressed bipolar II disorder (BD-II). We explored symptoms and behaviors preceding the first major affective episode (FMAE) of BD-II to generate hypotheses concerning possible clinical targets for early intervention. Methods: In-depth interviews of 15 BD-II patients and 22 family informants were carried out. Clinical diagnoses were reassessed. The textual data of transcribed interviews were analyzed utilizing qualitative methodology supplemented by quantitative analyses. Results: All patients experienced clinically significant symptoms and behaviors at an average of more than a decade before the FMAE. Anxiety and depression-type symptoms were the most common. Two distinct subgroups were identified based on prominent and enduring personal characteristics prior to the FMAE. The individuals in one of the subgroups were described as very well-functioning, whereas the individuals in the other subgroup were characterized by neurocognitive deficits, relatively low academic and social functioning, and pronounced irritability and aggressiveness. Furthermore, it is possible that these individuals experience earlier prodromal symptom onset, earlier FMAEs, and more symptoms than individuals without these characteristics. Limitations: This is a retrospective and hypothesis-generating qualitative study. The hypotheses generated need to be tested in future studies. Conclusions: Prodromal clinical phenomenology is too nonspecific to predict the occurrence of the FMAE of BD-II. However, identifiable subgroups may exist. We hypothesize that neurocognitive deficits together with pronounced irritability and aggressiveness may constitute a vulnerability marker for a subgroup of individuals who subsequently develop BD-II. This subgroup may be of potential interest for early identification.

Relationship between malnutrition and depression or anxiety in anorexia nervosa: A critical review of the literature,"Background: Depression, anxiety and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) frequently co-occur with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Clinical consensus admits that depressive symptoms and anxiety are the sequelae of malnutrition in AN. This review presents a critical assessment of the literature that looked into the link between depression/anxiety symptoms in relation to malnutrition and their improvement throughout the treatment. Methods: We performed a systematic search of literature in Medline and PsychInfo for all the studies done to investigate psychological factors in relation to malnutrition in AN using the keywords ""Anorexia Nervosa"", ""depression"", ""anxiety"", ""obsessive-compulsive disorder"" and ""malnutrition"". Only articles published between 1980 and 2010 in English or French were reviewed. From the articles on AN and depression, anxiety, and/or OCD, only the ones which investigated on the relation with malnutrition were kept. This search was complemented by a manual search. We also checked the reference lists of the articles we found. Results: Seven papers were analyzed and critically reviewed for their methods and results. Results are contradictory and inconsistent at all levels of assessment. Conclusions: Evidence based data is very rare. From the 7 reviewed studies, none of them draw the same conclusion. This is mainly due to the large differences in the samples' populations and the studies' protocols. Future studies are needed to focus on the relationship between depression/ anxiety symptoms and malnutrition. A more critical nutritional assessment should be undertaken with multiple psychological assessment scales.

Risk factors for suicide attempt in an Arab kindred,"Objective: This explorative study examines correlates of suicidal behavior in an extended Arab kindred selected because of a high rate of suicidal behavior. Methods: Family members (n = 468) aged 15 through 55 were assessed using a comprehensive structured psychiatric interview, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), which covers a wide range of psychopathology, including a spectrum of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In addition, self-reported depression, anxiety, hopelessness, impulsivity and hostility, early childhood adversity, and suicidal behavior in first- and second-degree relatives were assessed. Results: Significant associations were found between suicidal thoughts and behavior, and the presence of family history of suicide, all forms of psychopathology and suicidal behaviors. In addition, impulsivity and hostility were also significantly associated with suicidality. Limitation: The absence of similar assessments in comparison families, makes it difficult to assess why this family appears to be at higher risk for suicidal behavior. Conclusion: Risk correlates of suicidal behavior in the Arab kindred are similar to those reported from other parts of the world. These findings suggest that effective means of suicide prevention used in European populations may be successfully adapted to prevent suicide in this ethnic group as well. Since all forms of suicidal behavior in this population as well as in other Arab populations are increasing rapidly (Karam et al., 2008), these results have important implications for suicide prevention as well as for the understanding of the genetics of suicide.

Risk of suicide and mixed episode in men in the postpartum period,"Objectives: To assess suicide risk in men with mood disorders at the postpartum period. Methods: We conduct a longitudinal study with 650 men whose child has born from April 2007 to May 2008 at maternity hospital. The first assessment was in the antenatal period and the second within 30 to 60 days postpartum. Suicide risk, anxiety disorders, hypomanic, manic and mixed episodes were assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Results: The prevalence of suicide risk in fathers in postpartum was of 4.8%. Fathers with postpartum depression were 20.97 (CI: 5.74; 76.53) more likely to present suicide risk and those with mixed episodes showed a chance of 46.50 (CI: 10.52; 205.53) times higher than those who did not suffer from any mood disorder. Conclusion: Mixed episodes are common in fathers at postpartum, posing a higher suicide risk than depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes. Therefore, in order to reduce the suicide risk, clinicians should address and treat adequately mixed affective states in this specific population.

Genetic association between &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphisms and phobic disorders: A case–control study among mainland Han Chinese,"Introduction: Phobic disorders are a common group of syndromes comprising persistently recurring, irrational severe anxiety of specific objects, activities, or situations with avoidance behavior of the phobic stimulus. The present study investigated the association between whole region polymorphisms, (including the Val66Met variant), in the BDNF gene and phobic disorders among Han Chinese young adults. Methods: We conducted a case–control study to investigate the genetic association between BDNF polymorphisms and phobic disorders among mainland Chinese. One hundred and twenty young adults with phobic disorders and 267 matched controls were recruited. Three tag SNPs of BDNF were successfully genotyped by using PCR-based ligase detection reaction (PCR-LDR). Results: We found significant differences in allele distributions of SNP rs10835210 ( P &lt; 0.001) between the experimental and the control groups. In the haplotype analysis based on linkage-disequilibrium across this gene locus, we demonstrated significant association between phobic disorders and BDNF haplotype CAC ( P = 0.004). Association was significant after 10⁴ permutation tests ( P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that the BDNF gene may play a significant role in the etiology of phobic disorders in the Han Chinese population.

"Age of onset, clinical characteristics, and 15-year course of anxiety disorders in a prospective, longitudinal, observational study","Background: Age of onset is rarely studied in the anxiety disorders literature. The current study examined age of onset as it relates to clinical characteristics and course of anxiety disorders using a prospective, longitudinal, observational design. Methods: Fifteen-year follow-up data were examined for participants with panic disorder with (PDA) or without (PD) agoraphobia, social phobia (SP), and/or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) at baseline. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine whether age of onset was associated with demographic or clinical variables at baseline. Cox regression analyses were conducted to examine longitudinal course (time to recurrence and recovery, respectively) for each diagnostic group. Results: At baseline, PD participants with early onset (i.e., &lt; age 20) were more likely to have comorbid MDD, GAD, and SP relative to late-onset participants (≥ age 20). For PDA, early-onset participants were less likely to be married, and more likely to have both GAD and SP at baseline. With respect to longitudinal course, earlier onset was associated with an increased likelihood of recurrence in participants with PDA. No other models reached significance. Limitations: The sample sizes for some disorders were comparatively small in relation to PDA, and all participants were treatment-seeking, which may limit generalizability. Conclusions: For some anxiety disorders, earlier age of onset appears to be associated with greater severity and worse course, as evidenced by increased risk of recurrence over 15 years of follow-up. Early interventions focused on children and adolescents may alleviate some of the public health burden associated with anxiety disorders.

"Quasi-experimental study on the effectiveness of psychoanalysis, long-term and short-term psychotherapy on psychiatric symptoms, work ability and functional capacity during a 5-year follow-up","Background: Psychotherapy is apparently an insufficient treatment for some patients with mood or anxiety disorder. In this study the effectiveness of short-term and long-term psychotherapies was compared with that of psychoanalysis. Methods: A total of 326 psychiatric outpatients with mood or anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to solution-focused therapy, short-term psychodynamic and long-term psychodynamic psychotherapies. Additionally, 41 patients suitable for psychoanalysis were included in the study. The patients were followed from the start of the treatment and assessed 9 times during a 5-year follow-up. The primary outcome measures on symptoms were the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scales, and the Symptom Check List, anxiety scale. Primary work ability and functional capacity measures were the Work Ability Index, the Work-subscale of the Social Adjustment Scale, and the Perceived Psychological Functioning Scale. Results: A reduction in psychiatric symptoms and improvement in work ability and functional capacity was noted in all treatment groups during the 5-year follow-up. The short-term therapies were more effective than psychoanalysis during the first year, whereas the long-term therapy was more effective after 3 years of follow-up. Psychoanalysis was most effective at the 5-year follow-up, which also marked the end of the psychoanalysis. Conclusions: Psychotherapy gives faster benefits than psychoanalysis, but in the long run psychoanalysis seems to be more effective. Results from trials, among patients suitable for psychoanalysis and with longer follow-up, are needed before firm conclusions about the relative effectiveness of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders can be drawn.

The prevalence and characteristics of complicated grief in older adults,"Background: Complicated grief is a prolongation of the normal grieving process with distinct characteristics. It impairs mental and physical health and can potentially greatly impact the quality of life of sufferers and their families. The prevalence and characteristics of complicated grief in the general population are currently unclear. The aims of the present study were therefore to evaluate the prevalence of complicated grief in a population-based cohort, examine the overlap between anxiety and depression and identify common bereavement-related and socio-demographic characteristics. Methods: Based within the Rotterdam Study, 5741 older adults were evaluated. Complicated grief was assessed with a 17-item Inventory of Complicated Grief. Results: Prevalence within the general population was 4.8%. Current grief was reported by 1089 participants, and of these 277 (25.4%) were diagnosed with complicated grief. Inflated anxiety and depression rates were documented in people with complicated grief, but the vast majority remained free from co-morbidity. Time since bereavement and relationship to deceased, particularly when the source was a spouse or child, were predictive of complicated grief. People with complicated grief were older, had a lower level of education, and more cognitive impairment. Conclusions: The prevalence of complicated grief in older adults in the general population was noteworthy. Several factors were predictive of complicated grief and it was demonstrated as a separate condition to anxiety and depression. These findings highlight the need for prevention, diagnosis and treatment options for older adults with complicated grief and for recognition of complicated grief as a distinct diagnosis.

Prevalence and correlates of generalized anxiety disorder among older adults in the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) occurs commonly, with widespread consequences including decreased functioning and wellbeing, and increased consumption of health resources. Notwithstanding its prevalence and impact, knowledge about GAD in older adults is still scarce. Accordingly, the main goals of this study were to estimate the prevalence and analyze the correlates of 12-month DSM-IV GAD in older community-residing adults. Methods: The sample was drawn from the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being and consisted of 3035 participants aged between 55 and 85 years, assessed by lay interviewers with the fully-structured Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: Eighty-four participants were diagnosed with GAD, equivalent to a weighted 12-month population prevalence of 2.8% (95% CI: 2.0, 3.7). In a multivariate logistic regression model older age (OR = 0.24, p = 0.006), functional limitations (OR = 1.07, p = 0.001), lifetime depression comorbidity (OR = 5.31, p &lt; 0.001), concerns about having a serious illness despite doctor's reassurance (OR = 2.29, p = 0.021), and family history of anxiety or depression (OR = 2.41, p = 0.007) were the most significant predictors of 12-month GAD in older adults. Limitations: This was a cross sectional study, limiting causal inferences. Conclusions: In community-residing older adults GAD is highly prevalent and strongly associated with functional limitations, psychiatric comorbidity and increased medication intake. These findings suggest the need for greater clinical awareness of GAD among older adults.

An examination of the structure of posttraumatic stress disorder in relation to the anxiety and depressive disorders,"The nature and structure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been the subject of much interest in recent times. This research has been represented by two streams, the first representing a substantive body of work which focuses specifically on the factor structure of PTSD and the second exploring PTSD's relationship with other mood and anxiety disorders. The present study attempted to bring these two streams together by examining structural models of PTSD and their relationship with dimensions underlying other mood and anxiety disorders. PTSD, anxiety and mood disorder data from 989 injury survivors interviewed 3-months following their injury were analyzed using a series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) to identify the optimal structural model. CFA analyses indicated that the best fitting model included PTSD's re-experiencing (B1–5), active avoidance (C1–2), and hypervigilance and startle (D4–5) loading onto a Fear factor (represented by panic disorder, agoraphobia and social phobia) and the PTSD dysphoria symptoms (numbing symptoms C3–7 and hyperarousal symptoms D1–3) loading onto an Anxious Misery/Distress factor (represented by depression, generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder). The findings have implications for informing potential revisions to the structure of the diagnosis of PTSD and the diagnostic algorithm to be applied, with the aim of enhancing diagnostic specificity.

Anxiety and depression symptoms in women and men from early pregnancy to 3-months postpartum: Parity differences and effects,"This study aimed to investigate both anxiety and depression symptoms from early pregnancy to 3-months postpartum, comparing women and men and first and second-time parents. Methods: A sample of 260 Portuguese couples ( N = 520), first or second-time parents, recruited in an Obstetrics Out-patients Unit, filled in the State-Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) and the Edinburgh Post-Natal Depression Scale (EPDS) at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd pregnancy trimesters, childbirth, and 3-months postpartum. Results: A decrease in anxiety and depression symptoms from early pregnancy to 3-months postpartum was found in both women and men, as well as in first and second-time parents. Men presented less anxiety and depression symptoms than women, but the same pattern of symptoms over time. Second-time parents showed more anxiety and depression symptoms than first-time parents and a different pattern of symptoms over time: an increase in anxiety and depression symptoms from the 3rd trimester to childbirth was observed in first-time parents versus a decrease in second-time parents. Limitations: The voluntary nature of the participation may have lead to a selection bias; women and men who agreed to participate could be those who presented fewer anxiety and depression symptoms. Moreover, the use of self-report symptom measures does not give us the level of possible disorder in participants. Conclusions: Anxiety and depression symptoms diminish from pregnancy to the postpartum period in all parents. Patterns of anxiety and depression symptoms from early pregnancy to 3-months postpartum are similar in women and men, but somewhat different in first and second-time parents. Second-time parents should also be considered while studying and intervening during pregnancy and the postpartum.

Costs of depression in Catalonia (Spain),"Objective: To estimate the cost of depression for the adult population in Catalonia (Spain) for 2006. Method: The total adult population of Catalonia for the reference year was close to 6 million. A cross-design synthesis study was conducted, combining “top-down” and “bottom-up” data from secondary data sources, as well as expert opinion (nominal groups). A societal perspective was adopted. Estimates included direct health costs (hospital, primary, specialised and pharmacological care) and the indirect costs derived from the productivity lost due to morbidity and mortality. Sensitivity analyses were carried out for primary and specialised care resource utilisation. A Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to handle the uncertainty of the unit costs of primary care, specialised care and hospital visits. Results: The total annual cost of depression in Catalonia for 2006 was 735.4 million Euros. Of this figure, 21.2% corresponded to direct costs, including 41 million Euros in primary care (5.6%), 8.1 million Euros in mental health specialised care (1.1%), 5.6 million Euros due to hospitalisation (0.8%) and 101.1 million Euros due to pharmacological care (13.7%); and 78.8% to indirect costs due to productivity loss. 3.7 million work days were lost to temporary disability for depression with a cost of 199.6 million Euros (27.1%), and 353.3 million Euros due to permanent disability (48%). Mortality attributed to suicide accounted for 26.9 million Euros (3.7%). The average annual cost of an adult with depression was close to 1800 Euros. Limitations: The heterogeneity of the data sources, the uncertainty in several estimates (i.e. proportion of psychotropic expenditure attributed to the treatment of depression, suicide rate attributed to depression), and the difficulty in disaggregating anxiety and depressive disorders in a number of databases are study limitations. Conclusions: The burden of depression for the Catalan public health system and society as a whole due to the consumption of resources and, more importantly, the loss of productivity is significant. Inefficiencies may be found in the overuse of pharmaceuticals and in the eligibility criteria of disability for work.

The effects of continuous antidepressant treatment during the first 6 months on relapse or recurrence of depression,"Background: To examine whether continuous antidepressant treatment during the first 6 month reduces the risk of relapse/recurrence of depression in South Korea. Methods: We used National Health Insurance Data covering the period from 2001 through 2004. The study population consisted of 117,087 adult patients who received antidepressants after being diagnosed with depression. The continuous antidepressant was defined as evidence of antidepressant prescriptions for 75% of the first 6 months of treatment. Relapse or recurrence during the next 18-month period was defined by evidence of a new episode requiring antidepressant treatment, psychiatric hospitalization, electroconvulsive therapy, emergency department visit or attempted suicide. We compared the relapse/recurrence rate during the 18-month follow-up period in patients receiving continuous treatment and those who discontinued early using a Cox's proportional hazard model. Results: Patients receiving continuous antidepressant treatment experienced a lower risk of relapse/recurrence (Hazard ratio: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.40–0.44). Three or more follow-up visits in the first 3 months also reduced the risk of relapse/recurrence. Factors associated with a significant increase of relapse/recurrence were comorbid medical illness, anxiety disorder, and alcohol abuse. The small benefit of SSRIs was appeared only in the early discontinued treatment subgroup, not in the continuous treatment subgroup. Limitations: We were not able to consider the antidepressant utilization pattern. Conclusions: Continuous antidepressant treatment and frequent follow-up visits during the acute phase were associated with a significant reduction in the likelihood of relapse or recurrence of depression. Our results provide important evidence on the effectiveness of antidepressant treatment in South Korea.

Factors associated with depression in Parkinson's disease,"Background: Depression is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and contributes significantly to a reduced quality of life in PD patients. The determinants of depression in PD are complex and poorly understood. We investigated the factors associated with depression in PD. Methods: PD patients were recruited from Neurology clinics. A validated method was used to screen for a lifetime history of depression. ‘Depressed’ patients were identified by a score of &gt; 6 in the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) or by having had prescribed treatment for depression. ‘Never depressed’ patients were recognised by a score of &lt; 5 in the GDS-15 with no signs of a history of depression. A newly developed and validated questionnaire was used to collect other information. Results: Depression was identified in 66% of the 639 PD patients who met the inclusion criteria. Depression was associated with an increased severity of illness as evidenced by higher Unified PD Rating Scale scores and a higher Hoehn and Yahr stage. Other clinical factors associated with disease severity were also more frequently observed in depressed patients. Similar to findings in non-PD samples, depressed PD patients were more likely to have a lower education level, a history of smoking and to regularly use non-aspirin based NSAIDs or analgesics. Comorbidities such as anxiety, memory problems, hallucinations, sleep disturbances and postural hypotension were more common in depressed PD patients. Limitations: To avoid patient exhaustion of over-surveying, some factors within the psychological domain were not examined. Conclusion: Our results provide a focus for future intervention strategies.

"Susceptibility genes, social environmental risk factors and their interactions in internalizing disorders among mainland Chinese undergraduates","Background: Analyses of large scale psychiatric epidemiology surveys suggest that common mental disorders can be generalized into two underlying dimensions, internalizing disorders (e.g. depression, and anxiety) and externalizing disorders (e.g. addictions). The present study explores the interactions among the genes (SLC6A4, BDNF, and MAOA) and selected environment factors (G×E), and gene×gene (G×G) interactions for internalizing disorders in the sample of Chinese university students. Methods: This is a genetic case control study. 259 undergraduates affected with internalizing disorders and 269 healthy controls were included. Multiple logistic regression was used to explore the potential environmental risk factors. G×E interactions were analyzed using the method developed by Mukherjee et al. (2008). Analyses of G×G interactions were conducted by generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) (Lou et al., 2007). We have previously reported on the polymorphism information for ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on SLC6A4, BDNF, and MAOA genes (Meng et al., 2009; Meng, 2010). Results: We found that an offspring's reported parents' negative mood, subject's unwillingness to express emotion, being an only child, having an unfulfilling relationship with his/her mother, and increased activity and behavior restrictions by his/her father were social environment risk factors for internalizing disorders. No statistically significant interactions were found in the G×E analyses. G×G analyses found that subjects with mutational alleles concurrently on rs10835210 and rs2030324 (BDNF gene) were significantly likely to develop internalizing disorders. Those with one mutated allele on either SNPs were 1.761 times, and those with both mutated alleles were 3.353 times, more likely to develop internalizing disorders. Conclusion: A negative family emotional environment was found to be associated with internalizing disorders. BDNF gene variants were also found to be similarly associated. Using conservative statistical analyses we did not find any G×E interactions.

Using the Distress Thermometer and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to screen for psychosocial morbidity in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer,"Background: The Distress Thermometer (DT) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) are commonly used within oncology settings. However there is a paucity of research comparing these measures to gold standard structured clinical interviews assessing for clinical disorders. The aim of this study is to establish the sensitivity, specificity and optimal cut-off scores on these measures when compared to a clinical interview. Method: Ninety-nine patients with colorectal cancer completed the DT and HADS and a psychologist-administered gold standard structured clinical interview (the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-CIDI). Receiver Operator Characteristic analyses (ROC) were conducted to establish the optimal cut-off score on the DT and HADS to identify clinical disorders based on the CIDI. Results: Seventeen patients met criteria for a clinical disorder in the sample. A cut-off score of 4 on the DT indicated acceptable sensitivity (60%) and specificity (67%) to detect a current clinical disorder,while the optimal cut-off for the HADS was 10 (sensitivity = 73%, specificity = 72%). The area under the ROC values were 0.66 for the DT (95% CI: 0.51, 0.82) and 0.78 for the HADS (95% CI: 0.67, 0.90). The difference in AUC between the two measures was not statistically significant. Limitations: The limitations to the design and methodology of the study are discussed. Conclusion: The single item DT performed fairly, however not as well as the longer HADS in identifying clinical disorders amongst oncology patients, particularly anxiety disorders.

"Confirmation of the factorial structure of temperamental autoquestionnaire TEMPS-A in non-clinical young adults and relation to current state of anxiety, depression and to schizotypal traits","Background: The 39-item TEMPS-A self-rated questionnaire assesses affective temperaments. We examined the factorial structure of its French version in a large sample of young adults and examined the relation to schizotypy, depression and anxiety. Method: University students were enrolled during their mandatory preventive health visit in the University medical facility (n = 3807, 19.9 ± .5 y.o.). They answered to the 39-TEMPS-A questionnaire, the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). We performed an exploratory Factorial Component Analysis (FCA) with varimax rotation of the 39-TEMPS-A in half of the sample, randomly selected, followed by a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) in the remaining subsample. TEMPS-A dimensions were correlated to HADS and SPQ sub-scores. Results: A five-factor structure was found by PCA and confirmed by the confirmatory analysis. The scale showed a good internal consistency (whole scale Cronbach's α: 0.83 and from 0.78 to 0.59 for Cyclothymic, Depressive, Irritable , Hyperthymic, Anxious subscales ). Depressive and Anxious TEMPS-A subscales were moderately correlated to HADS Depression and Anxiety subscales (Spearman ρ = 0.37 to 0.33). Cyclothymic and Depressive TEMPS-A subscales were respectively correlated to SPQ Paranoid (ρ= 0.53) and Negative dimensions (ρ = 0.52). Limitation: Representativity of the sample (higher education, response rate). Conclusion: We confirmed the five factor structure of the 39-item TEMPS-A in a large nonclinical population of young adults and found consistent correlations with anxiety—depression state markers and schizotypal traits.

Generalized anxiety disorder: Course and risk factors in pregnancy,"Background: There are limited studies of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) across pregnancy. Methods: Women (n = 2793) were enrolled in the Yale Pink and Blue study, a cohort enriched with subjects who suffered from major depressive disorder (MDD) within the past five years or used antidepressants in the past year. Subjects were evaluated with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview at three time points: twice in pregnancy and once after delivery. We defined a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) episode as per DSM IV but with required duration reduced to one month or longer. Course and correlates of GAD were examined in women who had: 1) no GAD during the 6 months prior or in pregnancy (Group A), 2) GAD in the 6 months prior to but not in pregnancy (Group B), 3) GAD in pregnancy only (Group C) and 4) GAD both in the 6 months prior to and during pregnancy (Group D). Results: 9.5% of the cohort suffered from GAD at some point in pregnancy. Anxiety symptoms were highest in the first trimester and decreased across pregnancy. Regression analysis revealed that previous GAD episodes, education, social support and a history of child abuse distinguished between membership in the four groups. Limitations: The sample may not be representational, as it was enhanced with those at risk, and had relatively low representation of socio-economically disadvantaged women. Conclusions: Identification of anxious patients during pregnancy may provide an opportunity to engage those in need of psychiatric treatment.

The association between depressive and anxiety symptoms and bone mineral density in the general population: The HUNT Study,"Background: Psychiatric disorders may be risk factors for reduced bone mineral density (BMD). Longitudinal evidence is limited and this is yet to be examined among community-dwelling adults with anxiety. We aimed to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between anxiety and depressive symptoms and BMD. Method: This study examined data from the second Nord-Trondelag Health Study (1995–1997; 1194 men and 7842 women) and a follow-up conducted in 2001 (697 men and 2751 women). Symptomatology was ascertained using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and BMD was measured at the forearm using single-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Information on medication use and lifestyle was self-reported, and these, together with anthropometric measures were tested in multivariate analyses. Results: In men, adjusted BMD was 2.6% lower at the ultradistal forearm for those with depressive symptoms and 2.6% lower at the ultradistal and 2.0% lower at the distal forearm for those with anxiety symptoms. In women, adjusted BMD at the distal and ultradistal forearm was lower for heavier women with depressive symptoms but this relationship diminished with decreasing weight. Forearm BMD was similar for women with or without anxiety symptoms. Longitudinally, neither depressive nor anxiety symptoms were associated with bone loss over 4.6 years. Limitations: Findings cannot be generalised to other skeletal sites and a longer follow-up period may be necessary to detect differences in bone loss. Conclusions: These results indicate that depressive and anxiety symptoms are cross-sectionally associated with reduced BMD. These findings provide further evidence to support monitoring BMD in individuals diagnosed with psychiatric illness.

Relative impact of Axis I mental disorders on quality of life among adults in the community,"Background: Little is known about the relative impact of different mental disorders on adult quality of life (QOL). This study estimated associations between several mental disorders and QOL in a representative American community sample. Methods: The QOL instrument was administered to 640 adult participants in the Children in the Community Study, a population-based longitudinal study. DSM-Axis I and Axis II mental disorder diagnoses were assessed by psychiatric interview. Results: Poorer QOL was strongly associated with having a mood disorder, especially major depression disorder (MDD) (effect size, ES = −0.57, p &lt; 0.01), whereas poorer quality social relationships were associated with having dysthymia and bipolar disorders (ES = −0.92, p &lt; 0.01; ES = −0.80, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Most anxiety disorders were not independently related to QOL with the exception of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which was significantly related to poorer physical health (ES = −0.78, p &lt; 0.01) and psychological well-being (ES = −0.73, p &lt; 0.01) and to less overall QOL (ES = −0.57, p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: MDD and PTSD are independently related to impaired QOL and dysthymia and bipolar disorder negatively influence social relationships.

Cortical mechanisms of the symptomatology in major depressive disorder: A resting EEG study,"Background: Diagnosis and treatment rely on symptom criteria in modern psychiatry. However, the cortical mechanisms of symptomatology in major depressive disorder (MDD) are still not clear. This study examined neural correlates of symptom clusters of MDD by electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Resting state eye-closed EEG signals were recorded in 196 depressive patients. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) of regional power, coherence and power series correlation across delta, theta, alpha and beta frequencies were used to correlate with overall depression severity evaluated by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Further, statistical comparisons between patients with high vs. low qEEG indices (median-split) were undertaken regarding symptom severity of core depression, sleep , activity , psychic anxiety , somatic anxiety , and delusion . Results: None of the qEEG indices significantly correlated with overall depression severity or differentiated symptom severity of core depression , sleep , activity and psychic anxiety . A higher symptom severity of somatic anxiety was associated with higher regional power over widespread cortical regions and lower strengths at bi-temporal, temporo-parietal and fronto-parietal connections. A higher symptom severity of delusion was associated with higher regional power in the frontal and temporal regions, and lower strengths at inter-hemispheric (frontal, temporal and parietal) and fronto–temporo-parietal connections. Limitations: Our EEG recording with sampling rate of 128 Hz and 20 electrodes may provide restricted spatial and temporal precision. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cortical mechanisms play important roles in the symptom manifestation of cognitive distortion (sub-score of delusion ) and somatic anxiety in MDD. Our findings further imply that psychic anxiety and somatic anxiety are distinct entities.

Comorbidity and risk indicators for alcohol use disorders among persons with anxiety and/or depressive disorders: Findings from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA),"Introduction: This study examines comorbidity of alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence as well as its risk indicators among anxious and/or depressed persons, also considering temporal sequencing of disorders. Methods: Baseline data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) were used, including 2329 persons with lifetime DSM-IV anxiety (social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and agoraphobia) and/or depressive (major depressive disorder and dysthymia) disorders and 652 controls. Lifetime diagnoses of DSM-IV alcohol abuse and dependence were established, as well as information about socio-demographic, vulnerability, addiction-related and anxiety/depression-related characteristics. Temporal sequencing of disorders was established retrospectively, using age of onset. Results: Of persons with combined anxiety/depression 20.3% showed alcohol dependence versus 5.5% of controls. Prevalence of alcohol abuse was similar across groups (± 12%). Independent risk indicators for alcohol dependence among anxious and/or depressed persons were male gender, vulnerability factors (family history of alcohol dependence, family history of anxiety/depression, openness to experience, low conscientiousness, being single, and childhood trauma), addiction-related factors (smoking and illicit drug use) and early anxiety/depression onset. Persons with secondary alcohol dependence were more neurotic, more often single and lonelier, while persons with primary alcohol dependence were more often male and more extravert. Discussion: Alcohol dependence, but not abuse, is more prevalent in anxious and/or depressed persons. Persons with comorbid alcohol dependence constitute a distinct subgroup of anxious and/or depressed persons, characterized by addiction-related habits and vulnerability. However, considerable variation in characteristics exists depending on temporal sequencing of disorders. This knowledge may improve identification and treatment of those anxious and/or depressed patients who are additionally suffering from alcohol dependence.

Chronic posttraumatic stress and its predictors in patients living with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator,"Introduction: Patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) show clinically relevant depression and anxiety, but little is known about their levels of posttraumatic stress. We assessed chronic posttraumatic stress attributable to a traumatic cardiac event and its predictors in patients at two time points after ICD placement. Methods: We investigated 107 consecutively enrolled patients (57 ± 14 years, 62% men) on average 24 ± 21 months after ICD placement (baseline) and again 41 ± 18 months later (follow-up). All patients completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) to self-rate the severity of posttraumatic stress (range 0–110). The 30% of patients with the highest IES-R scores (≥25) at baseline were defined as PTSD cases; the same threshold was applied to define PTSD caseness at follow-up. Results: Posttraumatic stress increased from baseline to follow-up (19 ± 22 vs. 25 ± 19, p &lt; 0.001); 19% of patients had PTSD at both assessments, 12% at baseline only, and 18% at follow-up only. Female gender as well as greater peritraumatic dissociation and depression predicted greater posttraumatic stress at baseline ( p -values ≤ 0.041). Greater baseline posttraumatic stress, helplessness, alexithymia, and ≥ 5 shocks during follow-up all predicted greater posttraumatic stress at follow-up ( p -values ≤ 0.029). Female gender, helplessness, and depression predicted PTSD at baseline ( p -values ≤ 0.022); low education and posttraumatic stress at baseline predicted PTSD at follow-up ( p -values ≤ 0.003). Conclusions: Between 2 and 5.5 years post-ICD placement chronic posttraumatic stress slightly increased and nearly one-fifth of patients had newly developed PTSD. The identified psychological predictors of long-term chronicity of posttraumatic stress might particularly inform behavioral interventions for ICD recipients.

Pregnancy and post-partum depression and anxiety in a longitudinal general population cohort: The effect of eating disorders and past depression,"Background: This study investigated the effect of past depression, past and current eating disorders (ED) on perinatal anxiety and depression in a large general population cohort of pregnant women, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Methods: Anxiety and depression were measured during and after pregnancy in 10,887 women using the Crown-Crisp Experiential Inventory and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Women were grouped according to depression and ED history: past ED with ( n = 123) and without past depression ( n = 50), pregnancy ED symptoms with ( n = 77) and without past depression ( n = 159), past depression only ( n = 818) and controls ( n = 9,660). We compared the course of depression and anxiety with linear mixed-effect regression models; and probable depressive and anxiety disorders using logistic regression. Results: Women with both past depression and past/current ED had high anxiety and depression across time perinatally; this was most marked in the group with pregnancy ED symptoms and past depression ( b coefficient:5.1 (95% CI: 4.1–6.1), p &lt; 0.0001), especially at 8 months post-partum. At 18 weeks in pregnancy all women (apart from those with past ED only) had a higher risk for a probable depressive and anxiety disorder compared to controls. At 8 months post-partum pregnancy ED symptoms and/or past depression conferred the highest risk for a probable depressive and anxiety disorder. Limitations: Data were based on self-report. There was some selective attrition. Conclusions: Pregnancy ED symptoms and past depression have an additive effect in increasing the risk for depression and anxiety perinatally. Screening at risk women for anxiety and depression in the perinatal period might be beneficial.

Impact of temperament on depression and anxiety symptoms and depressive disorder in a population-based birth cohort,"Background: The aim of this study was to characterize at the population level how innate features of temperament relate to experience of depressive mood and anxiety, and whether these symptoms have separable temperamental backgrounds. Methods: The study subjects were 4773 members of the population-based Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966, a culturally and genetically homogeneous study sample. Temperament was measured at age 31 using the temperament items of the Temperament and Character Inventory and a separate Pessimism score. Depressive mood was assessed based on a previous diagnosis of depressive disorder or symptoms of depression according to the Hopkins Symptom Check List–25. Anxiety was assessed analogously. Results: High levels of Harm avoidance and Pessimism were related to both depressive mood (effect sizes; d = 0.84 and d = 1.25, respectively) and depressive disorder ( d = 0.68 and d = 0.68, respectively). Of the dimensions of Harm avoidance, Anticipatory worry and Fatigability had the strongest effects. Symptoms of depression and anxiety showed very similar underlying temperament patterns. Limitations: Although Harm avoidance and Pessimism appear to be important endophenotype candidates for depression and anxiety, their potential usefulness as endophenotypes, and whether they meet all the suggested criteria for endophenotypes will remain to be confirmed in future studies. Conclusions: Personality characteristics of Pessimism and Harm avoidance, in particular its dimensions Anticipatory worry and Fatigability, are strongly related to symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as to depressive disorder in this population. These temperamental features may be used as dimensional susceptibility factors in etiological studies of depression, which may aid in the development of improved clinical practice.

Objective physical functioning in patients with depressive and/or anxiety disorders,"Background: Poorer physical function in patients with depressive or anxiety disorders has been reported, but is often measured by self-reports which may be biased by mood. This study examined the association between depression and anxiety and physical function using objective measures in a large cohort, and investigated which psychiatric characteristics are associated with physical function. Methods: Baseline data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used, including persons with current depressive and/or anxiety disorders ( n = 1629) and healthy controls without lifetime diagnoses ( n = 629). Psychiatric characteristics studied included type of disorder, duration, severity, age of onset, and antidepressant use. Hand grip strength and lung function were used as general objective measurements of physical function. Results: Women with depressive or anxiety disorders had significantly poorer physical function—both lower grip strength and lung function—compared to healthy controls, especially those with a late age of onset (≥40 years). Poorer lung function was present among the women using antidepressants, those with higher symptom severity, and those with depression compared to anxiety disorder. In men, depressive or anxiety disorder was associated with better lung function but not with hand grip strength. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional design no causal relationships could be established. Conclusions: In women, depressive or anxiety disorders were associated with objective indicators of poorer physical function. Since this association was most pronounced for later onset disorders, it suggests a larger role of physical function in depressive and anxiety disorders at later age.

Explosive anger in postconflict Timor Leste: Interaction of socio-economic disadvantage and past human rights-related trauma,"Background: Countries emerging from major conflict commonly experience recurrent periods of communal instability. A psychosocial theory, Adaptation and Development after Persecution and Trauma (ADAPT), suggests that experiences of past human rights abuses interact with socio-economic disadvantage in the postconflict period to generate or maintain explosive forms of anger. Previous research has supported a link between trauma exposure and anger but the role of ongoing socio-economic disadvantage requires further clarification. Methods: The present study examined a structural equation model based on cross-sectional epidemiological data (n = 1245) collected in post-conflict Timor Leste in 2004. The model included four trauma dimensions derived from a prior factor analysis; a latent variable of postconflict distress symptoms (derived from measures of PTSD and depression/anxiety); an index of socio-economic distress; and an indigenously-based measure of explosive anger. Results: The final model yielded a good fit (chi-square = 26.59 df = 20 p = 0.15 CFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.016). Postconflict distress symptoms mediated the associations of trauma dimensions and socio-economic disadvantage with anger. Trauma dimensions associated with human rights violations and witnessing murder were partly mediated by ongoing socio-economic disadvantage in the path to postconflict distress and anger. Limitations: Longitudinal studies will be needed to confirm the chronological sequencing of these relationships. Conclusions: The study offers empirical support for a link between past trauma related to human rights violations and ongoing socio-economic disadvantage in the path to distress and anger.

Disability is already pronounced in young people with early stages of affective disorders: Data from an early intervention service,"Background: Although there is growing recognition that disability emerges early in the course of psychotic disorders, it is unclear whether young people with early stages of anxiety or affective disorders are similarly affected. This study examined patient self-reported disability in young people attending a designated early intervention service. Methods: Cross-sectional study comparing new headspace patients on self-reported measures of disability and distress (Kessler-10, Work and Social Adjustment Scale, and Brief Disability Questionnaire) with clinician-rated diagnosis and clinical stage. Results: Data from 330 participants with an average age of 16.8 years (50.0% male) was analysed and demonstrated high levels of psychological distress and disability in the overall group. Higher levels of self-reported psychological distress and disability were associated with affective disorder diagnosis and increased with advancing clinical stage. Female gender and younger age also predicted affective disorder diagnosis. Limitations: Clinician-rated participant disability was obtained via a single global measure (SOFAS) and not a systematic assessment. Additionally, data collected was cross-sectional and collected at intake only. Longitudinal assessment of clinical features and disability is required to map changes in disability over time. Conclusions: Surprisingly high levels of psychological distress and disability are apparent in young people presenting to early intervention services. Data suggests that distress and disability in those with anxiety is less than for affective disorder. Results also suggest that clinical staging approaches capture the increasing disability associated with illness progression. The obtained results highlight the need for interventions that specifically target disability, rather than just symptoms of mental health problems.

Glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) and self reported depression: An association study from the HUNT,"Background: There is increasing evidence suggesting oxidative stress may play a role in the aetiology of depression. Glutathione is the brain's predominant free radical scavenger, and associated polymorphisms of the glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) gene have been reported for related psychiatric disorders. The aim of the study was to investigate candidate polymorphisms of GCL validated in schizophrenia and their association with current state depression, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Methods: Polymorphisms were genotyped on 983 cases and 967 controls selected from a population sample of adults participating in the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study. Cases were the top scoring individuals (98.5th percentile) on the HADS depression subscale while the controls were randomly selected from below this cut-off. The polymorphisms comprised three SNPs from GCLM, the gene encoding the GCL modifier and 9 SNPs plus a trinucleotide repeat (TNTR) from intron 1 and the 5′UTR of GCLC, the gene encoding the GCL catalytic subunit. Using the linkage disequilibrium between the GCLC markers we also tested whether SNPs could represent the variation of the TNTR. Results: The candidate polymorphisms showed no evidence for association with depression. The C allele of SNP rs9474592 is coupled with the 9 GAG repeats allele of the TNTR, r²=0.81. None of the other SNPs either individually or as two or three-SNP haplotypes was associated with the TNTR alleles. Limitations: Depression was self-reported and measured at one time point. Conclusions: This study provides no evidence to suggest that polymorphisms of GCL are associated with self-reported depression.

The distressed (type D) personality in both patients and partners enhances the risk of emotional distress in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator,"Background: A subgroup of patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) experiences emotional distress. This may be related to partner factors. We examined the impact of the personality of the partner (i.e., the distressed (Type D) personality) in combination with that of the patient on anxiety and depression levels in ICD patients. Methods: Consecutively implanted ICD patients (N=281; 80.1% men; mean age=58.3±11.0) and their partners (N=281; 20.6% men; mean age=56.5±11.7) completed the Type D Scale at baseline; patients also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at baseline and 6 months post-implantation. Results: ANOVA for repeated measures, using the Type D main effects and the interaction effect, showed that the interaction time by Type D patient by Type D partner was significant (F (1,277) =7.0, p=.009) for depression as outcome, but not for anxiety (F (1,277) =3.1, p=.08). Post-hoc comparisons revealed that Type D patients with a Type D partner (n=23/281, 8.2%) experienced the highest depression levels compared to other personality combinations (all ps&lt;.05). Limitations: The group of Type D patients with a Type D partner was rather small. Conclusions: ICD patients with a Type D personality report more depressive symptoms, but not anxiety, if the partner also has a Type D personality. This may be due to poor communication and lack of emotional support in the relationship. These results emphasize the importance of taking into account the psychological profile of the partner in the management and care of the ICD patient, and to direct behavioural support not only at the ICD patient but also at the partner.

"Prevalence of distress, comorbid conditions and well being in the general population","Background: The purposes of this paper are to determine the prevalence of distress in the community, to identify its determinants and to assess its relationship to somatic conditions and subjective well being. Methods: Distress and associated factors were investigated in a random sample of 5000 participants (35–74 years) of a community-based, prospective, observational cohort study in western Mid-Germany (""Gutenberg Heart Study"") between 04/2007 and 10/2008. The sample was stratified 1:1 for gender and residence and in equal strata for decades of age. Data were assessed by self-report instruments, interviews and medical examination. Results: We found a prevalence rate for depression of 7.2% (6.5–8.0%), social anxiety 7.0% (6.3–7.7%), panic 4.6% (4.0–5.2%), generalized anxiety 3.4% (2.9–3.9%), and Type D personality 22.1% (21.0–23.2%). Mental conditions declined by age. Depression was related to diabetes (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.26–3.15), dyslipidemia (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.02–1.79), coronary heart disease (CHD; OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.04–3.39), and the history of stroke (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.02–5.76). Panic was related to the history of myocardial infarction (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.15–5.25), and generalized anxiety to obesity (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.11–2.44). Mental distress was unrelated to hypertension, atrial fibrillation and cancer. In ordinal logistic regression subjective physical and mental well being were associated with anxiety, depression and Type D personality. Conclusions: While mental conditions are highly prevalent, especially depression is associated with several somatic conditions. Mental and physical well being are strongly related to mental conditions. Future work should take into account comorbid conditions when identifying the impact of depression on CHD.

Mental health outcome of long-term and episodic adolescent depression: 15-year follow-up of a community sample,"Background: Recent studies have highlighted the unfavourable natural course of chronic/long-term depression. We investigated the adult mental health outcome of adolescent depression, with specific focus on long-term and episodic adolescent major depression (MD). Methods: A community sample of depressed adolescents and non-depressed peers was followed-up with a structured diagnostic interview after 15 years. The participants (n = 382) were divided into five groups depending on their status in adolescence: no depression (n = 155); long-term MD (n = 91); episodic MD (n = 63); dysthymia (n = 33); and subthreshold symptoms (n = 40). Outcomes (age 19–31) included mood disorders, other mental disorders, suicidality, and treatment for mental disorders. Results: The long-term group overall had a poorer outcome than the non-depressed group, with the episodic group in an intermediate position. The outcome of the dysthymic group was similar to that of the long-term group, while the subsyndromal group did not differ markedly from the non-depressed group. The long-term group was more likely than the episodic group to report adult anxiety disorders, multiple mental disorders, suicide attempts, and treatment; they also seemed to develop more persistent adult depressions, with a higher number of recurrent episodes and longer duration of antidepressant treatment. Even after adjustment for adolescent factors of clinical and etiological importance, the long-term group had a markedly less favourable outcome than the episodic group. Limitation: The participation rate at follow-up was 64.6%. Conclusion: Longstanding depression in adolescence is a powerful predictor of continued mental health problems in adulthood. It is now important to evaluate if early interventions can alter this severe course.

"Towards parenthood: An antenatal intervention to reduce depression, anxiety and parenting difficulties","Background: There have been few antenatal interventions aimed at preparing women for the transition to parenthood and previous attempts to intervene antenatally to prevent postnatal depression and anxiety have had limited impact. Methods: We evaluated the effectiveness of an antenatal intervention which targeted risk factors for poor postnatal adjustment, with the dual aim of reducing both postnatal symptoms of depression/anxiety and parenting difficulties (a nine-unit self-guided workbook with weekly telephone support). Based on an initial feasibility study ( n = 200) which confirmed a low level of help-seeking among distressed women during pregnancy, an additional community networking component was developed aimed at increasing social support and access to health professionals to facilitate treatment of current antenatal depression/anxiety, if present. In the evaluation of a second version of the intervention, pregnant women ( n = 143) were randomly allocated to receive either the intervention or routine care. Results: Following the antenatal intervention there were significantly fewer cases scoring above threshold for mild-to-severe depression/anxiety symptoms postnatally compared to routine care, along with a trend towards reduced parenting stress. The community networking component appeared helpful and women with higher baseline depression scores showed higher levels of help-seeking in both intervention and routine care groups. Limitations: It was not possible to evaluate the efficacy of individual program components separately. Conclusions: The findings provide support for the effectiveness of the Towards Parenthood intervention both as a preparation for parenthood program and in reducing symptoms of postnatal depression/anxiety.

Prevalence of episodes of mania and hypomania and associated comorbidities among young adults,"Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of episodes of mania and hypomania, as well as associated factors and comorbidities among adults 18 to 24 years old in the city of Pelotas, Brazil. Method: This is a cross-sectional population-based study. The sample was selected through conglomerates, and episodes of mania and hypomania were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric. Results: The sample consisted of 1560 subjects. The lifetime prevalence of manic and hypomanic episodes was 7.5% and 5.3%, respectively. Subjects with (hypo)manic episodes had a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders, substance abuse and suicidality. Limitation: The high rate of (hypo)mania may to some extent reflect diagnostic error. Conclusion: Such high prevalence of (hypo)mania may nonetheless be valid as it was associated with corresponding rates of comorbidity and suicidality.

High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as an augmenting strategy in severe treatment-resistant major depression: A prospective 4-week naturalistic trial,"Background: Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have found repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to be effective for major depression, but its usefulness as an augmenting strategy for severe treatment-resistant depression (TRD) has yet to be firmly established. Methods: In a naturalistic trial, 15 chronically depressed, severely treatment-resistant patients were treated with daily high frequency (HF) rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 4 weeks as an augmenting strategy. Depressive and anxious symptoms (both subjective and objective), as well as quality of life (QOL) domains were measured pre-post rTMS treatment. Results: Pre-post rTMS comparisons revealed significant reductions of both clinician-rated and selfreport depression and anxiety measures and increases in three (out of five) domains of subjective QOL (i.e., global, physical, and psychological). Limitations: Small sample size and non-controlled design. Conclusions: Our results suggest that HF rTMS, when used as an augmenting strategy, positively affects depressive and anxious symptoms as well as QOL in patients with severe TRD. However, further studies with larger samples and controlled designs are needed to better clarify our preliminary findings.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy vs cognitive behaviour therapy as a treatment for non-melancholic depression,"Aim: To examine the comparative effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) as treatments for non-melancholic depression. Method: Participants who met criteria for a current episode of major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to either an 8-week MBCT (n = 19) or CBT (n = 26) group therapy condition. They were assessed at pre-treatment, 8-week post-group, and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Results: There were significant improvements in pre- to post-group depression and anxiety scores in both treatment conditions and no significant differences between the two treatment conditions. However, significant differences were found when participants in the two treatment conditions were dichotomized into those with a history of four or more episodes of depression vs those with less than four. In the CBT condition, participants with four or more previous episodes of depression demonstrated greater improvements in depression than those with less than four previous episodes. No such differences were found in the MBCT treatment condition. No significant differences in depression or anxiety were found between the two treatment conditions at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Limitations: Small sample sizes in each treatment condition, especially at follow-up. Conclusions: MBCT appears to be as effective as CBT in the treatment of current depression. However, CBT participants with four or more previous episodes of depression derived greater benefits at 8-week post-treatment than those with less than four episodes.

The relationship between physical conditions and suicidal behavior among those with mood disorders,"Background: There has recently been increased interest in the relationship between physical illness, mental illness, and suicide. The present study utilizes a large community-based sample to investigate the association between certain physical conditions and suicidal behavior, among those with a history of a mood disorder. Methods: Data came from the nationally representative German Health Survey (N = 4181, age 18–65). Physical conditions were assessed by a general practice physician. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Among those with a lifetime mood disorders, suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were assessed by self-report. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between physical conditions and suicidal behavior among those with a history of mood disorder. Results: Anxiety and substance use disorders were significantly positively associated with suicidal behavior [OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.13–2.31 and 2.01, 95% 1.34–3.00, respectively]. After adjusting for anxiety and substance use disorders as well as sociodemographic variables, respiratory illness, hypertension, and number of physical disorders were significantly associated with suicidal behavior [AORs 1.72, 1.68, and 1.16, respectively]. Limitations: The findings of this study are limited to adults with a history of a mood disorder. Personality disorders were not assessed. Conclusion: The present study suggests that among people with mood disorder, respiratory illnesses, hypertension, and number of physical conditions are associated with suicidal behavior independent of the effects of comorbid mental illness. Clinicians should recognize the contributing risk of physical health problems to suicidal behavior.

Clinical correlates of eating disorder comorbidity in women with bipolar disorder type I,"Objective: To report on the presence of current and lifetime eating disorders (ED) in a well-defined sample of 137 female individuals with bipolar disorder type I. Methods: Trained psychiatrists interviewed the patients, and the diagnoses of BD and comorbidities were confirmed using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Axis I Disorders. Clinical and demographic characteristics of both groups (group with ED vs. group without ED) were compared. Results: Female patients with ED had an earlier onset of BD and an increased number of mood episodes, predominantly depressive. Women in the ED group also had higher rates of comorbidity with substance use disorders and anxiety disorders and reported a history of suicide attempts more frequently than women without ED. Conclusion: The presence of ED is a correlate of severity of BD type I, and interventions should be developed to minimize distress and suicide risk and to improve treatment outcome.

Childhood CBCL bipolar profile and adolescent/young adult personality disorders: A 9-year follow-up,"Background: To assess the late adolescent psychiatric outcomes associated with a positive Child Behavior Checklist-Juvenile Bipolar Disorder Phenotype (CBCL-JBD) in children diagnosed with ADHD and followed over a 9-year period. Methods: Parents of 152 children diagnosed as ADHD (ages 7–11years) completed the CBCL. Ninety of these parents completed it again 9 years later as part of a comprehensive evaluation of Axis I and II diagnoses as assessed using semi-structured interviews. As previously proposed, the CBCL-JBD phenotype was defined as T-scores of 70 or greater on the Attention Problems, Aggression, and Anxiety/Depression subscales. Results: The CBCL-JBD phenotype was found in 31% of those followed but only 4.9% of the sample continued to meet the phenotype criteria at follow-up. Only two of the sample developed Bipolar Disorder by late adolescence and only one of those had the CBCL-JBD profile in childhood. The proxy did not predict any Axis I disorders. However, the CBCL-JBD proxy was highly predictive of later personality disorders. Limitations: Only a subgroup of the original childhood sample was followed. Given this sample was confined to children with ADHD, it is not known whether the prediction of personality disorders from CBCL scores would generalize to a wider community or clinical population. Conclusions: A positive CBCL-JBD phenotype profile in childhood does not predict Axis I Disorders in late adolescence; however, it may be prognostic of the emergence of personality disorders.

Recognition and subsequent treatment of patients with sub-threshold symptoms of depression in primary care,"Background: Non-psychiatric physicians are better at correctly ruling out depressive disorders than appropriately recognising them. However, given large numbers of non-depressed patients, a small percentage of false positives equates to a greater number of patients than the number of depressed patients that GPs fail to detect. Concern thus arises that substantial numbers of patients with falsely identified depression may receive inappropriate interventions. Methods: Unselected GP consulters were screened with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). GPs' perceptions of depression were independently rated on an ICD-10 scale. Case records were reviewed. Analysis related to participants with HADS-D&lt;8. Data were assessed of 660 participants with sub-threshold symptoms. Factors were assessed according to GP ratings. Results: GP perceived depression in false positive cases were more likely at index visit, to have a mental health presenting problem (OR = 6.74 (95% CI = 3.21, 14.16); receive antidepressant prescriptions (OR 3.79 (95% CI = 1.69, 8.49) and have greater severity of HADS-D score (OR 1.18 (95% CI = 1.01, 1.38). Subthreshold cases that GPs identified as depressed, more often had a recording, over subsequent six months, of: depressive symptoms (16 (35%) versus 26 (7%), p &lt; 0.001); antidepressant prescriptions (11 (24%) versus 25 (7%), p = 0.001); and Community Mental Health Team referrals (4 (9%) versus 1 (&lt;1%), p = 0.001). They also consulted GPs more frequently than those not identified (median = 5 (IQR 2.8, 6.3) versus median = 3 (IQR = 2, 5), p = 0.004 over six months. Limitations: The HADS is not a diagnostic tool. Conclusions: GPs' diagnoses of depressive disorder in patients with sub-threshold symptoms were appropriate. Interventions offered to this group were consistent with documented previous histories.

Occupational impairment and social anxiety disorder in a sample of primary care patients,"Background: Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is the second most prevalent psychiatric condition in the US. Because of the inherent nature of SAD, it may cause impairments in workplace functioning, particularly compared to other anxiety disorders that do not necessarily lead to social impairments. In this study, we compared workplace functioning in primary care patients with SAD to patients with other anxiety disorders and comorbid Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Methods: Data are obtained from the Primary Care Anxiety Project (PCAP), a naturalistic, longitudinal study of anxiety disorders in 539 primary care patients. We examined intake demographic and interviewer-assessed ratings of workplace functioning. Results: Results revealed that patients with SAD and MDD had significantly decreased workplace functioning, compared to individuals with other anxiety disorders. Furthermore, results showed that patients with SAD were greater than two-times more likely to be unemployed, but expected to work, than all other patients. Limitations: Workplace functioning was not measured objectively and the sample may not be representative of the general population. Conclusions: These findings highlight the particular need to assess for the presence of undereducation and underperformance at work and/or underemployment in individuals with SAD, as they are at most risk for these impairments. Additionally, early detection and intervention in individuals with or at risk for SAD may curb the future impact of social anxiety on occupational attainment.

Biased emotional recognition in depression: Perception of emotions in music by depressed patients,"Background: Depression is a highly prevalent mood disorder, that impairs a person's social skills and also their quality of life. Populations affected with depression also suffer from a higher mortality rate. Depression affects person's ability to recognize emotions. We designed a novel experiment to test the hypothesis that depressed patients show a judgment bias towards negative emotions. Methods: To investigate how depressed patients differ in their perception of emotions conveyed by musical examples, both healthy (n = 30) and depressed (n = 79) participants were presented with a set of 30 musical excerpts, representing one of five basic target emotions, and asked to rate each excerpt using five Likert scales that represented the amount of each one of those same emotions perceived in the example. Results: Depressed patients showed moderate but consistent negative self-report biases both in the overall use of the scales and their particular application to certain target emotions, when compared to healthy controls. Also, the severity of the clinical state (depression, anxiety and alexithymia) had an effect on the self-report biases for both positive and negative emotion ratings, particularly depression and alexithymia. Limitations: Only musical stimuli were used, and they were all clear examples of one of the basic emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, anger and tenderness. No neutral or ambiguous excerpts were included. Conclusions: Depressed patients' negative emotional bias was demonstrated using musical stimuli. This suggests that the evaluation of emotional qualities in music could become a means to discriminate between depressed and non-depressed subjects. The practical implications of the present study relate both to diagnostic uses of such perceptual evaluations, as well as a better understanding of the emotional regulation strategies of the patients.

Mexican migration experiences to the US and risk for anxiety and depressive symptoms,"Background: Scant and contradictory information prevails on the risk for common psychiatric disorders in Mexican immigrants to the United States (US). Extension of these results in larger samples is needed to better address treatment needs. This study investigates the association between migration to the US and development of depressive and anxiety symptoms in four urban areas of Mexico. Methods: A cross-sectional survey in 2005 of individuals ages 12–65 from four cities formed a representative sample. Immigration-related experiences and prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms were recorded. Respondents were classified into three groups: (i) ‘return migrants’, (ii) ‘relatives of migrants’ and (iii) ‘non-migrants’ in the general population. Depression symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and anxiety was determined using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms were estimated as the proportion of the entire sample reporting the outcome. Crude and adjusted OR's were estimated in logistic regression models. Results: A total of 1630 respondents, represent a 70.5% response rate. Overall prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms were both approximately 16%. Increased risk for depressive symptoms (OR = 1.49 CI 95% = 1.01–2.20) among return migrants and depressive (OR = 1.48, CI 95% = 1.07–2.05) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.38, CI 95% = 1.08–1.78) in relatives of migrants was found in comparison to those without a migration experience. Limitations: Specific age and timing of migration experiences were not recorded. Conclusions: Migration experiences produce important levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms that could be linked to psychopathology.

"Risk of placental abruption in relation to maternal depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms","Background: Little is known about the influence of psychiatric factors on the etiology of placental abruption (PA), an obstetrical condition that complicates 1–2% of pregnancies. We examined the risk of PA in relation to maternal psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy. Methods: This case–control study included 373 PA cases and 368 controls delivered at five medical centers in Lima, Peru. Depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to calculate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for confounders. Results: Depressive symptoms of increasing severity (using the DASS depression subscale) was associated with PA ( p for trend = 0.02). Compared with women with no depressive symptoms, the aOR (95%CI) for PA associated with each level of severity of depression symptoms based on the DASS assessment were as follows: mild 1.84 (0.91–3.74); moderate 1.25 (0.67–2.33); and severe 4.68 (0.98–22.4). The corresponding ORs for mild, moderate, and moderately severe depressive symptoms based on the PHQ assessment were 1.10 (0.79–1.54), 3.31 (1.45–7.57), and 5.01 (1.06–23.6), respectively. A positive gradient was observed for the odds of PA with severity of anxiety ( p for trend = 0.002) and stress symptoms ( p for trend = 0.002). Limitations: These cross-sectionally collected data may be subject to recall bias. Conclusions: Maternal psychiatric disorders may be associated with an increased occurrence of AP. Larger studies that allow for more precise evaluations of maternal psychiatric health in relation to PA risk are warranted.

Childhood history of behavioral inhibition and comorbidity status in 256 adults with social phobia,"Background: Behavioral inhibition (BI), a heritable temperament, predisposes one to an increased risk of social phobia. Recent investigations have reported that BI may also be a precursor to anxiety as well as depressive and alcohol-related disorders, which are frequently comorbid with social phobia. In the present study, we explored the relationship between BI and psychiatric disorders in 256 adults with a primary diagnosis of social phobia. Methods: BI severity was retrospectively assessed with the Retrospective Self-Report of Inhibition (RSRI). The severity of social phobia and the presence of comorbid diagnoses were evaluated with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, respectively. Results: The RSRI score was significantly and positively correlated with both the LSAS score and the occurrence of a major depressive disorder. No significant association was found with other anxiety and substance-related disorders. Limitation: The assessment of BI was retrospective and self-reported. Conclusion: A childhood history of BI was associated with an increased risk of depressive comorbidity in social phobia.

Personal and perceived depression stigma in Australian adolescents: Magnitude and predictors,"Background: Depression stigma has been identified as a barrier to help-seeking in adolescents. This study aimed to examine and compare levels of personal and perceived depression stigma amongst Australian adolescents and to identify predictors of these constructs. Methods: A total of 1,375 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years ( M = 14.34) completed the Depression Stigma Scale (DSS) and a number of other sociodemographic and symptom scale measurements as part of the pre-intervention questionnaire of the YouthMood Project. Results: Levels of perceived stigma ( M = 20.53, SD = 5.06) were significantly higher than levels of personal stigma ( M = 14.48, SD = 5.28). Higher personal stigma was predicted by being male ( p &lt; .001), younger ( p = .01), living with both parents ( p = .02), having no history of depression ( p &lt; .001), having no history of parental depression ( p &lt; .01), speaking English as a second language ( p &lt; .001), lower levels of mastery ( p &lt; .01), and higher levels of alcohol consumption ( p &lt; .001) and perceived stigma ( p &lt; .001). Higher perceived stigma was predicted by being female ( p = .02), having a history of parental depression ( p = .05), and higher levels of anxiety ( p &lt; .001) and personal stigma ( p &lt; .001). Limitations: Participants completed a self-report cross-sectional survey, which does not allow temporal relationships to be drawn. Conclusions: Stigmatising attitudes are common amongst the adolescent population. The identified predictors of stigma should be considered in the development of future community campaigns to reduce stigma in adolescents.

Improvement within 2 weeks and later treatment outcomes in patients with depressive disorders: The CRESCEND study,"Background: Although antidepressants are conventionally given for 4–6 weeks before deciding on response, several reports suggest that early improvement predicts later outcomes. In a naturalistic national cohort study, we sought to investigate the predictive value of early improvement on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score for later outcomes (depression (HAMD), anxiety (HAMA), global severity (CGI-s) and functioning (SOFAS)), as well as socio-demographic and clinical correlates of early improvement. Methods: Participants were recruited from 18 hospitals across South Korea. All met DSM-IV criteria for depressive disorders, scored ≥14 on the HAMD and received antidepressant treatment for up to 12 weeks. Treatment was naturalistic in that each clinician freely decided the types, doses, and regimes of antidepressant and concomitant medications. Early improvement was defined as a reduction in HAMD score of ≥20% compared with baseline within 2 weeks of treatment. Later treatment outcomes were measured at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Results: In a recruited sample of 568 patients, early improvement predicted 12 week treatment outcomes with high sensitivity and high negative predictive values. The predictive values for HAMD and HAMA 12-week responses were higher compared to CGI-s and SOFAS responses. Early improvement was associated with higher monthly income, baseline lower anxiety and higher functioning levels. The patients with early improvement more frequently received antidepressant monotherapy. Limitations: The study was observational, and the treatment modality was naturalistic. Conclusions: Early antidepressant improvement strongly predicted later outcomes, and was associated with higher income, lower anxiety, and higher function.

CBT for pharmacotherapy non-remitters—A systematic review of a next-step strategy,"Background: Non-remission rates to pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders are related to higher relapse rates, decreased quality of life and greater functional impairment. Here we sought to investigate the efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) as a next-step strategy in the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders who did not remit after a pharmacological intervention. Method: We carried out a systematic review in the ISI, Pubmed and PsycINFO/PsychLit databases. Studies that did not use CBT and that did not focus on resistance to drug therapy were excluded. We considered resistant patients who failed to respond (did not fully remit) to an adequate trial of pharmacotherapy and still exhibited residual symptoms of anxiety disorder. Results: We identified 603 references in our survey, of which 17 were included: eight were on OCD, five on panic disorder, and four on PTSD. No studies were found on social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. We observed a lack of standardization of terminology and of definitions of resistance, which makes comparison of results difficult. Finally, all of the identified studies showed benefits from the addition of CBT as a next-step strategy. Limitations: A limited number of randomized controlled studies were found. Conclusions: CBT seems to be a promising next-step strategy for patients with anxiety disorders who did not remit with drug-based therapies. However, further clinical trials with strong methodological designs are needed to definitely establish its efficacy in this population.

Obstetric and perinatal outcomes among women with blood- and injection phobia during pregnancy,"Background: Little is known about how anxiety disorders affect pregnancy outcomes. Therefore we investigated the impact of one anxiety disorder, blood- and injection phobia, on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Methods: From a population-based prospectively collected cohort we compared an index group of 110 women with blood- and injection phobia with a control group of 220 women. Standardized medical records were used to collect data. Obstetric and neonatal outcomes e.g. elective cesarean, prematurity, and small for gestational age were used as the main outcome measures. Results: Women with blood- and injection phobia stated more often a fear of childbirth (p &lt; 0.001) and were more frequently delivered by elective cesarean section (p = 0.032). The incidence of premature delivery (p = 0.028), neonatal morbidity (p = 0.001) and the risk of having a baby born small for gestational age (p = 0.009) was higher among women with blood-and injection phobia. Limitations: The medical records, from which all information is drawn, despite standardization, sometimes may lack some information. However, this dilemma exists in both groups. Conclusions: Women with an anxiety disorder such as blood- and injection phobia are at increased risk for adverse obstetric outcomes, premature delivery and for having a baby born with higher neonatal morbidity. It therefore seems important to identify and treat women with anxiety disorders without delay early during pregnancy in an effort to minimize risks of complications for the woman herself and the child.

Risk factors for chronic depression—A systematic review,"Background: One of five patients with an acute depressive episode develops chronic depression. Risk factors for a current depressive episode to become chronic are insufficiently known. This review was conducted to examine which factors represent a risk factor for the development of chronic depression for patients diagnosed with a depressive episode. Method: Medline, Psycinfo, ISI Web of Science, CINHAL and BIOSIS Previews were searched up until September 2007, complemented by handsearching in the December 1987 to December 2007 issues of Journal of Affective Disorders and investigating reference lists of included articles and existing reviews. On the basis of a formal checklist, two investigators independently decided which studies to include or exclude. Results: 25 relevant primary studies with a total of 5192 participants were included in the systematic review. Overall the methodological quality of the included studies was found to be sufficient. Data synthesis was performed via vote counting. The following risk factors were identified: younger age at onset , longer duration of depressive episode , and family history of mood disorders . Psychological comorbidity i.e. anxiety disorders , personality disorders and substance abuse , low level of social integration , negative social interaction and lower severity of depressive symptoms repeatedly appeared concurrently with chronic depression. Limitations: Most included studies were cross-sectional thus drawing causal conclusions with regard to risk factors proved to be difficult. Conclusion: Risk factors for a current depressive episode to become chronic were identified. To date only few significant longitudinal studies on this topic are available.

The functional Val¹⁵⁸Met polymorphism in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is associated with depression and motivation in men from a Swedish population-based study,"Background: Environmental risk factors together with genetic vulnerability create a complex background to develop depression. Methods: We investigated the associations between COMT Val¹⁵⁸Met and depression in a Swedish population-based sample of 405 depressed individuals (major depression diagnosis, dysthymia or mixed anxiety depression defined according to DSM-IV) and 2,151 healthy controls. We also analyzed interaction between this genetic variation and some environmental risk factors for depression and the link between this polymorphism and the low motivational level and negative mood state found in depressed individuals. Results: Depressed individuals displayed a higher frequency of the Met/Met and Met/Val genotypes compared to controls (OR = 1.49, CI 95% = 1.11–2.00, P = 0.009). The association was found among men only (OR = 2.26, CI 95% = 1.26–4.05, p = 0.008). Regression analysis including some potential risk factors for depression, did further indicate that Met/Met and Met/Val were associated with depression in men (P = 0.005). There was also an interaction between genotype and family childhood problems (RERI = 0.876, CI 95% = 0.090–1.662 and AP = 0.426, CI 95% = 0.030–0.821). Further, depressed men homozygous for the Val-allele, had a higher motivational level than depressed men with a Met-variant (P = 0.02). Limitations: The sample size of depressed individuals per group when stratifying cases according to gender and genotypes is considered a limitation. Conclusions: The Met-variants of COMT Val158Met are risk variants for depression and low motivational level in depressed Swedish men, but not women. Individuals with this risk variant in combination with a problematic childhood, have an even higher risk to develop depression.

Antenatal anxiety disorder as a predictor of postnatal depression: A longitudinal study,"Previous research has implicated high levels of antenatal anxiety as a predictor of postnatal depression, but there is a paucity of evidence on the relationship between the various forms of anxiety and postnatal depression. A longitudinal study of 246 mothers (56 with antenatal generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), 68 with antenatal generalised social phobia, 28 with both disorders in the antenatal period, and 94 with no antenatal GAD or social phobia) allowed us to explore whether antenatal social phobia and GAD predict high Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores (probable depression N12) at 10–14 days, 10–12 weeks, 10 months, 14 months, and 24 months postnatally. We found that, after accounting for the presence of other antenatal anxiety disorders, antenatal depression, maternal age at child's birth, socioeconomic status and ethnicity in the models, antenatal GAD independently predicted depression at all time points after delivery. A less robust relationship was found for antenatal social phobia, which predicted postnatal depression at only 10 months after birth. One possibility consistent with our findings is that there may be differences in the timing of postnatal depression with different forms of antenatal anxiety disorders.

Subthreshold anxiety better defined by symptom self-report than by diagnostic interview,"Background: There is no consensus on how to define subthreshold anxiety. Based on functional impairment, we aim to evaluate the use of a diagnostic instrument and an anxiety severity questionnaire to derive an empirical cut-off for defining clinically relevant, subthreshold anxiety. Methods: Our sample consisted of 1788 subjects without full-syndromal anxiety disorders from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). We used ANCOVA to compare the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) in their association with functional impairment, measured by the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS II). The BAI was selected over the Fear Questionnaire (FQ) and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) for its highest associations with anxiety disorders. ROC analysis determined the percentage of functionally impaired with subthreshold anxiety based on found cut-offs. Results: The CIDI was very modestly associated with functional impairment, possibly because of skip rules, wording or scoring, while the BAI was highly correlated to functional impairment. A score of 11 on the BAI defined clinically relevant subthreshold anxiety. This cut-off identified 36.0% of the most functionally impaired as having subthreshold anxiety. Limitations: No “natural” cut-off on the BAI for determining subthreshold anxiety could be determined. The cut-off point of 11, based on a large effect size relative to normal anxiety, thus remains somewhat arbitrary. Conclusions: The questionnaire BAI is more suitable than the interview CIDI to measure clinically relevant, subthreshold anxiety. The BAI score of 11 appeared to be the most appropriate cut-off for identifying clinically relevant subthreshold anxiety.

A pharmaco-epidemiological study of migraine and antidepressant medications: Complete one year data from the Norwegian population,"Background: Migraine, depression and anxiety disorders have been associated with one another in several epidemiological studies. However, it is not known if or how these associations are reflected in the concurrent use of medications for migraine and depressive/anxiety disorders in the general population. The purpose of the present study was to identify groups of patients particularly likely to receive clinical treatment for both conditions. Methods: Data from the Norwegian Prescription Database for 2006 were analysed for the purpose of ascertaining concurrence of prescriptions for migraine and depression/anxiety disorders. Data were subjected to analysis testing deviation from unity for the OR performed by a chi-square test. Results: In the total Norwegian population ( N = 4640219) migraine drugs were prescribed to 81225 persons (1.8% of the population), antidepressant drugs to 257700 persons (5.6% of the population), and 11269 persons were prescribed both types of drugs. The prescription of antidepressants was significantly increased in patients receiving a prescription for a medication used to treat migraine (OR = 2.82 (95% CI = 2.76–2.88); chi-square p &lt; 0.001), and this association was stronger for men than for women. Teenage women carried the highest risk for this co-morbid constellation (OR = 3.89 CI = 3.17–4.77); chi-square p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This study revealed a strong positive association between the prescription of migraine and antidepressant medications, and this association was generally most pronounced in men. However, teenage girls carried the highest risk of receiving both kinds of prescriptions, suggesting particular attentiveness is required in the clinical management of these patients.

In the company of my sisters: Sister circles as an anxiety intervention for professional African American women,"Background: Sister circles have been used within African American communities to raise awareness about physical health. The possibility exists that sister circles could be used to educate and teach women strategies about managing anxiety and panic. In this paper we examine professional Black women's conceptualization of panic attacks and other related anxiety issues. Then, we explore the feasibility of sister circles as a psycho-educational anxiety intervention for African American professional women. Methods: Four focus groups ( n = 37) were conducted. Focus group interviews were transcribed and were coded into three categories: (a) a major theme; (b) a minor theme; or (c) an off-topic comment. Specifically, we generate information regarding the key content and research components of a sister circle for African American female professionals. Results: Focus group members saw a distinct difference between anxiety and panic. The number of African American women who experienced was seen as low. Women felt sister circles were a nice vehicle for helping African American women manage their anxiety and panic. Confidentially was a key component. Sister circles for anxiety and panic were seen as a natural outgrowth of African American women's professional networks. Limitations: Limited data were collected on participant's anxiety levels. Conclusions: Overall, sister circles were seen as feasible interventions for African American professional women. The data from the focus groups were used to enhance the development of a sister circle intervention for anxious professional African American women.

Major depression is associated with impaired processing of emotion in music as well as in facial and vocal stimuli,"Background: The processing of emotional stimuli is thought to be negatively biased in major depression. This study investigates this issue using musical, vocal and facial affective stimuli. Methods: 23 depressed in-patients and 23 matched healthy controls were recruited. Affective information processing was assessed through musical, vocal and facial emotion recognition tasks. Depression, anxiety level and attention capacity were controlled. Results: The depressed participants demonstrated less accurate identification of emotions than the control group in all three sorts of emotion-recognition tasks. The depressed group also gave higher intensity ratings than the controls when scoring negative emotions, and they were more likely to attribute negative emotions to neutral voices and faces. Limitations: Our in-patient group might differ from the more general population of depressed adults. They were all taking anti-depressant medication, which may have had an influence on their emotional information processing. Conclusions: Major depression is associated with a general negative bias in the processing of emotional stimuli. Emotional processing impairment in depression is not confined to interpersonal stimuli (faces and voices), being also present in the ability to feel music accurately.

Prevalence and correlates of eating disorders in 875 patients with bipolar disorder,"Objective: Relatively little is known about the co-occurrence of bipolar and eating disorders. We therefore assessed the prevalence and clinical correlates of eating disorders in 875 patients with bipolar disorder. Method: 875 outpatients with DSM-IV bipolar I or II disorder were evaluated with structured diagnostic interviews and clinician- and self-administered questionnaires to determine bipolar and eating disorder diagnoses, other comorbid Axis I disorder diagnoses, and demographic and historical illness characteristics. Results: 125 (14.3%) patients met DSM-IV criteria for at least one comorbid lifetime Axis I eating disorder, with binge eating disorder (N = 77) being more common than bulimia nervosa (n = 42) and anorexia nervosa (N = 27). There were no significant eating disorder comorbidity differences between bipolar I and bipolar II patients. Presence of a lifetime comorbid eating disorder was associated with female gender, younger age, earlier age of onset of mood symptoms and of bipolar disorder, presentation in a mixed episode, greater number of prior mood episodes, history of rapid cycling and suicide attempts, greater mean BMI, obesity and severe obesity, and family history of depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism, and drug abuse. When the three eating disorder groups were compared, lifetime anorexia nervosa was associated with normal weight and a lifetime anxiety disorder, lifetime bulimia nervosa was associated with overweight, and lifetime binge eating disorder was associated with obesity and severe obesity. Conclusions: Patients with bipolar disorder, especially women, not infrequently have comorbid eating disorders, and this comorbidity is associated with an earlier age of onset and more severe course of bipolar illness.

Validity of the GAD-7 scale as an outcome measure of disability in patients with generalized anxiety disorders in primary care,"Objective: To explore the validity of the GAD-7 scale as an outcome measure of disability in primary care. Methods: A random sample of 212 subjects was recruited in primary care clinics; 50% diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) by DSM-IV criteria and 50% concurrent matched controls. The GAD-7, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), and the abridged 12-item version of World Health Organization Disability Scale (WHO-DAS-II) were administered. The number of visits to primary care and specialty clinics was also recorded. Results: Strong and significant (p &lt; 0.001) correlations were found between GAD-7 and HAM-A (r = 0.852) and WHO-DAS-II (r = 0.704) scores, particularly for Participation in Society (r = 0.741), Understanding and Communication (r = 0.679), and Life Activities (0.638) dimensions. Moderate but significant correlations were also found between GAD-7 score and the number of visits to Primary Care (r = 0.393) and Specialty clinics (r = 0.373). In all cases, an overall relation was observed between GAD-7 severity levels and disability scores [F (3,208) = 25.4, p &lt; 0.001] as assessed by the WHO-DAS II, with higher mean disability values related to higher severity levels. Conclusions: The GAD-7 scale has been shown to highly correlate not only with specific anxiety but also with disability measures. It has been shown that more severe GAD levels correlate with higher disability states and tend to demand more health care attention. As the GAD-7 is self-administered and is not time consuming, this instrument could be a good choice to explore the level of patient disability in subjects with GAD in primary care settings.

Fibromyalgia syndrome and depressive symptoms: Comorbidity and clinical correlates,"Objective: Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and higher pain perception in specific anatomic sites called tender points. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with psychiatric symptoms, like depression and anxiety; indeed some authors have argued about the possibility to classify this syndrome into affective spectrum disorder. Few studies have analyzed the impact of depressive symptoms on pain threshold. This research is aimed at evaluating the prevalence and the clinical correlates of depressive symptoms in fibromyalgic patients, and investigating their impact on pain perception and quality of life. Methods: Outpatients between 18 and 75 years with diagnosis of fibromyalgia according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology have been included. All subjects have been evaluated with the following rating scales: HAM-D; VAS (to quantify pain); a visual analogical scale to evaluate quality of life; and Paykel's List of Recent Life Events. Results: Thirty subjects have been recruited. Most patients (83.3%) had clinically significant depressive symptoms as indicated by a HAM-D score &gt; 7. Depressive symptoms are associated with higher pain perception, worse quality of life and more severe life events. Conclusion: The presence of depressive symptoms is associated with a great impairment in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome: indeed the psychiatric comorbidity lowers pain threshold and worsens the quality of life of our patients. Future studies should be conducted in order to identify the individual factors, e.g. stress or inflammatory processes, which drive the association between depression and higher severity of fibromyalgia syndrome.

Aripiprazole: A clinical review of its use for the treatment of anxiety disorders and anxiety as a comorbidity in mental illness,"Background: Although anxiety disorders are common, optimal treatment is elusive. More than half of anxiety patients treated with an adequate course of antidepressants fail to fully improve: treatment resistance, residual symptoms, and recurrence/relapse remain a challenge. Recently, atypical antipsychotics have been considered for treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. This review will explore the available data for the role of aripiprazole in the treatment of anxiety. Methods: PubMed and conference abstracts were searched for randomized, double-blind studies that investigated the efficacy of aripiprazole in anxiety; its efficacy in bipolar disorder and depression was also explored for comparison. Results: A number of studies have shown atypical antipsychotics to be effective in anxiety, and currently available data suggest that aripiprazole augmentation in patients with anxiety disorders is likely as effective as other atypical antipsychotic drugs. Although there have been no randomized, controlled trials, aripiprazole has been found to be effective in treating anxiety disorders in two open-label trials. This combined with the larger data base demonstrating its utility in bipolar disorder and depression, its safety profile and its unique mechanism of action, make aripiprazole for anxiety an intriguing avenue of exploration. Limitations: Data from large randomized, controlled trials on the use of atypical antipsychotics for anxiety in general, and aripiprazole in particular, are currently lacking. Conclusion: The results of open-label trials of aripiprazole in anxiety provide enough support to warrant its further study. This, combined with a larger data base demonstrating its utility in bipolar disorder and depression, its safety profile and its unique mechanism of action, make aripiprazole for anxiety an intriguing avenue of exploration.

Aripiprazole: Striving towards euthymia with a novel mechanism of action,"The introduction of the psychopharmacological era in the mid 20th century aimed to provide ataraxia to those who suffer from chronic debilitating mental illnesses. Ataraxia is described as freedom from the anguish of affective, anxiety, and/or psychotic symptoms; a ""pharmacologic euthymia"". Currently, aripiprazole, olanzapine (in combination with fluoxetine), and quetiapine are FDA approved as treatments for individuals insufficiently responding to conventional unimodal antidepressant monotherapy. The widespread availability, evaluation, and marketing of atypical antipsychotics as resulted in this class of agents being used ahead of first-generation antipsychotics in the algorithmic treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. There are several key messages that busy practitioners can take away from this collection of articles. Aripiprazole offers symptom relief in the treatment of anxiety symptoms admixed with depressive episodes; its efficacy in anxiety disorders has not been sufficiently evaluated. We continue to aim for ataraxia and functional recovery, the expanding therapeutic options in mood and anxiety disorders is introducing more complexity in the treatment algorithm yet hopefully raising the probability of successful outcome.

Grandparental anxiety and depression predict young children's internalizing and externalizing problems: The generation R study,"Background: Family history is a major risk factor for child problem behaviour, yet few studies have examined the association between grandparental psychiatric disorder and child problem behaviour. Results are inconsistent as to whether the effect of grandparental depression on child problem behaviour is independent of parental psychopathology. Methods: Mothers and their children participated in an ethnically Dutch subcohort of a population-based prospective cohort in the Netherlands. N = 816 (66%) mothers and n = 691 fathers participated in the prenatal interviews. N = 687 (84%) mothers and children and n = 565 (82%) fathers participated three years postpartum. (Grand)parental psychopathology was assessed during pregnancy of the mothers with the Family Informant Schedule and Criteria (FISC), the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Child behaviour was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) by mother and father when the child was three years old. Results: Grandparental anxiety disorder predicted maternal reports of children's internalizing problems (OR = 1.98, 95% C.I. (1.20, 3.28), p-value &lt; 0.01) and externalizing problems (OR = 1.73, 95% C.I. (1.04, 2.87), p-value = 0.03), independent of parental psychopathology. Results were similar for grandparental depression; internalizing OR = 1.75, 95% C.I (1.11, 2.75), p-value = 0.02 and externalizing OR = 1.67, 95% C.I. (1.05, 2.64) p-value = 0.03. However, grandparental psychopathology was not associated with children's problem behaviour as reported by the father. Limitations: Information on grandparental lifetime psychiatric disorder was assessed through a parental interview which may have led to an underestimation of the prevalence rates. Conclusions: These results confirm the importance of a family history including not only the parental but also the grandparental generations.

Psychiatric disorders and functional impairment among disaster victims after exposure to a natural disaster: A population based study,"Objective: We aimed to examine psychiatric morbidity and functional impairment after a natural disaster. Method: Norwegian tourists who survived the 2004 tsunami in Khao Lak (n = 63), a severely affected area in Thailand, were interviewed in person 2.5years after the disaster. The examination included the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), the Global Assessment of Functioning function score (GAF-F), and questions covering background characteristics and disaster exposure. Results: The most prevalent disorders were specific phobia (30.2%), agoraphobia (17.5%), social anxiety disorder (11.1%), PTSD (11.1%), major depressive disorder (MDD, 11.1%), and dysthymic disorder (DD, 11.1%). In 24 of the 40 respondents with a current psychiatric disorder, symptoms had originated after the tsunami. The post-tsunami 2.5year incidence of PTSD and MDD was 36.5% and 28.6%, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis showed that the depressive disorders (MDD and DD) and PTSD were associated with self-reported functional impairment (WSAS), and the depressive disorders were associated with clinician assessed functional impairment (GAF-F). Limitations: Small sample size and high education may limit the generalizability of the results.

Base rates for depersonalization according to the 2-item version of the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS-2) and its associations with depression/anxiety in the general population,"Background: Recently, the two item version of the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS-2) has been validated in a clinical sample and has demonstrated that it is a useful tool for the detection of clinically significant depersonalization (DP). In order to provide a framework for the interpretation of the CDS-2 scores the aim of this study was to achieve normative data of a representative sample of the German population and to evaluate the associations with depression, anxiety and sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: A nationally representative face-to-face household survey was conducted during the mid of 2009 in Germany. The sample comprised N=2512 participants. The survey questionnaire consisted of the CDS-2, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and demographic characteristics. Results: Case level of DP was found for 3.4% of the participants without significant sex and age differences. Although DP was strongly associated with depression and anxiety, principal component analysis clearly supported the distinctiveness of the psychopathological syndromes of depression, anxiety and DP. Limitations: A criterion standard diagnostic interview for DP, anxiety and depression was not included. Conclusions: The results provide a framework for the interpretation of the CDS-2 scores and support the view that DP is a common and distinct psychopathological syndrome.

Treatment for depression and change in mood instability,"Background: Mood varies along at least 2 dimensions, severity and instability (MI). Compared with severity, there is little research on the treatment of MI. We assessed changes in MI with community psychiatric treatment, in patients with depression and mood swings. Method: Diagnoses were obtained with the MINI. Thirty-four patients completed the Mood Disorders Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T). MI was calculated from visual analogue scales (VAS) ratings for depression and anxiety. The VAS was rated twice a day for a week. The BDI, STAI-T and VAS were repeated after 3–6months of treatment. Results: Patients improved with treatment on depression (BDI) and anxiety (STAI-T) severity but not on MI. However, change in MI predicted change in depression severity (BDI). Limitations: The sample size was relatively small and information on treatment waslimited. There was no control group. Studies of longer duration and with more comprehensive treatment might be necessary to show changes in MI. Conclusions: MI does not respond consistently within 3–6months to common effective psychiatric treatments for depression and anxiety. Improved treatment of MI could result in improved treatment for major depression.
