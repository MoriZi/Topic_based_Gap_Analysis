Life in a post-pandemic world: What to expect of anxiety-related conditions and their treatment,"Our research suggests that, during the current pandemic, some people have developed a COVID Stress Syndrome, characterized by fear of infection, fear of touching surfaces or objects that might be contaminated with the novel coronavirus, xenophobia (i.e., fear that foreigners might be infected with the virus), COVID-related checking and reassurance seeking, and COVID-related traumatic stress symptoms (e.g., COVID-related intrusive thoughts and nightmares). It appears that people who develop COVID Stress Syndrome have pre-existing psychopathology, particularly pre-existing high levels of health anxiety and obsessive-compulsive checking and contamination symptoms. It remains to be seen whether the COVID Stress Syndrome is simply an adjustment disorder, abating once the pandemic is over, or whether it will become chronic for some individuals.

"How health anxiety influences responses to viral outbreaks like COVID-19: What all decision-makers, health authorities, and health care professionals need to know","Psychological factors are known to play a vital role in the success of public health strategies used to manage pandemics, including COVID-19. Knowledge of how high and low levels of health anxiety will impact behaviour as it relates to strategies for containing and mitigating viral spread is important for all decision-makers, health authorities, and health care professionals.

The effects of imagery rescripting on memory outcomes in social anxiety disorder,"Imagery rescripting (IR) is an effective intervention for social anxiety disorder (SAD) that targets negative autobiographical memories. IR has been theorized to work through various memory mechanisms, including modifying the content of negative memory representations, changing memory appraisals, and improving negative schema or core beliefs about self and others. However, no prior studies have investigated the unique effects of rescripting itself relative to other IR intervention components on these proposed mechanisms. In this preliminary study, 33 individuals with SAD were randomized to receive a single session of IR, imaginal exposure (IE), or supportive counselling (SC). Memory outcomes were assessed at 1- and 2-weeks post-intervention and at 3-months follow-up. Results demonstrated that the content of participants’ autobiographical memory representations changed in distinct ways across the three conditions. Whereas IR facilitated increases only in positive/neutral memory details, IE facilitated increases in both positive/neutral and negative memory details and SC facilitated no changes in memory details. Although memory appraisals did not differ across conditions, participants who received IR were more likely to update their negative memory-derived core beliefs. These unique effects of rescripting on memory representations and core beliefs enhance our understanding of the memory-based mechanisms of IR within the context of exposure-based learning for people with SAD.

Mediators of treatment effect in minimal-contact cognitive behaviour therapy for severe health anxiety: A theory-driven analysis based on a randomised controlled trial,"Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is efficacious for severe health anxiety, but little is known about mechanisms. We analysed putative mediators of change based on 13 weekly assessments in a randomised controlled trial (N = 132) of exposure-based minimal-contact CBT (guided Internet-delivered CBT, unguided Internet-delivered CBT and bibliotherapy) vs. a waitlist control for severe health anxiety. We hypothesised that the effect of CBT on health anxiety would be mediated by non-reactivity to inner experiences, health anxiety behaviours and perceived competence. We also explored somatosensory amplification. In parallel process growth models, non-reactivity, health anxiety behaviours and perceived competence—but not somatosensory amplification—were influenced by CBT and associated with health anxiety. Random intercepts cross-lagged panel models were used to study within-individual ordering of change. None of the putative mediators systematically predicted subsequent changes in health anxiety. Rather, changes in health anxiety predicted subsequent changes in all putative mediators. In summary, CBT influenced health anxiety behaviours, non-reactivity to inner experiences and perceived competence, and these variables were associated with the outcome. However, their role as mediators was not corroborated because we found no evidence that changes in these variables predicted subsequent changes in health anxiety. We encourage further research into mediators of CBT for health anxiety.

Do religious patients need religious psychotherapists? A naturalistic treatment matching study among orthodox Jews,"Religion is professed by the majority of the general population, but a minority of mental health practitioners. We evaluated whether religious patients benefited more from treatment with religious psychotherapists in a naturalistic study among adult Orthodox Jewish ( n = 117) and control patients ( n = 91) receiving psychotherapy from Orthodox Jewish ( n = 15) and other ( n = 7) psychotherapists at a New York based outpatient clinic. Groups did not differ with respect to diagnoses (χ² (200) = 7.5, p = .76), likelihood of having an Orthodox Jewish therapist (χ² (200) = .06, p = .81), or number of therapy sessions ( t (206) = .73, p = .47). Multilevel regression modeling revealed that Orthodox patients reported lower initial anxiety ( t (198) = 3.71, p &lt; .001, d = .54) and depression ( t (198) = 3.71, p &lt; .001, d = .54, d = .50), but were equivalent to controls at termination (Anxiety t (189) = .36, p = .72; Depression t (182) = 1.00, p = .32). Interactions between patient and therapist religious affiliations were not significant. These results suggest that religious (and non-religious) patients may benefit equally from treatment delivered by religious and non-religious therapists.

The impact of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for health anxiety on cyberchondria,"Cyberchondria refers to an emotional-behavioural pattern whereby excessive online searches lead to increased anxiety about one’s own health status. It has been shown to be associated with health anxiety, however it is unknown whether existing cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions targeting health anxiety also improve cyberchondria. This study aimed to determine whether internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for severe health anxiety led to improvements in self-reported cyberchondria and whether improvements in cyberchondria were associated with improvements in health anxiety observed during treatment. Methods: We analysed secondary data from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing an iCBT group (n = 41) to an active control group who underwent psychoeducation, monitoring and clinical support (n = 41) in health anxious patients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of Illness Anxiety Disorder and/or Somatic Symptom Disorder. The iCBT group showed a significantly greater reduction in cyberchondria compared to the control group, with large differences at post-treatment on the Cyberchondria Severity Scale Total scale (CSS; Hedges g = 1.09), and the Compulsion, Distress, Excessiveness subscales of the CSS (g’s: 0.8–1.13). Mediation analyses showed improvements in health anxiety in the iCBT group were mediated by improvements in all of the CSS subscales, except for the Mistrust subscale. Conclusions: Internet CBT for health anxiety improves cyberchondria.

"Changes in trauma-potentiated startle, skin conductance, and heart rate within prolonged exposure therapy for PTSD in high and low treatment responders","While exposure-based psychotherapy is recommended as a first-line treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) given strong evidence for its effectiveness, some patients fail to receive full benefit. Psychophysiological data may be important complementary indices for investigating variability in treatment response and changes over the course of treatment. The focus of the present investigation was to examine change in psychophysiological indices pre- to post-treatment and to investigate if changes differed for high versus low PTSD treatment responders. Participants included veterans with primary PTSD diagnoses who received a two-week intensive prolonged exposure (PE) treatment. Psychophysiological assessment included trauma-potentiated startle, heart rate, and skin conductance recordings during presentation of three standard virtual reality (VR)-based, trauma-relevant scenes presented through a head mounted display. Results indicate that 48.6% were classified as high treatment responders (≥ 50% reduction in PCL-5 from baseline). Trauma-potentiated startle was observed in all patients at pre-treatment, F = 13.58, p &lt; .001, in that startle magnitude was increased during VR stimuli relative to baseline regardless of responder status. However, in high treatment responders, there was an interaction of VR with time, F = 14.10, p = .001; VR scenes did not potentiate startle post-treatment. Specifically, high treatment responders were less reactive to trauma stimuli following PE treatment. There was no effect of time in the low responder group. Heart rate reactivity data revealed a significant main effect of treatment, F = 45.7, p = .035, but no significant interaction with responder status. Skin conductance reactivity did not significantly change from pre to post-treatment. These results suggest that trauma-potentiated startle may represent an objective marker of fear- and anxiety-related symptom reduction that is sensitive to both traditional outpatient as well as intensive treatment approaches.

Changes in dosing and dose timing of d-cycloserine explain its apparent declining efficacy for augmenting exposure therapy for anxiety-related disorders: An individual participant-data meta-analysis,"The apparent efficacy of d-cycloserine (DCS) for enhancing exposure treatment for anxiety disorders appears to have declined over the past 14 years. We examined whether variations in how DCS has been administered can account for this “declining effect”. We also investigated the association between DCS administration characteristics and treatment outcome to find optimal dosing parameters. We conducted a secondary analysis of individual participant data obtained from 1047 participants in 21 studies testing the efficacy of DCS-augmented exposure treatments. Different outcome measures in different studies were harmonized to a 0-100 scale. Intent-to-treat analyses showed that, in participants randomized to DCS augmentation (n = 523), fewer DCS doses, later timing of DCS dose, and lower baseline severity appear to account for this decline effect. More DCS doses were related to better outcomes, but this advantage leveled-off at nine doses. Administering DCS more than 60 minutes before exposures was also related to better outcomes. These predictors were not significant in the placebo arm (n = 521). Results suggested that optimal DCS administration could increase pre-to-follow-up DCS effect size by 50%. In conclusion, the apparent declining effectiveness of DCS over time may be accounted for by how it has been administered. Optimal DCS administration may substantially improve outcomes.

But what will the results be?: Learning to tolerate uncertainty is associated with treatment-produced gains,"The current study examined the association between changes in intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and treatment outcomes for anxious youth. Participants were youth ages 7 to 17 who received cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety ( N = 73). Youth and their primary caregivers completed a diagnostic interview and self- and parent-report measures at pre- and post-treatment, including the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale for Children (IUS-C/P; Przeworski, 2006), the Coping Questionnaire (CQ-C/P; Kendall, 1994) and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC-C/P; March et al., 1997). Hierarchical regression analyses evaluated the role of change in IU (the IUS-C/P) in predicting changes in functional impairment, coping efficacy, and anxiety severity post-treatment, controlling for demographic variables (age and gender), and baseline levels of IU, anxiety severity, functional impairment, and coping efficacy. Results demonstrated that treatment was associated with improvements across child-, parent- and clinician-report, and decreased IU from pre- to post-treatment was associated with (a) decreased functional impairment, (b) increased coping efficacy and (c) decreased anxiety severity. The findings indicate that a greater reduction in IU over treatment is associated with better outcomes in children and adolescents with anxiety across informants, suggesting the possibility that an increased focus on IU during treatment for youth anxiety may improve treatment outcomes. Future research should assess the causality of this relationship.

The association between prenatal maternal anxiety disorders and postpartum perceived and observed mother-infant relationship quality,"Introduction: Prenatal maternal anxiety disorders have been associated with adverse outcomes in offspring including emotional, behavioral and cognitive problems. There is limited understanding of the mechanisms underpinning these associations, although one possible candidate is an impaired mother-infant relationship. The authors investigated whether prenatal anxiety disorders were associated with poorer postpartum mother-infant relationship quality, measured by maternal self-reported bonding and observed mother-infant interactions. Methods: A cohort of 454 pregnant women recruited from an inner-city maternity service in London (UK) were assessed for mental disorders using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and followed up at mid-pregnancy and 3-months postpartum. Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and mid-pregnancy (using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). At three months postpartum, women were assessed for self-reported bonding difficulties (using the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire) and a subsample (n = 204) participated in video-recorded mother-infant interaction, coded using the Child-Adult Relationship Experimental Index by an independent rater. Results: Prenatal anxiety disorders were associated with higher perceived bonding impairment, but not associated with observed poor mother-infant interaction quality. Higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with lower maternal sensitivity. Conclusions: Interventions for anxiety disorders in the perinatal period could be tailored to address anxieties about mother-infant relationship and co-morbid depressive symptoms.

Social problem solving in social anxiety disorder,"Successful social problem solving requires both an adaptive orientation toward the problem and the necessary skills to generate relevant and effective solutions. Surprisingly few studies have examined social problem solving in the context of social anxiety. We examined social problem solving in 38 participants with social anxiety disorder (SAD) in comparison to 30 healthy control (HC) participants with no history of anxiety problems. Participants rated their problem solving attitudes and abilities (i.e., problem orientation ) and then generated solutions to hypothetical interpersonal problems from both their own perspective and that of an objective other. These solutions were coded for effectiveness and relevance, as well as the degree to which the solution was active versus passive. Participants with SAD exhibited a more negative problem orientation than HC participants. Furthermore, although SAD and HC participants demonstrated no overall differences in generating relevant and effective solutions to interpersonal problems, utilizing a personal perspective facilitated the generation of more active solutions for HC participants, but less active solutions for those with SAD. Findings illuminate new research directions regarding social problem solving in social anxiety, with potential implications for applied intervention.

"Effortful control, interpretation biases, and child anxiety symptom severity in a sample of children with anxiety disorders","Introduction: Effortful control—the ability to inhibit impulsive reactions in favor of more adaptive responses—is negatively related to child anxiety severity. One potential explanation is that greater effortful control may “slow down” automatic, threat-laden interpretations, thereby lowering children’s anxiety. The present investigation tested this hypothesis by examining associations between effortful control (and its subcomponents) and anxiety symptom severity, mediated by interpretation biases, in a diverse sample of clinically anxious youth. Method: Participants ( N = 105; M age = 10.09 years, SD = 1.22; 56.7% female; 49% ethnic minority) completed a diagnostic interview; self-report measures of temperament, anxiety, and interpretation biases; a performance-based measure of interpretation biases; and a parent–child interaction task for which an index of behavioral anxiety was computed. Results: Significant indirect effects were found for effortful control, attentional control, and inhibitory control on child self-reported anxiety severity by way of self-reported (but not behaviorally-indexed) interpretation biases. Models predicting behaviorally-indexed child anxiety severity were not significant. Discussion: Greater effortful control may result in enhanced attentional capacities that allow children to assess automatic cognitions more objectively, potentially lowering their anxiety. Future work should evaluate whether targeting malleable temperamental constructs, such as effortful control, leads to clinically meaningful reductions in interpretation biases and child anxiety symptoms.

"Reassurance seeking in the anxiety disorders and OCD: Construct validation, clinical correlates and CBT treatment response","Background: Reassurance seeking has been hypothesized to be a key factor in the maintenance of anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders according to contemporary cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) approaches. The present study sought to examine the structure, clinical correlates, and malleability of reassurance seeking in the context of CBT treatment. Methods: Treatment-seeking participants ( N = 738) with DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/A), social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) completed the Reassurance Seeking Scale (RSS) with other symptom measures prior to and following CBT treatment. Results: A confirmatory factor analysis supported a three factor solution: the need to seek excessive reassurance regarding decisions, attachment and the security of relationships, and perceived general threat and anxiety. The RSS was moderately correlated with general measures of anxiety and depression as well as disorder-specific symptom scales. Further, CBT was found to produce changes in reassurance seeking across CBT treatments and these reductions were significantly associated with disorder-specific clinical improvement. Conclusion: Reassurance seeking appears to be a common factor across anxiety disorders and its reduction in CBT treatment is associated with improved clinical outcomes.

Examining the cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of anxiety sensitivity on indicators of disease severity among patients with inflammatory arthritis,"Few studies have investigated anxiety sensitivity (AS) in the context of inflammatory arthritis (IA), despite evidence of a relationship between AS and pain. This study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between AS and indicators of IA severity in 148 participants with IA. AS and its factors (social, physical, cognitive) were self-reported. Arthritis severity was physician-assessed (disease activity scales) and self-reported (physical function; pain and fatigue). Cross-sectional correlations assessed the association between AS and arthritis severity outcomes. Longitudinal multivariable mixed-effect regressions assessed the association of AS total and AS factors at each visit with disease severity outcomes. All AS factors were significantly and positively correlated (at the same visit) with function, pain, and fatigue. AS total significantly predicted pain, fatigue, and function. Cognitive AS significantly predicted fatigue, and physical AS significantly predicted pain and fatigue. Social AS significantly predicted pain, fatigue, function and weighted joint count (articular burden). AS is associated with several indicators of disease severity among those with IA; unique findings emerged across factors with the broadest disease impact by social AS. The AS factors, especially social AS, may contribute to the development and severity of IA symptoms, which may have implications for interventions.

Processes in cognitive behavior therapy for social anxiety disorder: Predicting subsequent symptom change,"Although cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for social anxiety disorder, little is known about the processes during treatment that bring about change. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the proposed processes of change according to the cognitive model of social anxiety disorder predicted subsequent symptom reduction in CBT delivered as therapist-guided bibliotherapy. We analyzed data from patients with social anxiety disorder ( N = 61) who participated in an effectiveness trial of CBT in primary care. Seven putative processes and outcome (i.e., social anxiety) were assessed on a weekly basis throughout treatment. We used linear mixed models to analyze within-person relations between processes and outcome. The results showed a unidirectional effect of reduced avoidance on subsequent decrease in social anxiety. Further, we found support for reciprocal influences between four of the proposed processes (i.e., estimated probability and cost of adverse outcome, self-focused attention, and safety behaviors) and social anxiety. The remaining two processes, (i.e., anticipatory and post-event processing) did not predict subsequent social anxiety, but were predicted by prior symptom reduction. The findings support that several of the change processes according to the cognitive model of social anxiety disorder are involved in symptom improvement.

Neural responses to social evaluation: The role of fear of positive and negative evaluation,"One of the core features of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the persistent fear of being evaluated. Fear of evaluation includes fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and fear of positive evaluation (FPE). Few studies have examined the relationship between self-reported FNE and FPE and neural responses to simulated negative and positive social evaluation. In the current study, 56 participants, 35 with SAD and 21 healthy controls, completed questionnaires to assess dimensions of social anxiety including FNE and FPE, as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression. Participants also completed a social evaluation task, which involved viewing people delivering criticism and praise, and a control task, which involved counting asterisks, during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although whole-brain analyses did not reveal significant associations between self-reported constructs and neural responses to social evaluation, region of interest analyses for the sample as a whole revealed that both FNE and social anxiety symptoms were associated with greater neural responses to both criticism and praise in emotion-processing brain regions, including the amygdala and anterior insula. There were no significant associations between FPE or depressive symptoms and neural responses to criticism or praise for the sample as a whole. Future research should examine the relationship between FNE, FPE, and neural responses to self-referent social evaluation in an unselected sample to assess a full range of fear of evaluation.

Problematic driving in former service members: An evaluation of the Driving Behavior Survey in veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder,"Despite high levels of traffic-related mortality, injury, and impairment among former service members, measures validated to assess problematic driving in this population remain limited. The current study examined characteristics of the Driving Behavior Survey (DBS) in male veterans (76.3% White; age: M = 56.4, SD = 12.3) meeting criteria for PTSD. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated acceptable fit of a 3-factor model specifying dimensions of anxiety-based performance deficits, exaggerated safety/caution, and hostile/aggressive driving behavior. Concurrent associations with indices of anxiety, depression, trauma history, and clinician-rated PTSD were consistent with small ( r = .10–.29) to medium ( r = .30–.49) effects. Discriminative validity was noted through elevations in performance deficit ( d = .26), safety/caution ( d = .50), and hostile/aggressive ( d = .39) scales relative to published data from student drivers. Scores comparable to civilian motorists with accident-related PTSD help to qualify the severity of problematic driving behavior in trauma-exposed veterans.

"""Do men and women arrive, stay, and respond differently to cognitive behavior group therapy for social anxiety disorder?"": Erratum","Reports an error in ""Do men and women arrive, stay, and respond differently to cognitive behavior group therapy for social anxiety disorder"" by Maya Asher, Haggai Hermesh, Shay Gur, Sofi Marom and Idan Aderka ( Journal of Anxiety Disorders , 2019[May], Vol 64, 64-70). The publisher regrets that several errors were made during the production process, most notably several relating to the authors and their respective affiliations. In addition, two references were inadvertently omitted from the original paper. The correct affiliations and the omitted references are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-27063-009). Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common and debilitating psychiatric disorder with an estimated lifetime prevalence rate of 12.1%. It is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of one or more social situations (e.g., talking to a stranger or peer, going to a party) or performance activities (e.g., giving a speech) in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people, and may face possible scrutiny by others. These difficulties in interpersonal interactions experienced by individuals with SAD result in significant impairment in almost all facets of daily life, including relationships, work, and studies. Considering the large body of research on SAD, and despite accumulating data about gender differences in other disorders there is a paucity of research directly examining gender differences in SAD. However, a recent review of the literature found gender differences in a number of domains of SAD and stressed the need for more research on the topic as gender differences can have substantial clinical implications. The present study is focused on identifying and elucidating gender differences in pretreatment clinical severity, treatment seeking, attrition and treatment response in SAD.

Rural living environment predicts social anxiety in transgender and gender nonconforming individuals across Canada and the United States,"Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals frequently confront discrimination, rejection, and violence. Such experiences may put TGNC individuals at risk for minority stress and associated psychiatric symptoms. Protective factors like social support, pride in one’s gender identity, or connectedness to similar others may make TGNC individuals less vulnerable to psychiatric symptoms, and the presence of risk and protective factors may vary depending on living environment. This study examined the relationship of living environment (urban vs. suburban vs. small-town/rural) to social anxiety (SA) in a sample of 902 TGNC individuals who participated in the Trans Health Survey. Analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in SA across living environments. Those living in small-town/rural environments reported significantly higher levels of SA compared to those living in urban environments. There was a trend-level difference in SA in suburban compared to urban environments. Linear regression analyses revealed that living environment significantly moderated the relationship between social support and SA. Higher social support was more protective against elevated SA in urban and suburban than in small-town/rural environments. This study is the first to demonstrate the experience of elevated SA among TGNC individuals living in rural environments. Implications and future directions for research are discussed.

The impact of uncontrollability beliefs and thought-related distress on ecological momentary interventions for generalized anxiety disorder: A moderated mediation model,"This study was a secondary analysis of LaFreniere and Newman (2016), a randomized controlled trial comparing two ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): The worry outcome journal (WOJ) and thought log (TL). We predicted that higher thought-related distress would be a mediator by which higher uncontrollability beliefs (UB) would hinder the efficacy of the WOJ, but not the TL. Fifty-one undergraduates who met GAD criteria underwent one of the EMIs for 10 days. WOJ users tracked worries, associated distress, interference, expected outcome probabilities, and whether their worries came true four times/day. TL users tracked general thoughts, associated distress, and interference four times/day. Bootstrapping path analysis was used to analyze moderated mediation models. Higher UB predicted higher thought-related distress for both EMIs. Higher UB also predicted reduced efficacy of the WOJ at post-trial and of both EMIs at 30-day follow-up. However, for WOJ users, when higher initial UB levels predicted higher thought-related distress early in treatment, participants reported greater levels of worry at post-trial and follow-up. In contrast, UB’s effect on the TL group at post-trial and follow-up was not mediated by early distress. Thought-related distress appears to be a mechanism by which UB impedes the WOJ intervention.

"Examining a novel, parent child interaction therapy-informed, behavioral treatment of selective mutism","Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new therapy for children with selective mutism (SM) that combines Parent-Child Interaction Therapy principles and behavioral techniques. Method: Children aged 4–10 with a primary diagnosis of SM were eligible to participate. Comorbidity was allowed with the exception of autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, mania or psychosis. Of 54 potentially eligible participants, 33 met inclusion/exclusion criteria of which 31 families consented (94%). Following assessment, children were waitlisted for an average of 4 months before receiving 16 sessions of weekly therapy at an outpatient psychiatry clinic of a children’s hospital in Vancouver, Canada; all children completed treatment. Assessments were conducted at time of referral (baseline), pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3 month follow up, and 1 year follow up. Two did not complete follow up assessments (93% retention). Results: Results showed significant and large (Cohen’s d = 1.80) gains in speaking behaviors across contexts from pre- to post-treatment. Gains were maintained at 3-months and 1-year post-treatment. Statistically significant and large improvements were also found in post-treatment teacher and parent reports of child anxiety as well as a behavioral measure of the child speaking to an unknown adult. Parents reported high satisfaction with treatment. None of the potential predictors of treatment response examined were found to be significant. Conclusions: PCIT-SM appears to be an effective treatment for children aged 4–10 with SM.

Changes in post-event processing during cognitive behavioural therapy for social anxiety disorder: A longitudinal analysis using post-session measurement and experience sampling methodology,"Purpose: Post-event processing (PEP) is posited to be an important factor in the maintenance of social anxiety symptoms. Previous research has demonstrated that general PEP tendencies are sensitive to treatment. However, it remains unclear how momentary PEP following social interactions changes over the course of treatment for social anxiety disorder. The purpose of the present study was to examine how both momentary and general PEP change over the course of treatment, and how such changes predict treatment outcome. Method: Participants (N = 60) with social anxiety disorder were enrolled in group cognitive behavioural therapy. All participants completed measures of PEP and social anxiety symptom severity at five time points over treatment. A subset (N = 33) also completed repeated experience sampling measurements of PEP following social interactions across the course of treatment. Results: Both general and momentary PEP decreased over the course of treatment. Decreases in both types of PEP predicted lower social anxiety symptom severity following treatment. Conclusion: The results of the study demonstrate that momentary experiences of PEP can be influenced by treatment, and can in turn impact treatment outcome. The findings have significant clinical and theoretical implications.

Prevalence and correlates of generalized anxiety disorder in Singapore: Results from the second Singapore Mental Health Study,"The aim of this paper is to report findings on the epidemiology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using data from the Singapore Mental Health Study (SMHS) 2016, and draw comparisons with results from the first SMHS in 2010. Singapore residents aged 18 years and above participated in the household survey where the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 was administered to assess the prevalence of GAD and other mental health conditions. The findings revealed that the lifetime prevalence of GAD was 1.6% among the Singapore general population in 2016, an increase from the 0.9% in 2010. More lifetime GAD cases were reported across several sociodemographic groups including age and employment status. Lifetime GAD was significantly associated with higher odds of several comorbid psychiatric conditions (OR = 3.8–9.3, p &lt; 0.05). Treatment seeking behavior did not differ significantly when compared to SMHS 2010 and there was still a considerable treatment gap among individuals with GAD. Future intervention programs to reduce anxiety and encourage help-seeking behavior could be implemented at institutes of higher learning and workplace settings to reach the targeted audience.

Pupil dilation to emotional expressions in adolescent social anxiety disorder is related to treatment outcome,"Atypical attention to potential social threats, such as emotional faces, may be one of the core mechanisms underlying social anxiety disorder (SAD). Pupil dilation is an index of locus coreuleus-noradrenergic activity, and closely linked to attention. In the present study, pupil dilation was studied in adolescents with SAD ( N = 26; 22 Female) before the onset of a 12-week cognitive behavioral treatment, and in healthy controls ( N = 23). Stimuli were faces with angry or happy emotional expressions. Contrary to our hypothesis, the SAD group did not show hyper-responsiveness to angry compared to happy faces. Instead, an atypical time course of the pupil dilation response was found, resulting in an attenuated response during late time stages. Larger pupil dilation amplitude to happy faces before treatment was related to worse treatment response. These results contribute significantly to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying adolescent SAD.

Childhood adversities and psychopathology among military veterans in the US: The mediating role of social networks,"Childhood adversities can impact negatively on psychological health across the lifespan. Many military veterans have a history of adverse childhood experiences, which when combined with deployment related traumas, can lead to high levels of psychopathology. Social networks can however be protective. The current study aimed to identify typologies of childhood adversity in U.S. military veterans ( n = 3092) and explore relationships between the adversity typologies and PTSD, mood and anxiety disorders, utilising data from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (NESARC-III). The mediating role of quality and quantity of social networks were examined. Latent class analysis identified four adversity classes; 1) baseline, 2) household dysfunction, 3) maltreatment, and 4) multi-adversity. Individuals in the adversity classes (2–4), especially those who experienced multi-adversity had higher rates of psychopathology. The quality of social networks played an important mediating role, while quantity of networks did not. Those who experienced adversity were less likely to have supportive social networks, therefore adversity had both a direct and indirect impact on psychopathology. The findings highlight the importance of developing and maintaining social networks following military life. Recommendations include interpersonal skills training and programmes which may help them engage back into the community and enhance relationships.

Sex differences in the etiology of disgust sensitivity: A preliminary behavioral genetic analysis,"Evidence suggests that Disgust Sensitivity (DS) is a personality trait that may confer risk for the development of some anxiety-related disorders. To examine the origins of this trait we administered the DS subscale of the Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity Scale-Revised to 90 monozygotic and 90 dizygotic twin pairs, of which 55% were women. The DS subscale consists of two dimensions; Somatic Disgust and Ruminative Disgust. Biometrical modeling techniques were used to estimate heritability of the DS dimensions by sex. For women, each dimension was influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. More specifically, 40.1% of the variance in DS was observed to be due to additive genetic factors and the remaining variance due to non-shared environment. Correlations among DS dimensions for women could be explained by genetic and environmental factors influencing the two dimensions. For men, the two dimensions were influenced by environmental but not genetic factors. These findings suggest that the etiology of DS is complex and arises as a function of dimension-specific and non-specific etiologic factors that vary as a function of sex. The implication of these findings for the sex differences in the etiology of some anxiety-related disorders are discussed.

"Self- and other-perceptions of interpersonal problems: Effects of generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and depression","Despite attention on overlap and distinction between generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), interpersonal specificity (distinct, prototypical interpersonal features) between the disorders has been understudied. There is emerging evidence for such specificity (e.g., Erickson et al., 2016), but most studies relied on self-report, and not all studies controlled for shared variance between the disorders, complicating interpretation of findings. The present study extended the literature by examining unique interpersonal correlates of GAD, SAD, and MDD symptoms on self- and informant-report, and how self-informant agreement (both mean-level and correlation) in perception of interpersonal affiliation, dominance, and distress varied as a function of the symptoms. 369 college-aged participants (43% with clinical-level symptoms for at least one of the disorders (GAD, SAD, MDD), 57% non-disordered) and up to three of their significant others rated participants’ interpersonal problems (interpersonal behaviors that were difficult to engage in or engaged in excessively). We found evidence for exploitable tendencies in GAD, socially avoidant and nonassertive tendencies in SAD, and coldness in MDD based on self-report, but not on informant-report. Although self-other correlation was positive across outcomes, participants endorsed higher affiliation and interpersonal distress and lower dominance relative to informants. GAD, SAD, and MDD symptoms showed distinct moderating effects on these self-informant discrepancies. GAD symptoms predicted over-endorsing affiliation, SAD predicted under-endorsing dominance and affiliation, and MDD predicted no discrepancies in affiliation and dominance. The results speak to potential differentiation of the disorders based on distinct patterns of self-other discrepancy in interpersonal perceptions.

“Fear guides the eyes of the beholder”: Assessing gaze avoidance in social anxiety disorder via covert eye tracking of dynamic social stimuli,"Gaze avoidance is an important feature of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and may serve as a biobehavioral marker of SAD. The purpose of the present study was to replicate and extend findings on gaze avoidance in SAD via eye tracking during a computerized social simulation. Patients with SAD ( n = 27) and a (sub)sample of demographically-matched healthy controls (HC; n = 22) completed a computerized, dynamic social simulation task involving video clips of actors giving positive and negative social feedback to the participant. All participants were unknowingly eye tracked during the simulation, and post-study consent was obtained to examine responses. Consistent with the bivalent fear of evaluation (BFOE) model of social anxiety, fear of positive evaluation related systematically to state anxiety in response to positive social feedback, and fear of negative evaluation related systematically to state anxiety in response to negative social feedback. Moreover, compared to HCs, SAD patients exhibited significantly greater global gaze avoidance in response to both the positive and negative video clips. Our results provide strong additional support for gaze avoidance as a biobehavioral marker of SAD, as well as additional support for the BFOE model. Implications for the assessment and treatment of SAD are discussed.

Enhanced cognitive control over task-irrelevant emotional distractors in generalized anxiety disorder versus obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is defined in part by excessive and uncontrollable worry. However, little is known about cognitive control abilities in adults with GAD. The present study examined cognitive control over negative and neutral material in a mixed clinical sample of adults with GAD and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder and a comparison healthy control sample. Participants completed a novel emotional variant of the AX-CPT (eAX-CPT) to index proactive and reactive cognitive control in the presence of negative and neutral distractor stimuli. Participants with GAD demonstrated enhanced cognitive control specifically over negative emotional distractors, relative to neutral distractors (within-subjects) and relative to OCD and controls (between-subjects). Findings were specific to GAD versus trait worry; however, higher trait worry predicted better cognitive control in GAD only. These findings are inconsistent with deficit-based cognitive models of GAD and may be better accounted for by models that conceptualize worry as an intentional (albeit maladaptive) cognitive control or emotion regulation strategy that is actively maintained by individuals with GAD in order to avoid engaging with more distressing emotional information.

Measuring treatment outcome in patients with anxiety disorders: A comparison of the responsiveness of generic and disorder-specific instruments,"Background: For routine outcome monitoring, generic (i.e., broad-based) and disorder-specific instruments are used to monitor patient progress. While disorder-specific instruments may be more sensitive to therapeutic change, generic measures can be applied more broadly and allow for an assessment of therapeutic change, irrespective of a specific anxiety disorder. Our goal was to investigate whether disorder-specific instruments for anxiety disorders are a valuable (or even necessary) addition to generic instruments for an appropriate assessment of treatment outcome in groups of patients. Methods: Data were collected from 2002 to 2013 from psychiatric outpatients in treatment for Social Phobia (SP; n = 834), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD; n = 661), Panic Disorder (PD; n = 944), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD; n = 460), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD; n = 691). Instruments used were the generic Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), The Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (MASQ), and several disorder-specific instruments (e.g., Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, Social Phobia Scale, Panic Appraisal Inventory, etc.). Responsiveness (i.e., sensitivity to therapeutic change) was examined through correlational analyses, effect sizes (ES), and analysis of variance for repeated measures. Results: The MASQ appeared generally more responsive than the BSI, except for the BSI Anxiety subscale for PD. Disorder-specific measures equaled the MASQ and BSI in responsiveness. When statistically significant differences occurred, the ES was small. Discussion/conclusions: For most anxiety disorder groups (i.e., SP, PD and OCD), the MASQ or BSI was equally suited as disorder-specific instruments to detect change at group level. Exceptions are GAD and PTSD. These findings suggest limited incremental information value of disorder-specific instruments over the MASQ and BSI for measuring change.

"""Therapist-led and self-led one-session virtual reality exposure therapy for public speaking anxiety with consumer hardware and software: A randomized controlled trial"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Therapist-led and self-led one-session virtual reality exposure therapy for public speaking anxiety with consumer hardware and software: A randomized controlled trial"" by Philip Lindner, Alexander Miloff, Simon Fagernäs, Joel Andersen, Martin Sigeman, Gerhard Andersson, Tomas Furmark and Per Carlbring ( Journal of Anxiety Disorders , 2019[Jan], Vol 61, 45-54). A phrasing error has been discovered in one of the items of the self-report instrument used as a primary outcome measure in the trial. Consequently, the item is perceived as one that should be reverse-coded (the Swedish equivalent of the word “not” was omitted), yet the total scores used for analyses and reported in the publication were not adjusted for this error. The results of reverse-coding the item and calculating new total scores for each individual and time point are discussed in this corrigendum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-36762-001). Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is a common condition which can be treated effectively with exposure therapy. However, inherent difficulties in stimuli presentation and control limits dissemination and the therapeutic potential. Virtual Reality (VR) technology has the potential to resolve these issues and provide a scalable platform for self-help interventions. No previous study has examined whether this can be achieved using the first generation of consumer VR hardware and software. In the current trial, n = 25 + 25 participants were randomized to either one-session therapist-led VR exposure therapy for PSA followed by a four-week internet-administered VR to in-vivo transition program, or a waiting-list. Linear mixed effects modeling revealed significant, large (within Cohen’s d = 1.67) decreases in self-reported PSA. The waiting-list was then given access to an internet-administered, self-led version of the same VR exposure therapy to be conducted at home, followed by the same transition program. Dual-slope mixed effects modeling revealed significant, large (d = 1.35) decreases in self-reported PSA. Results were maintained or improved at six- and twelve-month follow-ups. We show for the first time that low-cost, off-the-shelf consumer VR hardware and software can be used to conduct exposure therapy for PSA, both in the traditional, previously impractical one-session format, and in a novel self-led, at-home format.

"Safety behaviors, experiential avoidance, and anxiety: A path analysis approach","Avoidance has long been viewed as an etiological mechanism of anxiety disorders. Of more recent focus within this literature is the distinction between avoidance that is trait-based (experiential avoidance) versus contextual (safety behaviors). Whereas both experiential avoidance and safety behaviors have been studied within anxiety research, no known studies have evaluated the direct and indirect relationships of these forms of avoidance in predicting critical outcomes, particularly in conjunction with symptom severity. To address this gap, the current study assessed social anxiety and panic symptoms, experiential avoidance, use of preventive and restorative safety behaviors, and quality of life to determine the direct and indirect contributions of trait-based and contextual avoidance in predicting clinically relevant outcomes via path analysis. U.S. adults with elevated social anxiety or panic symptoms ( n = 254) were recruited online. Results from path analysis showed that, across groups, the relationship between symptoms and quality of life was indirectly accounted for by use of preventive safety behaviors. Further, for participants with panic symptoms (but not for those with social anxiety symptoms), experiential avoidance predicted quality of life even after accounting for use of preventive safety behaviors. The results of this study indicate that trait-based and contextual avoidance contribute significantly to clinically relevant outcomes.

"Do men and women arrive, stay, and respond differently to cognitive behavior group therapy for social anxiety disorder?","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 67[102119] of Journal of Anxiety Disorders (see record 2019-55015-001). The publisher regrets that several errors were made during the production process, most notably several relating to the authors and their respective affiliations. In addition, two references were inadvertently omitted from the original paper. The correct affiliations and the omitted references are present in the erratum.] Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common and debilitating psychiatric disorder with an estimated lifetime prevalence rate of 12.1%. It is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of one or more social situations (e.g., talking to a stranger or peer, going to a party) or performance activities (e.g., giving a speech) in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people, and may face possible scrutiny by others. These difficulties in interpersonal interactions experienced by individuals with SAD result in significant impairment in almost all facets of daily life, including relationships, work, and studies. Considering the large body of research on SAD, and despite accumulating data about gender differences in other disorders there is a paucity of research directly examining gender differences in SAD. However, a recent review of the literature found gender differences in a number of domains of SAD and stressed the need for more research on the topic as gender differences can have substantial clinical implications. The present study is focused on identifying and elucidating gender differences in pretreatment clinical severity, treatment seeking, attrition and treatment response in SAD.

External validation of the international risk prediction algorithm for the onset of generalized anxiety and/or panic syndromes (the Predict A) in the US general population,"Introduction: Multivariable risk prediction algorithms are useful for making clinical decisions and health planning. While prediction algorithms for new onset of anxiety disorders in Europe and elsewhere have been developed, the performance of these algorithms in the Americas is not known. The objective of this study was to validate the PredictA algorithm for new onset of anxiety and/or panic disorders in the US general population. Methods: Longitudinal study design was conducted with approximate 2-year follow-up data from a total of 24 626 individuals who participated in Wave 1 and 2 of the US National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) and who did not have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder in the past year at Wave 1. The PredictA algorithm was directly applied to the selected participants. Results: Among the participants, 5.4% developed GAD and/or panic disorder over two years. The PredictA algorithm had a discriminative power (C-statistics = 0.62, 95%CI: 0.61; 0.64), but poor calibration (p &lt; 0.001) with the NESARC data. The observed and the mean predicted risk of GAD and/or panic disorders in the NESARC were 5.3% and 3.6%, respectively. Particularly, the observed and predicted risks of GAD and/or panic disorders in the highest decile of risk score in the NESARC participants were 13.3% and 10.4%, respectively. Conclusion: The PredictA algorithm has acceptable discrimination, but the calibration with the NESARC data was poor. The PredictA algorithm is likely to underestimate the risk of GAD/panic disorders in the US population. Therefore, the use of PredictA in the US general population for predicting individual risk of GAD and/or panic disorders is not encouraged.

An integrative review of the vigilance-avoidance model in pediatric anxiety disorders: Are we looking in the wrong place?,"Enduring cognitive models of anxiety posit that negative biases in information processing are implicated in the etiology, maintenance, and recurrence of anxiety disorders in youth and adults. Specifically, the vigilance-avoidance model of attention is an influential hypothesis proposed to explain anxious individuals’ attentional patterns. The vigilance-avoidance model posits that anxious individuals, relative to nonanxious individuals, initially orient more quickly to threatening stimuli and then later avoid threatening stimuli. However, a large body of empirical research examining attentional mechanisms in anxious individuals uses paradigms that do not allow the measurement of the time course of attention. Furthermore, existing reviews that examine the time course of attention only include studies with adults. We systematically review in depth the literature that compares anxious and non-anxious children that takes advantage of research designs that allow the examination of the time course of attention. Across studies, there is not robust support for the vigilance-avoidance model in samples of anxious youth. Future research examining attention biases across time should employ tasks that more directly measure multiple stages of attention, in order to assess if vigilance-avoidance patterns emerge based on sample characteristics or task variables, and to inform intervention efforts.

Heart rate variability in patients with agoraphobia with or without panic disorder remains stable during CBT but increases following in-vivo exposure,"Patients with anxiety disorders have a lower heart rate variability (HRV) than healthy controls. Low HRV is associated with cardiovascular disease and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The aim of the present study was to investigate if HRV in patients with agoraphobia with or without panic disorder can be influenced by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). 73 patients with agoraphobia with or without panic disorder were included in the study. Heart rate (HR) and HRV were recorded at rest before and after CBT and during in-vivo exposure. No changes in HR and HRV were observed throughout therapy. During in-vivo exposure HRV increased significantly and HR exhibited a tendency to decrease. Despite clinical improvement of anxiety symptoms, ANS activity at rest did not seem to be influenced by CBT. However, during in-vivo exposure, HRV changed significantly, indicating a higher parasympathetic activity at the end of exposure.

The efficacy of interventions for test-anxious university students: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Test anxiety (TA) is highly distressing and can significantly undermine academic performance. Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for university students with TA have been conducted, but there has been no systematic review of their efficacy. This meta-analysis examines the efficacy of interventions for test-anxious university students in: (i) reducing TA, and (ii) improving academic performance. We searched for RCTs published in English language peer-reviewed journals. Forty-four RCTs met our eligibility criteria ( n = 2,209). Interventions were superior to control conditions at post-treatment for reducing TA ( g = −0.76) and improving academic performance ( g = 0.37). Interventions were superior to control conditions at follow-up. Subgroups analyses found most support for behaviour therapy. Cognitive-behavioural therapy, study skills training, and combined psychological and study skills training interventions show promise but lack evidence for their longer-term efficacy, and results are based upon a small number of studies. Evidence of publication bias was found and poor quality of reporting meant that confidence in results should be moderated. Future RCTs should be conducted and reported with greater rigour, have larger samples, and examine newer interventions.

An initial review of residual symptoms after empirically supported trauma-focused cognitive behavioral psychological treatment,"Objective: Although residual symptoms remain following clinical treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), little is known about the characteristics of these residual symptoms. We aimed to determine the type, severity, and frequency of symptoms that remain after trauma-focused psychotherapy. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of 51 randomized controlled trials of empirically supported psychosocial interventions for PTSD (68 total treatment arms). Outcomes included: 1) PTSD symptoms and 2) conditions commonly comorbid with PTSD: depression, anxiety, and quality of life impairment. Results: In general, the results revealed that participants who completed PTSD treatment continued to report residual PTSD symptoms: 31% reported clinical symptom levels, and 59% reported subthreshold levels at posttreatment, particularly within the hyperarousal cluster. Residual symptoms also emerged for depression (19% clinical), anxiety (55% clinical), and quality of life (36% clinical). Few differences emerged across treatment types, but differential patterns were revealed for sample/trauma types. Conclusions: Results suggest a need for focused research attention to and clinical assessment of individual residual symptoms following empirically supported treatment for PTSD to determine whether further treatment sessions are warranted.

Preference trial of internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy comparing standard weekly versus optional weekly therapist support,"Emerging evidence from research trials suggests that Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) produces similar symptom improvements whether patients receive weekly therapist support ( standard support ) or therapist support only when requested ( optional support ). It remains unknown, however, how many patients receiving ICBT as part of routine clinical care would prefer optional support compared to standard support and how outcomes compare when patients select their preferred treatment option. In this uncontrolled trial, we investigated patient preference and outcomes for standard versus optional support among patients with depression and or anxiety who were offered an 8-week transdiagnostic ICBT intervention in routine care. Of 401 patients accepted for ICBT, 22% selected optional support and 78% selected standard support. At assessment, patients who selected optional support had lower symptoms of anxiety and panic than patients who selected standard support. At post-treatment, both groups achieved similar large improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression, with improvements sustained at 3-month follow-up. Patients receiving optional support sent and received fewer messages compared to patients receiving standard support. This study demonstrates the potential of optional therapist support to meet the needs and preferences of patients and to also reduce therapist costs in routine care.

Inverse reasoning processes in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Replication in a clinical sample,"The inference-based approach (IBA) is one cognitive model that aims to explain the aetiology and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). IBA theory suggests that certain reasoning processes lead an individual with OCD to confuse imagined possibilities with actual probabilities, a process termed inferential confusion. One such reasoning process is inverse reasoning, where hypothetical causes form the basis of conclusions about reality. Recently, we developed a task-based measure of inverse reasoning. In an online sample, we reported significant and positive associations between endorsement of inverse reasoning on this task and OCD symptomatology. We concluded that there was some support for the role of inverse reasoning in OCD but these results required extension using a between-groups design in a clinical sample. Therefore, the present study compared endorsement in inverse reasoning on this task between individuals diagnosed with OCD, anxiety and/or mood disorder (clinical controls), and healthy individuals (healthy controls). Relative to both control groups, the OCD group demonstrated significantly greater endorsement in inverse reasoning on scenarios where OCD relevant concerns were prompted. When non-OCD relevant concerns were involved, the OCD group only evidenced greater endorsement in inverse reasoning relative to the healthy control group. Implications for IBA theory are discussed.

Mapping the frequency and severity of anxiety behaviors in preschool-aged children,"Although anxiety can be early-emerging, impairing, and persistent, behaviors relevant to anxiety mirror typical development in early childhood. To better understand the spectrum of typical to problematic behavior, this study characterizes the range of frequency and severity of separation and social anxiety behaviors and associated impairment in preschool-aged children using a novel daily diary method. Primary caregivers of 291 3-5-year-old children reported the frequency of children’s daily separation and social anxiety behaviors and related impairment for 14 days. Frequencies of each separation and social anxiety behavior were computed and item response theory analyses revealed the specific frequencies at which the behavior was considered psychometrically severe/rare. Patterns varied across items; for example, worry that caregiver would not return and shyness with familiar adults had to occur at least 3–4 times over 14 days for the behavior to be considered severe/rare, whereas shyness around peers and new people were not severe at any frequency. In addition, behaviors were associated with impairment. To our knowledge, these data are the first to delineate empirical, dimensional information about the frequency and severity of anxiety behaviors and associated impairment in early childhood. Such data could be useful for clinical practice to enhance empirically-driven assessment of anxiety.

A systematic review of the role of parents in the development of anxious cognitions in children,"Anxious cognitions and parental behavior are important in the development of child anxiety. The current review aims to appraise the literature on the relationship between parental factors and chid anxious cognitions. Online database searches of PsycInfo, Scopus, ProQuest Dissertations and Web of Science were systematically searched using key terms related to ‘parent’, ‘child’, ‘anxiety’ and ‘cognitions’. Included studies (N = 13) were quality assessed and study findings were appraised in line with cognitive behavioral frameworks of the parental pathways to the development of anxious cognitions in children. Reviewed studies confirmed that parental factors have a role in the development of their children’s anxious cognitions by modelling fearful responses, reducing their child’s autonomy, and indirectly via their own expectations about their child. Limitations of the literature are considered, including issues of measurement. Future research should consider multi-modal assessment of parental factors and examine parental behavior and child anxious cognitions in the context of real-life threatening events.

Intolerance of uncertainty and &lt;i&gt;DSM-5&lt;/i&gt; PTSD symptoms: Associations among a treatment seeking veteran sample,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU), defined as an inability to tolerate the unpleasant response triggered by the observed absence of information, has received increased empirical attention in recent years. The contribution of this cognitive behavioral construct to the etiology and maintenance of various anxiety disorders has become increasingly recognized. However, the relationship between IU and other affective disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), remains largely unexplored. The current study sought to examine the relationship between IU and overall PTSD symptom and cluster severity using an outpatient sample of veterans ( N = 116) assessed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth edition ( DSM-5 ) PTSD symptom structure. Results revealed that IU was significantly associated with overall PTSD symptom severity, above and beyond relevant covariates. Further, IU was significantly associated with the PTSD avoidance and hyperarousal clusters. Prospective IU, rather than inhibitory IU, accounted for these unique associations. These findings add to a growing body of literature establishing IU as a transdiagnostic risk factor and point to the importance of future research on the role of IU in contributing to and/or maintaining PTSD symptoms.

Family accommodation mediates nightmares and sleep-related problems in anxious children,"Nightmares are commonly reported in clinically anxious children and are associated with the presence of other sleep-related problems. Family accommodation has been theorized as playing a central role in the sleep-related problems of anxious children, but empirical data is lacking. We examined associations between nightmares, maternal reports of family accommodation, and sleep-related problems in clinically anxious children. We also examined a hypothesized mediational pathway linking nightmares to other sleep-related problems, through increased family accommodation using structural equation modeling. Participants were 277 clinically anxious children (ages 6–17), and their mothers. Nightmares were reported in over three quarters of the children and were linked to higher mother-rated accommodation and to sleep-related problems. Fit indices for the structural equation model were excellent, and data supported the hypothesis that family accommodation mediates the association between nightmares and sleep-related problems in the anxious children. Results provide the first empirical evidence for the role of family accommodation in nightmares and other sleep-related problems in anxious children. Implications for assessment and treatment of childhood anxiety are discussed.

Efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy for the treatment of dental phobia in adults: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Although Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) has proven to be effective in the treatment of various subtypes of specific phobia, there is limited evidence of its role in the treatment of dental phobia. Method: A single-blind RCT was conducted among 30 randomized patients with dental phobia to either VRET or informational pamphlet (IP) condition. Primary outcome anxiety measures (VAS-A, MDAS and DFS) were evaluated at baseline, pre- and post-intervention, 1-week, 3-months and 6-months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures assessed were pre-post behavioral avoidance, temporal variations of heart rate and VR-experience during and post-VRET, and dental treatment acceptance in both conditions at 6-month follow-up. Results: Intention to treat analysis, using a repeated measures MANOVA, revealed a multivariate interaction effect between time and condition (p = 0.015) for all primary outcome measures (all ps &lt; 0.001). Only patients of the VRET condition showed a significant reduction in anxiety scores (mean reduction [s.d.]: VAS-A 44.4 [36.1]; MDAS 7.1 [5.4]; DFS 21.2 [13.1]) whereas the patients in the IP group did not (mean reduction [s.d.]: VAS-A −0.33 [7.7]; MDAS −0.33 [1.3]; DFS −1.9 [3.8]), F (15, 14) = 3.3, p = 0.015. Conclusions: VRET was found to be efficacious in the treatment of dental phobia.

The relationship between anxiety symptom severity and problematic smartphone use: A review of the literature and conceptual frameworks,"In the present paper, we examine the literature studying relations between problematic smartphone use (PSU) and anxiety symptom severity. We first present background on the health advantages and disadvantages of using a smartphone. Next, we provide caveats in distinguishing healthy smartphone use from unhealthy PSU, and we discuss how PSU is measured. Additionally, we discuss theoretical frameworks explaining how some people develop PSU, including Uses and Gratifications Theory, and Compensatory Internet Use Theory. We present our own theoretical model of how PSU is specifically related to anxiety. We discuss and review mental health constructs associated with PSU severity, based on prior literature. Next, we systematically review the research on PSU severity in relation to anxiety symptoms, given the recent growth of studies on this research question. Finally, we offer implications and recommendations for future research in this area.

Deterioration rates in Virtual Reality Therapy: An individual patient data level meta-analysis,"Ample evidence supports the use of Virtual Reality (VR) for anxiety disorders. Nonetheless, currently there is no evidence about moderators or potential negative effects of VR treatment strategies. An Individual Patient Data (IPD) approach was employed with 15 retrieved datasets. The current study sample was composed of 810 patients. Randomized control trials (RCTs) for each primary outcome measure were performed, in addition to moderator analyses of the socio-demographic variables. Deterioration rates were 14 patients (4.0%) in VR, 8 (2.8%) in active control conditions, and 27 (15%) in the WL condition. With regard to receiving treatment, patients in a waiting list control condition had greater odds of deteriorating than in the two active conditions, odds ratios (ORs) 4.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.05, 0.67]. In the case of the socio-demographic variables, none of them were associated with higher or lower odds of deterioration, with the exception of marital status in the WL condition; married people presented a significantly lower probability of deterioration, OR 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.67]. Finally, when comparing pooled effects of VR versus all control conditions, the OR was 0.61 (95% CI 0.31–1.23) in favor of VR, although this result was not statistically significant. This study provides evidence about the deterioration rates of a therapeutic VR approach, showing that the number of deteriorated patients coincides with other therapeutic approaches, and that deterioration is less likely to occur, compared to patients in WL control groups.

Virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety and related disorders: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Trials of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) for anxiety-related disorders have proliferated in number and diversity since our previous meta-analysis that examined 13 total trials, most of which were for specific phobias (Powers &amp; Emmelkamp, 2008). Since then, new trials have compared VRET to more diverse anxiety and related disorders including social anxiety disorder (SAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder (PD) with and without agoraphobia. With the availability of this data, it is imperative to re-examine the efficacy of VRET for anxiety. A literature search for randomized controlled trials of VRET versus control or in vivo exposure yielded 30 studies with 1057 participants. Fourteen studies tested VRET for specific phobias, 8 for SAD or performance anxiety, 5 for PTSD, and 3 for PD. A random effects analysis estimated a large effect size for VRET versus waitlist ( g = 0.90) and a medium to large effect size for VRET versus psychological placebo conditions ( g = 0.78). A comparison of VRET and in vivo conditions did not show significantly different effect sizes ( g = −0.07). These findings were relatively consistent across disorders. A meta-regression analysis revealed that larger sample sizes were associated with lower effect sizes in VRET versus control comparisons (β = −0.007, p &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that VRET is an effective and equal medium for exposure therapy.

Therapist-led and self-led one-session virtual reality exposure therapy for public speaking anxiety with consumer hardware and software: A randomized controlled trial,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 64 of Journal of Anxiety Disorders (see record 2019-27063-012). A phrasing error has been discovered in one of the items of the self-report instrument used as a primary outcome measure in the trial. Consequently, the item is perceived as one that should be reverse-coded (the Swedish equivalent of the word “not” was omitted), yet the total scores used for analyses and reported in the publication were not adjusted for this error. The results of reverse-coding the item and calculating new total scores for each individual and time point are discussed in the erratum.] Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is a common condition which can be treated effectively with exposure therapy. However, inherent difficulties in stimuli presentation and control limits dissemination and the therapeutic potential. Virtual Reality (VR) technology has the potential to resolve these issues and provide a scalable platform for self-help interventions. No previous study has examined whether this can be achieved using the first generation of consumer VR hardware and software. In the current trial, n = 25 + 25 participants were randomized to either one-session therapist-led VR exposure therapy for PSA followed by a four-week internet-administered VR to in-vivo transition program, or a waiting-list. Linear mixed effects modeling revealed significant, large (within Cohen’s d = 1.67) decreases in self-reported PSA. The waiting-list was then given access to an internet-administered, self-led version of the same VR exposure therapy to be conducted at home, followed by the same transition program. Dual-slope mixed effects modeling revealed significant, large (d = 1.35) decreases in self-reported PSA. Results were maintained or improved at six- and twelve-month follow-ups. We show for the first time that low-cost, off-the-shelf consumer VR hardware and software can be used to conduct exposure therapy for PSA, both in the traditional, previously impractical one-session format, and in a novel self-led, at-home format.

A meta-analytic examination of attrition in virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety disorders,"A proposed advantage of virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety disorders is that people will be less likely to drop out of treatment prematurely if the treatment involves facing one’s fear in a virtual world rather than the real world, but this has yet to be empirically tested. The present meta-analyses assess the odds of dropout from virtual reality exposure therapy compared to in vivo exposure therapy, estimate the overall rate of dropout from virtual reality exposure treatment, and test potential moderating variables. The odds ratio meta-analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in the likelihood of attrition from virtual reality exposure therapy relative to in vivo exposure therapy. The overall attrition rate for virtual reality exposure therapy across 46 studies with a combined sample size of 1057 participants was 16%. This rate is slightly lower than other estimates of dropout from in vivo therapy and from cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders. Incorporation of between-session intervention (i.e., homework) was identified as a moderator; specifically, inclusion of between-session interventions in the treatment was associated with better retention. Overall, the findings of the present study indicate that virtual reality exposure and in vivo exposure therapy show similar rates of attrition.

"Navigating the social world: The role of social competence, peer victimisation and friendship quality in the development of social anxiety in childhood","Social and communication (SC) difficulties predict increased social anxiety (SA) symptoms in childhood. Peer victimisation and friendship quality are commonly associated with both SC difficulties and SA. Based on this, we tested for a cascade effect of early SC difficulties, peer victimisation and friendship quality on SA in late childhood, using a population-based sample of 8028 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Parent-reported data were collected on SC difficulties at age 7 and SA at age 7, 10 and 13. Child-reported data on peer victimisation and friendship quality were collected at age 8. Our results revealed that SC difficulties predict increased negative friendship qualities and peer victimisation. Relational victimisation predicted increased SA symptoms at 13 years old. Neither overt nor relational victimisation mediated the developmental relationship between SC difficulties and SA. Furthermore, friendship quality did not moderate the developmental relationship between SC difficulties and SA. In addition, no sex differences were observed. The evidence demonstrates that peer victimisation and friendship quality do not explain why some children with SC difficulties go on to develop SA. Future research clarifying the complex etiological pathways contributing towards the development of SA in childhood and adolescence is warranted.

"Moving toward a metacognitive conceptualization of cyberchondria: Examining the contribution of metacognitive beliefs, beliefs about rituals, and stop signals","Cyberchondria refers to the repeated use of the Internet to search for health information that leads to negative consequences. The present set of studies examined the tenability of a proposed metacognitive conceptualization of cyberchondria that includes metacognitive beliefs about health-related thoughts, beliefs about rituals, and stop signals. The contribution of those variables to cyberchondria was examined among 330 undergraduate students from a U.S. university in Study 1 and 331 U.S. community respondents in Study 2. All participants reported using the Internet to search for health information. Across both studies, metacognitive beliefs, beliefs about rituals, and stop signals shared positive bivariate associations with cyberchondria and accounted for unique variance in cyberchondria scores in multivariate analyses. Beliefs about rituals and stop signals emerged as relatively specific to cyberchondria versus health anxiety in multivariate analyses. Results provide preliminary support for a metacognitive conceptualization of cyberchondria, with extensions of the present findings discussed.

The efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy for the treatment of perinatal anxiety symptoms: A preliminary meta-analysis,"Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is considered the psychological treatment of choice for anxiety disorders in the general population. However the efficacy of CBT for anxiety that occurs during the perinatal period, defined as the period from conception to 12 months post birth, is less understood. Perinatal anxiety is a complex and multifaceted problem that can affect both the pregnant women and the unborn child, as well as the wider family unit. The aim of this study was to synthesize the current empirical status of CBT for perinatal anxiety using a meta-analytic approach. Relevant articles were identified through a search of electronic databases through to June 2018. The search terms used include ‘anxiety’ or ‘phobia’ AND ‘perinatal’ or ‘pregnan* or ‘postnatal’ or ‘postpartum’ AND ‘CBT’ or ‘cognitive behav* therapy’. Randomized and non-randomized studies were included within the meta-analysis. A total of 13 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled between-group mean effect size was small at post treatment ( k = 7; d = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.08–0.91) favoring the CBT treatments ( Q ₁ = 30.13, p &lt;.001). Heterogeneity was high ( I ² = 80.09). The pooled within-group mean effect size was large across the treatment groups from pre-treatment to post-treatment when combining all of the studies (i.e., controlled and uncontrolled studies; k = 14; d = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.63–1.17). Heterogeneity was high ( I ² = 88.55). Some preliminary and exploratory moderator analyses were also conducted to inform potential future research in this field.

Cognitive-behavior therapy for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders: A meta-analysis of secondary outcomes,"Anxiety-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) effectively reduces anxiety in children and adolescents. An important remaining question is to what extent anxiety-focused CBT also affects broader outcome domains. Additionally, it remains unclear whether parental involvement in treatment may have impact on domains other than anxiety. A meta-analysis (n studies = 42, n participants = 3239) of the effects of CBT and the moderating role of parental involvement was conducted on the following major secondary outcomes: depressive symptoms, externalizing behaviors, general functioning, and social competence. Randomized controlled trials were included when having a waitlist or active control condition, a youth sample (aged &lt; 19) with a primary anxiety disorder diagnosis receiving anxiety-focused CBT and reported secondary outcomes. Controlled effect sizes (Cohen’s d ) were calculated employing random effect models. CBT had a large effect on general functioning (-1.25[-1.59;0.90], n studies = 17), a small to moderate effect on depressive symptoms (-0.31[-0.41;-0.22], n studies = 31) and a small effect on externalizing behaviors (-0.23[-0.38;-0.09], n studies = 12) from pre-to post-treatment. Effects remained or even further improved at follow-up. Social competence only improved at follow-up (n studies = 6). Concluding, anxiety-focused CBT has a positive effect on broader outcome domains than just anxiety. Higher parental involvement seemed to have beneficial effects at follow-up, with improvements in general functioning and comorbid symptoms.

The latent profile analysis of Chinese adolescents’ anxiety: Examination and validation,"The main purpose of current study was to investigate the characteristics of anxiety in Chinese adolescents using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) with the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders. LPA was conducted with a sample of 2158 participants aged 12–20 years from 3 urban schools in Beijing, China. Results suggested a best-fitting model with three profiles: Low Group with Diffuse Types of Anxiety, Moderate Group with Predominant Generalized and Social Anxiety and High Group with Predominant Somatization Anxiety. Additional analyses using Regression Mixture Modeling suggested that older adolescents and girls were significantly more likely to be classified into the High Group with Predominant Somatization Anxiety. Finally, in support of the construct validity of the anxiety profiles, differential negative cognitions, especially the subscales measuring cognitions about social threat and physical threat, predicted the anxiety profiles. The current study supports an intuitive model of adolescent anxiety in a large, non-Western population with clinical implications for anxious adolescents in China.

Exploring behavioral pattern separation and risk for emotional disorders,"Pattern separation is a facet of memory encoding that facilitates the adaptive integration of old and new experiences. At the computational level, this process reduces overlap between how two entities are represented. Behaviorally, this allows for greater memory resolution while avoiding memory interference; similar entities are perceived as distinct. Poor pattern separation could contribute to psychopathology, especially anxiety, as individuals with high anxiety tend to overgeneralize their perception of threat, or have difficulty distinguishing between currently safe contexts and previously threatening ones. However, there is little empirical work examining this as a contributory mechanism of anxiety in humans. This study examines the relationship between behavioral pattern separation, anxiety, and related symptoms. Participants (N = 111) completed questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, stress, trait worry, and state affect. They then completed the Mnemonic Similarity Task, a computerized test that serves as a putative behavioral proxy to tax and thus measure hippocampal pattern separation. Behavioral pattern separation performance alone was not predictive of high anxiety, depression, or stress. However, two significant interactions emerged. The interactions between performance and state affect, and between performance and trait worry predicted anxious and depressive symptoms. Only at higher levels of negative affect was performance predictive of symptom severity. Similarly, poor pattern separation and high trait worry together predicted the most severe symptoms. This project provides support for behavioral pattern separation as a plausible factor in anxiety and related psychopathology, particularly in combination with sensitivity to acute distress and known risk factors, such as trait worry.

Predictors of long-term outcome of CBT for youth with anxiety disorders treated in community clinics,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven long-term effects in youth with anxiety disorders. However, only a few studies have examined predictors of long-term outcomes of CBT treatment. The present study investigated possible predictors of long-term treatment outcomes in youth with mixed anxiety disorders treated in community mental health clinics. A total of 139 youth (mean age at assessment 15.5 years, range 11–21 years) with a principal diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and/or generalized anxiety disorder were evaluated a mean of 3.9 years post-treatment (range 2.2–5.9 years). Outcomes were loss of all inclusion anxiety diagnoses, loss of the principal inclusion anxiety diagnosis, and changes in youth- and parent-rated youth anxiety symptoms. Predictors encompassed youth, parent and demographic factors, and post-treatment recovery. The most consistent finding was that low family social class predicted poorer outcomes. Higher treatment motivation was associated with better outcome whereas a diagnosis of social anxiety was associated with poorer outcome. Identified predictors extend on previous findings from efficacy trials, and the results indicate a need for more specific treatment protocols.

A pilot randomized clinical trial of cognitive behavioral therapy versus attentional bias modification for social anxiety disorder: An examination of outcomes and theory-based mechanisms,"No studies have compared face-to-face cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and attention bias modification (ABM) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and their purported mechanisms. We asked: 1) Is CBT more effective than ABM? and 2) Are changes in attentional biases and cognitions temporally related to symptom change? Forty-three patients were randomly assigned to 8 sessions of ABM or up to 20 sessions of individual CBT. Intent-to-treat results revealed that CBT was superior to ABM in response rates and on symptom measures at endpoint, but not on other measures. No differences were found on measures in rates of change between CBT and ABM. Frequency of negative cognitions changed in both groups and negative beliefs changed only in CBT. Attentional bias did not change in either group. Cognitive changes bidirectionally correlated with symptom change in cross-lagged analyses in CBT, but not in ABM, suggesting a reciprocal relationship. Trial-level bias away from negative faces was simultaneously related to symptom change in ABM only. Results suggest that CBT is superior to ABM when administered at their typical doses, but raise questions given the similar rates of change. In addition, results support theories of cognitive change and raise questions about changes in attentional biases in CBT.

Corrigendum to “A network analysis of DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder and functional impairment in UK treatment-seeking veterans”,"Reports an error in ""A network analysis of DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder and functional impairment in UK treatment-seeking veterans"" by Jana Ross, Dominic Murphy and Cherie Armour ( Journal of Anxiety Disorders , 2018[Jun], Vol 57, 7-15). The authors regret that Fig. 2 (page 10) is incorrect. The correct Fig. 2 is included in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-30164-003). Network analysis is a relatively new methodology for studying psychological disorders. It focuses on the associations between individual symptoms which are hypothesized to mutually interact with each other. The current study represents the first network analysis conducted with treatment-seeking military veterans in UK. The study aimed to examine the network structure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and four domains of functional impairment by identifying the most central (i.e., important) symptoms of PTSD and by identifying those symptoms of PTSD that are related to functional impairment. Participants were 331 military veterans with probable PTSD. In the first step, a network of PTSD symptoms based on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 was estimated. In the second step, functional impairment items were added to the network. The most central symptoms of PTSD were recurrent thoughts, nightmares, negative emotional state, detachment and exaggerated startle response. Functional impairment was related to a number of different PTSD symptoms. Impairments in close relationships were associated primarily with the negative alterations in cognitions and mood symptoms and impairments in home management were associated primarily with the reexperiencing symptoms. The results are discussed in relation to previous PTSD network studies and include implications for clinical practice.

The effects of psychosocial interventions on death anxiety: A meta-analysis and systematic review of randomised controlled trials,"Death anxiety has been proposed as a transdiagnostic construct, underlying numerous mental disorders. Although it has been argued that treatments, which reduce death anxiety, are needed, research investigating the impact of interventions on death fears has produced mixed results. As such, the current meta-analysis aimed to examine the effect of psychosocial interventions on death anxiety. Overall, results from 15 randomised controlled trials suggested that psychosocial treatments produced significant reductions in death anxiety, with a small to medium effect size ( g = .45). Intervention type (death education vs. therapy) did not significantly moderate the effect of intervention on death anxiety ( g = −.47). However, therapy type was a significant moderator of treatment efficacy ( g = −1.39). Cognitive Behaviour Therapy was found to be particularly efficacious, producing significant reductions in death anxiety relative to control ( g = 1.7), whereas other therapies did not ( g = .20). The number of treatment sessions and baseline death anxiety significantly moderated intervention efficacy, whereas the duration of the intervention, training of the interventionist, and clinical nature of the sample did not. Given the small number and generally low quality of the included studies, future research using more rigorous methodology, as well as clinical samples, is needed.

Does CBT for anxiety-related disorders alter suicidal ideation? Findings from a naturalistic sample,"Background: Anxiety disorders commonly co-occur with suicidal ideation (SI). To our knowledge, no studies have reported on the baseline prevalence of SI and the reduction in SI in a naturalistic sample receiving cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for anxiety-related disorders. Methods: Participants ( n = 355) recruited from an anxiety specialty clinic reported SI at pre-, mid-, and post-CBT. Multilevel mixed effects logistic regression models compared differences in SI endorsement over Time. Results: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) were associated with significantly elevated baseline SI relative to specific phobia. PTSD and unspecified anxiety-related disorders were associated with significant reductions in SI, whereas reductions in SAD, GAD, OCD, and panic disorder did not reach significance. Rates of new onset and exacerbation of SI were low. Discussion: CBT for anxiety disorders was associated with significant reductions in SI over time, with no evidence for exacerbation of suicide risk. Clinical implications are discussed, as well as future research directions to further understand the effect of anxiety disorder treatments on SI.

Brief treatment for nighttime fears and co-sleeping problems: A randomized clinical trial,"Sixty-eight 4–6 year old children who co-slept with their parents and who avoided sleeping alone due to intense nighttime fears were randomized to a brief combined parent-based intervention (CBT-based bibliotherapy plus doll) or a wait list control group. After the waiting period, the wait list participants were offered treatment. Co-sleeping patterns, sleep records, anxiety, general fears, and behavior problems were assessed with parent-report measures. Nighttime fears were assessed with parent-report measures and a single item visual analogue scale for the young children. Assessments were completed pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3 months following treatment. Results showed that the combined intervention was superior to the wait list control condition and that treatment effects were maintained at 3-month follow-up. This study provides initial support for use of CBT-based bibliotherapy plus doll in the treatment of nighttime fears. Such a treatment might be used to supplement standard CBT approaches in routine clinical practice or in a stepped care approach to treatment.

Mental imagery in dentistry: Phenomenology and role in dental anxiety,"Dental anxiety is a prevalent problem with marked psychological, physical and public health implications. Based on cognitive theory and evidence, we hypothesized that vivid, sensory image-based cognitions play a role in dental anxiety. A quantitative online survey (N = 306) and qualitative semi-structured interviews (N = 18) found that vivid sensory images were common irrespective of dental anxiety levels, but that their content, associated distress and responses varied. Participants reporting higher anxiety experienced intense and intrusive fear-provoking dental imagery focusing on unpleasant sensations, which were associated with the intrusive recollection of negative past experiences and avoidance of dentistry. Participants with lower anxiety ratings, reported images that were less distressing and centered around reassuring aspects and positive appointment outcomes, potentially acting as protective factors against dental anxiety and facilitating appointment attendance. The inclusion of components aimed at reducing intrusive memories and dental imagery rescripting may help improve interventions for dental anxiety.

Children with social anxiety disorder show blunted pupillary reactivity and altered eye contact processing in response to emotional faces: Insights from pupillometry and eye movements,"Cognitive models and adult research associate social anxiety disorder (SAD) with hypervigilant-avoidant processing of social information, such as eye contact. However, processing biases in childhood SAD remain mostly unexplored. We examined 10- to 13-year-old children’s eye contact processing and pupil dilation in response to happy, neutral, and angry faces in three groups: SAD ( n = 31), mixed anxiety disorders (MAD; n = 30), and healthy controls (HC; n = 32). Compared to HC, SAD children showed faster first fixations on the eye region of neutral faces and shorter first fixation durations on the eye region of all faces. No differences between the two clinical groups emerged in eye movement results. SAD girls showed reduced pupil dilation in response to happy and angry faces compared to MAD and to happy faces compared to HC. SAD boys showed reduced pupil dilation in response to neutral faces compared to HC. Dimensionally, reduced pupil dilation was linked to social anxiety severity while eye movements were correlated with mixed anxiety and depressive severity. Results suggest that hypervigilant-avoidant eye contact processing and a blunted pupillary reactivity characterize children with SAD. Both transdiagnostic and disorder-specific processing biases are relevant for the understanding of childhood SAD.

Exposure therapy for youth with anxiety: Utilization rates and predictors of implementation in a sample of practicing clinicians from across the United States,"Exposure therapy is a highly effective, evidence-based treatment technique for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. Regardless, therapists in the community are reported to use exposure relatively rarely compared with other approaches. The goal of the present study was to identify how practicing clinicians treat youth with anxiety disorders across the United States and what factors contribute to their use of exposure therapy. Recruited from public directories, 257 private practice therapists who treat anxious youth were surveyed. Non-exposure cognitive-behavioral techniques like cognitive restructuring and relaxation techniques were used significantly more frequently than exposure. Providers with more training in exposure therapy and fewer negative beliefs about this approach reported using exposure significantly more in the treatment of youth with social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and panic disorders. Self-identification as an anxiety disorder specialist significantly predicted exposure use for youth with posttraumatic stress disorder. Most therapists in private practice have minimal training in exposure therapy, perceive a lack of training options, and believe there would be a benefit to acquiring more training. The implications of these findings are discussed, including how to optimally design training opportunities in exposure therapy.

Variation in out of pocket health care costs for individuals with anxiety disorders by type of insurance coverage,"Purpose: Given that out-of-pocket (OOP) costs impact adherence to treatment and recent and proposed changes to the health insurance system that impact OOP costs, it is imperative to understand the OOP cost burden faced by individuals with anxiety disorders depending upon type of insurance coverage. The objective of this study was to determine the annual OOP cost burden faced by individuals with anxiety disorders and the variation of these costs by type of insurance coverage. Methods: Using weighted nationally representative data from the 2011–2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys, total OOP health care costs were assessed for all respondents who indicated that they had an anxiety disorder (N = 9985). Total OOP health care costs were also calculated separately by type of insurance. Results: Average annual OOP costs among individuals with anxiety was $1152. The highest OOP cost were incurred by individuals with private fee-for-service (FFS) insurance ($1356/year, 4.1% of annual income), while individuals enrolled in HMOs with dual Medicare/Medicaid had the lowest OOP cost ($129/year, 6.8% of annual income). Individuals without insurance had high OOP cost burden ($1309/year, 12.5% of annual income). Conclusion: Individuals with anxiety disorders have a wide range of OOP cost depending upon their insurance coverage. Those with anxiety should carefully consider their choice of insurance coverage if interested in minimizing OOP costs.

"Shame-proneness, guilt-proneness and anxiety symptoms: A meta-analysis","There is a growing body of investigations showing that shame and guilt are important features of various psychological problems including anxiety disorders. This study quantitatively summarized the magnitude of the associations of shame and guilt with anxiety symptoms. We looked both at the associations with broader categories of anxiety symptoms (i.e., undifferentiated anxiety symptoms, trait and state anxiety), but also with symptoms specific to individual anxiety disorders. In most cases, shame was more strongly associated with anxiety symptoms (in general medium effect sizes) than guilt (in general small effect sizes). When controlling for the shared variance of shame and guilt, in most cases only shame remained significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. Moderation analyses testing for the effect of subtype of shame/guilt, type of measurement, clinical status, age and gender were conducted. Two types of guilt seem to be equally maladaptive as shame, generalized guilt (involving a free-floating guilt separated from specific contexts) and contextual-maladaptive guilt (involving an inappropriate or exaggerated feeling of responsibility). External shame (perceived negative evaluations of others) seems to be more strongly associated with social anxiety symptoms than internal shame (negative self-evaluations). Results for other moderators and implications are discussed in light of the existing theoretical and empirical data.

Predictors of treatment outcome for the unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders in children (UP-C),"Various efficacious treatment packages exist for youth anxiety, and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is now considered to be a well-established treatment for child anxiety disorders (Higa-McMillan, Francis, Rith-Najarian, &amp; Chorpita, 2016). Improving outcomes for the significant proportion of anxious youth who demonstrate inadequate response to CBT is imperative, but our understanding of who does and does not benefit is incomplete. Further, there are no known empirical studies of predictors of treatment response for youth who receive a transdiagnostic intervention for anxiety or depression, and it is therefore unclear whether predictors of response to a transdiagnostic treatment for children are similar to those found in previous studies of anxiety-specific treatments. This study investigated potential predictors of outcome following administration of the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children (UP-C; Ehrenreich-May et al., 2018). Participants were 60 children ages 6–13 ( M = 9.47, SD = 1.68) with a primary anxiety diagnosis (with or without comorbid depression) who received a 15-week UP-C group treatment. Consistent with prior literature on CBT for anxiety, social anxiety emerged as a consistent predictor of poorer response to the UP-C. Inconsistent with prior literature, depression, symptom severity, parent psychopathology, and child age were not significant predictors of poor outcome. Results indicate some differences between predictors for transdiagnostic versus anxiety-focused treatments, but point to a need for both types of interventions to better target social anxiety in children.

A network analysis of DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder and functional impairment in UK treatment-seeking veterans,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 59 of Journal of Anxiety Disorders (see record 2018-58041-011). The authors regret that Fig. 2 (page 10) is incorrect. The correct Fig. 2 is included in the erratum.] Network analysis is a relatively new methodology for studying psychological disorders. It focuses on the associations between individual symptoms which are hypothesized to mutually interact with each other. The current study represents the first network analysis conducted with treatment-seeking military veterans in UK. The study aimed to examine the network structure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and four domains of functional impairment by identifying the most central (i.e., important) symptoms of PTSD and by identifying those symptoms of PTSD that are related to functional impairment. Participants were 331 military veterans with probable PTSD. In the first step, a network of PTSD symptoms based on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 was estimated. In the second step, functional impairment items were added to the network. The most central symptoms of PTSD were recurrent thoughts, nightmares, negative emotional state, detachment and exaggerated startle response. Functional impairment was related to a number of different PTSD symptoms. Impairments in close relationships were associated primarily with the negative alterations in cognitions and mood symptoms and impairments in home management were associated primarily with the reexperiencing symptoms. The results are discussed in relation to previous PTSD network studies and include implications for clinical practice.

Out of my league: Appraisals of anxiety and confidence in others by individuals with and without social anxiety disorder,"Forty participants with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and 42 healthy controls (HCs) were randomized to watch a confederate deliver a speech in either a visibly anxious or confident manner. Participants rated their perception of the presenter’s desirability across five attributes and compared themselves to the presenter along these same dimensions. Participants then delivered their own speeches, and were rated in a similar manner by trained research assistants who were naïve to participants’ group status and study objectives. Results demonstrated that all participants, irrespective of group status, judged the visibly anxious presenter as being less desirable and the confident presenter as more desirable. Socially anxious participants tended to view themselves as inferior to confident others. Coders also rated participants with SAD, based on their speeches, as being less interpersonally desirable than HCs. These results suggest that individuals who appear visibly anxious may be objectively disadvantaged in their ability to make a positive first impression on others. We discuss these findings in relation to theoretical models of social anxiety and explore how to address such interpersonal factors in psychological interventions for SAD.

Social interaction anxiety and personality traits predicting engagement in health risk sexual behaviors,"Individuals with social interaction anxiety, a facet of social anxiety disorder, withdraw from or avoid social encounters and generally avoid risks. However, a subset engages in health risk sexual behavior (HRSB). Because sensation seeking, emotion dysregulation, and impulsivity predict engagement in HRSB among adolescents and young adults, the present study hypothesized that latent classes of social interaction anxiety and these personality traits would differentially predict likelihood of engagement in HRSB. Finite mixture modeling was used to discern four classes: two low social interaction anxiety classes distinguished by facets of emotion dysregulation, positive urgency, and negative urgency (Low SIAS High Urgency and Low SIAS Low Urgency) and two high social interaction anxiety classes distinguished by positive urgency, negative urgency, risk seeking, and facets of emotion dysregulation (High SIAS High Urgency and High SIAS Low Urgency). HRSB were entered into the model as auxiliary distal outcomes. Of importance to this study were findings that the High SIAS High Urgency class was more likely to engage in most identified HRSB than the High SIAS Low Urgency class. This study extends previous findings on the heterogeneity of social interaction anxiety by identifying the effects of social interaction anxiety and personality on engagement in HRSB.

Disentangling intolerance of uncertainty and threat appraisal in everyday situations,"Intolerance of Uncertainty is a transdiagnostic risk and maintenance factor in a range of anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder. However, the mechanism of action in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders is poorly understood, with the relationship between the constructs of uncertainty and threat appraisal remaining unclear. Most research to date has investigated IU in situations that are explicitly or implicitly threatening (i.e. where they have a negative outcome), which makes it difficult to establish whether it is the uncertainty or the prospect of a negative outcome (or threat) that people find aversive. If the construct of IU is about uncertainty (and not threat), it should also be operating in situations where there are no negative outcomes possible. Participants (N = 224) completed a battery of online measures in tasks designed to evaluate level of situational uncertainty and perception of threat level. These tasks required responses to scenarios which displayed or implied varying levels of estimated threat. Regression analyses indicated that IU was related to perceiving threat and uncertainty in negative situations and positive situations, with the greatest contribution from uncertainty within the situations, supporting the conceptualisation of IU as a response to uncertainty that is largely independent of threat although may contribute to perceptions of threat.

"Obsessive-compulsive disorder research: Growing in scope, advances unclear","There has been impressive growth in scholarly research on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). As a general rule, this can be construed as a sign of health in the subspecialty within anxiety disorder research. One factor that likely contributed to the growth in research on OCD was the observation that obsessional experiences can be placed on a dimension from normal to abnormal (or non-clinical to clinical) (Rachman and de Silva, 1978). While the dramatic growth in OCD research has led to increased sophistication in clinical conceptualization of various presentations of this heterogeneous condition, it has not led to a commensurate increase in the availability of efficacious treatment. This gap, between awareness of the disorder and delivery of evidence-based treatment, serves as a limiting factor in enthusiasm regarding the growth in research productivity on OCD as a sign of health in the subspecialty.

Research on social anxiety disorder continues to escalate: A commentary on Asmundson and Asmundson’s analysis of publication trends in the anxiety disorders,"Asmundson and Asmundson (2018) reported that publication of research on anxiety disorders, including social anxiety disorder (SAD), has seen rapid growth in the period between 2006 and 2016. In fact, the uptick in publication rate of SAD research was unexpectedly high given previous predictions by Boschen (2008), who reviewed publication trends from 1980 to 2005. In this commentary, we consider potential factors involved in the continued increase in publication of research on SAD. We examine the roles that empathy and evolutionary factors may play in our ability to relate to those with SAD and in our motivation to research it. Further, we consider whether the relatively high prevalence of SAD, the visibility of experiences of social anxiety in the general population, and the availability of viable theoretical models of SAD and its treatment have played a significant role in the high publication rate. Other factors affecting research on SAD such as changes in the definition of SAD in various editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), comorbidity which other psychiatric disorders, and the role of pharmaceutical company research are also discussed.

Are anxiety disorders publications continuing on a trajectory of growth? A look at Boschen’s (2008) predictions and beyond,"The relative health of a field of research can be approximated by assessing peer-reviewed journal publication trends for articles pertinent to that field. The most recent comprehensive assessment of publication trends in the anxiety disorders indicated that the field was on a continuing trajectory of growth (Boschen, 2008). We conducted an updated search of Medline for publications on each of the anxiety disorders from 2006 to 2016. Results indicated that there was continuing growth in anxiety disorders research overall and, particularly, for posttraumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Publication trends observed in Medline were also reflected in the focus of papers published in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders over the past 3 years; yet, a substantive number of papers in the journal also dealt with multiple anxiety disorders, anxiety-related constructs, transdiagnostic issues, and conditions with significant overlap with the anxiety disorders. Observed publication trends, shifts in the focus of research attention, and probable future research directions are discussed briefly.

The increase in interest in GAD: Commentary on Asmundson &amp;amp; Asmundson,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders. It is associated with functional impairment and is unlikely to spontaneously remit. As identified by Asmundson and Asmundson (2018), published research studies on GAD have increased in number over the last decade. We propose that this is due to the high prevalence of the diagnosis and symptoms, interest in transdiagnostic processes, such as worry, increased interest in emotion dysregulation as a principle underlying diagnoses, and new methods of treating and disseminating treatment that may be particularly well suited to GAD. Despite the increase in research articles on GAD, GAD still remains one of the least studied anxiety disorders. We propose that this is due to the misconception that GAD does not lead to severe impairment, despite data showing otherwise. Future research should continue to examine the phenomenology, mechanisms, and treatment of GAD in order to better understand this common anxiety disorder.

Posttraumatic stress disorder as a growth industry: Comment on Asmundson and Asmundson (2018),"Asmundson and Asmundson’s (2018) bibliometric study demonstrates that the anxiety disorders remain a major focus of clinical research. Yet striking differences emerged among these syndromes. For example, in contrast to panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder has increasingly flourished as a major focus of publications. The purpose of my commentary is to discuss the basis for the remarkable success of traumatology relative to other areas (e.g., panic disorder research).

Insula activation is modulated by attention shifting in social anxiety disorder,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by exaggerated reactivity to social threat, often documented by biased attention to threatening information, and increased activation in brain regions involved in salience/threat processing. Attention training has been developed to ameliorate the attention bias documented in individuals with SAD, with mixed results. We investigated patterns of brain activation underlying acute attention modulation in 41 participants (29 with SAD and 12 health controls). We then investigated how brain activation changed over time in both groups in response to a 4-session attention training protocol (toward threat, away from threat, no-training control). Results revealed diminished pre-training deactivation in the insula in SAD participants during attention modulation. SAD participants also demonstrated an increase in insula deactivation over time, suggestive of an improvement in attention modulation of emotion, and this was associated with a decrease in symptom severity. Attention training did not, itself, lead to clinical improvement, though there was a trend level effect of training toward threat on increased insula deactivation over time. While deficits in attentional control and emotion modulation are documented in individuals with SAD, current attention training protocols are not robustly effective in ameliorating aberrant functioning. Pursuit of training protocols that have more robust impacts on the relevant neural circuitry may have some value.

A population-based examination of the co-occurrence and functional correlates of chronic pain and generalized anxiety disorder,"Objectives: This study aimed to: 1) Establish the prevalence of co-occurring chronic pain conditions (i.e., arthritis, back pain, and migraines) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and 2) Examine levels of pain severity, disability, and work absenteeism among comorbid chronic pain conditions and GAD. Methods: Data were analyzed from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey–Mental Health (CCHS-MH; N = 25,113). Chi-square analyses assessed whether significant differences existed in pain severity in those with comorbid chronic pain and GAD versus pain conditions alone. Multivariable regressions examined the association between comorbid chronic pain and GAD with functional outcomes. Results: The weighted prevalence of GAD among those with chronic migraines, arthritis and back pain was 6.9%, 4.4%, and 6.1% respectively, compared to 2.6% among the entire sample. Severity of pain was increased among those with comorbid chronic pain and GAD compared with chronic pain conditions alone. Migraine was the only pain condition that was significantly associated with disability in our most stringent adjustment model. After controlling for other psychiatric disorders, comorbid GAD and chronic pain was not associated with work absenteeism. Conclusion: Chronic pain is common among the Canadian population and is associated with substantial disability. Results demonstrated that GAD is prevalent among chronic pain conditions, and comorbidity is associated with greater pain severity. GAD in the context of migraines, in particular, may represent an important treatment target to reduce disability.

Politically-focused intrusive thoughts and associated ritualistic behaviors in a community sample,"A significant proportion of the U.S. population report increased stress attributed to the political climate following the controversial 2016 United States (U.S.) Presidential election. The political stressors paired with the growth in news consumption and social media-use could be a potential trigger for obsessive-compulsive-like symptoms specific to politics in some individuals. This study aimed to elucidate the rate of Politically-focused Intrusive Thoughts and associated Ritualistic Behaviors (PITRB), their demographic and clinical correlates, and the degree of association with political ideology. Survey data were collected using the crowdsourcing platform Mechanical Turk. A total of N = 484 individuals completed the survey. Measures of politically-focused intrusive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors, general obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, anxiety, anxiety control, worry, and disability were administered, as well as a measure of social and economic conservative affiliation. Results showed that a quarter of the sample (25.2%) had at least one PITRB more than once a day. PITRB was associated with all measures of psychopathology and disability. Finally, anxiety control moderated the relationship between PITRB and both anxiety and depression. No differences in psychopathology were found between major party affiliations. The findings suggest that politically-focused intrusive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors are associated with psychopathology domains in a manner comparable to general obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

Internet-based treatment for panic disorder: A three-arm randomized controlled trial comparing guided (via real-time video sessions) with unguided self-help treatment and a waitlist control. PAXPD study results,"A growing body of evidence suggests that Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatments (ICBT) are effective to treat anxiety disorders. However, the effect of therapist guidance in ICBT is still under debate and guided ICBT offered in a real-time audio-video communication format has not yet been systematically investigated. This three-arm RCT compared the efficacy of guided with unguided ICBT (12 weeks intervention) and a waitlist (WL). A total of 111 individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder (PD) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. Primary outcomes were the severity of self-report panic symptoms and diagnostic status. Secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression, functional impairment, catastrophic cognitions, fear of sensations and body vigilance. At post-treatment, both active conditions showed superior outcomes regarding PD and associated symptoms (guided ICBT vs. WL: d = 1.04–1.36; unguided ICBT vs. WL: d = 0.70–1.06). At post-treatment, the two active conditions did not differ significantly in self-reported symptom reduction ( d = 0.21–0.54, all p s &gt; 0.05), but the guided treatment was superior to the unguided treatment in terms of diagnostic status (χ² (1) = 13.15, p &lt; 0.01). Treatment gains were maintained at successive follow-ups and the guided treatment became superior to the unguided treatment at 6 months follow-up ( d = 0.72–1.05, all ps &lt; 0.05).

Changes in neural activation underlying attention processing of emotional stimuli following treatment with positive search training in anxious children,"Prior research indicates that positive search training (PST) may be a promising home-based computerised treatment for childhood anxiety disorders. It explicitly trains anxious individuals in adaptive, goal-directed attention-search strategies to search for positive and calm information and ignore goal-irrelevant negative cues. Although PST reduces anxiety symptoms, its neural effects are unknown. The main aim of this study was to examine changes in neural activation associated with changes in attention processing of positive and negative stimuli from pre- to post-treatment with PST in children with anxiety disorders. Children’s neural activation was assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging ( f MRI) during a visual-probe task indexing attention allocation to threat-neutral and positive-neutral pairs. Results showed pre- to post-treatment reductions in anxiety symptoms and neural reactivity to emotional faces (angry and happy faces, relative to neutral faces) within a broad neural network linking frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital regions. Changes in neural reactivity were highly inter-correlated across regions. Neural reactivity to the threat-bias contrast reduced from pre- to post-treatment in the mid/posterior cingulate cortex. Results are considered in relation to prior research linking anxiety disorders and treatment effects with functioning of a broad limbic-cortical network involved in emotion reactivity and regulation, and integrative functions linking emotion, memory, sensory and motor processes and attention control.

Emotional clarity and attention to emotions in cognitive behavioral group therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction for social anxiety disorder,"We examined (1) differences between controls and patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) in emotional clarity and attention to emotions; (2) changes in emotional clarity and attention to emotions associated with cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), or a waitlist (WL) condition; and (3) whether emotional clarity and attention to emotions moderated changes in social anxiety across treatment. Participants were healthy controls ( n = 37) and patients with SAD ( n = 108) who were assigned to CBGT, MBSR, or WL in a randomized controlled trial. At pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up, patients with SAD completed measures of social anxiety, emotional clarity, and attention to emotions. Controls completed measures at baseline only. At pretreatment, patients with SAD had lower levels of emotional clarity than controls. Emotional clarity increased significantly among patients receiving CBGT, and changes were maintained at 12-month follow-up. Emotional clarity at posttreatment did not differ between CBGT and MBSR or between MBSR and WL. Changes in emotional clarity predicted changes in social anxiety, but emotional clarity did not moderate treatment outcome. Analyses of attention to emotions were not significant. Implications for the role of emotional clarity in the treatment of SAD are discussed.

Rethinking avoidance: Toward a balanced approach to avoidance in treating anxiety disorders,"Avoidance is typically considered a maladaptive behavioral response to excessive fear and anxiety, leading to the maintenance of anxiety disorders. Exposure is a core element of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders. One important aspect of this treatment is repeated and prolonged exposure to a threat while discouraging patients from using avoidance strategies, such as escape or safety behaviors. We will first revisit the role of avoidance learning in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders, including important insights from the neuroscience literature. Next, we will consider both the negative and positive aspects of avoidance for therapeutic interventions. Finally, we will explore the application of adaptive avoidance in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. We will argue that there are occasions when avoidance behaviors can serve as effective coping strategies to enhance the person’s perception of control over the environment and the potential threat. We conclude that avoidance behaviors can be a valuable therapeutic element, depending on the function of these behaviors.

Cultural influences on mental health symptoms in a primary care sample of Latinx patients,"The present study examines how both between group (i.e., ethnic group membership) and within group cultural factors (i.e., nativity status, age of immigration, and perceived discrimination) may contribute to anxiety and related symptoms in Latinx with anxiety disorders. Baseline data were examined from patients who participated in one of the largest intervention studies for adults with anxiety disorders in primary care settings; 196 Latinx and 568 NLW (non-Latinx White) patients participated. Proportions of anxiety disorders were similar between Latinx and NLWs; however, Latinx, on average, had a greater number of anxiety disorders than NLWs. Levels of anxiety and depression symptom severity, anxiety sensitivity, and mental functional impairment were similar between the ethnic groups. Latinx expressed greater somatization and physical functional impairment than NLWs. Among Latinx, perceived discrimination, but not other cultural variables, was predictive of mental health symptoms while controlling for age, gender, education, and poverty. Overall, these findings suggest more similarities than differences in types and levels of anxiety and anxiety-related impairment, with some important exceptions, including greater levels of somatization and physical functional impairment among Latinx patients. Further, perceived discrimination may be an important factor to consider when examining risk for greater symptom burden among Latinx with anxiety.

Anxiety-related psychopathology and chronic pain comorbidity among public safety personnel,"Canadian Public Safety Personnel (PSP; e.g., correctional service officers, dispatchers, firefighters, paramedics, police officers) regularly experience potentially traumatic, painful, and injurious events. Such exposures increase risk for developing mental disorders and chronic pain, which both involve substantial personal and social costs. The interrelationship between mental disorders and chronic pain is well-established, and both can be mutually maintaining; accordingly, understanding the relationship between mental health and chronic pain among PSP is important for improving health care. Unfortunately, the available research on such comorbidity for PSP is sparse. The current study was designed to provide initial estimates of comorbidities between mental disorders and chronic pain across diverse PSP. Participants included 5093 PSP (32% women) in six categories (i.e., Call Center Operators/Dispatchers, Correctional Workers, Firefighters, Municipal/Provincial Police, Paramedics, Royal Canadian Mounted Police) who participated in a large PSP mental health survey. The survey included established self-report measures for mental disorders and chronic pain. In the total sample, 23.1% of respondents self-reported clinically significant comorbid concerns with both mental disorders and chronic pain. The results indicated PSP who reported chronic pain were significantly more likely to screen positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder. There were differences between PSP categories; but, the most consistent indications of comorbidity were for chronic pain, PTSD, and major depressive disorder. Comorbidity between chronic pain and mental disorders among PSP is prevalent. Health care providers should regularly assess PSP for both symptom domains.

"Computer therapy for the anxiety and depression disorders is effective, acceptable and practical health care: An updated meta-analysis","Background: A 2010 meta-analysis of internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) RCTs argued ‘computer therapy for the anxiety and depressive disorders was effective, acceptable and practical health care’ without data on effectiveness or practicality in routine practice. Methods: Databases, reviews and meta-analyses were searched for randomised controlled trials of cCBT or iCBT versus a control group (care as usual, waitlist, information control, psychological placebo, pill placebo, etc.) in people who met diagnostic criteria for major depression, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder or generalised anxiety disorder. Number randomised, superiority of treatment versus control (Hedges’g) on primary outcome measure, length of follow-up, follow up outcome, patient adherence and satisfaction/harm were extracted; risk of bias was assessed. A search for studies on effectiveness of iCBT in clinical practice was conducted. Results: 64 trials were identified. The mean effect size (efficacy) was g = 0.80 (NNT 2.34), and benefit was evident across all four disorders. Improvement was maintained at follow-with good acceptability. Research probity was good, and bias risk low. In addition, nine studies comparing iCBT with traditional face-to-face CBT and three comparing iCBT with bibliotherapy were identified. All three modes of treatment delivery appeared equally beneficial. The results of effectiveness studies were congruent with the results of the efficacy trials. Limitations: Studies variably measured changes in quality of life and disability, and the lack of comparisons with medications weakens the field. Conclusions: The conclusions drawn in the original meta-analysis are now supported: iCBT for the anxiety and depressive disorders is effective, acceptable and practical health care.

Psychological interventions for anxiety in adult primary care patients: A review and recommendations for future research,"Anxiety symptoms are prevalent in primary care, yet treatment rates are low. The integration of behavioral health providers into primary care via the Primary Care Behavioral Health (PCBH) model offers a promising way to improve treatment options by adding a team member with the necessary skillset to deliver evidence-based psychological interventions for anxiety. We conducted a narrative review of psychological interventions for anxiety applied within adult primary care settings ( k = 44) to update the literature and evaluate the fit of existing interventions with the PCBH model. The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs; 70.5%). Most interventions utilized cognitive-behavioral therapy (68.2%) and were delivered individually, face-to-face (52.3%). Overall, 65.9% of interventions (58.6% of RCTs, 91.7% of pre-post) were effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, and 83.3% maintained the gains at follow-up. Although it is encouraging that most interventions significantly reduced anxiety, their longer formats (i.e., number and duration of sessions) and narrow symptom targets make translation into practice difficult. Methodological limitations of the research included homogenous samples, failure to report key procedural details, pre-post designs, and restrictive eligibility criteria. We offer recommendations to guide future research to improve the likelihood of successful translation of anxiety interventions into clinical practice.

Who benefits most from therapist-assisted internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy in clinical practice? Predictors of symptom change and dropout,"Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) is effective for treating anxiety and depression, but not for all patients. Predictors of dropout and outcomes from ICBT remain unclear and the literature could benefit from study of response to ICBT among larger community samples using advanced statistical techniques. In this study, we sought to identify predictors of dropout and symptom change in a large community sample ( n = 1201) who received therapist-assisted transdiagnostic ICBT targeting anxiety and/or depression. Logistic regression was used to assess dropout, and showed that those who fully completed ICBT lessons ( n = 880) were older and endorsed lower psychological distress at intake than those who only partially completed ICBT lessons ( n = 321). During the course of therapy, patients responded to the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 at six time points. Autoregressive latent trajectory models were fitted to this data to assess the ability of demographic variables, program engagement, psychological and medical service usage, and psychological distress to explain individual variance in initial symptom levels and symptom change over time. Higher symptom scores at pre-treatment were predictive of greater symptom improvement. Symptom improvement was greater in those who were off work on disability and those without higher post-secondary education. Clinical implications are discussed.

ICD-11 complex PTSD among Israeli male perpetrators of intimate partner violence: Construct validity and risk factors,"The International Classification of Diseases 11th Version (ICD-11) will include Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) as a unique diagnostic entity comprising core PTSD and DSO (disturbances in self-organization) symptoms. The current study had three aims: (1) assessing the validity of CPTSD in a unique population of male perpetrators of intimate partner violence; (2) examining whether exposure to different types of traumatic events would be associated with the two proposed CPTSD factors, namely PTSD or DSO; and (3) assessing the differential association of various sociodemographic and symptom characteristics with each factor. Participants were 234 males drawn randomly from a sample of 2600 men receiving treatment at 66 domestic violence centers in Israel. Data were collected using the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ)—Hebrew version. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the factorial validity of ICD-11 CPTSD. Cumulative lifetime trauma and physical childhood neglect were associated with PTSD and DSO, while cumulative childhood violence exposure was associated only with DSO. Anxiety was associated only with DSO; depression more strongly with DSO than PTSD. Religious level contributed only to PTSD; compulsory military service only to DSO.

"High risk, high reward: Daily perceptions of social challenge and performance in social anxiety disorder","Individuals with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) have difficulty engaging in social situations because their actions are predicated on minimizing the subjectively biased high potential for rejection. That is, individuals with SAD frequently perceive social situations as challenging, and their performance as subpar. Yet when individuals perceive themselves as succeeding in challenging situations, they typically report these situations as enjoyable and rewarding. This subjective experience of succeeding in a challenging situation has been studied as flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975; 2000). Thirty-three adults with SAD and 34 matched healthy controls completed a baseline assessment, along with daily and experience sampling entries for 14 days. Results were analyzed using three-level generalized linear mixed effects models, with observations nested within days, nested within participants. Although individuals with and without SAD experienced the same frequency of flow in daily life, social situations led to proportionally more flow in participants with SAD than healthy controls. Both results were unexpected, and reasons for them are explored at length. Several experiential variables (positive emotions during and importance ascribed to the event) predicted the probability of flow during each situation. These results offer intervention-relevant suggestions for how individuals may benefit from seeking out challenging situations that offer maximal rewards.

The effect of panic disorder versus anxiety sensitivity on event-related potentials during anticipation of threat,"Attention-related abnormalities are key components of the abnormal defensive responding observed in panic disorder (PD). Although behavioral studies have found aberrant attentional biases towards threat in PD, psychophysiological studies have been mixed. Predictability of threat, an important feature of threat processing, may have contributed to these mixed findings. Additionally, anxiety sensitivity , a dimensional trait associated with PD, may yield stronger associations with cognitive processes than categorical diagnoses of PD. In this study, 171 participants with PD and/or depression and healthy controls completed a task that differentiated anticipation of predictable vs. unpredictable shocks, while startle eyeblink and event-related potentials (ERPs [N100, P300]) were recorded. In all participants, relative to the control condition, probe N100 was enhanced to both predictable and unpredictable threat, whereas P300 suppression was unique to predictable threat. Probe N100, but not P300, was associated with startle eyeblink during both threatening conditions, and was strongest for unpredictable threat. PD was not associated with ERPs, but anxiety sensitivity (physical concerns) was positively associated with probe N100 (indicating reduced responding) in the unpredictable condition independent of PD diagnosis. Vulnerability to panic-related psychopathology may be characterized by aberrant early processing of threat, which may be especially evident during anticipation of unpredictable threats.

Emotional lability and affective synchrony in posttraumatic stress disorder pathology,"This study examined the relations of PTSD pathology to both the lability of three specific emotions (anxiety, anger, self-conscious emotions [SCE]) and the extent to which changes in one emotional state co-occur with changes in another emotional state (i.e. affective synchrony). Moreover, given evidence that emotional responding in PTSD may be heightened in response to trauma-related cues, these relations were explored in the context of a trauma cue versus neutral cue. Trauma-exposed patients in residential substance use disorder treatment ( N = 157) completed a diagnostic interview and two laboratory sessions involving presentation of neutral and individualized trauma scripts. State anxiety, anger, and SCE were assessed at five points throughout each laboratory session. Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that participants (regardless of PTSD status) exhibited greater lability of all emotions following the trauma script versus neutral script. Only anger lability was elevated among those with (versus without) a current PTSD diagnosis following the neutral script. Results also revealed synchrony (i.e., positive covariation) between each possible pair of emotions, regardless of PTSD status. Findings suggest that concurrent changes in anxiety and anger may be especially relevant to PTSD symptom severity.

Long-term effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with anxiety disorders,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated favorable long-term outcomes in youth with anxiety disorders in efficacy trials. However, long-term outcomes of CBT delivered in a community setting are uncertain. This study examined the long-term outcomes of individual (ICBT) and group CBT (GCBT) in youth with anxiety disorders treated in community mental health clinics. A total of 139 youth (mean age at assessment 15.5 years, range 11–21 years) with a principal diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder (SAD), social anxiety disorder (SOP), and/or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were evaluated, on average, 3.9 years post-treatment (range 2.2–5.9 years). Outcomes included loss of all inclusion anxiety diagnoses, loss of the principal anxiety diagnosis and changes in youth- and parent-rated youth anxiety symptoms. At long-term follow-up, there was loss of all inclusion anxiety diagnoses in 53%, loss of the principal anxiety diagnosis in 63% of participants as well as significant reductions in all anxiety symptom measures. No statistical significant differences in outcome were obtained between ICBT and GCBT. Participants with a principal diagnosis of SOP had lower odds for recovery, compared to those with a principal diagnosis of SAD or GAD. In conclusion, outcomes of CBT for youth anxiety disorders delivered in community mental health clinics were improved at nearly 4 years post-treatment, and recovery rates at long-term follow-up were similar to efficacy trials.

Difficulty concentrating in generalized anxiety disorder: An evaluation of incremental utility and relationship to worry,"Difficulty concentrating is one of the most common diagnostic criteria across DSM-5 categories, especially within the emotional (mood- and anxiety-related) disorders. A substantial literature has characterized cognitive functioning in emotional disorders using objective (behavioral) computerized cognitive tasks. However, diagnoses are typically formed on the basis of subjective (self-reported; clinician-rated) assessments of symptoms, and little is known about difficulty concentrating as a symptom. These questions are particularly important for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which has long been the subject of nosological debates, and for which several theoretical models that suggest a central role for cognitive impairments (including difficulty concentrating) in the maintenance of psychopathology have been proposed. The present study evaluated the incremental utility of difficulty concentrating and its relationship to worry and other symptoms in 175 GAD-diagnosed adults. Clinician-assessed difficulty concentrating incrementally predicted clinician-rated GAD, anxiety, and depression severity even after other GAD symptoms were controlled. Consistent with theoretical models of GAD that propose a direct relationship between worry and cognitive impairment, difficulty concentrating mediated the relationship between trait worry and clinical severity. These findings suggest that difficulty concentrating has value as a diagnostic criterion and is a potential mechanism by which worry increases distress and impairment.

Lower-order anxiety sensitivity and intolerance of uncertainty dimensions operate as specific vulnerabilities for social anxiety and depression within a hierarchical model,"Within a hierarchical framework for depressive and anxiety disorders, negative affect (NA) is posited to be indirectly related to social anxiety and depression through cognitive vulnerabilities, including intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and anxiety sensitivity (AS). However, few prior studies have considered whether the lower-order dimensions of IU (i.e., prospective and inhibitory IU) and AS (i.e., physical, cognitive, and social concerns) better explain the indirect relation between NA and social anxiety and depression. The indirect relations between NA and social anxiety and depression through these cognitive vulnerabilities were examined using structural equation modeling in a clinical sample ( N = 298). NA and social anxiety symptoms were indirectly related through AS social concerns and inhibitory IU, although a direct effect of NA was also found. Only AS social concerns explained the relation between NA and a social anxiety disorder diagnosis. AS cognitive concerns was the only cognitive vulnerability factor to indirectly explain the relation between NA and depressive symptoms, although a direct effect of NA was also found. These findings suggest that the lower-order dimensions of AS and IU demonstrate more specific and less transdiagnostic associations with social anxiety and depression.

Anxiety sensitivity and sleep disturbance: Investigating associations among patients with co-occurring anxiety and substance use disorders,"Sleep disturbance is a common problem among individuals with anxiety and substance use disorders (SUD). Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is elevated in patients with anxiety disorders and SUD and has been linked to sleep-related problems, including insomnia and somnolence (i.e., daytime sleepiness). We examined the unique roles of AS cognitive, physical, and social concerns in sleep disturbance among a sample of 99 residential SUD patients with anxiety disorders. Clinical levels of insomnia or somnolence were evidenced by 53.5% of the sample. Consistent with predictions, AS physical concerns was significantly associated with insomnia, and AS cognitive concerns was significantly related to insomnia and somnolence. Hierarchical linear regression models were conducted to test the association of AS cognitive and physical concerns with insomnia and somnolence symptoms while controlling for relevant factors. AS cognitive concerns accounted for unique variance, above and beyond withdrawal symptoms, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, in the model examining insomnia symptoms ( B = 0.30, SE = 0.13, p = 0.023). Results suggest that AS cognitive concerns may represent an important transdiagnostic mechanism underlying sleep disturbance among individuals with dual diagnosis.

The efficacy of group metacognitive therapy for children (MCT-c) with generalized anxiety disorder: An open trial,"Metacognitive therapy is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders in adults. Studies have demonstrated that the underlying theoretical model is also supported in children. It has therefore been suggested that metacognitive therapy for children may be effective. Our study is an open trial of metacognitive therapy for children with generalized anxiety as their primary disorder. Therapy was provided in groups. Families were interviewed with the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule—child/parent versions. They reported on the child’s anxiety levels using the Revised Childrens Anxiety and Depression Scale—child/parent versions. Children reported on metacognitive beliefs using the Metacognitions Questionnaire for Children—30 item version. Fourty-four children aged 7–13 years (50% girls) were enrolled, and one family dropped out during treatment. Fifty percent of the children had received counseling or psychological treatment for their anxiety disorder previously. Following treatment, 86.4% of the children were free of their primary disorder and 72.7% were free of all anxiety disorders, the corresponding figures were 75% and 65.9% at 6-months follow-up. The effect sizes were large for all measures and clinically significant improvements were obtained for 70% of the children at posttest and 77% at follow-up. Our study suggests that metacognitive therapy for children with generalized anxiety disorder may be a highly promising treatment approach.

Factor structure of the intolerance of uncertainty scale for children,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU), a dispositional negative orientation toward uncertainty and its consequences, has been studied in adults, but research has only recently examined IU in youth. Despite some advances, little is known about the factor structure of measures of IU in youth. The present study used confirmatory factor analysis to examine the structure of IU as measured by the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale for Children (IUSC; Comer et al., 2009) in a sample of youth (N = 368) 9–18 years of age (M age = 12.47) with and without anxiety disorders and their mothers. Findings demonstrated multiple acceptable factor structures: a correlated factors 2-factor structure and a bifactor model where a general factor underlies all items. While the bifactor model provides better fit and reliability to the data, multivariate analyses indicated that the 2-factor structure distinguishes apprehensive anxiety regarding future events (prospective IU) from present-focused inhibition of behavior due to uncertainty and negative reactions to the presence of uncertainty (inhibitory IU); a total IU score predicted all anxiety domains for self- and parent-reports except for parent-report harm avoidance. Findings are discussed in terms of consistency of IU across adult and youth samples, and how results can inform treatment efforts and etiologic models of IU and anxiety.

Does D-cycloserine facilitate the effects of homework compliance on social anxiety symptom reduction?,"Background: Prior studies examining the effect of D-cycloserine (DCS) on homework compliance and outcome in cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) have yielded mixed results. The aim of this study was to investigate whether DCS facilitates the effects of homework compliance on symptom reduction in a large-scale study for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Methods: 169 participants with generalized SAD received DCS or pill placebo during 12-session exposure-based group CBT. Improvements in social anxiety were assessed by independent raters at each session using the Liebowitz social anxiety scale (LSAS). Results: Controlling for LSAS at the previous session, and irrespective of treatment condition, greater homework compliance in the week prior related to lower LSAS at the next session. However, DCS did not moderate the effect of homework compliance and LSAS, LSAS on homework compliance, or the overall augmenting effect of DCS on homework compliance. Furthermore, LSAS levels were not predictive of homework compliance in the following week. Conclusion: The findings support the general benefits of homework compliance on outcome, but not a DCS-augmenting effect. The comparably small number of DCS-enhanced sessions in this study could be one reason for the failure to find a facilitating effect of DCS.

Do worry and its associated cognitive variables alter following CBT treatment in a youth population with Social Anxiety Disorder? Results from a randomized controlled trial,"Presents a study which aims to examine whether worry and its associated cognitive variables alter following cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment in a youth population with social anxiety disorder. There were three main findings from this study. First, by 6-month follow-up of an online treatment program for youth SAD, worry, IU, NBW, PBW, NPO and CA had significantly reduced despite not being directly targeted in treatment. Second, compared to youth who retained their SAD diagnosis, those who had lost their diagnosis by 6-month follow-up showed greater reductions in worry and CA from pre-assessment to 6-month follow-up. Third, compared to youth who retained their SAD diagnosis, those who lost their diagnosis by 6-month follow-up demonstrated lower baseline levels of NPO. The current study advances one's understanding of the cognitive constructs associated with youth SAD, a relatively common and debilitating disorder.

Parental reactions to children’s negative affect: The moderating role of parental GAD,"The impact of parental anxiety disorders has been explored in broad categories of parenting behaviors; however, less is known about the impact of parental anxiety on emotion socialization behaviors. The current study tested the conditional effect of parental Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) on one aspect of emotion socialization, parents’ reactions to their child’s negative affect. Participants were 89 children between ages 3 and 12 and their parents, from a community sample. Parents completed the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-IV (ADIS-IV), an interaction task with their child, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory-II (BAI-II). Overall, the data supported study hypotheses. Parental GAD moderated the relationship between child’s negative affect and parental over control and emotional discouragement. Specifically, children’s negative affect was positively related to parental emotional discouragement for parents with GAD, but not for parents without a diagnosis. Conversely, children’s negative affect was not predictive of parental overcontrol for parents with GAD, but increases in children’s negative affect did predict increases in parental overcontrol for parents without a diagnosis. The present findings suggest parents diagnosed with GAD are discouraging of their children’s emotional experiences and fail to adjust their level of guidance throughout situations which induce negative affect, leaving children to cope with negative emotions on their own.

Pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder: Interpersonal predictors of outcome and the mediating role of the working alliance,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is highly prevalent and associated with high levels of impairment and distress. Therapies for SAD leave many patients symptomatic at the end of treatment, and little is known about predictors or mechanisms of treatment outcome. Given the interpersonal dysfunction fundamental to SAD, this study investigated whether prominent interpersonal features of SAD (submissive behavior, childhood maltreatment, suppression of anger, and depression) predicted attrition and response to pharmacotherapy and whether the working alliance mediated these relationships. This is the first study to examine the role of the working alliance in pharmacotherapy for SAD. One hundred thirty-eight treatment-seeking individuals with a primary diagnosis of SAD received 12 weeks of open treatment with paroxetine. Higher levels of depression predicted greater severity of SAD at the end of treatment, and higher levels of submissive behavior and childhood emotional maltreatment predicted a greater probability of attrition from treatment. The psychiatrist-assessed working alliance mediated response to pharmacotherapy for individuals who reported a history of emotional maltreatment. These results identify variables that predict pharmacotherapy outcome and emphasize the importance of the working alliance as a mechanism of treatment response for those with a history of emotional maltreatment. Implications for person-specific treatment selection are discussed.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of dropout rates in individual psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Despite being a relatively prevalent and debilitating disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is the second least studied anxiety disorder and among the most difficult to treat. Dropout from psychotherapy is concerning as it is associated with poorer outcomes, leads to service inefficiencies and can disproportionately affect disadvantaged populations. No study to date has calculated a weighted mean dropout rate for GAD and explored associated correlates. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using PsycINFO, Medline and Embase databases, identifying studies investigating individual psychotherapies for adults with GAD. Forty-five studies, involving 2224 participants, were identified for meta-analysis. Results: The weighted mean dropout rate was 16.99% (95% confidence interval 14.42%–19.91%). The Q-statistic indicated significant heterogeneity among studies. Moderator analysis and meta-regressions indicated no statistically significant effect of client age, sex, symptom severity, comorbidity, treatment type, study type (randomized trial or not), study quality, number of sessions or therapist experience. Conclusions: In research investigating psychotherapy for GAD, approximately one in six clients can be expected to drop out of treatment. Dropout rate was not significantly moderated by the client, therapist or treatment variables investigated. Future research should specify the definition of dropout, reasons for dropout and associated correlates to assist the field’s progression.

Randomized controlled trial of Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy comparing standard weekly versus optional weekly therapist support,"Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) is effective for treating anxiety and depression. The relative benefits of offering standard weekly compared to optional weekly therapist support in conjunction with ICBT within routine care has not been examined. Patients seeking ICBT for depression and or anxiety in routine care were randomized to standard ( n = 92) or optional ( n = 88) weekly support. The optional approach resulted in therapists receiving half as many messages from (1.70 vs. 3.96) and sending half as many messages to patients (3.62 vs. 7.29). Optional Support was associated with lower completion rates (56.6% versus 82.4%), but, similar to Standard Support, resulted in large reductions on the GAD-7 (within Cohen’s d ≥1.08; avg. reduction ≥47%) and PHQ-9 (within Cohen’s d ≥0.82; avg. reduction ≥43%) at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Optional weekly support appears clinically effective and acceptable for many patients and may reduce costs, but safety requires monitoring given lower completion rates.

A randomized controlled study of power posing before public speaking exposure for social anxiety disorder: No evidence for augmentative effects,"This manuscript details a randomized controlled study designed to test the efficacy of power posing (i.e., briefly holding postures associated with dominance and power) as an augmentative strategy for exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Seventy-three individuals diagnosed with SAD were assigned to one of three conditions: power posing, submissive posing, or rest (no posing) prior to participating in an exposure therapy session. Participants were assessed for between-group differences in pre- and post-manipulation salivary hormone levels, within-session subjective experiences of fear, and pre- and 1-week post-treatment SAD severity outcome measures. Though the intervention resulted in decreased SAD symptom severity one week later, analyses revealed no significant between-group differences on any tested variables. Accordingly, this study provides no evidence to suggest that power posing impacts hormone levels or exposure therapy outcomes.

The efficacy of aerobic exercise and resistance training as transdiagnostic interventions for anxiety-related disorders and constructs: A randomized controlled trial,"Evidence supports exercise as an intervention for many mental health concerns; however, randomized controlled investigations of the efficacy of different exercise modalities and predictors of change are lacking. The purposes of the current trial were to: (1) quantify the effects of aerobic exercise and resistance training on anxiety-related disorder (including anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder) status, symptoms, and constructs, (2) evaluate whether both modalities of exercise were equivalent, and (3) to determine whether exercise enjoyment and physical fitness are associated with symptom reduction. A total of 48 individuals with anxiety-related disorders were randomized to aerobic exercise, resistance training, or a waitlist. Symptoms of anxiety-related disorders, related constructs, and exercise enjoyment were assessed at pre-intervention and weekly during the 4-week intervention. Participants were further assessed 1-week and 1-month post-intervention. Both exercise modalities were efficacious in improving disorder status. As well, aerobic exercise improved general psychological distress and anxiety, while resistance training improved disorder-specific symptoms, anxiety sensitivity, distress tolerance, and intolerance of uncertainty. Physical fitness predicted reductions in general psychological distress for both types of exercise and reductions in stress for aerobic exercise. Results highlight the efficacy of different exercise modalities in uniquely addressing anxiety-related disorder symptoms and constructs.

Still lonely: Social adjustment of youth with and without social anxiety disorder following cognitive behavioral therapy,"Social experiences are an integral part of normative development for youth and social functioning difficulties are related to poor outcomes. Youth with anxiety disorders, and particularly social anxiety disorder, experience difficulties across many aspects of social functioning that may place them at risk for maladjustment. The goal of this paper was to compare social experiences of youth across anxiety diagnoses and examine whether treatment is helpful in improving social functioning. Ninety-two children (age 7–12 years; 58% male; 87.0% White) with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and/or social anxiety disorder participated in cognitive behavioral therapy. At both pre- and post-treatment, children with social anxiety disorder self-reported greater loneliness than youth without social anxiety disorder, though levels of peer victimization and receipt of prosocial behavior were similar across groups. Parents reported greater social problems for youth with social anxiety disorder compared to those without social anxiety disorder. All youth experienced improved social functioning following treatment per child- and parent-reports. The results call for an increased focus on the social experiences of youth with anxiety disorders, and particularly loneliness, for children with social anxiety disorder. The results document ways that evidenced-based practice can improve social functioning for youth with anxiety disorders.

"Examining temporal alterations in Social Anxiety Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: The relation between autobiographical memory, future goals, and current self-views","The self is a multi-faceted and temporally dynamic construct reflecting representations and beliefs about identity in the past, present, and future. Clinical studies have shown that individuals with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) exhibit alterations in self-related processing but these studies have focused primarily on memory. Few studies in PTSD and SAD have examined self-related processing for the present and future, and no studies have directly compared these processes across these two disorders. Individuals diagnosed with PTSD ( n = 21), SAD ( n = 21), and healthy controls ( n = 21) completed cognitive tasks related to the past, present, and future. Disorder congruent temporal alterations were found across both disorders. Further, regression analyses revealed that trauma-related memories were significantly predicted by future goals related to the trauma, whereas social anxiety-related recall was predicted by current socially anxious self-views. Thus, although self-related processing may be common in PTSD and SAD, those aspects of the self most strongly associated with disorder-congruent recall differ by disorder. Self-alterations may be modifiable and developing a better understanding of past, present, and future self-processing might aid in the development of interventions that target these process.

Psychometric properties of the Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale—Preschool Version,"Despite growing recognition of childhood anxiety as a common and often debilitating clinical concern, we have limited knowledge of the particular ways in which anxiety interferes with daily life for young children who have not yet entered formal schooling. The present study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale – Preschool Version (CALIS-PV). The CALIS-PV is a brief (18 item) parent-report measure of the impacts of a young child’s anxiety on their own life and that of her or his parent. Participants were 784 parents of a child aged 3–7 years, who completed the CALIS-PV as a part of the follow-up assessment battery for two anxiety prevention trials targeted at preschool children with temperamental inhibition. Confirmatory factor analysis supported three CALIS-PV factors reflecting anxiety-related life interference at home, outside home and on parent life. The three factors showed good internal consistency and good convergent and divergent validity, and successfully differentiated children with and without an anxiety diagnosis. Findings provide initial support for the CALIS-PV as a reliable and valid measure of the daily life impacts of childhood anxiety for preschool-aged children and their parents.

Health anxiety by proxy in women with severe health anxiety: A case control study,"Health anxiety (HA) refers to excessive worries and anxiety about harbouring serious illness based on misinterpretation of bodily sensations or changes as signs of serious illness. Severe HA is associated with disability and high health care costs. However, the impact of parental HA on excessive concern with their children’s health (health anxiety by proxy) is scantly investigated. The aim of this study is to investigate HA by proxy in mothers with severe HA. Fifty mothers with severe HA and two control groups were included, i.e. mothers with rheumatoid arthritis (N = 49) and healthy mothers (N = 51). All participants completed self-report questionnaires on their own HA and illness perceptions and on illness worries and illness behaviour related to their children. The results showed that mothers with severe HA reported significantly more negative illness perceptions and more HA on behalf of their child (i.e. by proxy) compared to both control groups. HA by proxy may be an overlooked treatment target in mothers with severe HA, and improving our understanding of this condition can have important preventive and clinical implications.

Demand/withdraw communication in the context of intimate partner violence: Implications for psychological outcomes,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). To clarify the influence of a dyadic conflict pattern that has previously been shown to accompany violence in romantic relationships (partner demand/self withdraw) on these mental health outcomes, we examined the associations between three forms of IPV (physical, emotional-verbal, dominance-isolation), partner demand/self withdraw, and PTSD and GAD symptoms, in a sample of 284 IPV-exposed women. Using structural equation modeling, we found significant associations between dominance-isolation IPV, partner demand/self withdraw, and clinician-assessed GAD symptoms. Associations between emotional-verbal IPV and partner demand/self withdraw were also significant. Associations for physical IPV, partner demand/self withdraw, and clinician-assessed PTSD symptoms were not statistically significant. These results underscore the need for research on the mental health outcomes associated with specific forms of IPV and the long-term psychological consequences of the conflict patterns that uniquely characterize violent relationships.

Can less be more? Open trial of a stepped care approach for child and adolescent anxiety disorders,"This open trial presents a stepped care treatment approach for youths with anxiety disorders. In Step 1, 124 youths (65 girls; M age = 9.7 years) participated in a low intensity computer administered attention bias modification (ABM) protocol. Statistically significant reductions in youth anxiety severity were found following Step 1. Youths and parents were then given the option to not continue with further treatment or step up to a higher intensity cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol (Step 2). Of 112 youths who completed Step 1, 67 (59.8%) discontinued treatment and 45 (40.2%) stepped up. Co-occurring ADHD and higher anxiety severity at baseline were significantly associated with the decision to step up. Of those youths who completed Step 2, additional statistically significant reductions in youth anxiety severity were found. Across the entire protocol, 68.6% of youths were rated as either very much improved or much improved on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale. In a hypothetical comparison in which all youths received CBT alone, the stepped care protocol resulted in approximately 50% less time in treatment sessions. These findings support the promise of initiating youth anxiety disorder treatment with low intensity treatment and then stepping up to higher intensity treatment as needed.

"Discriminant validity, diagnostic utility, and parent-child agreement on the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) in treatment- and non-treatment-seeking youth","The Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorder (SCARED) may be differentially sensitive to detecting specific or comorbid anxiety diagnoses in treatment-seeking and non-treatment-seeking youth. We assessed the SCARED’s discriminant validity, diagnostic utility, and informant agreement using parent- and self-report from healthy and treatment-seeking anxious youth (Study 1, N = 585) and from non-treatment-seeking anxious youth (Study 2, N = 331) diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), or comorbid GAD + SAD. Among treatment-seeking youth, the SCARED showed good diagnostic utility and specificity, differentiating healthy, comorbid, and non-comorbid anxious youth. Child-parent agreement was modest: healthy child self-reports were higher than parent-reports whereas anxious child self-reports were similar or lower than parent-reports. Less consistent results emerged for diagnostic utility, specificity, and informant agreement among non-treatment-seeking youth. Given the number of non-treatment seeking anxious youth ( N = 33), generalizability of these findings may be limited.

Health anxiety and medical utilization: The moderating effect of age among patients in primary care,"Health anxiety is commonly seen in medical clinics and is related to the overutilization of primary care services, but existing studies have not yet considered the possible moderating effect of age. We examined if age moderated the association between health anxiety and medical utilization. A secondary aim was to examine potential racial/ethnic differences in health anxiety. An ethnoracially diverse group of patients ( N =533) seeking treatment from a primary care clinic completed a self-report measure of health anxiety. Three indices of medical utilization were assessed using medical records, including the number of: (a) clinic visits over the past two years, (b) current medications, and (c) lab tests over the past two years. Age moderated the effect of health anxiety on multiple indices of medical utilization. Supplemental analyses found that the moderating effect of age was specific to a somatic/body preoccupation, rather than health worry, dimension of health anxiety. Mean-level differences in health anxiety were either not supported (health anxiety composite, somatic/body preoccupation) or were small in magnitude (health worry) among self-identifying Black, Latino, and White participants. Results indicate that assessing for health anxiety could be particularly important for older adult patients who frequently seek out medical services.

A theoretical and empirical modeling of anxiety integrated with RDoC and temporal dynamics,"The newly launched Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) emphasize specific mechanisms over diagnostic categories of psychopathology. In our view, RDoC provides a useful heuristic for mental health disorders, but does not capture the complexity of psychological data when proposed mechanisms are viewed as static entities. However, temporal and complex system dynamics may advance RDoC’s utility. By investigating temporal patterns within trajectories and the interaction of complex networks, we propose that dynamic modeling provides comprehensive methods with which to investigate the etiopathology and maintenance of mental health disorders. We examine applications of dynamical systems to periphery physiology, an RDoC construct that has been widely used in psychological science. A review of the literature suggests methodological problems with aggregate and reductive models. We present a dynamical systems modeling of anxiety which suggests avenues for future biomarker research. This model appears congruent with RDoC and recent learning theory.

Combining child social skills training with a parent early intervention program for inhibited preschool children,"Background: Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of early intervention for anxiety in preschoolers through parent-education. The current study evaluated a six-session early intervention program for preschoolers at high risk of anxiety disorders in which a standard educational program for parents was supplemented by direct training of social skills to the children. Methods: Seventy-two children aged 3–5 years were selected based on high behavioural inhibition levels and concurrently having a parent with high emotional distress. Families were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which consisted of six parent-education group sessions and six child social skills training sessions, or waitlist. After six months, families on waitlist were offered treatment consisting of parent-education only. Results: Relative to waitlist, children in the combined condition showed significantly fewer clinician-rated anxiety disorders and diagnostic severity and maternal (but not paternal) reported anxiety symptoms and life interference at six months. Mothers also reported less overprotection. These gains were maintained at 12-month follow-up. Parent only education following waitlist produced similar improvements among children. Quasi-experimental comparison between combined and parent-only interventions indicated greater reductions from combined intervention according to clinician reports, but no significant differences on maternal reports. Conclusions: Results suggest that this brief early intervention program for preschoolers with both parent and child components significantly reduces risk and disorder in vulnerable children. The inclusion of a child component might have the potential to increase effects over parent-only intervention. However, future support for this conclusion through long-term, randomised controlled trials is needed.

Integrating iCBT for generalized anxiety disorder into routine clinical care: Treatment effects across the adult lifespan,"The burden attributable to late-life Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is set to increase alongside the ageing population. Yet, the psychogeriatric workforce is limited in size and few studies have focused on the treatment of GAD among older patients. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) could be integrated into existing infrastructure and scale the psychogeriatric workforce, if shown to be effective across the adult lifespan. This study examined age-related differences in presentation, adherence and effects of iCBT for GAD among patients in routine clinical care (N = 942; 18–29 years (n = 267); 30–39 years (n = 260); 40–49 years (n = 180); 50–59years (n = 124); and 60+ years (n = 111)). Compared to younger patients, older patients were less likely to present with probable GAD and MDD diagnoses (&lt; 60years vs. 60+ years) and more likely to complete treatment (&lt; 50years vs. 50 + years). iCBT produced moderate to large effect size reductions in symptom severity, distress and impairment independent of age. iCBT is therefore an effective treatment for GAD across the adult lifespan, which can be delivered in routine clinical care. Continuing to integrate iCBT into existing services has the potential to improve the capacity of the existing workforce to manage those seeking help for GAD particularly as the population ages.

Initial validation of a virtual blood draw exposure paradigm for fear of blood and needles,"Fear of blood, injections, and needles commonly prevents or delays individuals’ receipt of health care, such as vaccines or blood draws. Innovative methods are needed to overcome these fears and reduce anxiety related to activities of this nature. The present study describes initial testing of an arm illusion paradigm that may prove useful during early phases of graded exposure for people with blood and needle fear. Seventy-four undergraduate students aged 18–29 years were tested. In line with study aims, results indicated that the virtual blood draw paradigm promoted strong perceptions of arm ownership and elicited significant changes in physiological indices (blood pressure, heart rate, electrodermal activity, respiratory rate) in response to key procedure elements (e.g., needle insertion). Further, bivariate correlations indicated that individual differences in self-reported blood and needle fear collected prior to the illusion paradigm were significantly associated with presyncopal symptoms reported following the procedure. In regression analyses, self-reported measures of blood and needle fear explained unique variance in presyncopal symptoms even after controlling for general state anxiety. These findings provide initial support for the virtual blood draw paradigm as a promising tool to help provide graded exposure to medical procedures involving needles and blood draw.

The effects of cognitive reappraisal on conditioned disgust in contamination-based OCD: An analogue study,"Experimental research has shown that conditioned disgust is resistant to extinction, which may account for the slower habituation to disgust relative to fear in contamination-based obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, few studies have examined the efficacy of interventions that may attenuate conditioned disgust responses. Studies of cognitive reappraisal have demonstrated that reinterpreting a stimulus can alter emotional responding. This technique is based on cognitive theories which suggest that anxiety disorders arise from biased cognitions; therefore, changing a person’s thoughts will elicit durable changes in emotional responses. Given the demonstrated effectiveness of cognitive reappraisal, the present study examined whether cognitive reappraisal would attenuate conditioned disgust responses. We conditioned participants high in contamination fear ( n = 55) using images of neutral food items (conditioned stimuli; CS) paired with videos of individuals vomiting (unconditioned stimuli; US) while we obtained subjective disgust reports. After conditioning, half of the participants were randomly assigned to cognitive reappraisal training aimed at decreasing their emotional response to the US and CS, while the other half received no such training. The findings showed that cognitive reappraisal participants demonstrated a reduction in learned disgust across sessions and further benefited from extinction. These findings suggest that cognitive reappraisal may be an effective strategy for attenuating learned disgust.

Psychiatric reactions to continuous traumatic stress: A latent profile analysis of two Israeli samples,"Many individuals worldwide are exposed to continuous traumatic stress (CTS). However, the psychiatric sequela of CTS and the relevance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic criteria in this situation have yet to be determined. Filling this gap, the present study assessed psychiatric reactions to CTS and the relationship between such reactions and functional impairment among two representative samples of adults exposed to ongoing shelling over 6 (n = 387) and 9 years (n = 468). Assessment included PTSD symptomatology (i.e., intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal), anxiety, somatization, and depression. Profile categorization aimed to underscore variations in symptom clustering and severity, and determine whether or not a profile is dominated by PTSD symptoms. Latent Profile analyses (LPA) of sample I revealed four distinct symptoms profiles: (1) ‘symptomatically resilient’; (2) ‘symptomatically low-moderate’; (3) ‘symptomatically moderate-high’; and (4) ‘symptomatically overall high’. LPA of sample II revealed three distinct symptoms profiles: (1) ‘symptomatically resilient’; (2) ‘symptomatically low-moderate’; (3) “symptomatically moderate-high”. Moreover, profile variation was implicated in dysfunction. Consistent with studies focusing on single trauma exposure, the findings revealed that the most prevalent profile was the symptomatically resilient, indicating that most people exposed to CTS seem to evince a scarce number of psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, reactions to CTS proved broader than the existing PTSD symptomatology. Examining symptom dominance and severity in relation to impairment and dysfunction, and clinical considerations are discussed.

"The Youth Anxiety Measure for DSM-5 (YAM-5): Correlations with anxiety, fear, and depression scales in non-clinical children","The Youth Anxiety Measure for DSM-5 (YAM-5) is a newly developed rating scale for assessing anxiety disorder symptoms of children and adolescents in terms of the contemporary classification system. In the present study, 187 children aged 8–12 years completed the new measure as well as the trait version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), the Short Form of the Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised (FSSC-R-SF), the Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS), the Selective Mutism Questionnaire (SMQ), and the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI). Results indicated that part one of the YAM-5, which measures symptoms of the major anxiety disorders, was most substantially linked with the trait anxiety scale of the STAIC, whereas part two, which measures phobic symptoms, was most clearly associated with the FSSC-R-SF. The correlation between the YAM-5 and the SCAS was also robust, and particularly strong correlations were found between subscales of both questionnaires that assessed similar symptoms. Further, the selective mutism subscale of the YAM-5 was most clearly linked to the SMQ. Finally, the YAM-5 was also significantly correlated with depression symptoms as indexed by the CDI. These findings provide further support for the concurrent validity of the YAM-5.

Metacognitive therapy versus disorder-specific CBT for comorbid anxiety disorders: A randomized controlled trial,"Few studies have compared the effects of Metacognitive therapy (MCT) and Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for comorbid anxiety disorders. In the current study we compared CBT and MCT for heterogeneous anxiety disorders in a residential setting. Ninety patients with a primary diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Social Phobia or Panic disorder, with and without Agoraphobia, were randomized to either CBT or MCT. Patients were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and one-year follow-up. Primary outcome measures were Beck Anxiety Inventory and ADIS IV and secondary outcome measures were SCID II, Beck Depression Inventory, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, The Symptom Checklist-90 and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems–64. Treatment fidelity was satisfactory and therapist credibility was equal in both treatments. There was a significant difference in the level of anxiety favouring MCT at post-treatment ( d = 0.7), but there were no differences at one-year follow-up, mainly due to a further improvement in the CBT group during the follow-up period. Both treatments were efficacious. No differences in effect on comorbid diagnoses and symptoms were found, but MCT produced larger change in personality problems. MCT seems to have a more rapid effect on anxiety symptoms, but there were no significant differences in the long term for patients with comorbid anxiety disorders.

Examining anxiety sensitivity as a mediator of the association between PTSD symptoms and suicide risk among women firefighters,"Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are associated with increased suicide risk. Anxiety sensitivity (AS)—the fear of anxiety-related sensations—is both a vulnerability factor for and consequence of PTSD symptoms. AS also predicts suicide risk. To our knowledge, no study has examined whether AS concerns account for the association between PTSD symptoms and suicide risk. Method: A total of 254 women firefighters completed a web-based mental health survey. The Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5) was administered as a prelude to the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) to assess for exposure to a Criterion A event. The PCL-5, Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3), and Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) were utilized to assess PTSD symptoms, AS concerns, and suicide risk, respectively. Bootstrap mediation analyses were conducted, controlling for depression symptoms as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale—Revised (CESD-R). Results: Global and cognitive AS concerns, but neither physical nor social AS concerns, were statistically significant mediators of the relationship between PTSD symptoms (total score, re-experiencing and numbing clusters) and suicide risk. Alternate mediation models testing PTSD symptoms as a mediator of the relationship between AS concerns and suicide risk were not statistically significant, supporting the specificity of our proposed model. Conclusions: Anxiety sensitivity concerns—specifically, cognitive AS concerns—account for the link between PTSD symptoms and suicide risk among women firefighters. Among firefighters with elevated PTSD symptoms, interventions that address cognitive AS concerns may thwart the trajectory to suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Facial emotion processing in pediatric social anxiety disorder: Relevance of situational context,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) typically begins in childhood. Previous research has demonstrated that adult patients respond with elevated late positivity (LP) to negative facial expressions. In the present study on pediatric SAD, we investigated responses to negative facial expressions and the role of social context information. Fifteen children with SAD and 15 non-anxious controls were first presented with images of negative facial expressions with masked backgrounds. Following this, the complete images which included context information, were shown. The negative expressions were either a result of an emotion-relevant (e.g., social exclusion) or emotion-irrelevant elicitor (e.g., weight lifting). Relative to controls, the clinical group showed elevated parietal LP during face processing with and without context information. Both groups differed in their frontal LP depending on the type of context. In SAD patients, frontal LP was lower in emotion-relevant than emotion-irrelevant contexts. We conclude that SAD patients direct more automatic attention towards negative facial expressions (parietal effect) and are less capable in integrating affective context information (frontal effect).

Young children have social worries too: Validation of a brief parent report measure of social worries in children aged 4–8 years,"This study investigated the psychometric properties of the Social Worries Anxiety Index for Young children (SWAIY), adapted from the Social Worries Questionnaire—Parent version (SWQ-P; Spence, 1995), as a measure of social anxiety in young children. 169 parents of children aged four to eight years from a community sample completed the SWAIY and a standardized measure of anxiety; the SWAIY was completed again two weeks later. Parents deemed the items appropriate and relevant to children of this age. The SWAIY demonstrated excellent (&gt; 0.80) internal consistency and a one-factor model. Test-retest reliability was strong ( r = 0.87) and evidence of convergent validity ( r &gt; .50) was found. The study provides initial evidence for the validation of SWAIY as a measure of social anxiety in children aged four to eight years old. This questionnaire is ideal for investigating social anxiety over early childhood and the relationship between early social worries and later anxiety disorders.

Admixture analysis of age of onset in generalized anxiety disorder,"Age of onset is a marker of clinically relevant subtypes in various medical and psychiatric disorders. Past research has also reported that age of onset in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is clinically significant; but, in research to date, arbitrary cut-off ages have been used. In the present study, admixture analysis was used to determine the best fitting model for age of onset distribution in GAD. Data were derived from 459 adults with a diagnosis of GAD who took part in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Associations between age of onset subtypes, identified by admixture analysis, and sociodemographic, clinical, and vulnerability factors were examined using univariate tests and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Two age of onset distributions were identified: an early-onset group (24 years of age and younger) and a late-onset group (greater than 24 years of age). Multivariate analysis revealed that early-onset GAD was associated with female gender (OR 2.1 (95%CI 1.4–3.2)), higher education (OR 1.1 (95%CI 1.0–1.2)), and higher neuroticism (OR 1.4 (95%CI 1.1–1.7)), while late-onset GAD was associated with physical illnesses (OR 1.3 (95%CI 1.1–1.7)). Study limitations include the possibility of recall bias given that age of onset was assessed retrospectively, and an inability to detect a possible very-late-onset GAD subtype. Collectively, the results of the study indicate that GAD is characterized by a bimodal age of onset distribution with an objectively determined early cut-off at 24 years of age. Early-onset GAD is associated with unique factors that may contribute to its aetiology; but, it does not constitute a more severe subtype compared to late-onset GAD. Future research should use 24 years of age as the cut-off for early-onset GAD to when examining the clinical relevance of age of onset for treatment efficacy and illness course.

The “weakest link” as an indicator of cognitive vulnerability differentially predicts symptom dimensions of anxiety in adolescents in China,"This multiwave longitudinal study examined the cognitive vulnerability-stress component of hopelessness theory to differentially predict symptom dimensions of anxiety using a “weakest link” approach in a sample of adolescents from Hunan Province, China. Baseline and 6-month follow-up data were obtained from 553 middle-school students. During an initial assessment, participants completed measures of assessing their weakest links, anxious symptoms, and the occurrence of stress. Participants subsequently completed measures assessing stress, and anxious symptoms one a month for six months. Higher weakest link scores were associated with greater increases in the harm avoidance and separation anxiety/panic dimensions, but not the physical or social anxiety dimension, of anxious symptoms following stress in Chinese adolescents. These results support the applicability of the “weakest link” approach, derived from hopelessness theory, in Chinese adolescents. Weakest link scores as cognitive vulnerability factors may play a role in the development of anxious symptoms, especially in the cognitive dimensions (e.g., harm avoidance and separation anxiety/panic). Our findings also have potential value in explaining the effectiveness of cognitive relevant therapy in treating the cognitive dimensions of anxious symptoms.

"Maternal emotion regulation during child distress, child anxiety accommodation, and links between maternal and child anxiety","Environmental contributions are thought to play a primary role in the familial aggregation of anxiety, but parenting influences remain poorly understood. We examined dynamic relations between maternal anxiety, maternal emotion regulation (ER) during child distress, maternal accommodation of child distress, and child anxiety. Mothers (N = 45) of youth ages 3–8 years (M = 4.8) participated in an experimental task during which they listened to a standardized audio recording of a child in anxious distress pleading for parental intervention. Measures of maternal and child anxiety, mothers’ affective states, mothers’ ER strategies during the child distress, and maternal accommodation of child anxiety were collected. Mothers’ resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) reactivity during the recording was also acquired. Higher maternal negative affect and greater maternal ER switching (i.e., using multiple ER strategies in a short time without positive regulatory results) during child distress were associated with child anxiety. Sequential mediation modeling showed that maternal anxiety predicted ineffective maternal ER during child distress exposure, which in turn predicted greater maternal accommodation, which in turn predicted higher child anxiety. Findings support the mediating roles of maternal ER and accommodation in linking maternal and child anxiety, and suggest that ineffective maternal ER and subsequent attempts to accommodate child distress may act as mechanisms underlying the familial aggregation of anxiety.

Effects of acute exercise on fear extinction in rats and exposure therapy in humans: Null findings from five experiments,"Background: Exposure therapy is an established learning-based intervention for the treatment of anxiety disorders with an average response rate of nearly 50%, leaving room for improvement. Emerging strategies to enhance exposure therapy in humans and fear extinction retention in animal models are primarily pharmacological. These approaches are limited as many patients report preferring non-pharmacological approaches in therapy. With general cognitive enhancement effects, exercise has emerged as a plausible non-pharmacological augmentation strategy. The present study tested the hypothesis that fear extinction and exposure therapy would be enhanced by a pre-training bout of exercise. Methods: We conducted four experiments with rats that involved a standardized conditioning and extinction paradigm and a manipulation of exercise. In a fifth experiment, we manipulated vigorous-intensity exercise prior to a standardized virtual reality exposure therapy session among adults with fear of heights. Results: In experiments 1–4, exercise did not facilitate fear extinction, long-term memory, or fear relapse tests. In experiment 5, human participants showed an overall reduction in fear of heights but exercise did not enhance symptom improvement. Conclusions: Although acute exercise prior to fear extinction or exposure therapy, as operationalized in the present 5 studies, did not enhance outcomes, these results must be interpreted within the context of a broader literature that includes positive findings. Taken all together, this suggests that more research is necessary to identify optimal parameters and key individual differences so that exercise can be implemented successfully to treat anxiety disorders.

The mediating effect of mindful non-reactivity in exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy for severe health anxiety,"Exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of severe health anxiety, but little is known about mediators of treatment effect. The aim of the present study was to investigate mindful non-reactivity as a putative mediator of health anxiety outcome using data from a large scale randomized controlled trial. We assessed mindful non-reactivity using the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire-Non-Reactivity scale (FFMQ-NR) and health anxiety with the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). Participants with severe health anxiety ( N =158) were randomized to internet-delivered exposure-based CBT or behavioral stress management (BSM) and throughout the treatment, both the mediator and outcome were measured weekly. As previously reported, exposure-based CBT was more effective than BSM in reducing health anxiety. In the present study, latent process growth modeling showed that treatment condition had a significant effect on the FFMQ-NR growth trajectory (α-path), estimate=0.18, 95% CI [0.04, 0.32], p = .015, indicating a larger increase in mindful non-reactivity among participants receiving exposure-based CBT compared to the BSM group. The FFMQ-NR growth trajectory was significantly correlated with the SHAI trajectory (β-path estimate = −1.82, 95% CI [−2.15, −1.48], p &lt; .001. Test of the indirect effect, i.e. the estimated mediation effect (αβ) revealed a significant cross product of −0.32, which was statistically significant different from zero based on the asymmetric confidence interval method, 95% CI [−0.59, −0.06]. We conclude that increasing mindful non-reactivity may be of importance for achieving successful treatment outcomes in exposure-based CBT for severe health anxiety.

Development and validation of two measures of emotional contrast avoidance: The contrast avoidance questionnaires,"The Contrast Avoidance (CA) model (Newman &amp; Llera, 2011) proposed that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) fear sharp emotional shifts (or contrasts ), such as the shift from a pleasant or neutral state to one of sudden distress following a negative event. Further, the model suggests that chronic worry is employed by those with GAD to sustain negative emotionality as a means to avoid sudden shifts into negativity. The model has received empirical support; however, no validated measure exists to assess CA tendencies. In this paper we developed and tested two measures of CA: one focusing on worry, and another examining broader mechanisms of CA that could be used test whether CA is applicable to other disorders. In Study 1, Part 1, we used 3 samples of participants (each N = 410) to perform item reduction, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis. In Study 1, Part 2, we performed tests of construct validity. In Study 2, we used a new sample (N = 126) to determine test-retest reliability. All data point to the strong psychometric properties of the CA questionnaires and their relationship to GAD. Both measures distinguished between participants reporting clinical levels of GAD symptoms and nonanxious controls, demonstrating their utility as complementary measures of CA tendencies.

Predictors of clinician use of exposure therapy in community mental health settings,"Exposure therapy is recognized as the key component of cognitive-behavioral treatment for anxiety. However, exposure is the least used evidence-based treatment in community mental health settings and is the most challenging technique for clinicians to adopt within the context of effectiveness and implementation trials. Little work has examined clinician and organizational characteristics that predict use of exposure, which is important for identifying implementation strategies that may increase its use. In a large sample of community health clinicians ( N = 335) across 31 clinical practice sites, this study characterized clinician and organizational predictors of exposure use and relaxation for anxiety. Mixed effects regression analyses indicated that both clinician attitudes and an organization’s implementation climate may be important levers for interventions seeking to increase clinician exposure use. Greater clinician use of relaxation strategies was also associated with less exposure use. Results point to important implications for implementing cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety, including de-emphasizing relaxation and attending to organizational climate.

Subtyping social anxiety in youth,"Few empirical studies have examined subtypes of social anxiety disorder (SAD) in youth, and limited consensus resides on the nature of potential subtypes. Identifying subtypes, based on both fear and avoidance patterns, can help improve assessment and treatment of SAD. Subtypes of fear and avoidance were examined in a sample comprising 131 youth (age 8–15 years) diagnosed with SAD using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for children and parents (ADIS-C/P). Exploratory factor analysis of fear responses revealed three factors, defining fear subtypes linked to: (1) performance, (2) observation, and (3) interaction situations, respectively. Exploratory factor analysis of avoidance responses showed these were best represented by one avoidance factor. Few youth qualified exclusively for either of the fear subtypes, thus calling into question the clinical utility of these subtypes. Nevertheless, the findings indicate distinct contributions of fear and avoidance in SAD presentation. This finding might help clinicians target and improve treatment of the disorder.

The Looming Maladaptive Style Questionnaire: Measurement invariance and relations to anxiety and depression across 10 countries,"The Looming Maladaptive Style Questionnaire (LMSQ) is a self-report measure designed to assess the looming cognitive style, a tendency to interpret threats as rapidly approaching and increasing in magnitude. To date, no systematic evaluation on the psychometric properties of the LMSQ across diverse cultural contexts has been done. In the present research, the measurement invariance of the LMSQ test scores was examined in 10 countries ( N = 4000). Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that a two-factor model (i.e., physical looming and social looming) fitted the data well across countries. Partial measurement invariance was established for the LMSQ scores across the countries whereas full measurement invariance was achieved across gender. Meta-analytic structural equation modeling was applied to examine the unique contributions of the two looming factors to anxiety and depression symptoms. Results indicated that the test scores underlying two looming factors were crucial and valid predictors of symptoms. The LMSQ shows promise as a measure with cross-cultural generalizability and opens new avenues for its use in diverse cultural settings.

The affective tie that binds: Examining the contribution of positive emotions and anxiety to relationship formation in social anxiety disorder,"Individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) have difficulty forming social relationships. The prevailing clinical perspective is that negative emotions such as anxiety inhibit one’s capacity to develop satisfying social connections. However, empirical findings from social psychology and affective neuroscience suggest that positive emotional experiences are fundamental to establishing new social bonds. To reconcile these perspectives, we collected repeated measurements of anxiety, positive emotions (pleasantness), and connectedness over the course of a controlled relationship formation encounter in 56 participants diagnosed with SAD (64% female; M age =23.3, SD = 4.7). Participants experienced both increases in positive emotions and decreases in anxiety throughout the interaction. Change in positive emotions was the most robust predictor of subsequent increases in connectedness, as well as a greater desire to engage one’s partner in future social activities, above and beyond reductions in anxiety (medium to large sized effects). Those findings suggest that anxiety-based models alone may not fully explain difficulties in relationship formation in SAD, and underscore the potential value of considering positive emotional experiences in conceptual and treatment models of SAD.

A review of sociocultural factors that may underlie differences in African American and European American anxiety,"Preliminary evidence indicates there may be differences in the prevalence and severity of anxiety in African Americans and European Americans. A number of sociocultural risk and protective factors have been suggested to contribute to these group differences, such as salience of physical illnesses, discrimination, stigma toward mental illness, religiosity, and ethnic identity. In this paper, the literature concerning each of these factors is reviewed. Overall, the strongest evidence was found for ethnic identity and stigma toward mental illness as factors underlying group differences in anxiety. Ethnic identity and stigma toward mental illness consistently differed by racial group and were associated with anxiety in African Americans. Ethnic identity may buffer against the negative consequences of anxiety, reducing prevalence rates in African Americans. Stigma toward mental illness may decrease African Americans willingness to report anxiety symptoms, reducing overall prevalence rates but increasing the severity of treated cases. The research regarding discrimination, salience of physical illnesses, and religiosity was less clear. Much more research is required, but the findings of this review suggest that future studies should put particular emphasis on stigma toward mental illness and ethnic identity as important factors in understanding African American anxiety outcomes.

Efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for childhood anxiety and depression,"A review of meta-analyses of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety and depression was conducted. A total of 36 meta-analyses were identified that met inclusion criteria for this review. In most cases, medium-to-large effect sizes for treatment reduction were observed when CBT was compared to non-active control conditions. Small-to-medium effects were observed when CBT was compared to active control treatments. The available meta-analyses generally did not examine, or data were not sufficient to evaluate, potential moderators of outcome, differential effects for parental involvement, or changes in quality of life or functional outcomes associated with treatment. Accordingly, while CBT should be broadly considered an effective treatment approach for childhood anxiety and depression, additional research is warranted in order to establish guidelines for service delivery for complicating factors in client presentation.

"The structure, correlates, and treatment related changes of mindfulness facets across the anxiety disorders and obsessive compulsive disorder","Research with non-clinical and clinical samples has examined how mindfulness concepts relate to psychological symptom presentations. However, there is less clarity when examining treatment-seeking patients who experience DSM-diagnosed anxiety and obsessional disorders—both cross-sectionally, and following empirically-supported treatments. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer, &amp; Toney, 2006) conceptualizes mindfulness as consisting of five facets: Observing, Describing, Acting with Awareness, Nonreactivity, and Nonjudging. The current study examines the factor structure and predictive validity of the FFMQ in a large sample of treatment-seeking individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD/A), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) established that both four and five-factor models (i.e., with and without inclusion of the Observing factor) provided an acceptable representation of the underlying FFMQ structure, but did not support a one-factor solution. For each of these diagnostic groups, hierarchical regression analyses clarified the association between specific FFMQ facets and diagnosis specific symptom change during CBT treatment. These findings are discussed in the context of the possible transdiagnostic relevance of specific mindfulness facets, and how these facets are differentially associated with diagnosis specific symptom alleviation during CBT.

The role of anxiety sensitivity in the relation between anxious arousal and cannabis and alcohol use problems among low-income inner city racial/ethnic minorities,"The current study explored anxiety sensitivity as a factor accounting for the association between anxious arousal and problems related to use of cannabis and alcohol among a health disparity sample (low income minorities). Specifically, participants were 130 low-income racial/ethnic minorities who reported daily cannabis use (M age = 37.7 SD = 10.0; 28.5% female). There were significant indirect associations of anxious arousal via anxiety sensitivity in relation to: cannabis use problems, cannabis withdrawal symptoms, use of cannabis to cope, as well as hazardous drinking, alcohol use problems, and alcohol consumption. These data indicate anxiety sensitivity is a possible mechanism underlying the relation between anxious arousal and substance use problems among low-income racial/ethnic minorities. Future work could evaluate the efficacy of cannabis and alcohol use treatments incorporating anxiety sensitivity reduction techniques to facilitate amelioration of anxiety and substance use and offset mental health inequalities for this population.

Synergistic effects of pain intensity and experiential avoidance in relation to anxiety symptoms and disorders among economically disadvantaged latinos in a community-based primary care setting,"Latinos are subject to numerous health inequalities, including mental health disparity for anxiety and its disorders. In fact, there is strikingly little understanding of transdiagnostic risk factors for the onset and development of anxiety symptoms and disorders among Latinos. To build knowledge in this domain, the present investigation examined the interactive effects of experiential avoidance and pain intensity in relation to anxious arousal, social anxiety, and anxiety disorders among 361 Latino adults with annual incomes of less than $30,000 (87.5% female; M age = 38.8, SD = 11.4, and 98.5% used Spanish as their first language) who attended a community-based primary healthcare clinic. As hypothesized, the interaction between experiential avoidance and pain intensity was significantly related to anxious arousal, social anxiety, and a number of anxiety disorders over and above the effects of other factors. The form of the significant interactions indicated that participants reporting co-occurring higher levels of experiential avoidance and pain intensity evinced the greatest levels of anxious arousal, social anxiety, and anxiety disorders. These data provide novel empirical evidence suggesting that there is clinically-relevant interplay between experiential avoidance and pain intensity in regard to a relatively wide array of anxiety problems among Latinos in a primary care medical setting.

Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and negative affect during tobacco withdrawal in a non-clinical sample of African American smokers,"The association between obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptomatology and smoking is poorly understood, particularly in African Americans—a group subject to smoking- and OC-related health disparities. In a non-clinical sample of 253 African American smokers, we tested the negative reinforcement model of OC-smoking comorbidity, purporting that smokers with higher OC symptoms experience greater negative affect (NA) and urge to smoke for NA suppression upon acute tobacco abstinence. Following a baseline visit involving OC assessment, participants completed two counterbalanced experimental visits (non-abstinent vs. 16-h tobacco abstinence) involving affect, smoking urge, and nicotine withdrawal assessment. OC symptom severity predicted larger abstinence-provoked increases in overall NA, anger, anxiety, depression, fatigue, urge to smoke to suppress NA, and composite nicotine withdrawal symptom index. African American smokers with elevated OC symptoms appear to be vulnerable to negative reinforcement-mediated smoking motivation and may benefit from cessation treatments that diminish NA or the urge to quell NA via smoking.

Disparities in anxiety and its disorders,"Much of the scientific work addressing the enigmas of anxiety and its disorders has been conducted among European Americans. This work has led to great progress into the nature of anxiety psychopathology, including etiologic, maintenance, and relapse processes. Moreover, evidenced-based treatments for anxiety and its disorders have arguably been among the best in the field of psychopathology for well over two decades. Yet, the progress thus far attained on the nature and treatment of anxiety disorders has not benefited all members of society equally. In fact, there are striking gaps of inequalities in anxiety disorder research and practice. The population in the United States (U.S.) and many parts of the industrialized world is rapidly changing in terms of diversity, and gaps between segments of society are growing in many instances (e.g., financial inequity). Health disparities in anxiety disorders are not a generic issue, but rather, reflect a systematic difference disproportionately affecting groups often not afforded a high social status ranking. We developed this Special Issue in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders to call attention to matters of inequality in anxiety disorders. The present special issue is designed to contextualize contemporary health disparity work on anxiety and its disorders. The special issue highlights three domains of study that are starting to guide research and practice in this arena, including sociocultural and contextual influences on anxiety and its disorders; intra-individual transdiagnostic mechanisms underpinning the expression and etiology/maintenance of anxiety psychopathology; and the close interconnection between anxiety processes and health status and health compromising behaviors. By covering a range of issues interconnected by their focus on understanding health disparity issues, it is hoped that this issue will: alert readers to the significance of this work at different levels of analysis; illustrate the many domains currently being explored via innovative approaches; and identify fecund areas for future systematic study.

Anxiety sensitivity and racial differences in sleep duration: Results from a national survey of adults with cardiovascular disease,"Although Blacks sleep between 37 and 75min less per night than non-Hispanic Whites, research into what drives racial differences in sleep duration is limited. We examined the association of anxiety sensitivity, a cognitive vulnerability, and race (Blacks vs. White) with short sleep duration (&lt;7h of sleep/night), and whether anxiety sensitivity mediated race differences in sleep duration in a nationally representative sample of adults with cardiovascular disease. Overall, 1289 adults (115 Black, 1174 White) with a self-reported physician/health professional diagnosis of ≥1 myocardial infarction completed an online survey. Weighted multivariable logistic regressions and mediation analyses with bootstrapping and case resampling were conducted. Anxiety sensitivity and Black vs. White race were associated with 4%–84% increased odds, respectively, of short sleep duration. Anxiety sensitivity mediated Black–White differences in sleep duration. Each anxiety sensitivity subscale was also a significant mediator. Implications for future intervention science to address sleep disparities are discussed.

"Differential associations between Social Anxiety Disorder, family cohesion, and suicidality across racial/ethnic groups: Findings from the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent (NCS-A)","The proposed research seeks to introduce a novel model relating Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and suicide outcomes (i.e., passive suicidal ideation, active suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts) in diverse adolescents. This model posits that family cohesion is one pathway by which suicide risk is increased for socially anxious youth, and predicts that the relationships between these variables may be of different strength in Latino and White subgroups and across gender. Data from a sample of Latino ( n = 1922) and non-Hispanic White (hereafter referred to as White throughout) ( n = 5648) male and female adolescents who participated in the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent were used for this study. Analyses were conducted using generalized structural equation modeling. Results showed that the mediation model held for White females. Further examination of direct pathways highlighted SAD as a risk factor unique to Latinos for active suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, over and above comorbid depression and other relevant contextual factors. Additionally, family cohesion showed a strong association with suicide outcomes across groups, with some inconsistent findings for White males. Overall, it appears that the mechanism by which SAD increases risk for suicidality is different across groups, indicating further need to identify relevant mediators, especially for racial/ethnic minority youth.

"Anxiety sensitivity explains associations between anxious arousal symptoms and smoking abstinence expectancies, perceived barriers to cessation, and problems experienced during past quit attempts among low-income smokers","Disproportionately more smokers report low-income and mental health problems relative to non-smokers. Low-income smokers may use smoking to alleviate negative emotional states resulting from exposure to multiple stressors. Yet, little work has been devoted to elucidating mechanisms that may explain the association between negative emotional states and smoking-related processes among low-income smokers. The present study sought to address this gap by examining anxiety sensitivity, a transdiagnostic factor related to both anxiety and smoking, as a potential mediator for the influence of anxiety symptoms on smoking-related processes, including threat-related smoking abstinence expectancies (somatic symptoms and harmful consequences), perceived barriers for cessation, and problems experienced during past quit attempts. Participants included treatment-seeking daily cigarette smokers ( n = 101; 68.3% male; M age = 47.1; SD = 10.2). Results indicated that anxiety symptoms exerted a significant indirect effect through anxiety sensitivity for threat-related smoking abstinence expectancies (somatic symptoms and harmful consequences), perceived barriers for cessation, and problems experienced during past quit attempts. The present results provide empirical support that anxiety sensitivity may be an underlying mechanism that partially explains the relation between anxiety symptoms and smoking processes among low-income treatment-seeking smokers. Findings broaden current theoretical understanding of pathways through which anxiety symptoms contribute to maladaptive smoking processes and cognitions among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.

Perceived distress tolerance accounts for the covariance between discrimination experiences and anxiety symptoms among sexual minority adults,"Sexual orientation-related discrimination experiences have been implicated in elevated rates of anxiety symptoms within sexual minority groups. Theory suggests that chronic discrimination experiences may dampen the ability to tolerate distress, increasing vulnerability for anxiety. This study examined the role of distress tolerance, or the capacity to withstand negative emotions, as a construct underlying associations between discriminatory experiences and anxiety among sexual minority adults. Participants (N = 119; M age = 36.4 ± 14.8; 50% cisgender male, 31% cisgender female, 19% transgender; 37% non-Latino white) were recruited from Houston, Texas. Measures administered included the Heterosexist Harassment, Rejection, and Discrimination Scale (discrimination experiences), Distress Tolerance Scale (distress tolerance), and the State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (anxiety). The association of discrimination experiences and anxiety through distress tolerance was assessed using covariate-adjusted mediation modeling. Results indicated that sexual orientation-related discrimination experiences were significantly and positively associated with anxiety and that this association was mediated through lower distress tolerance. Significant indirect effects were specific to cognitive (versus somatic) anxiety symptoms. Results suggest that distress tolerance may be an explanatory mechanism in the association between discriminatory experiences and cognitive symptoms of anxiety and a potentially relevant target within clinical interventions to address anxiety-related health disparities among sexual minority adults. However, more sophisticated designs are needed to delineate causal associations.

Acculturative stress is associated with trajectory of anxiety symptoms during pregnancy in Mexican-American women,"Over half of pregnant women report anxiety symptoms and these symptoms may be precipitated by stressful experiences. Anxiety rates may be higher in Mexican-American women who experience sociocultural stressors, such as acculturation, acculturative stress and discrimination. However, the role of such stressors on the trajectory of anxiety symptoms across pregnancy is not yet known. Mexican-American women (n=151) completed surveys across pregnancy about acculturation, acculturative stress, perceived discrimination, and state anxiety. Multilevel modeling found that acculturation (Anglo orientation, b =0.050, SE =0.379, t (137.561)=0.134, p =0.894; Mexican orientation, b =0.775, SE =0.692, t (133.424)=1.121, p =0.264) and perceived discrimination ( b =−1.259, SE =0.921, t (137.489)=−1.367, p =0.174) were not associated with the trajectory of anxiety symptoms. However, acculturative stress, even while controlling for perceived stress, was associated with high levels of anxiety symptoms that were elevated early in pregnancy ( b =−0.045, SE =0.022, t (135.749)=−2, p =0.047). This work highlights the unique role of acculturative stress in risk for prenatal anxiety in early pregnancy.

Using a cultural and RDoC framework to conceptualize anxiety in Asian Americans,"Asian Americans are one of the fastest growing minority groups in the United States; however, mental health within this population segment, particularly anxiety disorders, remains significantly understudied. Both the heterogeneity within the Asian American population and the multidimensional nature of anxiety contribute to difficulties in understanding anxiety in this population. The present paper reviewed two sources of heterogeneity within anxiety in Asian Americans: (1) cultural variables and (2) mechanisms or components of anxiety. Specifically, we examined four cultural variables most commonly found in research related to anxiety in Asian Americans: acculturation, loss of face, affect valuation, and individualism-collectivism. We also discussed ways to parse anxiety through a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, specifically focusing on sensitivity to acute and potential threat, constructs within the Negative Valence System. Previously unpublished preliminary data were presented to illustrate one way of examining ethnic differences in anxiety using an RDoC framework. Finally, this paper offered recommendations for future work in this area.

"Examining anxiety sensitivity as an explanatory construct underlying HIV-related stigma: Relations to anxious arousal, social anxiety, and HIV symptoms among persons living with HIV","Persons living with HIV (PLHIV) are a health disparity subgroup of the overall population for mental and physical health problems. HIV-related stigma has been shown to increase anxiety symptoms and HIV symptoms among PLHIV. However, little is known about factors that may impact the relations between HIV-related stigma and anxiety symptoms and HIV symptoms among PLHIV. To address this gap in the literature, the current study examined anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the extent to which individuals believe anxiety and anxiety-related sensations) in the relation between HIV-related stigma, social anxiety, anxious arousal, and HIV symptoms among a sample of 87 PLHIV (60.9% cis gender male, 52.9% Black, non-Hispanic). Results indicated that anxiety sensitivity mediated the relations between HIV-related stigma and the dependent variables, with effect sizes indicating moderate to large effects of anxiety sensitivity on these relations. Findings suggest that anxiety sensitivity be a mechanistic factor in the relations between HIV-related stigma and social anxiety, anxious arousal, and HIV symptoms, and therefore, be important element in efforts to reduce mental/physical health disparity among this population.

Response bias-related impairment of early subjective face discrimination in social anxiety disorders: An event-related potential study,"Considerable research has shown that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is accompanied by various negative cognitive biases, such as social feedback expectancy bias, memory bias, and interpretation bias. However, whether the memory bias in individuals with SAD is actually a manifestation of response bias, and whether such response bias is associated with deficits in face discrimination, remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated response bias (i.e., a tendency to recognize more negative evaluations) to faces with positive (social acceptance) or negative (social rejection) social evaluations in individuals with SAD and healthy controls (HCs) using event-related potentials (ERPs). Behavioral results revealed significant group differences in response bias in the forced-choice recall task, but no difference in overall memory accuracy. ERP results demonstrated that HCs showed a larger N170 to faces that had rejected them as compared to those that had accepted them, but this effect was not evident in the SAD group. Further analysis showed that response bias was correlated with the ΔN170 (rejected—accepted) amplitude. We concluded that the response bias in individuals with SAD is resulted from impairments in early discrimination of social faces, as reflected by the absent early N170 differentiation effect, which was associated with their combined negative biases.

Cortisol as a predictor of psychological therapy response in anxiety disorders—Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Although psychotherapy generally is effective in anxiety disorders, many patients are treatment-resistant. At the same time, some patients with anxiety disorders show alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, one of the major stress-responsive systems. Since raised levels of the end product of the HPA axis, cortisol, adversely affect cognition, we hypothesised that more pronounced alterations in cortisol levels would be associated with a less favourable response to psychotherapy. More specifically, the higher patients’ basal levels and the lower their levels during exposure, the less likely we expected them to profit from treatment. Methods: We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO to review the literature and perform a meta-analysis on the relationship between pre-treatment cortisol and psychotherapy response. Records were included if they studied patients with any anxiety disorder undergoing psychotherapy, with a pre-treatment cortisol and a post-treatment symptom measure. Correlation coefficients were extracted for meta-analyses. Results: We identified six studies (N = 274). No relationship between patients’ basal cortisol and post-treatment symptoms was found ( p = 0.981). The systematic review showed higher cortisol during exposure sessions to predict better outcomes. Meta-analysis did not confirm this ( p = 0.603). Conclusions: Basal cortisol did not seem to predict psychological therapy responses in patients with anxiety disorders. By contrast, the current state of research is equivocal in terms of whether higher cortisol concentrations during exposure sessions are linked with better treatment outcomes, and more research is needed to investigate this.

Self-views in social anxiety disorder: The impact of CBT versus MBSR,"This study examines the impact of Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy (CBGT) versus Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) versus Waitlist (WL) on self-views in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). One hundred eight unmedicated patients with SAD were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of CBGT, MBSR, or WL, and completed a self-referential encoding task (SRET) that assessed self-endorsement of positive and negative self-views pre- and post-treatment. At baseline, 40 healthy controls (HCs) also completed the SRET. At baseline, patients with SAD endorsed greater negative and lesser positive self-views than HCs. Compared to baseline, patients in both CBGT and MBSR decreased negative self-views and increased positive self-views. Improvement in self-views, specifically increases in positive (but not decreases in negative) self-views, predicted CBGT- and MBSR-related decreases in social anxiety symptoms. Enhancement of positive self-views may be a shared therapeutic process for both CBGT and MBSR for SAD.

Transdiagnostic versus diagnosis specific cognitive behavioural therapies for anxiety: A meta-analysis,"Research evaluating transdiagnostic CBT (tCBT) demonstrates its efficacy. Some evidence suggests equivalence between tCBT and diagnosis-specific CBT (dxCBT), however more investigations are necessary to clarify any difference in efficacy. This meta-analysis was conducted to compare tCBT and dxCBT, and to investigate the differential impact of comorbidity on effect sizes. Pre and post scores from primary anxiety measures in 83 treatment conditions, taken from studies primarily targeting anxiety disorders, were summarised and compared. Meta-regression analyses were then used to test the effects of comorbidity. DxCBT and tCBT meta-effects were found to be large, where g = 0.951, 95% CI: 0.874–1.027, and g = 1.059, 95% CI: 0.876–1.242, respectively. While statistically different ( p = 0.008), overlap of confidence intervals indicated a lack of clinical significance. Furthermore, no relationship between comorbidity rate and tCBT outcome was observed. These results were discussed in the context of previous findings in the transdiagnostic CBT literature.

Secondary depression in transdiagnostic group cognitive behavioral therapy among individuals diagnosed with anxiety disorders,"Anxiety and depression co-occur at high rates, and their comorbidity typically creates a more severe clinical presentation then either alone. The effect of comorbid depression appears to vary across anxiety and related disorders. Transdiagnostic treatments present a promising option to improve comorbid conditions by targeting shared factors (e.g., information processing biases). The purpose of this study was to examine the reciprocal effects of secondary depression in transdiagnostic group cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety (TGCBT). 120 individuals diagnosed with a primary anxiety disorder, 42 of whom had a depressive diagnosis, were enrolled in 12 weeks of TGCBT. Depressed individuals were compared to those without a depressive diagnosis on both clinician-rated and self-reported anxiety and depression following TGCBT. Although depressed individuals scored higher on most indices of anxiety at pre-treatment, both groups improved similarly with some evidence of greater improvement among those with comorbid depression. All individuals improved in self-reported depressive symptoms and comorbid depression improved to subclinical levels. These results posit TGCBT as an effective, efficient option for treating patients with anxiety and comorbid depression.

"Evaluation of an integrated group cognitive-behavioral treatment for comorbid mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders: A pilot study","This paper presents the development and preliminary evaluation of an integrated group cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for comorbid mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. The 12-session, manualized treatment was developed collaboratively by a mental health program in a teaching hospital and a community-based addictions service and administered in both settings. Results from an uncontrolled effectiveness trial of 29 treatment completers suggest that integrated group CBT may reduce stress and alcohol use symptoms and improve substance refusal self-efficacy. Changes in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and drug use were not significant, although the effect size for anxiety reduction was in the medium range. Nonetheless, the clinical significance of treatment effects on mood, anxiety, and substance use symptoms was modest. Changes in coping skills and quality of life were not significant, although medium-to-large effects were observed for changes in several coping skills. Participants reported being highly satisfied with treatment, found the treatment strategies to be useful, and noted an improvement in their functioning, particularly socially. Methodological and sample size limitations warrant more rigorous follow-up investigations of this treatment. Results are considered in the context of the current literature on integrated psychological treatments for these common comorbidities.

Changes in threat-related cognitions and experiential avoidance in group-based transdiagnostic CBT for anxiety disorders,"Group-based Transdiagnostic Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TCBT) for anxiety disorders aims to target common factors to produce beneficial effects on multiple anxiety disorders at once. While there is growing evidence that various anxiety disorders can be effectively treated by this approach, the common factors contributing to these treatment effects are not well delineated. In a sample of 48 Veterans who completed Group-based TCBT, the current study examined change in threat perception and change in experiential avoidance pre to post-treatment and as potential mediators of changes in negative affect and personalized fear ratings. Results indicated that both threat perception and experiential avoidance were significantly reduced during treatment. Additionally, reductions in both threat perception and experiential avoidance significantly predicted reductions in negative affect and fear ratings. When change in threat perception and change in experiential avoidance were examined simultaneously, both remained significant predictors of changes in negative affect though only experiential avoidance predicted changes in fear ratings. Thus, both reductions in threat perception and experiential avoidance may mediate the broad treatment effects observed in group-based TCBT. Directions for future research are discussed.

An initial waitlist-controlled trial of the unified protocol for the treatment of emotional disorders in adolescents,"A substantial proportion of adolescents are non-responders to well-established treatments for anxiety and depression, and many existent approaches do not adequately address comorbidity. There is a need to develop and evaluate unified treatments for adolescents that flexibly address higher order factors shared among internalizing or emotional disorders. The Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescents (UP-A) is a transdiagnostic treatment that targets shared vulnerability and maintenance factors in a flexible format. This study examined initial outcomes of a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial of the UP-A. The UP-A outperformed waitlist at mid-treatment with respect to disorder severity and functional impairment, and there was a significant treatment effect in favor of the UP-A on all outcome measures at post-treatment. Within-subjects analyses collapsing across participants revealed significant improvements on outcome measures over time. Results support further study of the UP-A and its potential efficacy in treating adolescent anxiety and depression.

Efficacy of transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral group therapy for anxiety disorders and headache in adolescents,"Anxiety disorders and headache are both among the most prevalent disorders among adolescents. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has proved its efficacy with each of these disorders individually, there are several barriers to its utilization, including cost, gaps in knowledge about treatment delivery and modes, and its utility with comorbid disorders. The current study examined the comparative efficacy of a 12 week TCBT Group treatment ( n = 32) versus treatment as usual group ( n = 31) (TAU) in adolescents with anxiety disorders and headache in a north Indian hospital based setting. Results from 63 adolescents suggested while both conditions improved significantly on the Headache Impact Test and Children’s Global Assessment Scale, those receiving TCBT showed significantly greater improvement than those in the TAU condition. Participants receiving TCBT, but not those in the TAU condition, showed significant improvement on the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. The study provides evidence supporting the efficacy of TCBT in adolescents with anxiety disorders and headache. Further, group TCBT has the benefits of easy dissemination and increased access to evidence-based treatment, thus, lowering costs and therapist time.

A test of the core process account of psychopathology in a heterogenous clinical sample of anxiety and depression: A case of the blind men and the elephant?,"Many cognitive and behavioral processes, such as selective attention to threat, self-focused attention, safety-seeking behaviors, worry and thought suppression, have their foundations in research on anxiety disorders. Yet, they are now known to be transdiagnostic, i.e. shared across a wide range of psychological disorders. A more pertinent clinical and theoretical question is whether these processes are themselves distinct, or whether they reflect a shared ‘core’ process that maintains psychopathology. The current study utilized a treatment-seeking clinical adult sample of 313 individuals with a range of anxiety disorders and/or depression who had completed self-report measures of widely ranging processes: affect control, rumination, worry, escape/avoidance, and safety-seeking behaviors. We found that only the first factor extracted from a principal components analysis of the items of these measures was associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Transdiagnostic versus disorder-specific internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy for anxiety and depression in primary care,"Background: Disorder-specific and transdiagnostic internet cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) programs are effective for anxiety and depression, but no studies have compared their effectiveness in primary care. Methods: Patient characteristics, adherence and effectiveness of Transdiagnostic iCBT (n = 1005) were compared to disorder-specific programs for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (n = 738) and depression (n = 366) in a naturalistic non-randomised comparison study. Patients completed their iCBT program in primary care. The PHQ-9 (depression), GAD-7 (generalized anxiety), K-10 (distress), and the WHODAS-II (disability) were measured at pre- and post-treatment. Results: Patients in the Transdiagnostic program had higher comorbidity rates and baseline distress. All programs were associated with medium to large within-group effect sizes for improving anxiety, depression and distress between pre- and post-treatment (d’s = 0.64–1.39). Controlling for baseline group differences in severity, we found small effect sizes favoring the Transdiagnostic program over the GAD program in reducing PHQ-9 ( d = 0.44, 95%CI: 0.34–0.53), K-10 ( d = 0.21, 95%CI: 0.16–0.35) and WHODAS scores ( d = 0.20, 95%CI: 0.10–0.29), and small effect sizes favoring the Transdiagnostic program over the Depression program in reducing GAD-7 scores ( d = 0.48, 95%CI: 0.36–0.60). A smaller proportion of patients completed the Transdiagnostic program (44.9%) compared to the depression (51.6%) and GAD (49.2%) programs, which was attributable to baseline differences in age and symptom severity. Conclusions: Both Transdiagnostic iCBT and disorder-specific iCBT programs are effective in primary care, but there appears to be small effects favoring Transdiagnostic iCBT. Methods to increase adherence are needed to optimize the benefits to patients, and these findings await replication in a RCT.

False safety behavior elimination therapy: A randomized study of a brief individual transdiagnostic treatment for anxiety disorders,"In response to the ever-growing number of CBT based therapy protocols, transdiagnostic approaches to anxiety treatment, based on models of anxiety emphasizing common elements across anxiety disorders, have been increasingly explored. The aim of the current study was to test the efficacy of an individually administered, brief (5-session) transdiagnostic treatment for anxiety disorders. The current treatment (called F-SET) focuses chiefly on the elimination of anxiety maintaining behaviors and cognitive strategies (so-called “safety” aids) among individuals suffering from a range of anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PD). Patients ( N = 28; mean age = 28.5 years; 75% female; 71% White) were randomly assigned to F-SET or waitlist control conditions. Participants were assessed prior to, immediately after, and 1-month following treatment. In addition to independent assessments of diagnostic status, standardized self-report measures and assessor ratings of severity and distress associated with anxiety symptoms were used. Participants in the F-SET condition experienced significantly less anxiety (Cohen’s d = 2.01) and depression (Cohen’s d = 2.16) than those in the WL condition. Mediational analysis showed that change in avoidance strategies mediated the group changes in anxiety symptoms. The results from the current study are an important first step in identifying a simpler, focused form of CBT that can be delivered with minimal therapist training, at a low cost and with minimal client contact time.

Cognitive bias modification of interpretation in children with social anxiety disorder,"Negative (or a lack of positive) interpretation of ambiguous social situations has been hypothesised to maintain social anxiety disorder in children, yet there is currently limited evidence to support this. Cognitive Bias Modification of Interpretation (CBM-I) provides a means to explore the causal influence of interpretation bias on social anxiety disorder, and has been associated with a reduction in social anxiety symptoms in adults. Seven to twelve year old children with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder completed CBM-I training, adapted from materials designed for socially anxious children in the community, or no training. Effects on interpretation bias and social anxiety were assessed. The adapted CBM-I training was not associated with significant changes in benign or negative interpretation. Unsurprisingly given the lack of successful interpretation training, there were no significant changes in child or parent reported social anxiety symptoms, clinician-rated severity or diagnoses and change in interpretation was not significantly associated with change in social anxiety. These findings contrast with some studies with community populations although it is possible that more intensive CBM-I training is required to fully test this hypothesis among clinical groups.

Health anxiety in obsessive compulsive disorder and obsessive compulsive symptoms in severe health anxiety: An investigation of symptom profiles,"Severe health anxiety (SHA) shares features with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and in recent years there has been a debate as to whether the two disorders may represent two facets of the same condition. Few studies have however investigated the overlap and differences in symptom profiles between the disorders. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate these aspects using one sample of participants with a principal diagnosis of SHA and one sample of participants with a principal OCD diagnosis. The second aim was to examine differences in improvement trajectories on measures of health anxiety and OCD symptoms in patients with SHA receiving treatment with exposure and response prevention. We compared persons participating in clinical trials with a principal diagnosis of SHA ( N = 290) to persons with a principal diagnosis of OCD ( n = 95) on measures of health anxiety, OCD symptoms, and depressive symptoms. A subsample of SHA participants ( n = 99) received exposure and response prevention (ERP) for SHA over 12 weeks and was assessed at baseline and post-treatment. The results showed large and significant differences between SHA and OCD patients on measures of health anxiety ( d s = 2.99–3.09) and OCD symptoms ( ds = 1.64–2.14), while they had equivalent levels of depressive symptoms ( d = 0.19, 95% CI [−0.04, 0.43]). In the SHA sample 7.6% had comorbid OCD, and in the OCD sample 9.5% had SHA. For participants with a principal diagnosis of SHA, ERP led to large reductions of health anxiety, but effects on OCD symptoms were small to moderate. Among participants with comorbid OCD, effect sizes were large on measures of health anxiety and moderate to large on OCD measures. We conclude that SHA and OCD are separate psychiatric disorders with limited overlap in symptom profiles.

Effects of a training in mental imagery on worry: A proof-of-principle study,"Worry is characterized by a predominance of verbal thinking and relatively little mental imagery. This cognitive bias of verbal and abstract processing has been found to impair emotional processing of worry topics so that worrisome thoughts are maintained. On the other hand, engaging in mental imagery during the worry process fosters emotional processing of worry themes. In the present study, we examined whether training high worriers ( n = 71) to use more mental imagery in their everyday lives is an effective intervention to reduce pathological worry. Results indicated that our novel training in mental imagery (TMI) led to a significant reduction of worry and impairment, assessed both one and five weeks after the training. Furthermore, in highly anxious participants TMI had beneficial effects on controllability of worry, state anxiety, and positive mood. Theoretical and clinical implications of our findings and methodological limitations of this proof-of-principle study are discussed.

Guided parent-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for childhood anxiety: Predictors of treatment response,"Background: Guided Parent-delivered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (GPD-CBT) is a brief, effective treatment for childhood anxiety disorders, however not all children respond favourably. Aims: To examine predictors of response to GPD-CBT. Methods: Parents of 125 children (7–12 years) with an anxiety disorder received GPD-CBT over 2.6 or 5.3 h. Recovery was measured post treatment and six months later. Results: Younger children and those with primary Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) improved more post treatment, but older children and those without primary GAD had better outcomes at six month follow up. Fewer children allocated to 2.6 h had recovered post treatment compared to those allocated to the 5.2 h intervention, but did not differ significantly six months later. Conclusions: The identification of predictors of short and longer-term treatment outcomes can guide treatment decisions following this low-intensity approach.

Development of a scale to evaluate young children’s responses to uncertainty and low environmental structure,"Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU), defined as the dispositional interpretation of uncertain or ambiguous events as stressful and problematic, has been linked to excessive worry and other anxiety-related problems in adults and youth. IU has been conceptualized as a vulnerability factor for excessive worry and anxiety, but the historical absence of a supported measure of IU in young children has hampered longitudinal research needed to evaluate temporal relationships between IU and anxiety and the differential developmental pathways of IU leading to different anxiety disorders and depression. The present study evaluated the psychometric properties of a newly developed 17-item parent-report measure of younger children’s Responses to Uncertainty and Low Environmental Structure (i.e., the RULES questionnaire). We examined the preliminary structure, reliability, and validity of the RULES within a treatment-seeking sample of children aged 3–10 (N = 160) with anxiety. Findings from an exploratory factor analysis supported a one-factor model that retained all 17 items. The RULES demonstrated strong internal consistency, and predictive, convergent, and divergent validity. In this early childhood sample, the RULES also showed stronger associations with anxiety than did a previously supported measure of IU developed for older youth, and showed preliminary sensitivity to treatment-related change. Findings provide preliminary psychometric support for the RULES as a parent-report measure of children’s responses to uncertainty and low environmental structure that may inform etiologic models of anxiety.

Pathways from uncertainty to anxiety: An evaluation of a hierarchical model of trait and disorder-specific intolerance of uncertainty on anxiety disorder symptoms,"Uncertainty is central to anxiety-related pathology and intolerance of uncertainty (IU) appears to be a transdiagnostic risk and maintaining factor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a hierarchical model to identify the unique contributions of trait and disorder-specific IU (i.e., uncertainty specific to generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and panic disorder) to disorder-specific symptoms, beyond other disorder-specific cognitive vulnerabilities (i.e., negative metacognitive beliefs, fear of negative evaluation, inflated responsibility, and agoraphobic cognitions, respectively). Participants ( N = 506) completed a battery of online questionnaires. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate model fit, as well as direct and indirect pathways. Trait and disorder-specific IU were significantly associated with multiple cognitive vulnerability factors and disorder symptoms. Indirect effects between trait IU and symptoms were observed through disorder-specific IU and cognitive vulnerabilities. The relative contribution of trait IU and disorder-specific IU to symptoms varied and theoretical and clinical implications are highlighted. Limitations include the cross-sectional design and reliance on self-report. Avenues for further research include a need for replication and extension of the model in different samples and using experimental and multi-method research methods.

A network analysis of DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and correlates in U.S. military veterans,"Objective: Recent developments in psychometrics enable the application of network models to analyze psychological disorders, such as PTSD. Instead of understanding symptoms as indicators of an underlying common cause, this approach suggests symptoms co-occur in syndromes due to causal interactions. The current study has two goals: (1) examine the network structure among the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and (2) incorporate clinically relevant variables to the network to investigate whether PTSD symptoms exhibit differential relationships with suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, physical functioning/quality of life (QoL), mental functioning/QoL, age, and sex. Method: We utilized a nationally representative U.S. military veteran’s sample; and analyzed the data from a subsample of 221 veterans who reported clinically significant DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Networks were estimated using state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation models. Data and code are published along with the paper. Results: The 20-item DSM-5 PTSD network revealed that symptoms were positively connected within the network. Especially strong connections emerged between nightmares and flashbacks; blame of self or others and negative trauma-related emotions, detachment and restricted affect; and hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response. The most central symptoms were negative trauma-related emotions, flashbacks, detachment, and physiological cue reactivity. Incorporation of clinically relevant covariates into the network revealed paths between self-destructive behavior and suicidal ideation; concentration difficulties and anxiety, depression, and mental QoL; and depression and restricted affect. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the utility of a network approach in modeling the structure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and suggest differential associations between specific DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and clinical outcomes in trauma survivors. Implications of these results for informing the assessment and treatment of this disorder, are discussed.

The differential relationship between mental contamination and the core dimensions of contact contamination fear,"Two types of contamination fear are recognized: contact and mental contamination. Contact contamination appears to be motivated both by harm avoidance and disgust avoidance. This study aimed to examine the relationships between disgust propensity, mental contamination and contact contamination while differentiating between harm avoidance and disgust avoidance in contact contamination. 169 OCD patients completed a set of questionnaires assessing mental contamination, contact contamination, disgust propensity, OCD, anxiety and depression. 1) Contact contamination based on disgust avoidance was more strongly associated with mental contamination and disgust propensity than contact contamination based on harm avoidance; 2) mental contamination significantly predicted contact contamination based on disgust avoidance, while it did not predict contact contamination based on harm avoidance; 3) mental contamination had a significant mediational role in the relationship between disgust propensity and contact contamination motivated by disgust avoidance. Mental contamination plays a role in contact contamination fear when disgust is primarily experienced.

Social anxiety and suicidal ideation: Test of the utility of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide,"Social anxiety is related to greater suicidality, even after controlling for depression and other psychopathology. The Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS; Joiner, 2005) proposes that people are vulnerable to wanting to die by suicide if they experience both perceived burdensomeness (sense that one is a burden to others) and thwarted belongingness (a greater sense of alienation from others). Socially anxious persons may be especially vulnerable to these interpersonal factors. The current study tested whether interpersonal IPTS components independently and additively mediate the social anxiety-suicidal ideation (SI) relation among 780 (80.5% female) undergraduates. Social anxiety was significantly, robustly related to SI and to thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. Social anxiety was indirectly related to SI via thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. The sum of these indirect effects was significant. Moderated mediation analyses indicated that perceived burdensomeness only mediated the relation between social anxiety and SI at higher levels of thwarted belongingness. Findings highlight that difficulties in interpersonal functioning may serve as potential pathways through which social anxiety may lead to greater suicidality.

"Thinking anxious, feeling anxious, or both? Cognitive bias moderates the relationship between anxiety disorder status and sympathetic arousal in youth","Cognitive bias and physiological arousal are two putative markers that may underlie youth anxiety. However, data on relationships between cognitive bias and arousal are limited, and typically do not include behavioral measurement of these constructs in order to tap real-time processes. We aimed to examine the relationship between performance-based cognitive bias and sympathetic arousal during stress in clinically anxious and typically-developing youth. The sample included children and adolescents ages 9 to 17 (Mean age = 13.18, SD = 2.60) who either met diagnostic criteria for primary generalized anxiety, social phobia, or separation anxiety (N = 24) or healthy controls who had no history of psychopathology (N = 22). Youth completed performance-based measures of attention and interpretation bias. Electrodermal activity was assessed while youth participated in the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C; Buske-Kirschbaum, Jobst, &amp; Wustmans, 1997). A mixed models analysis indicated significant linear and non-linear changes in skin conductance, with similar slopes for both groups. Interpretation bias, but not attention bias, moderated the relationship between group status and sympathetic arousal during the TSST-C. Arousal trajectories did not differ for anxious and healthy control youth who exhibited high levels of threat interpretation bias. However, for youth who exhibited moderate and low levels of interpretation bias, the anxious group demonstrated greater arousal slopes than healthy control youth. Results provide initial evidence that the relationship between anxiety status and physiological arousal during stress may be moderated by level of interpretation bias for threat. These findings may implicate interpretation bias as a marker of sympathetic reactivity in youth. Implications for future research and limitations are discussed.

How fear-relevant illusory correlations might develop and persist in anxiety disorders: A model of contributing factors,"Fear-relevant illusory correlations (ICs) are defined as the overestimation of the relationship between a fear-relevant stimulus and aversive consequences. ICs reflect biased cognitions affecting the learning and unlearning of fear in anxiety disorders, and a deeper understanding might help to improve treatment. A model for the maintenance of ICs is proposed that highlights the importance of amplified aversiveness and salience of fear-relevant outcomes, impaired executive contingency monitoring and an availability heuristic. The model explains why ICs are enhanced in high fearful individuals and allows for some implications that might be applied to augment the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy, such as emotion regulation and the direction of attention to non-aversive experiences. Finally, we suggest possible future research directions and an alternative measure of ICs.

Is disgust proneness sensitive to treatment for OCD among youth?: Examination of diagnostic specificity and symptom correlates,"Although disgust proneness has been implicated in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), there is a paucity of research examining change in disgust proneness during treatment as well as the correlates of such change, especially in children. This study examined the relationship between changes in disgust proneness and disorder-specific symptoms during residential treatment among youth with OCD, anxiety, and mood disorders. Youth ages 12–18 ( n = 472) completed pre- and post-outcome measures of OCD, anxiety, and mood symptoms and disgust proneness. Results indicate that although disgust proneness decreases during treatment for youth with OCD, anxiety, and mood disorders, youth with primary OCD experienced the greatest decrease in disgust proneness over the course of treatment. Reductions in disgust proneness during treatment were significantly correlated with reductions in multiple symptom measures, with the strongest correlations between reductions in disgust proneness and OCD symptoms. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

Fear conditioning and stimulus generalization in patients with social anxiety disorder,"Although overgeneralization seems to be a hallmark of several anxiety disorders, this until now has not been investigated in social anxiety disorder (SAD). Therefore, we examined fear generalization in 26 SAD patients and 29 healthy controls (HC) using two faces as conditioned stimuli (CS+, CS−), and a loud scream and a fearful face as unconditioned stimulus (US). Generalization was tested by presenting both CS and four morphs of the two faces (generalization stimuli [GSs]), while ratings, heart rate (HR) and skin conductance responses (SCR) were recorded. Results revealed that SAD patients rated all stimuli as less pleasant and more arousing compared to HC. Moreover, ratings and SCR indicated that both groups generalized their acquired fear from the CS+ to GSs. Remarkably, only SAD patients showed generalization in HR responses (fear bradycardia). Overall, SAD seems not to be characterized by strong overgeneralization but discrepancies in fear responses to both conditioned and generalized threat stimuli.

Guided and unguided Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for social anxiety disorder and/or panic disorder provided via the Internet and a smartphone application: A randomized controlled trial,"Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) can be effective in treating anxiety disorders, yet there has been no study on Internet-delivered ACT for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PD), nor any study investigating whether therapist guidance is superior to unguided self-help when supplemented with a smartphone application. In the current trial, n = 152 participants diagnosed with SAD and/or PD were randomized to therapist-guided or unguided treatment, or a waiting-list control group. Both treatment groups used an Internet-delivered ACT-based treatment program and a smartphone application. Outcome measures were self-rated general and social anxiety and panic symptoms. Treatment groups saw reduced general ( d = 0.39) and social anxiety ( d = 0.70), but not panic symptoms ( d = 0.05) compared to the waiting-list group, yet no differences in outcomes were observed between guided and unguided interventions. We conclude that Internet-delivered ACT is appropriate for treating SAD and potentially PD. Smartphone applications may partially compensate for lack of therapist support.

Psychological perspectives on fear of childbirth,"The objective of this narrative review was to examine the literature on fear of childbirth from a psychological perspective, addressing the specificity of childbirth fear, the pathways of fear acquisition, and the physiological, cognitive and behavioral aspects of fear. Systematic procedures for literature search, inclusion and exclusion left 86 original research papers for analysis. Findings summarize the body of knowledge for each area of interest, as well as the number of studies addressing each theme. Overall, few studies adopt a clear-cut psychological perspective, leaving the psychological mechanisms of childbirth fear largely unexplored. Although methodological limitations make conclusions difficult, results give a hint of etiological diversity and possible psychological mechanisms commonly described as transdiagnostic features in anxiety. Systematic investigations of psychological mechanisms, longitudinal studies exploring possible vicious circles of fear, and studies comparing psychological characteristics within the group of women fearing childbirth are identified as research areas of high priority.

Does the measure matter? On the association between disgust proneness and OCD symptoms,"Although some studies suggest that the association between disgust proneness (DP) and obsessive–compulsive symptoms (OCS) is specific to the contamination subtype, others suggest that DP is associated with OCS more broadly. To examine if the discrepant findings may partially reflect differences in self-report measures used, this investigation employed structural equation modeling to examine the association between DP and OCS in three samples that completed different combinations of measures of DP, OCS, and anxiety/negative affect. In Study 1 ( n = 626), the path from DP to contamination-based OCS was significantly stronger than the path from DP to non-contamination OCS when controlling for anxiety sensitivity. In Study 2 ( n = 403), the results showed that the path from DP to contamination-based OCS did not significantly differ from the path from DP to non-contamination OCS when controlling for negative affect. Lastly, Study 3 ( n = 296) showed that the path from DP to contamination-based OCS was significantly weaker than the path from DP to non-contamination OCS. These findings highlight that the self-report measures employed is an important moderator when making inferences about the association between DP and contamination-based OCS and non-contamination OCS.

"Prediction of 6-yr symptom course trajectories of anxiety disorders by diagnostic, clinical and psychological variables","This study aimed to identify course trajectories of anxiety disorder using a data-driven method and to determine the incremental predictive value of clinical and psychological variables over and above diagnostic categories. 703 patients with DSM-IV panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, agoraphobia, social phobia, or generalized anxiety disorder were selected from a prospective cohort study. Latent Growth Mixture Modeling was conducted, based on symptoms of anxiety and avoidance as assessed with the Life Chart Interview covering a 6-year time period. In 44% of the participants symptoms of anxiety and avoidance improved, in 24% remained stable, in 25% slightly increased, and in 7% severely increased. Identified course trajectories were predicted by baseline DSM-IV anxiety categories, clinical variables (i.e., severity and duration and level of disability) and psychological predictors (i.e., neuroticism, extraversion, anxiety sensitivity, worry, and rumination). Clinical variables better predicted unfavorable course trajectories than psychological predictors, over and above diagnostic categories.

A cluster analysis of early onset in common anxiety disorders,"Early onset is regarded as an important characteristic of anxiety disorders, associated with higher severity. However, previous findings diverge, as definitions of early onset vary and are often unsubstantiated. We objectively defined early onset in social phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalised anxiety disorder, using cluster analysis with data gathered in the general population. Resulting cut-off ages for early onset were ≤ 22 (social phobia), ≤ 31 (panic disorder), ≤ 21 (agoraphobia), and ≤ 27 (generalised anxiety disorder). Comparison of psychiatric comorbidity and general wellbeing between subjects with early and late onset in the general population and an outpatient cohort, demonstrated that among outpatients anxiety comorbidity was more common in early onset agoraphobia, but also that anxiety- as well as mood comorbidity were more common in late onset social phobia. A major limitation was the retrospective assessment of onset. Our results encourage future studies into correlates of early onset of psychiatric disorders.

Reduction of depersonalization during social stress through cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorder: A randomized controlled trial,"Symptoms of depersonalization during feared social situations are commonly experienced by individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Despite its clinical relevance, it is not addressed in standard treatment manuals and it remains unclear if depersonalization is reduced by well-established treatments. This study investigated whether cognitive therapy (CT) for SAD effectively reduces depersonalization and whether pre-treatment severity of depersonalization predicts or mediates treatment outcome. In a randomized controlled trial, patients underwent the standardized Trier Social Stress Test before and after CT ( n = 20) or a waitlist period ( n = 20) and were compared to healthy controls ( n = 21). Self-reported depersonalization was measured immediately after each stress test. Depersonalization significantly decreased following CT, especially in treatment responders (η p ² = 0.32). Pre-treatment depersonalization did neither predict nor mediate post-treatment severity of social anxiety. Further prospective studies are needed for a better scientific understanding of this effect. It should be scrutinized whether SAD-patients suffering from depersonalization would benefit from a more specific therapy.

The From Survivor to Thriver program: RCT of an online therapist-facilitated program for rape-related PTSD,"This study evaluated the efficacy of the From Survivor to Thriver program, an interactive, online therapist-facilitated cognitive-behavioral program for rape-related PTSD. Eighty-seven college women with rape-related PTSD were randomized to complete the interactive program ( n = 46) or a psycho-educational self-help website ( n = 41). Both programs led to large reductions in interview-assessed PTSD at post-treatment (interactive d = 2.22, psycho-educational d = 1.10), which were maintained at three month follow-up. Both also led to medium- to large-sized reductions in self-reported depressive and general anxiety symptoms. Follow-up analyses supported that the therapist-facilitated interactive program led to superior outcomes among those with higher pre-treatment PTSD whereas the psycho-educational self-help website led to superior outcomes for individuals with lower pre-treatment PTSD. Future research should examine the efficacy and effectiveness of online interventions for rape-related PTSD including whether treatment intensity matching could be utilized to maximize outcomes and therapist resource efficiency.

The curious case of cyberchondria: A longitudinal study on the reciprocal relationship between health anxiety and online health information seeking,"The current study is the first to longitudinally investigate the reciprocal relationship between online health information seeking and health anxiety, i.e., cyberchondria. Expectations were that health anxious individuals who go online to find health information, experience an increase in health anxiety, which in turn will reinforce online seeking. A 4-wave longitudinal survey study among 5322 respondents aged 16–93 was conducted. Our results showed that individuals who are more health anxious than others, search online for health information more. Moreover, the results provided initial evidence for the expected reciprocal relationship between health anxiety and online health information seeking in respondents with non-clinical levels of health anxiety at the start of the study. However, this reciprocal relationship could not be found in a subsample of clinically health anxious individuals. Although for these individuals online health information seeking did not seem to exacerbate health anxiety levels, it might still serve as a maintaining factor of clinical health anxiety.

Synergistic effects of pain intensity and anxiety sensitivity in relation to anxiety and depressive symptoms and disorders among economically disadvantaged latinos in a community-based primary care setting,"The present investigation examined the interactive effects of anxiety sensitivity and pain intensity in relation to anxious arousal, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms and disorders among 203 Latino adults with an annual income of less than $30,000 (84.4% female; M age = 38.9, SD = 11.3 and 98.6% used Spanish as their first language) who attended a community-based primary healthcare clinic. As expected, the interaction between anxiety sensitivity and pain intensity was significantly related to increased anxious arousal, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms as well as number of depressive/anxiety disorder diagnoses. The form of the significant interactions indicated that participants reporting co-occurring higher levels of anxiety sensitivity and pain intensity evinced the greatest levels of anxious arousal, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms as well as higher levels of depressive and anxiety disorders. These data provide novel empirical evidence suggesting that there is clinically-relevant interplay between anxiety sensitivity and pain intensity in regard to a relatively wide array of anxiety and depressive variables among Latinos in a primary care medical setting.

"Relative effects of cognitive and behavioral therapies on generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and panic disorder: A meta-analysis","Although cognitive and behavioral therapies are effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders, it is not clear what the relative effects of these treatments are. We conducted a meta-analysis of trials comparing cognitive and behavioral therapies with a control condition, in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder. We included 42 studies in which generic measures of anxiety were used (BAI, HAMA, STAI-State and Trait). Only the effects of treatment for panic disorder as measured on the BAI (13.33 points; 95% CI: 10.58–16.07) were significantly (p = 0.001) larger than the effect sizes on GAD (6.06 points; 95% CI: 3.96–8.16) and SAD (5.92 points; 95% CI: 4.64–7.20). The effects remained significant after adjusting for baseline severity and other major characteristics of the trials. The results should be considered with caution because of the small number of studies in many subgroups and the high risk of bias in most studies.

Improvements in emotion regulation following repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for generalized anxiety disorder,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by emotion regulation difficulties, which are associated with abnormalities in neural circuits encompassing fronto-limbic regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The aim of this study was to determine whether DLPFC neuromodulation improves emotion regulation in patients with GAD. This is a secondary analysis from a randomized-controlled trial comparing 30 sessions of low-frequency right-sided active ( n = 13) versus sham ( n = 12, sham coil) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at the right DLPFC in patients with GAD. Results indicated statistically significant improvements in self-reported emotion regulation difficulties at posttreatment and 3-month follow-up in the active group only. Improvements were found primarily in the domains of goal-directed behaviors and impulse control and were significantly associated with a global clinician rating of improvement. These preliminary results support rTMS as a treatment for GAD and suggest improved emotion regulation as a possible mechanism of change.

Fear-relevant illusory correlations in different fears and anxiety disorders: A review of the literature,"Fearful individuals often overestimate the relationship between fear-relevant stimuli and aversive consequences. Such fear-relevant illusory correlations (ICs) might be involved in the maintenance of anxiety disorders. In this literature review, we found clear evidence that ICs are present and enhanced in fear of animals. We also revealed some evidence for ICs related to fear of flying, social anxiety, contamination fear, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, but with considerably less clarity. Fear-relevant ICs seem to be best explained by both a priori expectancies and biased encoding of the experienced associations. Studies to date suggest that one important biased encoding process is the enhanced aversiveness/salience of fear-relevant outcomes. Future studies may improve insight by developing more reliable IC measures and testing the effect of encoding processes on treatment outcomes.

A comprehensive meta-analysis of cognitive-behavioral interventions for social anxiety disorder in children and adolescents,"The effectiveness of different types of CBT for children and adolescents suffering from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is generally supported. However, no systematic efforts have been made to quantitatively summarize and analyse the impact of specific variables on therapeutic outcome. Here, we assessed the magnitude and duration of CBT effectiveness in children and adolescents with SAD. The effectiveness of CBT was supported by the effect sizes of studies that had examined pre-post (g = 0.99), between-group (g = 0.71), and follow-up responses (follow-up vs. pre-test mean g = 1.18, follow-up vs. post-test mean g = 0.25). A significant moderating effect was found for the variable “number of treatment sessions”. In addition, larger effect sizes were found in studies that included “Social Skills Training” sessions in the intervention package. Data support the effectiveness of CBT interventions and its durability for SAD in children and adolescents. Adding social skills training to the intervention package can further enhance the impact of treatment.

Meta-analysis of technology-assisted interventions for social anxiety disorder,"This meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of technology-assisted interventions for individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD). A systematic literature search in the databases Medline, PsychInfo, and Web of Science revealed 37 randomized controlled trials (2991 participants) that were grouped into internet delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT; 21 trials), virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET; 3 trials), and cognitive bias modification (CBM; 13 trials). Patients undergoing ICBT and VRET showed significantly less SAD symptoms at postassessment than passive control conditions ( g = 0.84 and 0.82, respectively). Compared to active control conditions, ICBT had a small advantage ( g = 0.38) and VRET showed comparable effects (p &gt; 0.05). CBM was not more effective than passive control conditions, except when delivered in the laboratory ( g = 0.35). While the efficacy of CBM was limited, substantial evidence for ICBT and preliminary evidence for VRET suggests that both can effectively reduce SAD symptoms indicating the potential of technology-assisted interventions for SAD.

Transdiagnostic internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy in Canada: An open trial comparing results of a specialized online clinic and nonspecialized community clinics,"Effects of Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) for anxiety and depression are not well understood when delivered in non-specialized as compared to specialized clinic settings. This open trial ( n = 458 patients) examined the benefits of transdiagnostic-ICBT when delivered in Canada by therapists (registered providers or graduate students) working in either a specialized online clinic or one of eight nonspecialized community clinics. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Completion rates and satisfaction were high. Significant and large reductions (effect sizes 1.17–1.31) were found on symptom measures. Completion rates, satisfaction levels and outcomes did not differ whether ICBT was delivered by therapists working in a specialized online clinic or nonspecialized community clinics. Differences were also not found between registered providers and graduate students, or therapists trained in psychology or another discipline. The findings support the public health potential of ICBT.

Transdiagnostic versus disorder-specific and clinician-guided versus self-guided internet-delivered treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder and comorbid disorders: A randomized controlled trial,"Disorder-specific (DS-CBT) and transdiagnostic (TD-CBT) cognitive behaviour therapy have both been used to treat social anxiety disorder (SAD). This study compared internet-delivered DS-CBT and TD-CBT for SAD across clinician-guided (CG-CBT) and self-guided (SG-CBT) formats. Participants with SAD (n=233) were randomly allocated to receive internet-delivered TD-CBT or DS-CBT and CG-CBT or SG-CBT. Large reductions in symptoms of SAD (Cohen’s d ≥ 1.01; avg. reduction≥30%) and moderate-to-large reductions in symptoms of comorbid depression (Cohen’s d ≥ 1.25; avg. reduction≥39%), generalised anxiety disorder (Cohen’s d ≥ 0.86; avg. reduction≥36%) and panic disorder (Cohen’s d ≥ 0.53; avg. reduction≥25%) were found immediately post-treatment and were maintained or further improved to 24-month follow-up. No marked differences were observed between TD-CBT and DS-CBT or CG-CBT and SG-CBT highlighting the potential of each for the treatment of SAD and comorbid disorders.

Building upon 30 years of high impact scholarship on the anxiety disorders: Vision statement from the new editor-in-chief,"This editorial briefs the changes in the forthcoming issues of the Journal of Anxiety Disorders. First, while continuing to publish manuscripts that are broadly relevant to understanding the anxiety-related disorders, the journal will prioritize several types of studies. Second, the journal will no longer publish articles as short reports (although, as noted below, short articles are always welcome), will no longer publish case reports, and will not prioritize articles that present psychometric studies of translated versions of English language measures. Third, in an effort to facilitate clear and concise scientific discourse, we are introducing word limits and related formatting changes for all manuscripts. Finally, they are introducing Invited Commentaries as a category of articles published in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders. The Journal of Anxiety Disorders has been a leading outlet for theory and research on the anxiety-related disorders since its inception.

"An integrative network approach to social anxiety disorder: The complex dynamic interplay among attentional bias for threat, attentional control, and symptoms","Cognitive models posit that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with and maintained by biased attention allocation vis-à-vis social threat. However, over the last decade, there has been intense debate regarding whether AB in SAD results from preferential engagement with or difficulty in disengaging from social threat. Further, recent evidence suggests that AB may merely result from top-down attentional impairments vis-à-vis non-emotional material. Consequently, uncertainty still abounds regarding both the relative importance and the mutual interactions of these different processes and SAD symptoms. Inspired by novel network approaches to psychopathology that conceptualize symptoms as complex dynamic systems of mutually interacting variables, we computed weighted directed networks to investigate potential causal relations among laboratory measures of attentional components and symptoms of social anxiety disorder. Global and local connectivity of network structures revealed that the three most central variables were the orienting component of attention as well as both avoidance and fear of social situations. Neither preferential attention engagement with threat nor difficulty disengaging from threat exhibited high relative importance as predictors of symptoms in the network. Together, these findings suggest the value of extending the network approach beyond self-reported clinical symptoms to incorporate process-level measures from laboratory tasks to gain new insight into the mechanisms of SAD.

The effect of targeting tolerance of children’s negative emotions among anxious parents of children with anxiety disorders: A pilot randomised controlled trial,"Following cognitive behavioural therapy for child anxiety a significant minority of children fail to lose their diagnosis status. One potential barrier is high parental anxiety. We designed a pilot RCT to test claims that parental intolerance of the child’s negative emotions may impact treatment outcomes. Parents of 60 children with an anxiety disorder, who were themselves highly anxious, received either brief parent-delivered treatment for child anxiety or the same treatment with strategies specifically targeting parental tolerance of their child’s negative emotions. Consistent with predictions, parental tolerance of the child’s negative emotions significantly improved from pre- to post-treatment. However, there was no evidence to inform the direction of this association as improvements were substantial in both groups. Moreover, while there were significant improvements in child anxiety in both conditions, there was little evidence that this was associated with the improvement in parental tolerance. Nevertheless, findings provide important clinical insight, including that parent-led treatments are appropriate even when the parent is highly anxious and that it may not be necessary to adjust interventions for many families.

Brief intensive CBT for pediatric OCD with E-therapy maintenance,"Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), incorporating exposure and response prevention (ERP), has received strong empirical support for the treatment of paediatric OCD, and moreover, is considered the first line treatment of choice (Geller &amp; March, 2012). However, despite the availability of effective treatments for this chronic and debilitating disorder, only a small proportion of youth receive these evidence-based approaches. The present study aimed to examine the effectiveness of an intensive ERP-based treatment for youth OCD, using a multiple baseline controlled design. Children and youth ( N = 10; aged 11–16 years) with a primary diagnosis of OCD were randomly assigned to a 1- or 2-week baseline monitoring condition followed by the intervention. The efficacy of the intensive treatment, involving 1 session psychoeducation, 2-sessions ERP plus e-therapy maintenance was examined across parent- child- and clinician-rated measures at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. Overall, there were significant reductions across time on almost all measures (except self-report anxiety), and moreover, the majority of the sample (80%) were considered reliably improved, and meeting clinically significant change. At post-treatment, 60% were in remission of symptoms, and at 6-month follow-up this increased to 70%. These findings provide strong support for intensive, time-limited approaches to ERP-based CBT for children and youth with OCD.

"Intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety sensitivity, health anxiety, and anxiety disorder symptoms in youth","Intolerance of uncertainty (IU)—difficulty coping with uncertainty and its implications – is traditionally studied in adult populations, but more recently has been explored in children and adolescents. To date, the association between IU and health anxiety has not been explored in a child or adolescent sample. Further, it is unknown whether the relationship between IU and health anxiety may be mediated by anxiety sensitivity (i.e., fear of anxiety-related sensations) in this population. We sought to extend the existing research and expand our understanding of IU as a transdiagnostic construct by exploring the association between IU and health anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and DSM-IV anxiety disorder symptom categories in 128 youth ( M age = 12.7 years, SD = 0.82, range 11–17 years). Participants completed measures of IU, health anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and anxiety disorder symptom categories. Results demonstrated significant positive associations between IU and all measures. Mediation analyses supported the direct and indirect importance of each IU subscale on health anxiety. Future directions and implications are discussed.

Experimental manipulation of avoidable feelings of uncertainty: Effects on anger and anxiety,"Though anger and anxiety are related, putative explanations for this association remain unclear. Beliefs about one’s state of uncertainty may be a pathway—the belief that one’s uncertain state is un avoidable might lead to anxiety, whereas the belief that one’s uncertain state is avoidable might lead to both anxiety and anger. To test this hypothesis, participants experienced an uncertainty induction and were then assigned to the avoidable uncertainty condition (experimental group) or the unavoidable uncertainty condition (control group). State anger and anxiety were assessed at baseline, following the uncertainty induction, and following the “avoidableness” manipulation. The uncertainty induction was successful; participants reported higher levels of anxiety at post-induction compared to baseline. As expected, the experimental group reported increases in anger from post-induction to post-manipulation whereas the control group reported decreases in anger. These findings suggest that when one’s state of uncertainty is avoidable, anger is experienced alongside anxiety.

The search for universal transdiagnostic and trans-therapy change processes: Evidence for intolerance of uncertainty,"The search for universal processes associated with symptom change across emotional disorders and different forms of psychotherapy offers hope of increased theoretical parsimony and treatment efficiencies. This study investigated whether intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a universal process by examining whether changes in IU were associated with changes in symptoms across three different cognitive behavior therapy protocols for depression ( n = 106), social anxiety disorder ( n = 88), or generalized anxiety disorder ( n = 62) in a community mental health clinic. IU was associated with reductions in repetitive negative thinking in all treatments, which is consistent with IU being a transdiagnostic and ‘trans-therapy’ process of change. Changes in IU were also associated with symptom relief in the social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder groups, but not in the depression group. Implications of these findings are discussed within the broader literature of transdiagnostic approaches to emotional disorders.

Intolerance of uncertainty and attentional networks: Unique associations with alerting,"The present study sought to extend our understanding as to how intolerance of uncertainty (IU) relates to information-processing by investigating associations between IU and attentional networks, including alerting, orienting, and executive attention. Based upon prior research, IU was expected to cluster with alerting. An unselected sample of college students ( N = 86; 79% women) completed self-report measures of IU and state anxiety, as well as the attention network test. Among the attentional networks, IU only shared a positive association with alerting and the association remained intact after statistically controlling for state anxiety. State anxiety did not moderate the association between IU and alerting. Although two IU dimensions (prospective and inhibitory) both shared a positive association with alerting, only prospective IU was associated with alerting after statistically controlling for state anxiety. The results provide evidence that IU relates to an overfunctioning of the alerting attentional network, which may suggest a role of hypervigilance and a greater influence of bottom-up processing in relation to IU. Implications for how these results advance our understanding of possible links between IU and anxiety disorders are discussed.

The default response to uncertainty and the importance of perceived safety in anxiety and stress: An evolution-theoretical perspective,"From a combined neurobiological and evolution-theoretical perspective, the stress response is a subcortically subserved response to uncertainty that is not ‘generated’ but ‘default’: the stress response is ‘always there’ but as long as safety is perceived, the stress response is under tonic prefrontal inhibition, reflected by high vagally mediated heart rate variability. Uncertainty of safety leads to disinhibiting the default stress response, even in the absence of threat. Due to the stress response’s survival value, this ‘erring on the side of caution’ is passed to us via our genes. Thus, intolerance of uncertainty is not acquired during the life cycle, but is a given property of all living organisms, only to be alleviated in situations of which the safety is learned. When the latter is deficient, generalized unsafety ensues, which underlies chronic anxiety and stress and their somatic health risks, as well as other highly prevalent conditions carrying such risks, including loneliness, obesity, aerobic unfitness and old age.

Intolerance of uncertainty and transdiagnostic group cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety,"Background: Recent evidence suggests intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic variable elevated across anxiety disorders. No studies have investigated IU’s response to transdiagnostic group CBT for anxiety (TGCBT). This study evaluated IU outcomes following TGCBT across anxiety disorders. Methods: 151 treatment-seekers with primary diagnoses of social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or GAD were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of TGCBT and completed self-report questionnaires at pre-, mid-, and post-treatment. Results: IU decreased significantly following treatment. Decreases in IU predicted improvements in clinical presentation across diagnoses. IU interacted with time to predict improvement in clinical presentation irrespective of primary diagnosis. IU also interacted with time to predict improvement in clinical presentation although interactions of time with diagnosis-specific measures did not. IUS interacted with time to predict reduction in anxiety and fear symptoms, and inhibitory IU interacted with time to predicted reductions in anxiety symptoms but prospective IU did not. Conclusion: IU appears to be an important transdiagnostic variable in CBT implicated in both initial presentation and treatment change.

Fear of the unknown: One fear to rule them all?,"The current review and synthesis was designed to provocatively develop and evaluate the proposition that “fear of the unknown may be a, or possibly the, fundamental fear” (Carleton, 2016) underlying anxiety and therein neuroticism. Identifying fundamental transdiagnostic elements is a priority for clinical theory and practice. Historical criteria for identifying fundamental components of anxiety are described and revised criteria are offered. The revised criteria are based on logical rhetorical arguments using a constituent reductionist postpositivist approach supported by the available empirical data. The revised criteria are then used to assess several fears posited as fundamental, including fear of the unknown. The review and synthesis concludes with brief recommendations for future theoretical discourse as well as clinical and non-clinical research.

"Stomaching uncertainty: Relationships among intolerance of uncertainty, eating disorder pathology, and comorbid emotional symptoms","Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is proposed to be a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor for various emotional disorders. There is robust evidence for the role of IU in anxiety and depressive disorders, but a paucity of evidence in eating disorders (ED). This study evaluated the factorial validity, internal consistency, and convergent validity of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale—Short Form (IUS-12; Carleton, Norton, &amp; Asmundson, 2007), and examined whether IU is associated with ED pathology and comorbid emotional symptoms, in a clinical sample with EDs ( N = 134). A unitary factor solution provided the best fit. The IUS-12 showed excellent internal consistency, and good convergent validity. IU had an indirect effect on dietary restraint, purging, and emotional symptoms via overvaluation of eating, weight, and shape. The indirect effect was not significant for bingeing. Findings provide partial support for the notion that IU is a vulnerability factor for ED pathology and support the notion that IU is a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor for emotional symptoms. Limitations, research implications, and future directions for research are discussed.

Intolerance of uncertainty as a predictor of post-traumatic stress symptoms following a traumatic event,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has been associated with elevated post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in the extant literature. However, no research to date has investigated whether pre-trauma IU predicts PTSS following trauma exposure. The current study prospectively examined the relationship between IU and PTSS within a sample of individuals with various levels of exposure to a university campus shooting. We hypothesized that pre-trauma IU would predict elevated PTSS following a campus shooting, even after covarying for anxiety sensitivity (AS), a known correlate of PTSS. Participants included undergraduates ( n = 77) who completed a self-report battery in Introductory Psychology. After a campus shooting, they were invited to complete measures of PTSD symptoms and level of exposure to the shooting. As anticipated, results revealed pre-trauma IU as a significant predictor of elevated PTSS following the campus shooting. These results remained significant after covarying for pre-trauma levels of AS. Our results are the first to demonstrate that elevated pre-trauma levels of IU predict later PTSS following exposure to a traumatic event. This finding is discussed in terms of promising directions for future research and treatment strategies.

A prospective-longitudinal study on the association of anxiety disorders prior to pregnancy and pregnancy- and child-related fears,"This study aimed to investigate the relation between anxiety disorders prior to pregnancy and specific pregnancy- and child-related fears during pregnancy and after delivery. 306 expectant mothers were interviewed regarding anxiety (and depressive) disorders prior to pregnancy and pregnancy- and child-related fears (e.g. fear of labor pain, fear of infant injury) using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women (CIDI-V). Pregnancy- and child-related fears were particularly pronounced in women with multiple anxiety disorders and women with comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders prior to pregnancy. Further analyses revealed associations between particular anxiety disorders and specific pregnancy- and child-related fears. Results remained stable when considering potential confounders such as maternal age, education, marital status, parity, prior abortion and preterm delivery or low birth weight. Our study suggests that especially women with multiple anxiety and/or comorbid depressive disorders may benefit from early targeted interventions to prevent an escalation of anxiety and fears over the peripartum period.

The efficacy of imagery rescripting compared to cognitive restructuring for social anxiety disorder,"Imagery rescripting (IR) aims to alter negative meanings associated with distressing autobiographical memories. The current study aimed to extend demonstrated benefits of IR for social anxiety disorder (SAD), including direct comparison of IR with cognitive restructuring (CR) to assess the relative impact of these interventions on symptoms and processes. SAD individuals ( N = 60) were randomly allocated to IR, CR or Control conditions, and completed two speech tasks (before and after) their assigned intervention. Participants completed measures of symptomatology and state affective/cognitive variables in relation to the intervention and speech tasks. Results support the benefits of IR for SAD, with both IR and CR yielding large and equivalent reductions in trait social anxiety. However, IR and CR may function via differing pathways. Outcomes suggest that IR may be most effective in the treatment of SAD when delivered across multiple sessions or preceded by CR to target verbal and imaginal self-representations.

Method.: Parents of children with anxiety disorders ( n = 27) and children without anxiety disorders ( n = 36) completed a headache questionnaire based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders (2nd edition) criteria. Results: Children with anxiety disorders had a higher incidence of headache symptoms consistent with migraine and TTH compared to children without anxiety disorders. Girls with anxiety disorders and children with separation anxiety disorder had a higher incidence of headaches compared to girls without anxiety disorders and children with other anxiety disorders respectively. Children with anxiety disorders and headaches had higher self-reported anxiety symptom severity compared to children with anxiety disorders without headaches and children without anxiety disorders.

Emotional distress tolerance across anxiety disorders,"Emotional distress tolerance (EDT) has increasingly been recognized as a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor. However, research assessing EDT in anxiety disorder populations is lacking. The current study addressed this gap in the literature by examining EDT in a sample of outpatients with panic, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, or obsessive compulsive disorders ( n = 674), and by assessing its relationship to symptom severity and impairment. Results showed that poor EDT was common across diagnostic groups. However, correlation and regression analyses suggested that although EDT was associated with symptom severity and impairment, it did not account for unique variance in scores beyond the effect of negative affect, stress, intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and anxiety sensitivity (AS). IU and AS had a stronger relationship with overall symptom severity and impairment in the regression models. Together, findings suggest that although EDT may be transdiagnostic, IU and AS are more relevant to our understanding of anxiety disorders.

Family environment as a moderator of the association between anxiety and suicidal ideation,"The present study examined associations among anxiety symptoms, anxiety disorder diagnoses, perceptions of family support and conflict, and suicidal ideation (SI) in a clinical sample of psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents. Participants were 185 adolescents (72% female; 84% white, mean age = 15.02 years, SD = 1.33) hospitalized on an acute psychiatric inpatient unit. Results indicated that anxiety disorders and symptoms were positively associated with SI, even after controlling for mood disorder diagnoses and sex. Moreover, this relationship was stronger among youth who reported lower (versus higher) levels of family support. Family conflict was positively associated with SI but did not moderate the relationship between anxiety and SI. Results suggest that family support may represent an important intervention target to decrease suicide risk among anxious youth. Integrating positive parenting techniques (e.g., attending to positive behaviors, providing praise, emotion coaching) and effective parent-child communication into treatment with anxious youth may help achieve this aim.

Factors associated with practitioners’ use of exposure therapy for childhood anxiety disorders,"The current study examines factors related to use of exposure therapy by clinicians who treat children with anxiety disorders. A sample of 331 therapists from a variety of backgrounds (i.e., social workers, doctoral psychologists, masters level counselors, and marriage and family therapists) completed a survey regarding use of exposure and other treatment techniques for childhood anxiety disorders, as well as beliefs about exposure and child resiliency. Although the majority of therapists endorsed a CBT orientation (81%) and use of CBT techniques, exposure therapy was rarely endorsed. Holding a PhD in psychology as well as more positive beliefs about exposure and child resiliency were associated with greater use of exposure. The results suggest that exposure-based therapy is rarely offered in community settings and that dissemination should focus on individual evidence-based principles and correcting therapist misconceptions.

The contemporary models appear to share a common core in underscoring the importance of responses to unknowns. A recent surge in published research has explored the transdiagnostic impact of not knowing on anxiety and related pathologies; as such, there appears to be mounting evidence for fear of the unknown as an important core transdiagnostic construct. The result is a robust foundation for transdiagnostic theoretical and empirical explorations into fearing the unknown and intolerance of uncertainty.

Anxiety sensitivity class membership moderates the effects of pre-quit reduction in anxiety sensitivity on quit-day tobacco craving,"Background: Although anxiety sensitivity has been primarily conceptualized as a dimensional latent construct, empirical evidence suggests that it also maintains a latent class structure, reflecting low-, moderate-, and high-risk underlying classes. The present study sought to explore whether these anxiety sensitivity classes moderated the relations between the degree of pre-quit reductions in anxiety sensitivity and the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms and craving experienced on quit-day. Methods: Participants included 195 adult smokers (47% female; Mage = 39.4) participating in a larger “anxiety sensitivity reduction-smoking cessation” intervention trial. Results: Anxiety sensitivity class significantly moderated relations between pre-quit reduction in anxiety sensitivity and quit-day craving. Specifically, smokers within the anxiety sensitivity high-risk class, who also demonstrated lesser pre-quit reductions in anxiety sensitivity, experienced the highest levels of craving on quit-day. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of ‘high-risk' classes of anxiety sensitivity to better understand the experience of craving on quit day.

Examining the dynamic relationships between exposure tasks and cognitive restructuring in CBT for SAD: Outcomes and moderating influences,"Meta-analyses indicate that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) leads to substantial symptom alleviation. Although there is an emphasis on engaging in exposure and cognitive restructuring during treatment, the longitudinal relationship between skill use and symptom alleviation is not well understood. Furthermore, treatment response may be attenuated by pre-existing patient vulnerabilities. This study examined the longitudinal association of skill use (i.e. exposure (EX), thought record use (TR)), symptom reduction and the potential moderating influence of perfectionism during a 12-session, manual-based CBT for SAD intervention for 100 patients (51% female) meeting DSM-IV criteria for SAD. Results obtained from Latent Difference Score (LDS) models indicated that the frequency of both EX and TR skill use led to subsequent symptom alleviation; however, this varied based on the type of skill used. Further, although both EX and TR interventions were associated with subsequent symptom reduction, the association of EX and subsequent symptom alleviation was greater than the association of TR and subsequent symptom alleviation. Finally, higher pre-treatment perfectionism was associated with greater initial skill use, followed by significantly reduced skill use in later sessions. These preliminary results suggest that perfectionistic individuals demonstrate differential engagement in EX and TR interventions during treatment.

"Parental Attitudes, Beliefs, and Understanding of Anxiety (PABUA): Development and psychometric properties of a measure","The Parental Attitudes, Beliefs, and Understanding of Anxiety (PABUA) was developed to assess parental beliefs about their child’s anxiety, parents’ perceived ability to cope with their child’s anxiety and to help their child manage anxious symptoms, and to evaluate parents’ understanding of various parenting strategies in response to their child’s anxiety. The study evaluated the PABUA in mother-child dyads ( N = 192) seeking treatment for youth anxiety. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a three-factor solution and identified PABUA scales of Overprotection, Distress, and Approach (with Cronbach’s alpha ranging from .67 to .83). Convergent and divergent validity of PABUA scales was supported by the pattern of associations with measures of experiential avoidance, beliefs related to children’s anxiety, empathy, trait anxiety, and depressive symptoms; parent-reported family functioning; parent- and youth-reported anxiety severity; and parent-reported functional impairment ( n = 83). Results provide preliminary support for the PABUA as a measure of parental attitudes and beliefs about anxiety, and future studies that investigate this measure with large and diverse samples are encouraged.

Use of evidence-based assessment for childhood anxiety disorders in community practice,"High-quality assessment is essential to the delivery of effective treatment for childhood anxiety disorders. However, relatively little is known about how frequently child clinicians utilize evidence-based assessment (EBA) techniques in practice, and even less is known about the factors that influence EBA use in such settings. Thus, the current study presents data from a survey of 339 clinicians from a variety of professional backgrounds concerning their use of EBA for childhood anxiety disorders and explores issues preventing EBA implementation. Results indicated infrequent EBA use with clinicians citing practical barriers (i.e., time, access, knowledge, cost) and negative beliefs about EBA techniques (i.e., unhelpful) as issues preventing implementation. Implications for future EBA dissemination and implementation efforts are discussed.

Efficacy of group psychotherapy for social anxiety disorder: A meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials,"Group psychotherapy for social anxiety disorder (SAD) is an established treatment supported by findings from primary studies and earlier meta-analyses. However, a comprehensive summary of the recent evidence is still pending. This meta-analysis investigates the efficacy of group psychotherapy for adult patients with SAD. A literature search identified 36 randomized-controlled trials examining 2171 patients. Available studies used mainly cognitive-behavioral group therapies (CBGT); therefore, quantitative analyses were done for CBGT. Medium to large positive effects emerged for wait list-controlled trials for specific symptomatology: g = 0.84, 95% CI [0.72; 0.97] and general psychopathology: g = 0.62, 95% CI [0.36; 0.89]. Group psychotherapy was also superior to common factor control conditions in alleviating symptoms of SAD, but not in improving general psychopathology. No differences appeared for direct comparisons of group psychotherapy and individual psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy. Hence, group psychotherapy for SAD is an efficacious treatment, equivalent to other treatment formats.

Disorder-specific versus transdiagnostic and clinician-guided versus self-guided internet-delivered treatment for panic disorder and comorbid disorders: A randomized controlled trial,"Transdiagnostic cognitive behaviour therapy (TD-CBT) aims to target the symptoms of multiple disorders whereas disorder-specific CBT (DS-CBT) targets the symptoms of principal disorders. This study compared the relative benefits of internet-delivered TD-CBT and DS-CBT when provided in clinician-guided (CG-CBT) and self-guided (SG-CBT) formats for people with a principal diagnosis of Panic Disorder (PD). Participants (n = 145) were randomly allocated to receive TD-CBT or DS-CBT and CG-CBT or SG-CBT. Large reductions in symptoms of PD (Cohen's d ≥ 0.71; avg. reduction ≥ 36%) and moderate-to-large reductions in symptoms of comorbid depression (Cohen's d ≥ 0.71; avg. reduction ≥ 33%), generalised anxiety disorder (Cohen's d ≥ 0.91; avg. reduction ≥ 34%) and social anxiety disorder (Cohen's d ≥ 0.50; avg. reduction ≥ 15%) were found over the 24-month follow-up period. Highlighting their efficacy and acceptability, no marked and consistent differences were observed between TD-CBT and DS-CBT or CG-CBT and DS-CBT.

Parents of terror victims. A longitudinal study of parental mental health following the 2011 terrorist attack on Utøya Island,"Background and aims: Little is known about parents' health following their children's exposure to trauma. We investigated the mental health of parents of young terrorist survivors and assessed parental distress and guilt as potential predictors of mental health. Method: Mothers and fathers ( N = 531) participated in two study waves 4–5 and 14–15 months after the shooting. Posttraumatic stress reactions (PTSS) and anxiety/depression were compared with age- and gender-adjusted expected scores that were calculated from a concurrent population study. Mixed effects models investigated the associations between parental distress, parental guilt, and mental health. Results: Parents' level of anxiety/depression was three times higher and PTSS was five times higher than that of the general population. Parental distress and guilt about their child's traumatic experience contributed uniquely to symptoms at both time points. Conclusions: Parents of traumatized youth constitute a vulnerable group that has been overlooked in the literature. Intervention strategies following trauma should include both survivors and their parents.

Self-reported social skills impairment explains elevated autistic traits in individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder,"Screening for autism in individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) is complicated by symptom overlap between GSAD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We examined the prevalence of self-reported autistic traits within a sample of participants with a diagnosis of GSAD ( n =37) compared to individuals without a GSAD diagnosis (NOSAD; n = 26). Of the GSAD sample participants, 70.84% self-reported autistic traits above a cut-off of 65 on the Autism Quotient-Short (AQ-S) and reported significantly more autistic traits on 3 of 5 AQ-S subscales compared to the NOSAD group. Diagnosis uniquely predicted variation in the social skills subscale above and beyond the other subscales and other predictors. Furthermore, variation in the social skills subscale largely explained group differences on the other subscales. Our results suggest caution in utilizing measures like the AQ-S with clinical populations characterized by social difficulties such as individuals with a GSAD diagnosis.

The structure of obsessive compulsive symptoms and beliefs: A correspondence and biplot analysis,"Research has suggested that obsessive-compulsive (OC) beliefs are differentially predictive of OC symptom dimensions. One additional way in which beliefs and symptoms may be related is by severity; that is, the role of beliefs may vary as a function of symptom severity. In order to evaluate this possibility, correspondence analysis with biplot was applied to evaluate the association between OC beliefs and OC symptom severity across three subsamples, individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; N = 398), individuals with anxiety disorders ( N = 104), and undergraduate students ( N = 285). To do so, we generated five row categories of symptom severity and six columns based on the Obsessive Compulsive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ) for three subsamples. Unlike factor analyses of inter-variable correlations (or covariances), the CA-biplot paradigm calibrates simultaneously row and column information and estimates dimensional coordinates (analogous to factor loadings) separately for rows and columns. We used the first two dimensions from each subsample because they accounted for most variance (on average 89%) so as to construct a hypothetical plane with them. Then, we visually inspected associations among five severity categories (rows) and six OBQ subscales (columns) in the plane and also calculated their correlations. The visual configurations and numerical correlations were consistent across three subsamples, indicating that inflated responsibility was significantly associated with OC symptoms, but only for those with the least severe symptoms. Importance and control of thoughts were associated with OC symptoms across all levels of symptom severity. The implications of these findings for the cognitive model of OCD are considered.

Social anxiety disorder and quality of life: How fears of negative and positive evaluation relate to specific domains of life satisfaction,"Individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) experience functional impairment in social, educational, and occupational arenas, contributing to poor quality of life. Previous research using the Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI) has identified four distinct domains of quality of life among individuals with SAD: Achievement, Personal Growth, Social Functioning, and Surroundings. The present study was designed to investigate how fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and fear of positive evaluation (FPE) relate to the four QOLI domains among individuals with SAD. We also examined the relationships of FNE and FPE to Satisfaction and Importance ratings on the QOLI. Individuals with SAD ( N = 129) completed a battery of questionnaires prior to initiating treatment. FNE and FPE showed distinct relationships with the four QOLI domains, even after controlling for demographic characteristics and comorbid depression. Both FNE and FPE were associated with ratings of Satisfaction with the QOLI domains, but neither was associated with ratings of Importance. Our findings highlight the differential impacts of FNE and FPE on SAD. Treatment implications are discussed.

The effects of social anxiety on interpersonal evaluations of warmth and dominance,"Social anxiety disorder is associated with interpersonal dysfunction, but it is not clear why people with the disorder feel unsatisfied with their relationships. One possibility is that higher social anxiety could lead to changes in sensitivity to interpersonal traits. We examined whether social anxiety moderates the types of interpersonal evaluations people make regarding warmth and dominance. We developed vignettes in which central characters systematically varied in dominance and warmth and asked two samples of participants (undergraduate students, n = 176, and online workers, n = 403) to rate their willingness to interact with, and the social desirability of, these characters. Participants in general reported stronger desire to interact with warmer and less dominant characters, and rated warmer and more dominant characters as being more socially desirable. People with higher social anxiety exhibited greater tolerance for colder and more submissive characters on both rated dimensions. The perceived similarity of the characters accounted for the bulk of these effects. Participants indicated a higher desire to interact with characters more similar to themselves, and people with higher social anxiety were more likely to rate submissive and cold characters as being like themselves. The results have implications for clinical interventions for social anxiety disorder.

Anxiety trajectories in response to a speech task in social anxiety disorder: Evidence from a randomized controlled trial of CBT,"The subjective experience of anxiety plays a central role in cognitive behavioral models of social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, much remains to be learned about the temporal dynamics of anxiety elicited by feared social situations. The aims of the current study were: (1) to compare anxiety trajectories during a speech task in individuals with SAD ( n = 135) versus healthy controls (HCs; n = 47), and (2) to compare the effects of CBT on anxiety trajectories with a waitlist control condition. SAD was associated with higher levels of anxiety and greater increases in anticipatory anxiety compared to HCs, but not differential change in anxiety from pre- to post-speech. CBT was associated with decreases in anxiety from pre- to post-speech but not with changes in absolute levels of anticipatory anxiety or rates of change in anxiety during anticipation. The findings suggest that anticipatory experiences should be further incorporated into exposures.

Does cyberchondria overlap with health anxiety and obsessive–compulsive symptoms? An examination of latent structure and scale interrelations,"Searching for medical information online is a widespread activity that increases distress for many individuals. Researchers have speculated that this phenomenon, referred to as cyberchondria , overlaps substantially with both health anxiety and obsessive–compulsive symptoms. This study sought to examine: (1) the distinguishability of cyberchondria from health anxiety and obsessive–compulsive symptoms and (2) the components of health anxiety and obsessive–compulsive symptoms that cluster most strongly with cyberchondria. The sample consisted of community adults in the United States with no current reported medical problems ( N = 375). Results from confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) support the idea that cyberchondria is distinct from, yet related to, health anxiety and obsessive–compulsive symptoms. Results from zero-order correlations and regression analyses suggest that cyberchondria clusters with the affective (health worry) component of health anxiety. Regression results diverged from prior findings, as obsessive–compulsive symptoms did not share associations with cyberchondria after accounting for negative affect and health anxiety. The present results indicate that cyberchondria is possibly discernible from both health anxiety and obsessive–compulsive symptoms, while also providing insight into areas of potential overlap.

An empirical analysis of Moscovitch’s reconceptualised model of social anxiety: How is it different from fear of negative evaluation?,"Cognitive-behavioural models propose that excessive fear of negative evaluation is central to social anxiety. Moscovitch (2009) instead proposes that perceived deficiencies in three self attributes: fears of showing signs of anxiety, deficits in physical appearance, or deficits in social competence are at the core of social anxiety. However, these attributes are likely to overlap with fear of negative evaluation. Responses to an online survey of 286 participants with a range of social anxiety severity were analysed using hierarchical multiple regression to identify the overall unique predictive value of Moscovitch’s model. Altogether, Moscovitch’s model provided improvements in the prediction of safety behaviours, types of fears and cognitions; however only the fear of showing anxiety subscale provided unique information. This research supports further investigations into the utility of this revised model, particularly related to utility of explicitly assessing and addressing fears of showing anxiety.

The effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy for youth anxiety on sleep problems,"The present study examined (a) whether sleep related problems (SRPs) improved following cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for youth with anxiety disorders, (b) whether variables that may link anxiety and SRPs (e.g., pre-sleep arousal, family accommodation, sleep hygiene) changed during treatment, and (c) whether such changes predicted SRPs at posttreatment. Youth were diagnosed with anxiety at pretreatment and received weekly CBT that targeted their principal anxiety diagnosis at one of two specialty clinics ( N = 69 completers, M age = 10.86). Results indicated that parent-reported SRPs improved from pre- to post-treatment and that treatment responders with regard to anxiety yielded greater SRP improvements than nonresponders. Parent report of bedtime resistance and sleep anxiety showed significant improvements. Youth reported lower rates of SRPs compared to their parents and did not demonstrate pre- to post-treatment changes in SRPs. Pre-sleep arousal and family accommodation decreased over treatment but did not predict lower SRPs at posttreatment. Higher accommodation was correlated with greater SRPs. Sleep hygiene evidenced no change and did not mediate links between accommodation and posttreatment SRPs.

Anger profiles in social anxiety disorder,"Individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) exhibit elevated levels of anger and anger suppression, which are both associated with increased depression, diminished quality of life, and poorer treatment outcomes. However, little is known about how anger experiences differ among individuals with SAD and whether any heterogeneity might relate to negative outcomes. This investigation sought to empirically define anger profiles among 136 treatment-seeking individuals with SAD and to assess their association with distress and impairment. A latent class analysis was conducted utilizing the trait subscales of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 as indicators of class membership. Analysis revealed four distinct anger profiles, with greatest distress and impairment generally demonstrated by individuals with elevated trait anger, a greater tendency to suppress the expression of anger, and diminished ability to adaptively control their anger expression. These results have implications for tailoring more effective interventions for socially anxious individuals.

Exploring differences between the ICD-11 and DSM-5 models of PTSD: Does it matter which model is used?,"Alternative symptom profiles for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are presented in the DSM-5 and ICD-11. This study compared DSM-5 PTSD symptom profiles with ICD-11 PTSD symptom profiles among a large group of trauma-exposed individuals from Denmark. Covariates, and rates of co-occurrence with other psychiatric disorders were also investigated. A sample of treatment-seeking adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse ( n = 434) were assessed using self-report measures of PTSD and other psychiatric disorders. A significantly larger proportion of individuals met caseness for DSM-5 PTSD (60.0%) compared to ICD-11 PTSD (49.1%). This difference was largely attributable to low endorsement of the ICD-11 re-experiencing criteria. Replacement of the ‘recurrent nightmares’ symptom with the ‘recurrent thoughts/memories’ symptom seemed to balance the proportion of individuals meeting caseness for both taxonomies. Levels of co-occurrence with anxiety and thought disorder were higher for the DSM-5 model of PTSD compared to the ICD-11 model. Current results merit careful consideration in the selection of symptom indicators for the new ICD model of PTSD, particularly with respect to the re-experiencing symptom category.

A systematic review of sleep disturbance in anxiety and related disorders,"Recent research suggests that sleep disturbance may be a transdiagnostic process, and there is increasing interest in examining how sleep disturbance may contribute to anxiety and related disorders. The current review summarizes and synthesizes the extant research assessing sleep in anxiety and related disorders. The findings suggest that sleep disturbance exacerbates symptom severity in the majority of anxiety and related disorders. However, the nature of sleep disturbance often varies as a function of objective versus subjective assessment. Although sleep disturbance is a correlate of most anxiety and related disorders, a causal role for sleep disturbance is less clear. A model of potential mechanisms by which sleep disturbance may confer risk for the development of anxiety and related disorders is discussed. Future research integrating findings from basic sleep research with current knowledge of anxiety and related disorders may facilitate the development of novel treatments for comorbid sleep disturbance and clinical anxiety.

A randomized controlled trial of guided internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy for older adults with generalized anxiety,"This study aimed to establish the efficacy of guided Internet-delivered cognitive-behaviour therapy (ICBT) for older adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or subclinical GAD. Participants were randomized to receive seven modules of ICBT ( n = 24) or to a waiting list condition (WLC; n = 22). Faster improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression were observed for participants in the ICBT condition relative to the WLC, with large between-group effect sizes on the Generalized anxiety disorder-7 ( d = .85) and the Patient health questionnaire ( d = 1.17) obtained at post-treatment. Further reduction in generalized anxiety symptoms was reported over the one-month follow-up. Treatment effects were replicated when control participants subsequently underwent treatment. Higher ratings of treatment credibility, but not expectancy, prior to ICBT predicted improvements over time. The results support the efficacy of ICBT as treatment for older adults with GAD.

Factor mixture modeling of the Penn State Worry Questionnaire: Evidence for distinct classes of worry,"Worry, the anticipation of future threat, is a common feature of anxiety and mood psychopathology. Considerable research has examined the latent structure of worry to determine whether this construct reflects a dimensional or taxonic structure. Recent taxometric investigations have provided support for a unidimensional structure of worry; however, the results of these studies are limited in that taxometric approaches are unable to assess for the presence of more than two classes of a given construct. Given the complex nature of worry, it is possible that worry may actually reflect a latent structure comprised of multiple classes that cannot be assessed through taxometric approaches. Thus, it is important to utilize newer statistical techniques, such as factor-mixture modeling (FMM), which allow for a more nuanced assessment of the latent structure of a given psychological construct. The aim of the current study was to examine the latent structure of worry using FMM. It was predicted that worry would reflect a three-class structure comprised of (1) a class of low, normative levels of worry, (2) a class of moderate, subclinical worry, and (3) a class of high, pervasive worry. The latent class structure of worry was assessed using FMM in a sample of 1337 participants recruited from the community through a research clinic. Results revealed a three-class structure of the PSWQ comprising low, moderate-high, and high classes of worry. We also provided convergent and discriminant validity of the worry classes by demonstrating that the high worry class was most associated with GAD and that the low worry class was the least associated with GAD. The clinical utility of the worry classes, including the creation of empirically based cut-scores, and the implications for future research are discussed.

"Theory of mind in social anxiety disorder, depression, and comorbid conditions","Social anxiety disorder is characterized by marked interpersonal impairment, particularly when presenting with comorbid major depression. However, the foundational social-cognitive skills that underlie interpersonal impairment in comorbid and non-comorbid manifestations of SAD has to date received very little empirical investigation. In a sample of 119 young adults, the current study examined differences in theory of mind (ToM), defined as the ability to decode and reason about others’ mental states, across four groups: (a) non-comorbid SAD; (b) non-comorbid Lifetime MDD; (c) comorbid SAD and Lifetime MDD; and (d) healthy control. The non-comorbid SAD group was significantly less accurate at decoding mental states than the non-comorbid MDD and control groups. Further, both the comorbid and non-comorbid SAD groups made significantly more ‘excessive’ ToM reasoning errors than the non-comorbid MDD group, suggesting a pattern of over-mentalizing. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding the social cognitive foundations of social anxiety.

Episodic future thinking in generalized anxiety disorder,"Research on future-oriented cognition in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has primarily focused on worry, while less is known about the role of episodic future thinking (EFT), an imagery-based cognitive process. To characterize EFT in this disorder, we used the experimental recombination procedure, in which 21 GAD and 19 healthy participants simulated positive, neutral and negative novel future events either once or repeatedly, and rated their phenomenological experience of EFT. Results showed that healthy controls spontaneously generated more detailed EFT over repeated simulations. Both groups found EFT easier to generate after repeated simulations, except when GAD participants simulated positive events. They also perceived higher plausibility of negative—not positive or neutral—future events than did controls. These results demonstrate a negativity bias in GAD individuals’ episodic future cognition, and suggest their relative deficit in generating vivid EFT. We discuss implications for the theory and treatment of GAD.

Psychometric properties of the anxiety sensitivity index-3 in an acute and heterogeneous treatment sample,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is associated with various forms of psychopathology. The most common measure of AS is the anxiety sensitivity index-3 (ASI-3). The current study examined the psychometric properties and factor structure of the ASI-3 in an acute and comorbid population seeking treatment for a broad range of psychopathology ( N = 382). Results confirmed a bi-factor structure and suggested that the ASI-3 demonstrates adequate psychometric properties in a transdiagnostic sample. The ASI-3 also showed adequate sensitivity to change over the course of partial hospital treatment. Findings regarding associations between specific anxiety disorders and subscales of the ASI-3 are discussed. Overall, the current results support the use of the ASI-3 to assess AS in heterogeneous treatment-seeking samples. This work is of particular utility for researchers examining the concept of AS transdiagnostically.

Dispositional mindfulness in trauma recovery: Prospective relations and mediating mechanisms,"This study examined the protective properties and candidate mediating processes (cognitive fusion and cognitive suppression) linking dispositional mindfulness to distal risk factors (negative affect, anxiety sensitivity, rumination) and psychopathology symptom outcomes (depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms) following trauma exposure. To do so, a community-based sample of adults was longitudinally studied in the six-months following exposure— within 30-days (T1), 3-months (T2), and 6-months (T3)—to a shared disaster-related potentially traumatic event (PTE). Specifically, we found that cognitive fusion predicted, and mediated, the effect of mindfulness on outcomes related to distress post-trauma including negative affect, depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Complementary to these effects, we found that cognitive suppression predicted, and mediated, the effect of mindfulness on distal risk factors linked to negative self-referential processes including rumination and anxiety sensitivity. Findings are discussed with respect to their theoretical and clinical implications for the potential role and mechanisms of mindfulness in recovery following trauma.

Latent dimensions of social anxiety disorder: A re-evaluation of the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN),"The Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN; Connor et al., 2000) is a well-validated instrument for assessing severity of social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, evaluations of its factor structure have produced inconsistent results and this aspect of the scale requires further study. Primary care patients with SAD ( N = 397) completed the SPIN as part of baseline assessment for the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management study (Roy-Byrne et al., 2010). These data were used for exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the SPIN. A 3-factor model provided the best fit for the data and factors were interpreted as Fear of Negative Evaluation, Fear of Physical Symptoms, and Fear of Uncertainty in Social Situations. Tests of a second-order model showed that the three factors loaded strongly on a single higher-order factor that was labeled Social Anxiety. Findings are consistent with theories identifying Fear of Negative Evaluation as the core feature of SAD, and with evidence that anxiety sensitivity and intolerance of uncertainty further contribute to SAD severity.

Does successful smoking cessation reduce anxious arousal among treatment-seeking smokers?,"Introduction: There is limited work that has examined the effect of quitting smoking on anxious arousal, an underlying dimension of anxiety symptoms and psychopathology. Method: Smokers ( n = 185, 54.1% female) enrolled in a smoking cessation treatment trial were monitored post-cessation in terms of abstinence status (biochemically verified; at Weeks 1, 2, and Month 1 post-quit) and severity of panic-relevant symptoms (self-reported; at Month 1 and 3 post-quit). Structural equation models were conducted, adjusting for participant sex, age, treatment condition, and pre-cessation nicotine dependence, presence of depressive/anxiety disorders, anxious arousal, and anxiety sensitivity. Results: After adjusting for covariates, participants who remained abstinent for one month ( n = 80; 43.2%) relative to those who did not ( n = 105; 56.8%) demonstrated significant reductions in anxious arousal at Month 1 (β = −.26, p = .04) and Month 3 post-quit (β = −.36, p = .006); abstinence status had a non-significant effect on anxious arousal severity at Month 3 after controlling for Month 1 anxious arousal (β = −.18, p = .09). Discussion: Findings align with theoretical models of smoking-anxiety interplay and suggest that smoking cessation can result in reductions in anxious arousal.

"""Diagnostic accuracy of three scoring methods for the Davidson Trauma Scale among U.S. Military Veterans"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Diagnostic accuracy of three scoring methods for the Davidson Trauma Scale among U.S. Military Veterans"" by Scott D. McDonald, NiVonne L. Thompson, Kelcey J. Stratton and Patrick S. Calhoun ( Journal of Anxiety Disorders , 2014[Mar], Vol 28[2], 160-168). In the original article, the formula to calculate the negative likelihood ratio may not be familiar to some readers. The formula and accompanying citation are provided. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-08473-002). Self-report questionnaires are frequently used to identify PTSD among U.S. military personnel and Veterans. Two common scoring methods used to classify PTSD include: (1) a cut score threshold and (2) endorsement of PTSD symptoms meeting DSM-IV-TR symptom cluster criteria (SCM). A third method requiring a cut score in addition to SCM has been proposed, but has received little study. The current study examined the diagnostic accuracy of three scoring methods for the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) among 804 Afghanistan and Iraq war-era military Service Members and Veterans. Data were weighted to approximate the prevalence of PTSD and other Axis I disorders in VA primary care. As expected, adding a cut score criterion to SCM improved specificity and positive predictive power. However, a cut score of 68–72 provided optimal diagnostic accuracy. The utility of the DTS, the role of baseline prevalence, and recommendations for future research are discussed.

“Having the heart to be evaluated”: The differential effects of fears of positive and negative evaluation on emotional and cardiovascular responses to social threat,"Accumulating evidence supports fear of evaluation in general as important in social anxiety, including fear of positive evaluation (FPE) and fear of negative evaluation (FNE). The present study examined state responses to an impromptu speech task with a sample of 81 undergraduates. This study is the first to compare and contrast physiological responses associated with FPE and FNE, and to examine both FPE- and FNE-related changes in state anxiety/affect in response to perceived social evaluation during a speech. FPE uniquely predicted (relative to FNE/depression) increases in mean heart rate during the speech; in contrast, neither FNE nor depression related to changes in heart rate. Both FPE and FNE related uniquely to increases in negative affect and state anxiety during the speech. Furthermore, pre-speech state anxiety mediated the relationship between trait FPE and diminished positive affect during the speech. Implications for the theoretical conceptualization and treatment of social anxiety are discussed.

Transdiagnostic versus disorder-specific and clinician-guided versus self-guided internet-delivered treatment for generalized anxiety disorder and comorbid disorders: A randomized controlled trial,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) can be treated effectively with either disorder-specific cognitive behavior therapy (DS-CBT) or transdiagnostic CBT (TD-CBT). The relative benefits of DS-CBT and TD-CBT for GAD and the relative benefits of delivering treatment in clinician guided (CG-CBT) and self-guided (SG-CBT) formats have not been examined. Participants with GAD ( n = 338) were randomly allocated to receive an internet-delivered TD-CBT or DS-CBT intervention delivered in either CG-CBT or SG-CBT formats. Large reductions in symptoms of GAD (Cohen’s d ≥ 1.48; avg. reduction ≥ 50%) and comorbid major depressive disorder (Cohen’s d ≥ 1.64; avg. reduction ≥ 45%), social anxiety disorder (Cohen’s d ≥ 0.80; avg. reduction ≥ 29%) and panic disorder (Cohen’s d ≥ 0.55; avg. reduction ≥ 33%) were found across the conditions. No substantive differences were observed between DS-CBT and TD-CBT or CG-CBT and SG-CBT, highlighting the public health potential of carefully developed TD-CBT and SG-CBT.

The SPAIC-11 and SPAICP-11: Two brief child- and parent-rated measures of social anxiety,"The Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children-11 (SPAIC-11) and Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children's Parents-11 (SPAICP-11) were developed as brief versions of the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory—Child and Parent Versions via item response theory (IRT) using child and parent reports of social anxiety. A sample of 496 children was analyzed using IRT analyses, revealing 11 items that exhibit measurement equivalence across parent and child reports. Descriptive and psychometric data are provided for the child, parent, and combined total scores. Discriminant validity was demonstrated using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. The SPAIC-11 and SPAICP-11 are psychometrically sound measures that are able to measure social anxiety invariantly across children and their parents. These brief measures which include combined parent and child perception of the child's social anxiety may provide notable benefits to clinical research.

Does attention redirection contribute to the effectiveness of attention bias modification on social anxiety?,"Attention bias modification (ABM) is designed to modify threat-related attention bias and thus alleviate anxiety. The current research examined whether consistently directing attention towards targeted goals per se contributes to ABM efficacy. We randomly assigned 68 non-clinical college students with elevated social anxiety to non-valence-specific attend-to-geometrics (AGC), attention modification (AMC), or attention control (ACC) conditions. We assessed subjective, behavioral, and physiological reactivity to a speech task and self-reported social anxiety symptoms. After training, participants in the AMC exhibited an attention avoidance from threat, and those in the AGC responded more rapidly toward targeted geometrics. There was a significant pre- to post-reduction in subjective speech distress across groups, but behavioral and physiological reactivity to speech, as well as self-report social anxiety symptoms, remained unchanged. These results lead to questions concerning effectiveness of ABM training for reducing social anxiety. Further examination of the current ABM protocol is required.

Psychometric evaluation of the concerns of Social Reprisal Scale: Further explicating the roots of fear of positive evaluation,"Fear of positive evaluation (FPE) has been proposed to be an important feature of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and to be rooted, at least partly, in concerns of social reprisal due to positive impressions. In order to formally test this hypothesis, the Concerns of Social Reprisal Scale (CSRS) was developed. The purpose of the present series of studies was to examine the psychometric profile of the CSRS across several independent samples including: a large ( n = 981) undergraduate sample; a clinical sample of individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder ( n = 27), and a demographically-matched subsample of healthy control participants ( n = 24). The factorial validity, internal consistency, and construct validity of the CSRS were examined. Results across both studies provided support for the psychometric profile of the CSRS. The implications of concerns of social reprisal for the assessment of social anxiety symptoms, theoretical models of fear of evaluation and SAD, and their potential clinical utility with regard to treating SAD are discussed.

Exploring the association between a cholecystokinin promoter polymorphism (rs1799923) and posttraumatic stress disorder in combat veterans,"Background: Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a neuropeptide that has been implicated in understanding the acquisition and extinction of fear. Research on CCK in anxiety has primarily focused on understanding panic attacks and panic disorder. Emerging data suggests that CCK may also hold promise in understanding the development and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method: The present study examined whether a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the CCK gene (C&gt;T; rs1799923) was associated with an increased prevalence of PTSD as well as with severity of PTSD symptoms among a sample of 457 combat veterans. Results: Results demonstrated that participants with either the heterozygous or homozygous T allele had an increased prevalence of PTSD relative to participants with the CC genotype (OR = 2.17; 95% CI [1.37–3.43]). Limitations: The relatively small sample size precluded examination of racial/ethnic differences. Findings were also limited by the absence of a systematic assessment of comorbid anxiety psychopathology. Conclusions: These data offer preliminary evidence supporting an association between the rs1799923 polymorphism in the CCK gene and PTSD. Additional research is needed to better understand the nature of this relationship.

Clinical characteristics and predictors of hoarding in children with anxiety disorders,"Objective: This investigation was conducted to describe the clinical of characteristics of anxious children with significant hoarding behavior and to examine the contributions of anxiety, obsessive compulsive, and inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in the prediction of hoarding. Method: One hundred nine children seeking treatment for an anxiety disorder and their parents completed clinician-administered and parent-report measures of emotional and behavioral symptoms, functional impairment, and hoarding symptoms. Results: Elevated levels of hoarding were reported for 22% of the sample. Children with elevated hoarding scored significantly higher on measures of anxiety, obsessive–compulsive, attention, social, and thought problems, rule-breaking, aggression, and overall functional impairment and had higher rates of major depressive disorder than children without hoarding. Attention problems predicted hoarding symptomology over-and-above the contributions of either anxiety or obsessive–compulsive symptoms. Conclusions: Findings suggest a pattern of behavioral and emotional dysregulation for children who hoard and provide further insight into the relationships between anxiety, attention problems, and hoarding.

Acute posttraumatic stress symptoms but not generalized anxiety symptoms are associated with severity of exposure to war trauma: A study of civilians under fire,"Posttraumatic stress (PTSS) and generalized anxiety symptoms (GAS) may ensue following trauma. While they are now thought to represent different psychopathological entities, it is not clear whether both GAS and PTSS show a dose–response to trauma exposure. The current study aimed to address this gap in knowledge and to investigate the moderating role of subjects’ demographics in the exposure-outcome associations. The sample included 249 civilian adults, assessed during the 2014 Israel–Gaza military conflict. The survey probed demographic information, trauma exposure, and symptoms. PTSS but not GAS was associated with exposure severity. Women were at higher risk for both PTSS and GAS than men. In addition, several demographic variables were only associated with PTSS levels. PTSS dose-response effect was moderated by education. These findings are in line with emerging neurobiological and cognitive research, suggesting that although PTSS and GAS have shared risk factors they represent two different psychopathological entities. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed.

The relationship between adult attachment style and post-traumatic stress symptoms: A meta-analysis,"There is increasing evidence that adult attachment plays a role in the development and perseverance of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This meta-analysis aims to synthesise this evidence and investigate the relationship between adult attachment styles and PTSD symptoms. A random-effects model was used to analyse 46 studies ( N = 9268) across a wide range of traumas. Results revealed a medium association between secure attachment and lower PTSD symptoms (ρ = − .27), and a medium association, in the opposite direction, between insecure attachment and higher PTSD symptoms (ρ = .26). Attachment categories comprised of high levels of anxiety most strongly related to PTSD symptoms, with fearful attachment displaying the largest association (ρ = .44). Dismissing attachment was not significantly associated with PTSD symptoms. The relationship between insecure attachment and PTSD was moderated by type of PTSD measure (interview or questionnaire) and specific attachment category (e.g. secure, fearful). Results have theoretical and clinical significance.

"Pathways involving traumatic losses, worry about family, adult separation anxiety and posttraumatic stress symptoms amongst refugees from West Papua","There is some evidence that adult separation anxiety disorder (ASAD) symptoms are closely associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) amongst refugees exposed to traumatic events (TEs), but the pathways involved remain to be elucidated. A recent study suggests that separation anxiety disorder precedes and predicts onset of PTSD. We examined a path model testing whether ASAD symptoms and worry about family mediated the path from traumatic losses to PTSD symptoms amongst 230 refugees from West Papua. Culturally adapted measures were applied to assess TE exposure and symptoms of ASAD and PTSD. A structural equation model indicated that ASAD symptoms played an important role in mediating the effects of traumatic losses and worry about family in the pathway to PTSD symptoms. Although based on cross-sectional data, our findings suggest that ASAD symptoms may play a role in the path from traumatic losses to PTSD amongst refugees. We propose an evolutionary model in which the ASAD and PTSD reactions represent complementary survival responses designed to protect the individual and close attachments from external threats.

Phenomenology and clinical correlates of family accommodation in pediatric anxiety disorders,"Despite evidence documenting high prevalence of family accommodation in pediatric obsessive–compulsive disorder, examination in other pediatric anxiety disorders is limited. Preliminary evidence suggests that family accommodation is common amongst children with anxiety disorders; however, the impact on clinical presentation and functional impairment has not been addressed. This study assessed the nature and clinical correlates of family accommodation in pediatric anxiety, as well as validating a mechanistic model. Participants included 112 anxious youth and their parents who were administered a diagnostic clinical interview and measure of anxiety severity, as well as questionnaires assessing internalizing and externalizing symptoms, family accommodation and functional impairment. Some form of accommodation was present in all families. Family accommodation was associated with increased anxiety severity and externalizing behaviors, having a diagnosis of separation anxiety, and increased functional impairment. Family accommodation partially mediated the relationship between anxiety severity and functional impairment, as well as externalizing behaviors and functional impairment. Family accommodation is common in pediatric anxiety disorders, and is associated with more severe clinical presentations and functional impairment. These findings highlight the importance of parental involvement in treatment and the need to specifically target accommodation practices during interventions to mitigate negative outcomes in anxious youth. Further studies utilizing longitudinal data are needed to validate mechanistic models.

Group cognitive behavioural treatment of youth anxiety in community based clinical practice: Clinical significance and benchmarking against efficacy,"The efficacy of a group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme (Cool Kids) of youth anxiety has been demonstrated at university clinics in Australia and Denmark and similar CBT programmes have been found effective within community settings in other countries. However, most effectiveness studies of CBT for youth anxiety have either used a mixture of CBT guidelines, or translated protocols not previous tested in an efficacy trial. This study used a benchmarking strategy to compare outcomes from the same CBT programme used at a university research clinic ( N = 87) and community centres ( N = 82). There was a significant reduction on both clinical and self-report measures of youth anxiety over time with medium to large effect sizes within both samples. Treatment effects on self-report measures of youth anxiety were significantly larger within the university sample, while changes in clinical measures of youth anxiety were similar in the two samples. Overall these findings suggest that an efficacious CBT group treatment programme developed within research contexts is transportable to community centres. Despite being effective within the community, the results indicate that the treatment may lose some of its efficacy when disseminated to the community.

Disorder-specific versus transdiagnostic and clinician-guided versus self-guided treatment for major depressive disorder and comorbid anxiety disorders: A randomized controlled trial,"Disorder-specific cognitive behavior therapy (DS-CBT) is effective at treating major depressive disorder (MDD) while transdiagnostic CBT (TD-CBT) addresses both principal and comorbid disorders by targeting underlying and common symptoms. The relative benefits of these two models of therapy have not been determined. Participants with MDD ( n = 290) were randomly allocated to receive an internet delivered TD-CBT or DS-CBT intervention delivered in either clinician-guided (CG-CBT) or self-guided (SG-CBT) formats. Large reductions in symptoms of MDD (Cohen’s d ≥ 1.44; avg. reduction≥45%) and moderate-to-large reductions in symptoms of comorbid generalised anxiety disorder (Cohen’s d ≥ 1.08; avg. reduction≥43%), social anxiety disorder (Cohen’s d ≥ 0.65; avg. reduction≥29%) and panic disorder (Cohen’s d ≥ 0.45; avg. reduction≥31%) were found. No marked or consistent differences were observed across the four conditions, highlighting the efficacy of different forms of CBT at treating MDD and comorbid disorders.

"Interpersonal trauma, attachment insecurity and anxiety in an inpatient psychiatric population","Current research suggests that interpersonal trauma has an impact on insecure attachment and anxiety. Some research further suggests that attachment may play a mediating role between traumatic events and psychopathology. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the experience of interpersonal trauma, attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance and clinical anxiety severity among adult psychiatric inpatients who reported having experienced interpersonal trauma after the age of 16. It was hypothesized that attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance would mediate the relationship between interpersonal trauma and clinical anxiety level. This study used archival data on 414 adult psychiatric inpatients in a large city in the Southwest U.S. Results suggest that interpersonal trauma was correlated to attachment avoidance but not to attachment anxiety and that attachment avoidance partially mediated the relation of interpersonal trauma to anxiety. The attachment framework appositely explains how a negative model of other contributes to the relation between experiences of interpersonal trauma and anxiety in adulthood.

Childhood adversity profiles and adult psychopathology in a representative Northern Ireland study,"Childhood adversities are key aetiological factors in the onset and persistence of psychopathology. The aims of this study were to identify childhood adversity profiles, and investigate the relationship between the adversity classes and psychopathology in Northern Ireland. The study utilized data from the Northern Ireland Study of Health and Stress, an epidemiological survey ( N = 1986), which used the CIDI to examine mental health disorders and associated risk factors. Latent Class Analysis revealed 3 distinct typologies; a low risk class ( n = 1709; 86%), a poly-adversity class ( n = 122; 6.1%), and an economic adversity class ( n = 155; 7.8%). Logistic Regression models revealed that individuals in the economic adversity class had a heightened risk of anxiety and substance disorders, with individuals in the poly-adversity class more likely to have a range of mental health problems and suicidality. The findings indicate the importance of considering the impact of co-occurring childhood adversities when planning treatment, prevention, and intervention programmes.

Mechanisms of change during group metacognitive therapy for repetitive negative thinking in primary and non-primary generalized anxiety disorder,"Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a transdiagnostic process that serves to maintain emotional disorders. Metacognitive theory suggests that positive and negative metacognitive beliefs guide the selection of RNT as a coping strategy which, in turn, increases psychological distress. The aim of this study was to test the indirect effect of metacognitive beliefs on psychological distress via RNT. Patients ( N = 52) with primary and non-primary generalized anxiety disorder attended a brief, six-week group metacognitive therapy program and completed measures of metacognitive beliefs, RNT, and symptoms at the first and final treatment sessions, and at a one-month follow-up. Prospective indirect effects models found that negative metacognitive beliefs (but not positive metacognitive beliefs) had a significant indirect effect on psychological distress via RNT. As predicted by metacognitive theory, targeting negative metacognitions in treatment appears to reduce RNT and, in turn, emotional distress. Further research using alternative measures at multiple time points during therapy is required to determine whether the absence of a relationship with positive metacognitive beliefs in this study was a consequence of (a) psychometric issues, (b) these beliefs only being relevant to a subgroup of patients, or (c) a lack of awareness early in treatment.

Emotional reactivity and executive control: A pathway of risk for the development of childhood worry,"Though risk factors associated with the development of anxiety have been examined, less is known about childhood worry. Current literature suggests that adult worriers may be more likely to avoid increases in negative affect (emotional contrast avoidance), and less likely to effectively regulate their emotions. The current study tested a mediational model to examine the role of emotional and attentional control in the relation between emotional reactivity and child worry. Participants were 99 children between 7 and 10 years old, and their parents, from a community sample. Parents completed measures of child temperament and executive function, and children completed a measure of worry. Overall the data supported the study hypotheses. Child temperaments rated as low in soothability were significantly related to higher worry symptoms. Attentional shift and emotional control acted as serial mediators in the relation between temperament and worry, and fully mediated the relation. These findings suggest a model for the development of childhood worry that combines emotional contrast avoidance and emotional dysregulation.

Out of the shadows and into the spotlight: Social blunders fuel fear of self-exposure in social anxiety disorder,"In a study designed to clarify and extend previous research on social blunders in social anxiety, 32 participants with social anxiety disorder (SAD), 25 anxious control (AC) participants with anxiety disorders other than SAD, and 25 healthy control (HC) participants with no history of anxiety problems estimated the costs of hypothetical blunders committed by either themselves or by others. Participants with SAD rated the costs of their own imagined blunders as highly inflated relative to both AC and HC participants. In contrast, for blunders participants imagined others committing, only SAD and healthy control participants’ cost estimates differed from one another. Moreover, concerns about revealing self-flaws—and, in particular, about appearing socially incompetent—accounted for significant, unique variance in SAD participants’ exaggerated cost estimates of self blunders, over and above symptoms of social anxiety and depression. These results enhance our understanding of how and why socially anxious individuals negatively appraise social blunders and help to clarify the potential function and role of social mishap exposures in the treatment of SAD.

Classification models for subthreshold generalized anxiety disorder in a college population: Implications for prevention,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders on college campuses and often goes unidentified and untreated. We propose a combined prevention and treatment model composed of evidence-based self-help (SH) and guided self-help (GSH) interventions to address this issue. To inform the development of this stepped-care model of intervention delivery, we evaluated results from a population-based anxiety screening of college students. A primary model was developed to illustrate how increasing levels of symptomatology could be linked to prevention/treatment interventions. We used screening data to propose four models of classification for populations at risk for GAD. We then explored the cost considerations of implementing this prevention/treatment stepped-care model. Among 2489 college students (mean age 19.1 years; 67% female), 8.0% (198/2489) met DSM-5 clinical criteria for GAD, in line with expected clinical rates for this population. At-risk Model 1 (subthreshold, but considerable symptoms of anxiety) identified 13.7% of students as potentially at risk for developing GAD. Model 2 (subthreshold, but high GAD symptom severity) identified 13.7%. Model 3 (subthreshold, but symptoms were distressing) identified 12.3%. Model 4 (subthreshold, but considerable worry) identified 17.4%. There was little overlap among these models, with a combined at-risk population of 39.4%. The efficiency of these models in identifying those truly at risk and the cost and efficacy of preventive interventions will determine if prevention is viable. Using Model 1 data and conservative cost estimates, we found that a preventive intervention effect size of even 0.2 could make a prevention/treatment model more cost-effective than existing models of “wait-and-treat.” (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",1715674203," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2015
Exposure therapy changes dysfunctional evaluations of somatic symptoms in patients with hypochondriasis (health anxiety). A randomized controlled trial,"Dysfunctional evaluations of somatic symptoms are considered a central factor in maintaining hypochondriasis. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether exposure therapy (ET) without cognitive restructuring is sufficient to change dysfunctional evaluations of somatic symptoms. The current study was based on a randomized controlled trial and compared patients with hypochondriasis ( N = 73) receiving ET or cognitive therapy (CT) to a wait list (WL) control group. In both the ET and CT groups, dysfunctional symptom evaluations changed significantly compared with the WL group. No differences between the ET and CT groups emerged. The relationship between the treatment condition (active treatment vs. WL) and reductions in health anxiety was mediated by changes in somatic symptom evaluations only in a specific card sorting procedure. We conclude that addressing dysfunctional symptom evaluations is a necessary precondition for the effective treatment of hypochondriasis. However, the results indicate that ET and CT appear to change those processes to a similar degree.

Metacognitive beliefs moderate the relationship between catastrophic misinterpretation and health anxiety,"Catastrophic misinterpretations of bodily symptoms have a central role in cognitive-behavioural models of health anxiety. However, the metacognitive (S-REF) model postulates that psychological disturbance is linked more to beliefs about thinking i.e., metacognition. Equally the relationship between catastrophic misinterpretation and health anxiety should be moderated by metacognition, in particular negative beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of thinking (MCQNeg). Participants ( N = 351) completed measures to examine the relationship between these variables. Results indicated positive relationships between metacognition, catastrophic misinterpretation, and health anxiety. Moderation analysis showed that the effect of catastrophic misinterpretations on health anxiety was explained by the proposed interaction with metacognition. Follow-up regression analysis demonstrated the interaction term explained variance in health anxiety when controlling for other variables, and was a stronger unique predictor of health anxiety than catastrophic misinterpretation. Metacognition appears to be an important factor in the relationship between catastrophic misinterpretation and health anxiety, and would have important implications for existing models and treatment.

Anxiety sensitivity and post-traumatic stress reactions: Evidence for intrusions and physiological arousal as mediating and moderating mechanisms,"A growing body of research has implicated anxiety sensitivity (AS) and its dimensions in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the mechanism(s) that may account for the association between AS and PTSD remains unclear. Using the “trauma film paradigm,” which provides a prospective experimental tool for investigating analog intrusion development, the present study examines the extent to which intrusions mediate the association between AS and the development of posttraumatic stress reactions. After completing a measure of AS and state mood, unselected participants ( n = 45) viewed a 10min film of graphic scenes of fatal traffic accidents and then completed a second assessment of state mood. Participants then kept a daily diary to record intrusions about the film for a one-week period. Post-traumatic stress reactions about the film were then assessed after the one-week period. The results showed that general AS and physical and cognitive concerns AS predicted greater post-traumatic stress reactions about the film a week later. Furthermore, the number of intrusions the day after viewing the traumatic film, but not fear and disgust in response to the trauma film, mediated the association between general AS (and AS specifically for physical and cognitive concerns) and post-traumatic stress reactions a week later. Subsequent analysis also showed that physiological arousal during initial exposure to the traumatic film moderated the association between general AS and the number of intrusions reported the day after viewing the film. The implications of these analog findings for conceptualizing the mechanism(s) that may interact to explain the role of AS in the development of PTSD and its effective treatment are discussed.

"Inferring other people's states of mind: Comparison across social anxiety, body dysmorphic, and obsessive–compulsive disorders","Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are characterized by fears of negative evaluation by others (related to one's own incompetence or flawed appearance, respectively). Previous research has shown that individuals with SAD and BDD exhibit difficulty identifying facial expressions and interpretive biases for threat in social situations. The current study aimed at further investigating social cognition in SAD, BDD, and mentally healthy controls (35 individuals per group, respectively). Further, 35 individuals with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) as a clinical control group not characterized by evaluation fears were included. Methods: The Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC) was applied. It consists of 45 video sequences depicting interactions among four people at a dinner party. Participants are instructed to evaluate each scenario with respect to the characters' emotions, thoughts, and intentions from a bystander perspective (i.e. other-referent context). Results: Only the socially anxious groups (SAD and BDD) were overall less accurate than the other groups in correctly interpreting the social situations, whereas no difference was obtained between the OCD and the control group. Further analyses indicated that the SAD and BDD groups were less accurate in identifying other people's thoughts and intentions, whereas, again, no difference was observed between the OCD and control groups. In addition, the SAD group was less accurate in inferring thoughts and intentions than the OCD group. Interestingly, the groups did not differ with respect to identifying other people's emotions. Conclusions: These results mostly confirm existing cognitive-behavioral models of SAD and BDD emphasizing that biased interpretation of what others think or intend is one of the key factors maintaining social anxiety and appearance-related concerns. Our study shows that this bias generalizes to social situations in which individuals take a third-person observer perspective.

Predicting short-term positive affect in individuals with social anxiety disorder: The role of selected personality traits and emotion regulation strategies,"Recently, research has provided support for a moderate, inverse relationship between social anxiety and dispositional positive affect. However, the dynamics of this relationship remain poorly understood. The present study evaluates whether certain personality traits and emotion regulation variables predict short-term positive affect for individuals with social anxiety disorder and healthy controls. Positive affect as measured by two self-report instruments was assessed before and after two tasks in which the participant conversed with either a friend or a romantic partner. Tests of models examining the hypothesized prospective predictors revealed that the paths did not differ significantly across diagnostic group and both groups showed the hypothesized patterns of endorsement for the emotion regulation variables. Further, a variable reflecting difficulty redirecting oneself when distressed prospectively predicted one measure of positive affect. Additional research is needed to explore further the role of emotion regulation strategies on positive emotions for individuals higher in social anxiety.

"Preliminary study of family accommodation in youth with autism spectrum disorders and anxiety: Incidence, clinical correlates, and behavioral treatment response","Anxiety symptoms are common in youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and directly associated with symptom severity and functional impairment. Family accommodation occurs frequently among individuals with obsessive-compulsive and anxiety disorders; to date, no data exist on the nature and correlates of family accommodation in youth with ASD and anxiety, as well as its relationship to cognitive-behavioral therapy outcome. Forty children with ASD and a comorbid anxiety disorder participated. Clinicians administered measures of ASD and anxiety disorder caseness, anxiety symptom severity, and family accommodation; parents completed questionnaires assessing social responsiveness, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and functional impairment. A subsample of youth ( n = 24) completed a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Family accommodation was common and positively correlated with anxiety symptom severity, but not functional impairment, general internalizing symptoms, externalizing behavior, or social responsiveness. Family accommodation decreased following cognitive-behavioral therapy with decreases in family accommodation being associated with decreases in anxiety levels.

Extinction learning as a moderator of D-cycloserine efficacy for enhancing exposure therapy in posttraumatic stress disorder,"Augmentation of exposure therapy with D-cycloserine (DCS) has proven efficacious across anxiety disorders, although results in PTSD have been mixed. Work in animals and anxiety-disordered patients suggest that the potentiating effects of DCS are dependent on the level of extinction learning during extinction training and exposure treatment, respectively. The aim of the current study was to replicate and extend previous work by examining the association between the degree of extinction learning and DCS efficacy in our randomized clinical trial on DCS (50mg) versus placebo enhancement of exposure therapy in a chronic mixed-trauma PTSD sample ( N = 67; de Kleine, Hendriks, Kusters, Broekman, &amp; van Minnen, 2012). The decline in subjective units of distress ratings collected during and across the exposure sessions were evaluated as indices of extinction learning. First, we examined whether extinction learning during an exposure session moderated DCS effects on self-reported PTSD symptoms at the next session. Second, we examined whether averaged extinction learning over the course of treatment interacted with group assignment to predict change over time and post treatment outcome. We did not find evidence that DCS effects were moderated by the degree of extinction learning, although, extinction learning was related to outcome regardless of group assignment. In PTSD, not one extinction-learning index has been consistently linked to DCS enhanced exposure treatment outcome. More (experimental) work needs to been done to unravel the complex interplay between extinction learning and DCS enhancement, especially in PTSD patients.

"BDNF Val66Met, stress, and positive mothering: Differential susceptibility model of adolescent trait anxiety","Etiological research has indicated the gene–environment interaction (G × E) on adolescent anxiety. This study aimed to examine how the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism interacted with stressful life events and positive mothering to influence youth trait anxiety. The study sample included 780 community adolescents of Chinese Han ethnicity ( M = 13.6, 51.3% females). Participants’ trait anxiety, exposure to stressful life events, and mother's warmth-reasoning were assessed by self-reported questionnaires. We found that BDNF Val66Met polymorphism significantly moderated the influences of stressful life events and mother's warmth-reasoning on adolescent anxiety. The influences were significantly greater in adolescents carrying one or two Val allele than those with Met/Met genotype. Moreover, the G × E interactions were more consistent with the differential susceptibility than the diathesis–stress model. Adolescents carrying Val allele who were more susceptible to adversity were also more likely to benefit from supportive experiences. These findings provide novel evidence for the role of BDNF Val66Met as a genetic susceptibility modulating the influences of stressful life events and mother's warmth-reasoning on adolescent anxiety. We speculate that BDNF Val66Met may moderate anxious youths’ responses to mindfulness-based stress reduction program and family-based treatment targeting the enhancement of positive parenting.

"The correlates of obsessive–compulsive, schizotypal, and borderline personality disorders in obsessive–compulsive disorder","We assessed correlates of obsessive–compulsive (OCPD), schizotypal (SPD) and borderline (BPD) personality disorders in 110 obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. We found OCD patients with OCPD (20.9%) to exhibit higher rates of hoarding and bipolar disorders, increased severity of hoarding and symmetry, lower prevalence of unacceptable thoughts involving sex and religion and less non-planning impulsivity. Conversely, OCD patients with SPD (13.6%) displayed more frequently bipolar disorder, increased severity of depression and OCD neutralization, greater prevalence of “low-order” behaviors (i.e., touching), lower low-planning impulsivity and greater “behavioral” compulsivity. Finally, in exploratory analyses, OCD patients with BPD (21.8%) exhibited lower education, higher rates of several comorbid psychiatric disorders, greater frequency of compulsions involving interpersonal domains (e.g. reassurance seeking), increased severity of depression, anxiety and OCD dimensions other than symmetry and hoarding, more motor and non-planning impulsivity, and greater “cognitive” compulsivity. These findings highlight the importance of assessing personality disorders in OCD samples.

Cognitive–behavioral therapy for late-life anxiety: Similarities and differences between Veteran and community participants,"Cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment for anxiety; however, a growing body of research suggests that CBT effect sizes are smaller in Veteran samples. The aim of this study was to perform secondary data analyses of a randomized controlled trial of CBT for late-life generalized anxiety disorder compared with treatment as usual (TAU) in a Veteran ( n = 101) and community-based ( n = 122) sample. Veterans had lower income and less education than community participants, greater severity on baseline measures of anxiety and depression, poorer physical health, and higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity. Treatment effects were statistically significant in the community sample (all ps &lt; 0.01), but not in Veterans (all ps &gt; 0.05). Further analyses in Veterans revealed that poorer perceived social support significantly predicted poorer outcomes (all ps &lt; 0.05). Our results underscore the complexity of treating Veterans with anxiety, and suggest that additional work is needed to improve the efficacy of CBT for Veterans, with particular attention to social support.

Common rather than unique aspects of repetitive negative thinking are related to depressive and anxiety disorders and symptoms,"Repetitive Negative Thinking (RNT) is assumed to be a transdiagnostic factor in depressive and anxiety disorders. We hypothesized that an underlying common dimension of RNT will be more strongly associated with each of the anxiety and depressive disorders, with comorbidity among disorders and with symptom severity than unique aspects of rumination and worry. In a cross-sectional study, 2143 adults diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria completed questionnaires for content-independent RNT, rumination and worry. 84% of the shared variance of worry and rumination overlapped with content-independent RNT. The common dimension of RNT was significantly associated with each of the depressive and anxiety disorders, comorbidity among emotional disorders and the common core of depressive, anxiety and avoidance symptoms. The unique portion of rumination showed a significant relationship with Major Depressive Disorder and depressive comorbidity and the unique portion of worry with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. These findings are particularly relevant for clinical practice as generic interventions to reduce RNT are currently being tested.

"Distress tolerance in OCD and anxiety disorders, and its relationship with anxiety sensitivity and intolerance of uncertainty","There is a growing interest in the role of distress tolerance (i.e., the capacity to withstand negative emotions) in the onset and maintenance of anxiety. However, both empirical and theoretical knowledge regarding the role of distress tolerance in the anxiety disorders is relatively under examined. Accumulating evidence supports the relationship between difficulties tolerating distress and anxiety in nonclinical populations; however, very few studies have investigated distress tolerance in participants with diagnosed anxiety disorders. Individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder with and without agoraphobia (PD/A) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) completed measures of distress tolerance (DT), conceptually related measures (i.e., anxiety sensitivity (AS), intolerance of uncertainty (IU)), and anxiety symptom severity. Results showed that DT was negatively associated with AS and IU. DT was correlated with GAD, SAD and OCD symptoms, but not PD/A symptoms, in individuals with those respective anxiety disorders. DT was no longer a significant predictor of OCD or anxiety disorder symptom severity when AS and IU were also taken into account. There were no between group differences on DT across OCD and the anxiety disorder groups. Implications for the role of distress tolerance in anxiety pathology are discussed.

Interoceptive exposure exercises for social anxiety,"Individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) commonly experience panic attacks and evidence increased anxiety sensitivity (AS) specific to noticeable anxiety sensations. Interoceptive exposure (IE) is an effective treatment for reducing AS, but few IE tasks target fears of blushing, sweating, or trembling, which are incorporated within AS social concerns and especially feared by individuals with SAD. The primary study aims were trifold: (1) identify novel IE tasks that produce blushing, sweating, and/or trembling; (2) assess the intensity of sensations and anxiety produced by a series of novel and validated IE tasks; and (3) evaluate the incremental validity of combining an IE task and a speech task. Individuals ( N = 55) with heightened fear of noticeably blushing, sweating, and/or trembling completed a control task and 8 IE tasks (e.g., hot sauce, hyperventilation). All tasks produced greater intensity of anxiety and sensations compared to the control task ( ps &lt; .001; range of η p ² = .20–.50). Responses to the combination of an IE task and social task compared to a social task alone did not differ significantly. Future directions for research and clinical implications of the findings are discussed.

"Relations between common and specific factors of anxiety sensitivity and distress tolerance and fear, distress, and alcohol and substance use disorders","Whereas it has been speculated that the psychopathology risk factors anxiety sensitivity (AS) and distress tolerance (DT) are highly overlapping, no studies have examined whether a core affect sensitivity construct explains this relation. It was hypothesized that, in a sample of 808 treatment-seeking individuals ( M age =35.11, SD = 14.94), the best-fitting confirmatory factor analysis model of AS and DT would comprise a common underlying affect sensitivity factor orthogonal to DT and lower-order AS factors (physical, cognitive, and social concerns). It was also hypothesized that specific relations between the factors and fear, distress, and alcohol/substance use disorders would emerge. The best-fitting model comprised a common affect sensitivity factor orthogonal to DT and lower-order AS factors. Whereas the affect sensitivity and DT factors were associated with fear, distress, and alcohol/substance use disorders, AS cognitive concerns was only related to distress disorders and AS social concerns was only related to fear disorders.

"Metacognitions, worry and sleep in everyday life: Studying bidirectional pathways using Ecological Momentary Assessment in GAD patients","Background: The metacognitive model of generalized anxiety disorder proposes that negative metacognitive beliefs are crucial in the maintenance of excessive worry. Furthermore, according to the cognitive model of insomnia, worry leads to problems falling or staying asleep and poor sleep quality. In order to test the assumed causal relationships, the present study examined the time-dependent course of negative metacognition and worry as well as worry and sleep quality, using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). Method: Negative metacognitions, worry and sleep were assessed by self-report questionnaires as well as EMA in 56 GAD patients who carried a portable device for 1 week and logged sleep quality, negative metacognition and worry processes four times a day. Results: Metacognitions, worry and sleep were significantly correlated. Structural equation modeling using multilevel analyses showed a unidirectional relationship of negative metacognitions leading to prolonged worry processes and a bidirectional relationship of worry and sleep quality. Conclusions: These findings support the theoretically derived assumptions on the relationship between negative metacognitions, worry and sleep. Implications for further research as well as clinical implications are discussed.

A randomized controlled trial of attention modification for social anxiety disorder,"Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) models implicate social threat cue vigilance (i.e., attentional biases) in symptom development and maintenance. A modified dot-probe protocol has been shown to reduce SAD symptoms, in some but not all studies, presumably by modifying an attentional bias. The current randomized controlled trial was designed to replicate and extend such research. Participants included treatment-seeking adults ( n = 108; 58% women) who met diagnostic criteria for SAD. Participants were randomly assigned to a standard (i.e., control) or modified (i.e., active) dot-probe protocol condition and to participate in-lab or at home. The protocol involved twice-weekly 15-min sessions, for 4 weeks, with questionnaires completed at baseline, post-treatment, 4-month follow-up, and 8-month follow-up. Symptom reports were assessed with repeated measures mixed hierarchical modeling. There was a main effect of time from baseline to post-treatment wherein social anxiety symptoms declined significantly ( p &lt; .05) but depression and trait anxiety did not ( p &gt; .05). There were no significant interactions based on condition or participation location ( ps &gt; .05). Reductions were maintained at 8-month follow-up. Symptom reductions were not correlated with threat biases as indexed by the dot-probe task. The modified and standard protocol both produced significant sustained symptom reductions, whether administered in-lab or at home. There were no robust differences based on protocol type. As such, the mechanisms for benefits associated with modified dot-probe protocols warrant additional research.

Anxiety sensitivity and the anticipation of predictable and unpredictable threat: Evidence from the startle response and event-related potentials,"There is growing evidence that heightened sensitivity to unpredictable threat is a core mechanism of dysfunction in anxiety disorders. However, it is unclear whether anxiety sensitivity is also associated with sensitivity to unpredictable threat. In the present study, 131 participants completed the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, which includes physical concerns (PC), social concerns (SC), and cognitive concerns (CC) subscales, and a predictable vs. unpredictable threat-of-shock task. Startle eyeblink and ERP responses (N100, P300) to the acoustic startle probes were measured during the task. PC and CC were associated with heightened and attenuated, respectively, startle for the unpredictable (but not predictable) condition. CC were also associated with attenuated probe N100 for the unpredictable condition only, and PC were associated with increased P300 suppression across the predictable and unpredictable conditions. This study provides novel evidence that the different anxiety sensitivity dimensions demonstrate unique relationships with the RDoC domains “acute” and “potential” threat.

Risk profiles for poor treatment response to internet-delivered CBT in people with social anxiety disorder,"In social anxiety disorder (SAD) co-morbid depressive symptoms as well as avoidance behaviors have been shown to predict insufficient treatment response. It is likely that subgroups of individuals with different profiles of risk factors for poor treatment response exist. This study aimed to identify subgroups of social avoidance and depressive symptoms in a clinical sample ( N = 167) with SAD before and after guided internet-delivered CBT, and to compare these groups on diagnostic status and social anxiety. We further examined individual movement between subgroups over time. Using cluster analysis we identified four subgroups, including a high-problem cluster at both time-points. Individuals in this cluster showed less remission after treatment, exhibited higher levels of social anxiety at both assessments, and typically remained in the high-problem cluster after treatment. Thus, in individuals with SAD, high levels of social avoidance and depressive symptoms constitute a risk profile for poor treatment response.

Intolerance of uncertainty as a mediator of reductions in worry in a cognitive behavioral treatment program for generalized anxiety disorder,"Growing evidence suggests that intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a cognitive vulnerability that is a central feature across diverse anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce IU, it remains to be established whether or not reductions in IU mediate reductions in worry. This study examined the process of change in IU and worry in a sample of 28 individuals with GAD who completed CBT. Changes in IU and worry, assessed bi-weekly during treatment, were analyzed using multilevel mediation models. Results revealed that change in IU mediated change in worry (ab = −0.20; 95% CI [−.35, −.09]), but change in worry did not mediate change in IU (ab = −0.16; 95% CI [−.06, .12]). Findings indicated that reductions in IU accounted for 59% of the reductions in worry observed over the course of treatment, suggesting that changes in IU are not simply concomitants of changes in worry. Findings support the idea that IU is a critical construct underlying GAD.

Intensive weekend group treatment for panic disorder and its impact on co-occurring PTSD: A pilot study,"This pilot study examines the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of delivering an intensive weekend group treatment for panic disorder (PD) to Veterans returning from deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan with co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The treatment program lasted 6h each day and was delivered by two experienced therapists. Patients received core components of panic treatment, including psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and interoceptive exposure. The interoceptive exposure exercises directly targeted anxiety sensitivity, a psychological construct also implicated in the maintenance of PTSD. Eighty-nine percent of patients who expressed interest in the treatment attended a baseline evaluation, and 63% of those who were study eligible initiated treatment. Treatment retention was high, with all 10 patients who initiated treatment completing the program. Veterans reported finding the treatment and delivery format highly acceptable and reported high levels of satisfaction. Panic symptoms improved significantly following the treatment and were maintained at a 7-month follow-up, with 71.4% of the sample reporting being panic free. Co-occurring PTSD symptoms also improved along with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Preliminary findings suggest that brief and intensive group treatments for PD/PTSD are a promising method of delivering cognitive behavioral therapy that may rapidly improve symptoms. This innovative treatment delivery format also may be a cost-effective way of increasing treatment engagement through increased access to quality care.

Anxiety sensitivity and sleep-related problems in anxious youth,"Anxiety disorders constitute the most common mental health disturbance experienced by youth. Sleep-related problems (SRPs) are highly prevalent among anxious youth and encompass a variety of problems including nighttime fears, insomnia, and refusal to sleep alone. Given that chronic sleep disturbance is associated with a range of behavioral and physical problems in youth and predicts future psychopathology, it is important to elucidate the nature of SRPs in anxious youth. The present study investigated the relationship between sleep problems and anxiety sensitivity in a sample of 101 anxious youth, ages 6–17. Heightened anxiety sensitivity significantly predicted prolonged sleep onset latency across the sample, even after accounting for severity of anxiety, depression, and age. Results support previous research indicating that SRPs are common among anxious youth and suggest that anxiety sensitivity may play a particularly important role in sleep onset latency.

The effect of maternal psychopathology on parent–child agreement of child anxiety symptoms: A hierarchical linear modeling approach,"The current study examined the effects of maternal anxiety, worry, depression, child age and gender on mother and child reports of child anxiety using hierarchical linear modeling. Participants were 73 mother–child dyads with children between the ages of 7 and 10 years. Reports of child anxiety symptoms, including symptoms of specific disorders (e.g., social phobia) were obtained using concordant versions of the Screen for Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED). Children reported significantly higher levels of anxiety symptoms relative to their mothers. Maternal worry and depression predicted for significantly lower levels of maternal-reported child anxiety and increasing discrepant reports. Maternal anxiety predicted for higher levels of maternal-reported child anxiety and decreasing discrepant reports. Maternal depression was associated with increased child-reported child anxiety symptoms. No significant effect of child age or gender was observed. Findings may inform inconsistencies in previous studies on reporter discrepancies. Implications and future directions are discussed.

Neurostructural abnormalities in pediatric anxiety disorders,"Functional neuroimaging studies have consistently demonstrated abnormalities in fear and threat processing systems in youth with anxiety disorders; however, the structural neuroanatomy of these systems in children and adolescents remains largely unknown. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), gray matter volumes were compared between 38 medication-free patients with anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder; social phobia; separation anxiety disorder, mean age: 14.4 ± 3 years) and 27 comparison subjects (mean age: 14.8 ± 4 years). Compared to healthy subjects, youth with anxiety disorders had larger gray matter volumes in the dorsal anterior cingulate and had decreased gray matter volumes in the inferior frontal gyrus (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex), postcentral gyrus, and cuneus/precuneus. These data suggest the presence of structural differences in regions previously implicated in the processing and regulation of fear in pediatric patients with anxiety disorders.

Long-term consequences of severe health anxiety on sick leave in treated and untreated patients: Analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial,"Health anxiety (HA) is prevalent and costly for health services. However, little is known about the full societal burden of HA. Based on complete register data, we (1) compared weeks on sickness-related benefits (SB) in untreated patients with severe HA ( n = 126) with a matched population sample ( n = 12,600); and (2) tested whether Acceptance &amp; Commitment group Therapy (ACT-G) ( n = 63) reduced weeks on SB during the first year after randomisation compared to a waitlist ( n = 63). We found that (1) HA patients showed a six-monthly increment of 2 weeks on SB compared with the general population ( p &lt; 0.0001), and (2) that ACT-G and the waitlist showed no difference in their ability to reduce SB during the first year ( p = 0.246). We conclude that HA is associated with a considerable societal burden. A possible beneficial effect of psychotherapy on SB needs further investigation.

The social interaction phobia scale: Continued support for the psychometric validity of the sips using clinical and non-clinical samples,"The present study sought to extend findings supporting the psychometric validity of a promising measure of social anxiety (SA) symptoms, the Social Interaction Phobia Scale (SIPS; Carleton et al., 2009). Analyses were conducted using three samples: social anxiety disorder (SAD) patients, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients, and healthy controls. SIPS scores of SAD patients demonstrated internal consistency and construct validity, and the previously demonstrated three-factor structure of the SIPS was replicated. Further, the SIPS total score uniquely predicted SA symptoms, and SIPS scores were significantly higher for SAD patients than GAD patients or controls. Two cut-off scores that discriminated SAD patients from GAD patients and from healthy controls were identified. The current study is the first to replicate the SIPS three-factor model in a large, treatment-seeking sample of SAD patients and establish a cut-off score discriminating SAD from GAD patients. Findings support the SIPS as a valid, SAD-specific assessment instrument.

Subthreshold and threshold DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder in Singapore: Results from a nationally representative sample,"Previous nationally representative studies have reported prevalence of DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, subthreshold and threshold GAD expressions remain poorly understood. The current study examined the prevalence, correlates and co-morbidity of a broader diagnosis of GAD in Singapore. The Singapore Mental Health Study (SMHS) was an epidemiological survey conducted in the population ( N = 6616) aged 18 years and older. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0 (CIDI 3.0) was used to establish mental disorder diagnoses. The lifetime prevalence for subthreshold GAD (2.1%) and threshold GAD (1.5%) in the current sample was found to be lower than in Western populations. Younger age group, Indian ethnicity, previously married, chronic physical conditions, and being unemployed were associated with higher odds of having more severe expression of generalized anxiety. The relatively lower prevalence rate of subthreshold GAD expression suggests possible cultural interferences in the reporting and manifestation of anxiety symptomatology. Despite the low prevalence, significant impacts on functioning and comorbidity among subthreshold generalized anxiety cases indicate the importance of early treatment to ensure a better prognosis.

Anxiety sensitivity and subjective social status in relation to anxiety and depressive symptoms and disorders among Latinos in primary care,"The present investigation examined the interactive effects of anxiety sensitivity and subjective social status in relation to anxiety and depressive symptoms and psychopathology among 143 Latinos (85.7% female; M age = 39.0, SD = 10.9; 97.2% used Spanish as their first language) who attended a community-based primary healthcare clinic. Results indicated that the interaction between anxiety sensitivity and subjective social status was significantly associated with number of mood and anxiety disorders, panic, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The form of the significant interactions indicated that individuals reporting co-occurring higher levels of anxiety sensitivity and lower levels of subjective social status evidenced the greatest levels of psychopathology and panic, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The present findings suggest that there is merit in focusing further scientific attention on the interplay between anxiety sensitivity and subjective social status in regard to understanding, and thus, better intervening to reduce anxiety/depressive vulnerability among Latinos in primary care.

Parenting clinically anxious versus healthy control children aged 4–12 years,"This study investigated whether parenting behaviors differed between parents of 68 clinically anxious children and 106 healthy control children aged 4–12 years. The effects of parent gender, child gender and child age on parenting were explored. Mothers and fathers completed a questionnaire to assess parenting behaviors in for children hypothetically anxious situations. Results showed that parents of clinically anxious children reported more anxiety-enhancing parenting (reinforcement of dependency and punishment) as well as more positive parenting (positive reinforcement). For the clinical sample, fathers reported using more modeling/reassurance than mothers, and parents reported using more force with their 4–7-year-olds than with their 8–12-year-olds. No interaction effects were found for child gender with child anxiety status on parenting. Results indicate that for intervention, it is important to measure parenting behaviors, and to take into account father and mother differences and the age of the child.

Cultural-based biases of the GAD-7,"The GAD-7 is a popular measure of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms that has been used across many cultural groups. Existing evidence demonstrates that the prevalence of GAD varies across self-identified ethnic/cultural groups, a phenomenon that some researchers attribute to cross-cultural measurement error rather than to actual differences in rates of GAD. Nonetheless, the effect of culture on factor structure and response patterns to the GAD-7 have not been examined and could result over- or under-estimated GAD-7 scores across different cultural groups. The current investigation assessed the factor structure of the GAD-7 in White/Caucasian, Hispanic, and Black/African American undergraduates and tested for cultural-based biases. A modified one-factor model exhibited good fit across subsamples. Results revealed that Black/African American participants with high GAD symptoms scored lower on the GAD-7 than other participants with similar GAD symptoms. Results highlight the need for culturally sensitive GAD screening tools.

Predictors of dropout from community clinic child CBT for anxiety disorders,"The aim was to investigate predictors of treatment dropout among 182 children (aged 8–15 years) participating in an effectiveness trial of manual-based 10-session individual and group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders in community clinics. The dropout rate was 14.4%, with no significant difference between the two treatment conditions. We examined predictors for overall dropout ( n = 26), early (≤ session 4, n = 15), and late dropout (≥ session 5, n = 11). Overall dropout was predicted by low child and parent rated treatment credibility, and high parent self-rated internalizing symptoms. Low child rated treatment credibility predicted both early and late dropout. High parent self-rated internalizing symptoms predicted early dropout, whereas low parent rated treatment credibility predicted late dropout. These results highlight the importance of addressing treatment credibility, and to offer support for parents with internalizing symptoms, to help children and families remain in treatment.

Developing scales measuring disorder-specific intolerance of uncertainty (DSIU): A new perspective on transdiagnostic,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a construct of growing prominence in literature on anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder. Existing measures of IU do not define the uncertainty that respondents perceive as distressing. To address this limitation, we developed eight scales measuring disorder-specific intolerance of uncertainty (DSIU) relating to various anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder. We used exploratory factor analysis and item characteristic curves in two large undergraduate samples ( Ns = 627 and 628) to derive eight three-item DSIU scales (24 items total) that exhibited excellent psychometric properties. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the factor structures of the scales and the transdiagnostic nature of IU. Each scale predicted unique variance in its respective symptom measure beyond a traditional measure of IU. DSIU represents a theoretically proximal and causal intermediary between known vulnerability factors and disorder symptomatology. The DSIU scales can be used to advance theories of psychopathology and inform case conceptualization and treatment planning.

Target problem (mis) matching: Predictors and consequences of parent–youth agreement in a sample of anxious youth,"Parents and youth often report discrepant target problems upon seeking treatment for youth psychopathology, which can have important impact on therapy processes (e.g., dropout) and treatment outcomes, as entry-level attitudes have been found to be influential in ultimate use and benefit of treatment. The current study examined parent–youth agreement within an anxiety disordered sample by assessing demographic and diagnostic factors that may predict matching, as well as the impact of matching on attrition, treatment outcome, and parental satisfaction. Ninety-five youth with principal anxiety disorders received cognitive–behavioral treatment for anxiety at a university outpatient clinic. Youth and parents independently identified target problems during the pretreatment assessment. Target problems were coded into 25 qualitative categories representing diagnostic, symptom, and functional impairment domains, including diffuse anxiety, social anxiety, academic achievement, oppositional/behavior problems, sleep problems, suicidal ideation, and family functioning. The majority of parent–youth dyads (67.4%) agreed on at least one target problem. Although problems related to diffuse anxiety and social anxiety were reported most frequently, relatively low rates of agreement were found in these domains. Kappa values demonstrated higher levels of agreement for problems with specific fears, school attendance, and panic and lower levels of agreement for difficulties with worry, shame, and self-esteem. Further, youth diagnosed with comorbid externalizing disorders were less likely to agree with their parents on at least one target problem. No effects were found for gender, age, or number of diagnoses in predicting agreement. Target problem agreement did not significantly impact rates of attrition or diagnostic remission, but did predict some measures of parental satisfaction. Results suggest that disagreement on treatment goals exists even within a narrow treatment population and may predict important consumer variables such as satisfaction. Findings emphasize that initial goals disagreement warrants careful assessment and monitoring.

Anxiety disorders and first alcohol use in the general population. Findings from a nationally representative sample,"Objective: To examine how early onset anxiety disorders are related to age of first alcohol use in a general population sample. Method: Discrete time survival analysis was used to model the odds of first alcohol use among those with, vs without, early onset anxiety disorders. Data came from the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. Results: After adjusting for the effects of family history of alcohol/drug use, sex, age cohort and education, people who experienced an early onset anxiety disorder had a 27% increased odds of first alcohol use in any given year, when compared to those with no anxiety disorder. This effect was particularly strong for transitions to first alcohol use that occurred after the age of 13 years. Conclusions: Early onset anxiety disorders significantly predict first alcohol use in the general population and this relationship appears to be related to change over time. These results point to the need for developmentally appropriate and integrated prevention programs that target anxiety and alcohol use together.

"Psychometric properties of Internet-administered measures of health anxiety: An investigation of the Health Anxiety Inventory, the Illness Attitude Scales, and the Whiteley Index","Background: The Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI), the Illness Attitude Scales (IAS), and the Whiteley Index (WI) are three of the most widely used health anxiety measures, but their psychometric properties have not been investigated when administered via the Internet. Methods: We investigated the three instruments' test–retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent, and discriminant validity and sensitivity to change using one sample ( n = 111) of participants with severe health anxiety and one sample of healthy controls ( n = 92). Results: The HAI, IAS, and WI showed high test–retest reliability (rs ≥ .80), good convergent, and discriminant validity and were sensitive to detect change. The HAI and IAS (α s ≥ .85), but not the WI (α s ≤ .60) demonstrated high internal consistency. Conclusions: The HAI, IAS, and WI have good psychometric properties, except for the low internal consistency of WI, when used as Internet-administered measures of health anxiety. Using these measures over the Internet offers highly important advantages such as increased ease of administration, reduced attrition, and cost-efficient treatment evaluation.

Validation of the Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS): Replication and extension with bifactor modeling,"Internet help seeking behaviors are increasingly common. Despite the positives associated with technology, cyberchondria, or the process of increased anxiety in response to internet medical information seeking, is on the rise. The Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS) was recently developed to provide a valid measure of cyberchondria across multiple dimensions. The current study sought to extend previous work on the CSS factor structure by examining a bifactor model. Participants ( N = 526) from a community sample completed the CSS via online crowd sourcing. Results revealed that the bifactor model of the CSS provided superior fit to the data, suggesting that it is useful to conceptualize the CSS as containing a General Cyberchondria factor that is orthogonal to its subfactors. Similar to previous work, the CSS Mistrust factor does not appear to be necessary to this construct. Finally, results revealed unique relations between General and Specific Cyberchondria factors with lower-order health anxiety dimensions.

Association study of monoamine oxidase-a gene promoter polymorphism (MAOA-uVNTR) with self-reported anxiety and other psychopathological symptoms in a community sample of early adolescents,"The polymorphism upstream of the gene for monoamine oxidase A (MAOA-uVNTR) is reported to be an important enzyme involved in human physiology and behavior. With a sample of 228 early-adolescents from a community sample (143 girls) and adjusting for environmental variables, we examined the influence of MAOA-uVNTR alleles on the scores obtained in the Screen for Childhood Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders and in the Child Symptom Inventory-4 . Our results showed that girls with the high-activity MAOA allele had higher scores for generalized and total anxiety than their low-activity peers, whereas boys with the low-activity allele had higher social phobia scores than boys with the high-activity allele. Results for conduct disorder symptoms did not show a significant relationship between the MAOA alleles and the presence of these symptoms. Our findings support a possible association, depending on gender, between the MAOA-uVNTR polymorphism and psychopathological disorders such as anxiety, which affects high rates of children and adolescents.

Three-year outcomes of adults with anxiety and related disorders following cognitive-behavioral therapy in a non-research clinical setting,"Anxiety and related disorders are highly prevalent and costly to society. Fortunately, a large number of randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the treatment of anxiety and related disorders. A smaller number of effectiveness studies have also demonstrated that similar outcomes to randomized controlled trials can be obtained in “real-world” settings. There is minimal research, however, into long-term outcomes in effectiveness research. This study describes the outcomes of 98 individuals with anxiety and related disorders treated in an outpatient, fee-for-service setting using a case formulation CBT approach. Participants were followed up each year after their discharge, for a period of 3 years. The results indicate that patients maintained their treatment gains, with large effect sizes obtained from pre-treatment to each follow-up time point ( d = 1.11–1.60). The results provide preliminary evidence to suggest that individuals treated with CBT in “real-world” settings maintain their treatment gains in the long-term.

The vasovagal response during confrontation with blood-injury-injection stimuli: The role of perceived control,"The vasovagal response (VVR) is a common medical problem, complicating and deterring people from various procedures. It is an unusual stress response given the widespread decreases in physiological activity. Nevertheless, VVR involves processes similar to those observed during episodes of strong emotions and pain. We hypothesized that heightened perceived control would reduce symptoms of VVR. Eighty-two young adults were randomly assigned to perceived control or no perceived control conditions during exposure to a stimulus video of a mitral valve surgery, known to trigger VVR in non-medical personnel. Perceived control was manipulated by allowing some participants to specify a break time, though all received equivalent breaks. Outcomes included subjective symptoms of VVR, anxiety, blood pressure, heart rate, and other measures derived from impedance cardiography. Compared to participants with perceived control, participants with no perceived control reported significantly more vasovagal symptoms and anxiety, and experienced lower stroke volume, cardiac output, and diastolic blood pressure. Participants who were more fearful of blood were more likely to benefit from perceived control in several measures. Perceived control appears to reduce vasovagal symptoms. Results are discussed in terms of cognition and emotion in VVR.

Beyond DSM-5: An alternative approach to assessing social anxiety disorder,"This article focuses on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) classification of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). The article details the diagnostic criteria for SAD that have evolved in the various editions and demonstrates that whilst there have been some positive steps taken to more comprehensively define the disorder, further revision is necessary. It will be argued that the DSM-5 (APA, 2013) has made some changes to the diagnostic criteria of SAD that do not seem to be completely in line with theory and research and do not describe SAD effectively in terms of both diversity and presentation. This article concludes with the presentation of a proposed set of diagnostic criteria that address the concerns raised in the article. The proposed criteria reflect a hybrid categorical–dimensional system of classification.

Treating nighttime fears in young children with bibliotherapy: Evaluating anxiety symptoms and monitoring behavior change,"Objective: Children's nighttime fears are a normal part of child development and are transient for most children, but result in considerable distress for others. The present study evaluated a 4-week bibliotherapy intervention designed to treat young children with persistent and interfering nighttime fears utilizing a multiple baseline design. Method: Nine children between 5 and 7 years of age with specific phobia diagnoses were randomized into one of three baseline control conditions (1, 2, or 3 weeks). The treatment protocol involved parents reading Uncle Lightfoot, Flip that Switch: Overcoming Fear of the Dark, Academic Version (Coffman, 2012) with their children over 4 weeks while engaging in activities prescribed in the book. Assessments took place at baseline, post treatment, and 1 month following treatment. Daily and weekly tracking of nighttime behaviors was also obtained. Results: Pre-post group analyses revealed that eight of the nine children demonstrated clinically significant change in anxiety severity. In addition, decreases in child-reported nighttime fears were observed, as were parent-reported decreases in separation anxiety and increases in the number of nights children slept in their own bed. Conclusions: The present study provides initial support for the use of bibliotherapy in the treatment of nighttime fears. Further replication and evaluation are needed to determine appropriate length of treatment and long-term effects. Implications of the findings are discussed.

Effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral group therapy for patients with hypochondriasis (health anxiety),"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of health anxiety. However, little is known about the effectiveness of group CBT in the treatment of health anxiety. The current study is the largest study that has investigated the effectiveness of combined individual and group CBT for patients with the diagnosis of hypochondriasis ( N = 80). Therapy outcomes were evaluated by several questionnaires. Patients showed a large improvement on these primary outcome measures both post-treatment (Cohen's d = 0.82–1.08) and at a 12-month follow-up (Cohen's d = 1.09–1.41). Measures of general psychopathology and somatic symptoms showed significant improvements, with small to medium effect sizes. Patients with more elevated hypochondriacal characteristics at therapy intake showed a larger therapy improvement, accounting for 7–8% of the variance in therapy outcome. CBT group therapy has therefore been shown to be an appropriate and cost-effective treatment for health anxiety.

Serum docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is inversely associated with anxiety disorders in early pregnancy,"Little is known about the association between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and anxiety disorders during pregnancy. We evaluated this association at the first pregnancy trimester in 228 women. The study endpoint was the diagnosis of any anxiety disorder assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The independent variables were the serum concentrations of total n-3 and fractions (18:2, 20:5, 22:5, 22:6), total n-6 and fractions (18:2, 18:3, 20:2, 20:3, 20:4, 22:4, 22:5) and the n-6/n-3 ratio PUFAs. The prevalence of any anxiety disorders was 25%. The first tertile of the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3) distribution represented 1.95 (95% CI: 1.00–3.77) higher chance of having an anxiety disorder diagnosis, compared to those in the second and third tertiles after adjusting the analyses for parity, family income, early pregnancy BMI and gestational age at the blood sampling. Serum concentrations of DHA were inversely associated with the occurrence of early pregnancy anxiety disorders.

Excoriation disorder: Impulsivity and its clinical associations,"Excoriation disorder is the repetitive scratching or picking of skin that leads to physical damage, distress, and functional impairment. Skin picking has been associated with impulsivity and problems with inhibition. We hypothesized that problems in these areas could be disease severity markers. We recruited 73 adults meeting DSM-5 criteria for excoriation disorder, and 50 adult controls. Those with excoriation disorder were categorized as either “high impulsive” (HI) or “low impulsive” (LI) using either a neurocognitive task of motor impulsivity (Stop Signal Task) or the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale's (BIS-11) motor impulsivity subscale. The HI subjects, based on the BIS-11, showed higher urges scores, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. These data suggest that impulsivity may reflect a specific clinical presentation among those with excoriation disorder, but the clinical characteristics differ depending upon the impulsivity measure used. Agreement on how to measure various domains of impulsivity may be important in better understanding the disorder psychopathology and so improve future treatments.

Short-term pain for long-term gain: The role of experiential avoidance in the relation between anxiety sensitivity and emotional distress,"Research has provided evidence of an interactive effect between anxiety sensitivity (AS) and experiential avoidance (EA) in predicting both anxiety and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptomatology. Additionally, theory suggests that EA alleviates distress in the short-term, but exacerbates it in the long-term. The present cross-sectional study was developed to replicate the noted findings and examine the interaction (EA×AS) in the context of an emotionally evocative task. It was predicted that, among high AS participants, high EA would (a) reduce the likelihood of experiencing short-term increases in negative affect following the task, and (b) increase the likelihood of anxiety and PTS symptomatology. Undergraduate participants ( N = 199) completed a battery of self-report questionnaires and an emotionally evocative task. As predicted, positive associations were observed between AS and both anxiety and PTS symptoms, but only among high EA participants. Additionally, AS only predicted increases in negative affect following the emotionally evocative task for those with lower levels of EA, thus providing empirical evidence of the affect regulatory function of EA among those who fear anxiety-related bodily sensations. These findings help to elucidate the motives for the use of avoidance among those high in AS. Conceptual and clinical implications are discussed.

"Parental involvement in youth anxiety treatment: Conceptual bases, controversies, and recommendations for intervention","Comments on an article by H. Breinholst et al. (see record 2012-06706-005). Parents are often perceived as a contributing or maintaining source of youth anxiety disorders, making them natural targets for either intervention or involvement in treatment protocols. Efforts to increase the efficacy and durability of standard treatments by incorporating parents have been successful, yet they often do not outperform child-focused treatment. Breinholst et al. (2012) review and discuss several overlooked parental research variables (anxiety, overcontrol, beliefs and assumptions, global family dysfunction) found to promote and maintain child anxiety. However, it remains unclear how these proposed variables interfere with active therapeutic ingredients (e.g., exposure) or how the identified problems might be addressed. We propose that insufficient attention to exposure-based treatment and family behavioral responses explain the comparatively low added value for parental involvement in child anxiety treatment and outline directions for research to address them. With meaningful attention being given to exposure and its accompanying variables in the treatment of childhood anxiety, we believe that treatment outcomes and intervention acceptability can be improved.

Language of perfectionistic parents predicting child anxiety diagnostic status,"Previous research has identified parental perfectionism as a risk factor for child anxiety. Yet few studies investigated why parental perfectionism may play such a role. Based on research suggesting parental verbal information and language use are associated with increased child fear beliefs and anxiety, the current study investigated the linguistic style of perfectionistic mothers and its relation to child anxiety. Participants were 71 mother–child dyads. Children were 3–12 years old, 57.7% female, and 30 were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Analyses showed that parental perfectionism was associated with increased second person pronouns, decreased adverbs, negative emotion words, and anger words. Second person pronouns and negative emotion words predicted child anxiety diagnostic status and mediated the relation between maternal perfectionism and child anxiety. These findings suggest that parental perfectionism may be associated with a specific language style that is related to child anxiety. Implications and future directions are discussed.

Test of an hypothesized structural model of the relationships between cognitive style and social anxiety: A 12-month prospective study,"The aim of this study was to test whether social looming cognitive style accounts for the predictive association between early maladaptive schema domains and social anxiety. We predicted that early maladaptive schema domains would predict the increase of social anxiety over time and that social looming would act as a mediator between schema domains and social anxiety. A three-wave longitudinal design was used. The participants ( N = 471, 56.95% women) were Spanish adolescents and young adults aged between 16 and 25 years old ( M age = 17.81, SD age = 3.19). The results showed that three schema domains (impaired autonomy and performance, impaired limits, and other-directedness) predicted the increase in social anxiety and that LCS for social threat acted as a mediator between other-directedness and social anxiety at T3. These results are important to improve the knowledge of the cognitive mechanisms that are involved in the occurrence and development of social anxiety.

The impact of alcohol use severity on anxiety treatment outcomes in a large effectiveness trial in primary care,"Objective: The presence of anxiety disorders is associated with poorer alcohol use disorder treatment outcomes, but little is known about the impact of alcohol use problems on anxiety disorder treatment outcomes despite their high comorbidity. The current study examined the impact of alcohol use symptom severity on anxiety disorder treatment outcomes in a multi-site primary care effectiveness study of anxiety disorder treatment. Method: Data came from the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) effectiveness trial. Participants ( N = 1004) were randomized to an evidence-based anxiety intervention (including cognitive behavioral therapy and medications) or usual care in primary care. Participants completed measures of alcohol use, anxiety, and depression at baseline, 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up periods. Patients with alcohol dependence were excluded. Results: There were no significant moderating (Treatment Group×Alcohol Use Severity) interactions. The majority of analyses revealed no predictive effects of alcohol use severity on outcome; however, alcohol problems at baseline were associated with somewhat higher anxiety and depression symptoms at the 18-month follow-up. Conclusions: These data indicate that patients with alcohol problems in primary care can be effectively treated for anxiety disorders. Baseline alcohol problems were associated with some poorer long-term outcomes, but this was evident across CALM and usual care. These findings provide preliminary evidence that there may be no need to postpone treatment of anxiety disorders until alcohol problems are addressed, at least among those who have mild to moderate alcohol problems. Replication with more severe alcohol use disorders is needed.

Perception matters for clinical perfectionism and social anxiety,"Despite research documenting a relationship between social anxiety and perfectionism, very little research has examined the relationship between social anxiety and clinical perfectionism, defined as the combination of high personal standards and high maladaptive perfectionistic evaluative concern. In the current studies we examined whether clinical perfectionism predicted social anxiety in a large sample of undergraduates ( N = 602), in a clinical sample of participants diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (SAD; N = 180), and by using a variance decomposition model of self- and informant-report of perfectionism ( N = 134). Using self-report, we found that an interaction of personal standards and evaluative concern predicted both social interaction anxiety and fear of scrutiny, but not in the theorized direction. Specifically, we found that self-report of low standards and high evaluative concern was associated with the highest levels of social anxiety, suggesting that when individuals with SAD hold low expectations for themselves combined with high concerns about evaluation, social anxiety symptoms may increase. Alternatively, when an informants’ perspective was considered, and more consistent with the original theory, we found that the interaction of informant-only report of personal standards and shared-report (between both primary participant and informant) of concern over mistakes was associated with self-reported social anxiety, such that high concern over mistakes and high personal standards predicted the highest levels of social anxiety. Theoretical, clinical, and measurement implications for clinical perfectionism are discussed.

Reliability and validity of the dimensional features of generalized anxiety disorder,"The reliability and validity of the dimensional features of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were examined in a diverse sample of 508 outpatients with anxiety and mood disorders who underwent two independent administrations of the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV : Lifetime version (ADIS-IV-L; Di Nardo, Brown, &amp; Barlow, 1994). Inter-rater reliability was higher in the full sample than in patients with current GAD. Additionally, the presence of a mood disorder weakened inter-rater reliability. We also explored the unique contribution of excessiveness and uncontrollability of worry to various clinical outcomes and found that excessiveness predicted anxiety, depression, and stress self-report measures, and uncontrollability predicted clinical severity and number of diagnoses. Findings are discussed with regard to their implications for the classification of GAD (e.g., utility of dimension-based assessment to improve the classification of psychological disorders).

"Social anxiety, acute social stress, and reward parameters interact to predict risky decision-making among adolescents","Risk-taking behavior increases during adolescence, leading to potentially disastrous consequences. Social anxiety emerges in adolescence and may compound risk-taking propensity, particularly during stress and when reward potential is high. However, the manner in which social anxiety, stress, and reward parameters interact to impact adolescent risk-taking is unclear. To clarify this question, a community sample of 35 adolescents (15–18 yo), characterized as having high or low social anxiety, participated in a study over two separate days, during each of which they were exposed to either a social stress or a control condition, while performing a risky decision-making task. The task manipulated, orthogonally, reward magnitude and probability across trials. Three findings emerged. First, reward magnitude had a greater impact on the rate of risky decisions in high social anxiety (HSA) than low social anxiety (LSA) adolescents. Second, reaction times (RTs) were similar during the social stress and the control conditions for the HSA group, whereas the LSA group's RTs differed between conditions. Third, HSA adolescents showed the longest RTs on the most negative trials. These findings suggest that risk-taking in adolescents is modulated by context and reward parameters differentially as a function of social anxiety.

Development of the pediatric accommodation scale: Reliability and validity of clinician- and parent-report measures,"The present study developed parallel clinician- and parent-rated measures of family accommodation (Pediatric Accommodation Scale, PAS; Pediatric Accommodation Scale-Parent Report; PAS-PR) for youth with a primary anxiety disorder. Both measures assess frequency and impact of family accommodation on youth and families. Studying youth ages 5–17 ( N = 105 caregiver-youth dyads), results provide evidence for the psychometric properties of the PAS, including internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, and convergent and discriminant validity. The PAS-PR exhibited good internal consistency and convergent validity with the PAS. Nearly all parents (&gt; 95%) endorsed some accommodation and accommodation frequency was associated with parent-rated impairment (home and school), and with youth-rated impairment (school only). Greater impact of accommodation on parents was associated with parent self-reported depressive symptoms. Findings support the common occurrence of family accommodation in youth with anxiety disorders, as well as for the use of the PAS and PAS-PR to measure family accommodation in this population.

Parental reactions to children's negative emotions: Relationships with emotion regulation in children with an anxiety disorder,"Research has demonstrated that parental reactions to children's emotions play a significant role in the development of children's emotion regulation (ER) and adjustment. This study compared parent reactions to children's negative emotions between families of anxious and non-anxious children (aged 7–12) and examined associations between parent reactions and children's ER. Results indicated that children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder had significantly greater difficulty regulating a range of negative emotions and were regarded as more emotionally negative and labile by their parents. Results also suggested that mothers of anxious children espoused less supportive parental emotional styles when responding to their children's negative emotions. Supportive and non-supportive parenting reactions to children's negative emotions related to children's emotion regulation skills, with father's non-supportive parenting showing a unique relationship to children's negativity/lability.

Does attention bias modification improve attentional control? A double-blind randomized experiment with individuals with social anxiety disorder,"People with anxiety disorders often exhibit an attentional bias for threat. Attention bias modification (ABM) procedure may reduce this bias, thereby diminishing anxiety symptoms. In ABM, participants respond to probes that reliably follow non-threatening stimuli (e.g., neutral faces) such that their attention is directed away from concurrently presented threatening stimuli (e.g., disgust faces). Early studies showed that ABM reduced anxiety more than control procedures lacking any contingency between valenced stimuli and probes. However, recent work suggests that no-contingency training and training toward threat cues can be as effective as ABM in reducing anxiety, implying that any training may increase executive control over attention, thereby helping people inhibit their anxious thoughts. Extending this work, we randomly assigned participants with DSM-IV diagnosed social anxiety disorder to either training toward non-threat (ABM), training toward threat, or no-contingency condition, and we used the attention network task (ANT) to assess all three components of attention. After two training sessions, subjects in all three conditions exhibited indistinguishably significant declines from baseline to post-training in self-report and behavioral measures of anxiety on an impromptu speech task. Moreover, all groups exhibited similarly significant improvements on the alerting and executive (but not orienting) components of attention. Implications for ABM research are discussed.

Internet-assisted delivery of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Aim: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to assess efficacy of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for child anxiety disorder. Method: A systematic search of 7 electronic databases was conducted to assess CBT intervention for children with anxiety problems with remote delivery either entirely or partly via technology. Six articles reporting 7 studies were included. Results: The findings together suggested that CBT programmes involving computerised elements were well received by children and their families, and its efficacy was almost as favourable as clinic-based CBT. The mixture of children and adolescents included the studies, diverse range of programmes, and lack of consistency between study designs made it difficult to identify key elements of these programmes or draw conclusions on the treatment efficacy. Conclusions: Analysis supports online delivery for wider access of this evidence-based therapy. Areas in need of improvement for this new method are indicated.

Evaluation of the Dimensions of Anger Reactions-5 (DAR-5) Scale in combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder,"After a traumatic event many people experience problems with anger which not only results in significant distress, but can also impede recovery. As such, there is value to include the assessment of anger in routine post-trauma screening procedures. The Dimensions of Anger Reactions-5 (DAR-5), as a concise measure of anger, was designed to meet such a need, its brevity minimizing the burden on client and practitioner. This study examined the psychometric properties of the DAR-5 with a sample of 163 male veterans diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. The DAR-5 demonstrated internal reliability (α = .86), along with convergent, concurrent and discriminant validity against a variety of established measures (e.g. HADS, PCL, STAXI). Support for the clinical cut-point score of 12 suggested by Forbes et al. (2014, Utility of the dimensions of anger reactions-5 (DAR-5) scale as a brief anger measure. Depression and Anxiety , 31, 166–173) was observed. The results support considering the DAR-5 as a preferred screening and assessment measure of problematic anger.

Psychometric properties of the child and parent versions of Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale in a Danish community and clinical sample,"This study examined the psychometric properties and norms of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) and the associated parent version (SCAS-P) in a Danish community and a clinical sample. The total sample consisted of 1240 children (972 from community sample), age 7–17 years, and 805 parents (537 from community sample). Results indicated that SCAS and SCAS-P had good internal consistency on the total scale and all subscales, with exception of the subscale for fear of physical injury. Both scales showed satisfactory 2-week and 3-month retest stability. All subscales and total scales of the SCAS and SCAS-P discriminated between the clinical and community sample. A comparison with the Beck Youth Inventories and the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire in the clinical sample supported the scales’ convergent and divergent validity. Results of confirmatory factor analyses for SCAS and SCAS-P were in favor of the original model with six correlated factors.

Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders: Are subscale scores reliable? A bifactor model analysis,"The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of creating and scoring subscales for the self-report version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) by examining whether subscale scores provide reliable information after accounting for a general anxiety factor in a bifactor model analysis. A total of 2420 children aged 9–18 answered the SCARED in their schools. Results suggested adequate fit of the bifactor model. The SCARED score variance was hardly influenced by the specific domains after controlling for the common variance in the general factor. The explained common variance (ECV) for the general factor was large (63.96%). After accounting for the general total score (ω h =.83), subscale scores provided very little reliable information (ω h ranged from .005 to .04). Practitioners that use the SCARED should be careful when scoring and interpreting the instrument subscales since there is more common variance to them than specific variance.

The impact of social skills training for social anxiety disorder: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) impacts social, occupational and academic functioning. Although many interventions report change in social distress, improvement in social behavior remains under-addressed. This investigation examined the additive impact of social skills training (SST) for the treatment of SAD. Method: Using a sample of 106 adults who endorsed SAD across numerous social settings, participants were randomized to exposure therapy (imaginal and in vivo) alone, a combination of SST and exposure therapy known as Social Effectiveness Therapy (SET), or a wait list control. The assessment strategy included self-report measures, blinded clinical ratings and blinded assessment of social behavior. Results: Both interventions significantly reduced distress in comparison to the wait list control and at post-treatment, 67% of patients treated with SET and 54% of patients treated with exposure therapy alone no longer met diagnostic criteria for SAD, a difference that was not statistically significant. When compared to exposure therapy alone, SET produced superior outcomes ( p &lt; .05) on measures of social skill and general clinical status. In addition to statistical significance, participants treated with SET or exposure reported clinically significant decreases on two measures of self-reported social anxiety and several measures of observed social behavior (all ps &lt; .05). Conclusions: Both interventions produced efficacious treatment outcome, although SET may provide additional benefit on measures of social distress and social behavior.

"The role of safety behaviors in exposure-based treatment for panic disorder and agoraphobia: Associations to symptom severity, treatment course, and outcome","The potentially detrimental effects of safety behaviors during exposure therapy are still subject to debate. Empirical findings are inconsistent, and few studies have investigated effects of idiosyncratic safety behavior manifestations during exposure or in everyday life. These limitations might be due to a lack of appropriate measures that address individual safety behaviors. We examined psychometric properties and predictive value of the Texas Safety Maneuver Scale (TSMS), a questionnaire specifically targeting safety behaviors in panic disorder and agoraphobia. Effects of safety behavior use, both during everyday life and during therapy, were examined using data from a multicenter RCT of N = 268 patients that aimed at evaluating efficacy and mechanisms of action of two variants of an exposure-based therapy. The TSMS total score demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.89), and it showed significant correlations with selected measures of baseline anxiety and impairment. The proposed factor structure could not be replicated. Frequent safety behavior use at baseline was associated with actual safety behavior during exposure exercises. Pronounced in-situ safety behavior, but not baseline safety behavior was associated to detrimental treatment outcome. The results underline the relevance of a rigorous safety behavior assessment in therapy. The actual relationship between safety behavior use and treatment outcome is yet to determine.

Autonomic effects of cognitive reappraisal and acceptance in social anxiety: Evidence for common and distinct pathways for parasympathetic reactivity,"Few studies investigated the effects of emotion regulation strategies on autonomic parameters in socially anxious individuals. We asked 99 socially anxious participants to give an impromptu speech in front of an audience in a virtual reality environment. In the anticipation phase, they practiced an emotion regulation strategy: negative functional reappraisal, acceptance, negative dysfunctional reappraisal. All strategies led to decreases in parasympathetic activity and increases in heart rate during anticipation. Parasympathetic activity remained low in the recovery phase, while heart rate increased, indicating a possible rebound effect of social performance. Exploratory moderation analysis revealed that for subjects with higher social anxiety, acceptance led to increased parasympathetic activity in the anticipation and recovery phases than negative functional reappraisal. Our results indicate that although globally parasympathetic reactivity seems to be a more general marker of simply attempting to regulate emotions, it could help distinguish between emotion regulation strategies for some participant subgroups.

"Parental accommodation of child anxiety and related symptoms: Range, impact, and correlates","Parental accommodation—i.e., changes in parents’ behavior in attempts to prevent or reduce child distress—has been most studied in relation to OCD. Although recent work suggests parents of children with non-OCD anxiety diagnoses also engage in accommodation, little is known about the specific forms, correlates, and associated interference of such accommodation. The present study examined the range and associated interference of parental accommodation behaviors using the newly developed Family Accommodation Checklist and Interference Scale (FACLIS) in a sample of the parents of 71 clinic-referred children with anxiety disorders ( N Mothers = 68; N Fathers = 51). The FACLIS demonstrated good reliability and validity. Ninety-seven percent of mothers and 88% of fathers reported engaging in at least one type of accommodation in the previous two weeks, with parents reporting an average of roughly 4 interfering parental accommodation behaviors. Greater parental accommodation and associated interference were associated with higher maternal distress. Among the anxiety disorders, accommodation was most strongly associated with generalized and separation anxiety disorder, as well as specific phobias. Findings (a) offer psychometric support for the FACLIS as a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of accommodation range and impact, and (b) help clarify the considerable scope and interference associated with parental accommodation of childhood anxiety.

Aversive learning and generalization predict subclinical levels of anxiety: A six-month longitudinal study,"The identification of premorbid markers of risk for psychopathology is one of the most important challenges for present-day psychiatric research. This study focuses on behavioral vulnerability factors that contribute to the development of anxiety. Little is known about the role of aversive learning and generalization in the development of pathological anxiety. In this study, a large student sample ( N = 375) completed a differential aversive learning task followed by a test of generalization. Anxiety was assessed at that moment and after a six-month follow-up. Results showed that both predictors (discrimination learning and generalization) added significantly to the explained variance in anxiety symptomatology at follow-up. These results highlight the importance of longitudinal designs and indicate that screening for individual differences in aversive learning and generalization may foster prediction of anxiety disorders, paving the way for targeted prevention.

Mediators of transdiagnostic group cognitive behavior therapy,"The efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety is well established. Investigations into the mechanisms of change in CBT report changes in cognitive vulnerabilities mediating improvements over the course of treatment. As anxiety disorders share certain risk factors, there is a trend toward CBT emphasizing these vulnerabilities, including negative affectivity (NA) and also more specific constructs such as anxiety sensitivity (AS) and intolerance of uncertainty (IU). The purpose of this investigation was to analyze potential mediators of anxiety reduction over the course of transdiagnostic group CBT. NA, AS, and IU all decreased over the course of treatment. Among the potential mediators, change in NA had a significant relationship with change in anxiety but change in AS and change in IU did not. Neither the main effect of primary diagnosis nor the interactions between potential mediators and primary diagnoses were significant, indicating that there were no differential changes in anxiety or the potential mediators across primary diagnoses. Results strongly point toward NA as an overarching mediator of anxiety reduction during transdiagnostic group CBT.

"Associations between anxiety disorders, suicide ideation, and age in nationally representative samples of Canadian and American adults","Suicidal behaviors are of significant concern for the individuals displaying such behavior and for service providers who encounter them. Using nationally representative samples of Canadian and American adults, we aimed to examine: whether age moderates the relationship between having any anxiety disorder and suicide ideation (SI), the prevalence of SI among younger and older adults, and whether age and individual anxiety disorders were differentially associated with SI. Age moderated the relationship between any anxiety disorder and SI among Americans only. Past-year SI was less prevalent among older, compared to younger, adults; though, nearly every anxiety disorder was associated with increased odds of SI among younger and older Canadian and American adults after controlling for covariates. Effect sizes were particularly large for older American adults, but were coupled with large confidence intervals. Findings contribute to a growing literature suggesting that SI in the context of anxiety is a highly prevalent and complex mental health problem across the adult lifespan.

Therapist-assisted internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy for depression and anxiety: Translating evidence into clinical practice,"This dissemination study examined the effectiveness of therapist-assisted Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) when offered in clinical practice. A centralized unit screened and coordinated ICBT delivered by newly trained therapists working in six geographically dispersed clinical settings. Using an open trial design, 221 patients were offered 12 modules of ICBT for symptoms of generalized anxiety ( n = 112), depression ( n = 83), or panic ( n = 26). At baseline, midpoint and post-treatment, patients completed self-report measures. On average, patients completed 8 of 12 modules. Latent growth curve modeling identified significant reductions in depression, anxiety, stress and impairment ( d = .65–.78), and improvements in quality of life ( d =.48–.66). Improvements in primary symptoms were large ( d = .91–1.25). Overall, therapist-assisted ICBT was effective when coordinated across settings in clinical practice, but further attention should be given to strategies to improve completion of treatment modules.

Measuring anxiety in late life: A psychometric examination of the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory and Geriatric Anxiety Scale,"We examined the psychometric properties, internal scale reliability and validity, of two geriatric anxiety measures: the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) and Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS). We also determined the extent to which memory ability influenced the psychometric properties of these measures. Older adult participants ( N = 110; M age = 75 years) completed self-report, clinician-rated and diagnostic psychiatric measures and a neuropsychiatric battery. GAI and GAS scores had good internal consistency, adequate reliability, and strong convergent validity. GAI scores had better discriminant validity than GAS scores relative to a health rating. Both measures had strong associations with depression scores. Psychometric properties were decreased in participants with average delayed memory recall compared with those with superior recall. Both measures had good psychometric support, particularly in those with strong memory abilities. Psychometric performance characteristics indicate that the GAI and GAS may be good alternatives to anxiety measures not designed specifically for older adults.

Predictors of CBT outcome in older adults with GAD,"The current study is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of CBT for late-life GAD (Stanley et al., 2014) which provided an opportunity to examine predictors of outcome among those who received CBT. Participants were 150 older adults who were randomized to receive 10 sessions of CBT. Completer analyses found that homework completion, number of sessions attended, lower worry severity, lower depression severity, and recruitment site predicted 6-month worry outcome on the PSWQ-A, whereas homework completion, credibility of the therapy, lower anxiety severity, and site predicted 6-month anxiety outcome on the STAI-T. In intent-to-treat multivariate analyses, however, only initial worry and anxiety severity, site, and number of sessions completed predicted treatment outcome. These results are largely consistent with predictors of outcome in younger adults and suggest that lower initial symptom severity and variables consistent with greater engagement in treatment predict outcome.

Can parent training for parents with high levels of expressed emotion have a positive effect on their child's social anxiety improvement?,"The role that parents’ involvement may play in improving their child's social anxiety is still under debate. This paper aimed to investigate whether training parents with high expressed emotion (EE) could improve outcomes for adolescent social anxiety intervention. Fifty-two socially anxious adolescents (aged 13–18 years), whose parents exhibited high levels of expressed emotion, were assigned to either (a) a school-based intervention with an added parent training component, or (b) a school-based program focused solely on intervening with the adolescent (no parental involvement). Post-treatment and 12-month follow-up findings showed that school-based intervention with parent training was superior to the adolescent-specific program, yielding significant reductions in diagnosis remission, social and depressive symptomatology, particularly when the EE status of parents changed. Overall, the findings suggest that high-EE parents of children with social anxiety need to be involved in their child's therapy.

"The Short Form of the Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised (FSSC-R-SF): An efficient, reliable, and valid scale for measuring fear in children and adolescents","The present study examined the psychometric properties of the Short Form of the Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised (FSSC-R-SF) in non-clinical and clinically referred children and adolescents from the Netherlands and the United States. Exploratory as well as confirmatory factor analyses of the FSSC-R-SF yielded support for the hypothesized five-factor structure representing fears in the domains of (1) failure and criticism, (2) the unknown, (3) animals, (4) danger and death, and (5) medical affairs. The FSSC-R-SF showed satisfactory reliability and was capable of assessing gender and age differences in youths’ fears and fearfulness that have been documented in previous research. Further, the convergent validity of the scale was good as shown by substantial and meaningful correlations with the full-length FSSC-R and alternative childhood anxiety measures. Finally, support was found for the discriminant validity of the scale. That is, clinically referred children and adolescents exhibited higher scores on the FSSC-R-SF total scale and most subscales as compared to their non-clinical counterparts. Moreover, within the clinical sample, children and adolescents with a major anxiety disorder generally displayed higher FSSC-R-SF scores than youths without such a diagnosis. Altogether, these findings indicate that the FSSC-R-SF is a brief, reliable, and valid scale for assessing fear sensitivities in children and adolescents.

Inattention symptoms and the diagnosis of comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder among youth with generalized anxiety disorder,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) commonly co-occur in childhood. Inattention symptoms can be hallmarks of both conditions, however assessment tools of inattention may not effectively distinguish between the two conditions. The present study used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses to examine the high-end specificity of the Attention Problems Scale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for detecting comorbid ADHD among youth with GAD ( N = 46). Results support the utility of the Attention Problems Scale for accurately distinguishing between the two groups (AUC = .84, SE = .06). Specifically, a cut score of 63 achieved the most favorable values across diagnostic utility indices; 74% of GAD youth with ADHD scored above this cutoff and 91% of GAD youth without ADHD scored below this cutoff. Findings provide support for the use of the CBCL Attention Problems Scale to supplement diagnostic interviews and identify inattention associated with ADHD among GAD youth.

Interpretation bias modification for youth and their parents: A novel treatment for early adolescent social anxiety,"Social anxiety is the most prevalent anxiety disorder of late adolescence, yet current treatments reach only a minority of youth with the disorder. Effective and easy-to-disseminate treatments are needed. This study pilot tested the efficacy of a novel, online cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) intervention for socially anxious youth and their parents. The CBM-I intervention targeted cognitive biases associated with early adolescents’ maladaptive beliefs regarding social situations, and with parents’ intrusive behavior, both of which have been theoretically linked with the maintenance of social anxiety in youth. To investigate the efficacy of intervening with parents and/or children, clinically diagnosed early adolescents (ages 10–15; N = 18) and their mothers were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: the first targeted early adolescents’ cognitive biases related to social anxiety (Child-only condition); the second targeted parents’ biases associated with intrusive behavior (Parent-only condition); and the third targeted both youth and parents’ biases in tandem (Combo condition). The use of a multiple baseline design allowed for the efficient assessment of causal links between the intervention and reduction in social anxiety symptoms in youth. Results provided converging evidence indicating modest support for the efficacy of CBM-I, with no reliable differences across conditions. Taken together, results suggest that online CBM-I with anxious youth and/or their parents holds promise as an effective and easily administered component of treatment for child social anxiety that deserves further evaluation in a larger trial.

Experience sampling and ecological momentary assessment for studying the daily lives of patients with anxiety disorders: A systematic review,"Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent. Symptoms may occur unpredictably (e.g., panic attacks) or predictably in specific situations (e.g., social phobia). Consequently, it may be difficult to assess anxiety and related constructs realistically in the laboratory or by traditional retrospective questionnaires. Experience sampling methods (ESM) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) can deepen the understanding of the course of anxiety disorders by frequently assessing symptoms and other variables in the natural environment. We review 34 ESM/EMA studies on adult panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder, as well as anxiety disorders in youth. Benefits of ESM/EMA for the study of anxiety disorders include generating insight into the temporal variability of symptoms and into the associations among daily affect, behaviors, and situational cues. Further, ESM/EMA has been successfully combined with ambulatory assessment of physiological variables and with treatment evaluations. We provide suggestions for future research, as well as for clinical applications.

"The relationships among separation anxiety disorder, adult attachment style and agoraphobia in patients with panic disorder","Epidemiological studies indicate that separation anxiety disorder occurs more frequently in adults than children. It is unclear whether the presence of adult separation anxiety disorder (ASAD) is a manifestation of anxious attachment, or a form of agoraphobia, or a specific condition with clinically significant consequences. We conducted a study to examine these questions. A sample of 141 adult outpatients with panic disorder participated in the study. Participants completed standardized measures of separation anxiety, attachment style, agoraphobia, panic disorder severity and quality of life. Patients with ASAD (49.5% of our sample) had greater panic symptom severity and more impairment in quality of life than those without separation anxiety. We found a greater rate of symptoms suggestive of anxious attachment among panic patients with ASAD compared to those without ASAD. However, the relationship between ASAD and attachment style is not strong, and adult ASAD occurs in some patients who report secure attachment style. Similarly, there is little evidence for the idea that separation anxiety disorder is a form of agoraphobia. Factor analysis shows clear differentiation of agoraphobic and separation anxiety symptoms. Our data corroborate the notion that ASAD is a distinct condition associated with impairment in quality of life and needs to be better recognized and treated in patients with panic disorder.

Is there a common pathway to developing ASD and PTSD symptoms?,"Numerous studies have identified risk factors for acute and long-term posttraumatic stress symptoms following traumatic exposure. However, little is known about whether there are common pathways to the development of acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Research suggests that a common path to ASD and PTSD may lie in peritraumatic responses and cognitions. The results of structural equation modeling in a national sample of Danish bank robbery victims ( N = 450) show that peritraumatic panic, anxiety sensitivity, and negative cognitions about self were significant common risk factors for both ASD severity and PTSD severity when controlled for the effect of the other risk factors. The strongest common risk factor was negative cognitions about self. Future research should focus on replicating these results as they point to possible areas of preventive and treatment actions against the development of traumatic stress symptoms.

Developmental pathways of social avoidance across adolescence: The role of social anxiety and negative cognition,"It is argued that the adolescent onset of social anxiety disorder (SAD) may be partly attributable to an increase in avoidance of social situations across this period. The current cohort-sequential study investigated developmental pathways of social avoidance in adolescence and examined the explanatory role of social anxiety and negative cognitive processes. A community sample of youth (9–21 years, N = 331) participated in a four-wave study. Trajectory analyses revealed two pathways: an increased avoidance pathway and a low avoidance pathway. The pathways were hardly distinguishable at age 9 and they steadily diverged across adolescence. Logistic regression analyses showed that social anxiety and post-event rumination were significantly related to the increased avoidance pathway; anticipatory processing and self-focused attention were not. The findings suggest that adolescence is a key developmental period for the progression of social avoidance among youth who show relatively high levels of social anxiety and post-event rumination.

Disseminating treatment for anxiety disorders: Step 1: Recognizing the problem as a precursor to seeking help,"Untreated mental illness is a substantial public health issue in the United States, with only approximately 1/3 of the estimated 46 million adults in the US with mental illness receiving treatment. Many of the individuals with mental illness suffer from excessive anxiety, as over 25% of Americans experience an anxiety disorder during their lifetime and most of these individuals remain untreated. Building from the premise that recognizing one's symptoms precedes requests for help, the current paper presents data from 577 adults (50% Caucasian, 50% African American) in the US regarding their ability to recognize anxiety disorders. Findings from a national survey showed that when presented with detailed vignettes portraying symptoms and their impact, 50% of respondents correctly recognized depression, whereas less than 20% correctly recognized the anxiety disorders. Recognition that the symptoms were a cause for concern was much more common, with 75% or more of the sample noting concern. Responses were surprisingly similar across the two races, and few consistent moderators were found. In conclusion, increasing recognition of anxiety disorders may be a useful first step toward increasing service utilization.

Implicit affective evaluation bias in hypochondriasis: Findings from the Affect Misattribution Procedure,"Cognitive theories of hypochondriasis (HYP) suggest that catastrophic misinterpretations of benign body sensations are a core feature for the maintenance of the disorder. There is tentative support from an analog sample that the interpretation of illness-related information also involves an implicit affective component. This is the first study to examine this negative affective evaluation bias implicitly in patients with HYP. An adapted version of the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) with illness, symptom and neutral primes was used in 80 patients with HYP, and compared to 83 patients with an anxiety disorder (AD), as well as 90 healthy controls (CG). The HYP group showed significantly more negative affective reactions in illness prime trials, compared to both control groups, as well as more negative implicit evaluations on symptom prime trials, compared to the CG. Significant inverse relationships were observed only between the implicit evaluations of illness words and health anxiety questionnaires. Thus, an implicit negative affective evaluation bias of serious illnesses rather than symptoms is a unique feature of HYP.

Parental changes after involvement in their anxious child's cognitive behavior therapy,"Objective: Specific parental behaviors and cognitions are associated with child anxiety. Studies informing us of the directionality of the associations are lacking. We investigated the effect of parental involvement in children's anxiety treatment on parental behaviors and cognitions. Method: Children ( N = 54, 7–12 years) and parents were randomly allocated to different treatment groups (involved, not involved). Observed behavior, self-reported behavior and cognitions were assessed separately for mothers and fathers at pre-, posttreatment and follow-up. Results: There were no differences over time for self-reported parental efficacy and observed negativity, but self-reported autonomy granting increased for both groups over time. Differential effects were found between groups for observed paternal over-involvement (fathers involved in treatment showed a more rapid decrease) and self-reported maternal autonomy-granting (non-involved mothers showed a greater increase). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that child anxiety significantly influences parental behaviors and cognitions. Child therapy may successfully change the family system.

Aversive responding to safety signals in panic disorder: The moderating role of intolerance of uncertainty,"An inability to inhibit aversive responding during conditions that signal safety may be a core dysfunction associated with anxiety disorders. However, there has been inconsistent evidence as to whether individuals with panic disorder (PD) exhibit aversive responding during safety signals. It is therefore possible that only certain subgroups of PD patients, particularly those with high levels of intolerance of uncertainty (IU), evidence this type of abnormal responding. The aim of the current study was to examine whether IU moderates the association between PD and startle potentiation during (a) safety and (b) threat periods during a threat-of-shock task. Participants included 172 adults, 74 of which had current diagnoses of PD. Results indicated that at high levels of IU, PD was associated with greater startle potentiation during safety. At low levels of IU, PD was not associated with startle potentiation during safety. IU did not moderate the effect of PD on threat responding. These results suggest that PD patients with high levels of IU fail to inhibit aversive responding during safety, possibly due to a tendency to interpret distal threat as distressing.

Disseminating treatment for anxiety disorders step 2: Peer recommendations to seek help,"Despite the high prevalence of and significant psychological burden caused by anxiety disorders, as few as 25% of individuals with these disorders seek treatment, and treatment seeking by African-Americans is particularly uncommon. This purpose of the current study was to gather information regarding the public's recommendations regarding help-seeking for several anxiety disorders and to compare Caucasian and African-American participants on these variables. A community sample of 577 US adults completed a telephone survey that included vignettes portraying individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia/social anxiety disorder (SP/SAD), panic disorder (PD), and for comparison, depression. The sample was ½ Caucasian and ½ African American. Respondents were significantly less likely to recommend help-seeking for SP/SAD and GAD (78.8% and 84.3%, respectively) than for depression (90.9%). In contrast, recommendations to seek help for panic disorder were common (93.6%) and similar to rates found for depression. The most common recommendations were to seek help from a primary care physician (PCP). African Americans were more likely to recommend help-seeking for GAD than Caucasians. Findings suggested that respondents believed individuals with anxiety disorders should seek treatment. Given that respondents often recommended consulting a PCP, we recommend educating PCPs about anxiety disorders and empirically-supported interventions.

Genetic and environmental contributions to social anxiety across different ages: A meta-analytic approach to twin data,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and social anxiety symptoms (SAS) have been largely studied both epidemiologically and genetically, however, estimates of genetic and environmental influences for these phenotypes widely vary across reports. Based upon available literature, 13 cohorts (42,585 subjects) were included in 3 meta-analytic estimates of the standardized variance components of aetiological influences on SAD/SAS, on the effect of age and of phenotype (symptoms vs. diagnosis). The proportions of variance accounted for by genetic and environmental factors were calculated by averaging estimates among studies, and pondered by the number of individuals in each sample. Meta-analytic estimations showed that genetic and non-shared environmental factors explain most of individual differences for SAD/SAS. In adults, the genetic contribution was half than that in younger patients, with higher contribution of non-shared environmental influences. In contrast, the shared environmental factors seem to be less relevant.

Cortical surface anatomy in pediatric patients with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: It is established that pediatric patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) exhibit functional abnormalities and altered gray matter volumes in neural structures that subserve emotional processing, yet there are no data regarding the surface anatomy of the cerebral cortex in youth with GAD. Methods: Using an automated surface-based approach (FreeSurfer), cortical thickness was assessed node-by-node over the entire cerebral cortex in adolescents with GAD and no co-occurring major depressive disorder ( n = 13) and healthy subjects ( n = 19). Results: Compared with healthy adolescents, youth with GAD exhibited increased cortical thickness in the right inferolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( i.e. , inferior frontal gyrus), the left inferior and middle temporal cortex as well as the right lateral occipital cortex. No relationships were observed between cortical thickness and the severity of anxiety symptoms in the significant regions that were identified in the vertex-wise analysis. Conclusions: These findings suggest that, in adolescents with GAD, abnormalities in cortical thickness are present in an ensemble of regions responsible for fear learning, fear extinction, reflective functioning ( e.g. , mentalization), and regulation of the amygdala.

Clinical implications of panic symptoms in dental phobia,"The occurrence of panic symptoms in various anxiety disorders has been associated with more severely impaired and difficult-to-treat cases, but this has not been investigated in dental phobia. We examined the clinical implications of panic symptoms related to sub-clinical and clinically significant dental phobia. The sample consisted of 61 patients at a university dental clinic who endorsed symptoms of dental phobia, 25 of whom met criteria for a formal diagnosis of dental phobia. Participants with dental phobia endorsed more panic symptoms than did those with sub-clinical dental phobia. In the total sample, greater endorsement of panic symptoms was associated with higher dental anxiety, more avoidance of dental procedures, and poorer oral health-related quality of life. Among those with dental phobia, certain panic symptoms exhibited associations with specific anxiety-eliciting dental procedures. Panic symptoms may serve as indicators of clinically significant dental phobia and the need for augmented treatment.

The results indicated that neither solution produce an adequate fit to the data in this study. We then proceeded to conduct an exploratory factor analysis within a confirmatory framework of both scales. While we were able to extract a 2-factor solution from the data, the item composition of the factors was somewhat different for African Americans than what is typically reported in non-Hispanic White samples. While we conclude that use of the two social anxiety scales is warranted, we make recommendations regarding the interpretation of both scales with African Americans.

Identification of anxiety sensitivity classes and clinical cut-scores in a sample of adult smokers: Results from a factor mixture model,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS), a multidimensional construct, has been implicated in the development and maintenance of anxiety and related disorders. Recent evidence suggests that AS is a dimensional-categorical construct within individuals. Factor mixture modeling was conducted in a sample of 579 adult smokers ( M age = 36.87 years, SD = 13.47) to examine the underlying structure. Participants completed the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 and were also given a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR. Three classes of individuals emerged, a high AS (5.2% of the sample), a moderate AS (19.0%), and a normative AS class (75.8%). A cut-score of 23 to identify high AS individuals, and a cut-score of 17 to identify moderate-to-high AS individuals were supported in this study. In addition, the odds of having a concurrent anxiety disorder (controlling for other Axis I disorders) were the highest in the high AS class and the lowest in the normative AS class.

An investigation into the lower peer liking of anxious than nonanxious children,"Peer dislike of anxious behaviour was investigated in 7–12 year olds. Child actors delivered an identical verbal presentation: once in an anxious manner and once confidently. The videos were rated for liking and seven potential mediators by three groups of children: 32 anxiety-disordered peers with social phobia; 16 anxiety-disordered peers without social phobia; and 48 nonclinical peers. A mediation model with moderation effects was tested within a within-subjects framework. “Anxious” actors were liked significantly less than “confident” actors. This effect differed by group rater, in that relative dislike of the anxious actor was significantly greater for the nonclinical than socially phobic raters. Physical attractiveness and friend acceptance mediated the effect for all group raters. Other identified mediators differed depending upon the group rater. The findings direct future efforts to help anxiety-disordered children circumvent an increased risk of negative peer relations, and testify to consideration of the rater in sociometric studies.

How is the Beads Task related to intolerance of uncertainty in anxiety disorders?,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a cognitive bias associated with anxiety disorders that has only been reliably measured using self-report instruments. The current study investigated relationships between a probabilistic inference task—the Beads Task—and self-report IU. Individuals with anxiety disorders (ANX) and non-anxious controls (NAC) completed self-report measures as well as the Beads Task at three levels of difficulty. The Beads Task successfully induced task-related uncertainty as the decision became more difficult. While the two groups did not differ on the observable performance related measures, the ANX group was significantly more distressed during the task than were the NACs. Moreover, among the ANX group, self-reported IU was correlated with draws to decision and distress during the task. The Beads Task appears to provoke distress associated with uncertainty for anxious individuals, rather than altering their behavioral responses; thus, clinical implications and avenues for future research are discussed.

The Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS): An examination of structure and relations with health anxiety in a community sample,"McElroy and Shevlin (2014) developed the 33-item Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS) to allow for a multidimensional assessment of cyberchondria (compulsion, distress, excessiveness, reassurance, and mistrust of medical professional). The present study evaluated psychometric properties of the CSS, including its factor structure, internal consistency, convergent validity, and incremental validity, using a large sample of community adults located in the United States ( N = 539). Results from a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the adequacy of the five-factor structure of the CSS. However, results from a higher-order CFA indicated that the mistrust of medical professional factor does not assess the same construct as the other factors of the CSS. The CSS scales evidenced adequate internal consistency and significantly correlated with health anxiety. The distress, excessiveness, and mistrust of medical professional scales correlated significantly more strongly with health anxiety than obsessive–compulsive symptoms and these three scales were the only CSS scales to share unique variance with health anxiety. Implications of these results for future research are discussed.

The impact of cognitive restructuring and mindfulness strategies on postevent processing and affect in social anxiety disorder,"Postevent processing (PEP; reviewing a past social event in detail) is a key maintenance factor of social anxiety disorder (SAD). The current study examined the efficacy of a single session cognitive restructuring or mindfulness strategy on decreasing PEP and its associated effects, and investigated the cognitive processes involved. Fifty-six individuals with SAD completed a speech task to elicit PEP and were taught a cognitive restructuring, mindfulness, or control strategy to manage their negative thoughts. Participants in the cognitive restructuring and mindfulness conditions reported significantly reduced PEP and improved affect as compared to the control condition. There were no significant differences between the cognitive restructuring and mindfulness conditions. Participants in the cognitive restructuring condition reported decreased probability and cost biases. Regardless of study condition, decreases in cost biases and maladaptive beliefs significantly predicted reductions in PEP. Cognitive restructuring and mindfulness appear to be promising strategies to decrease PEP and improve affect.

Testing a procedural variant of written imaginal exposure for generalized anxiety disorder,"This experiment examined the degree to which it is more beneficial for individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) to engage in repeated exposure to mental imagery of the same feared scenario versus varying the exposure content. On three consecutive days, individuals with GAD ( N = 57) spent 20min writing about: (1) the same worst case scenario (consistent exposure; CE), (2) variations of their worst case scenario (varied exposure; VE), or (3) a neutral topic (neutral control; NC). Participants in the CE condition displayed significant decreases in worry, acute cognitive avoidance, and intolerance of uncertainty from baseline to 1-week follow-up; participants in the VE and NC conditions did not. Initial activation of self-reported anxiety (observed in the CE and VE conditions) and between-session reduction in anxiety (observed in the CE condition only) were associated with improvement in worry. Including more references to negative emotion and writing in the present tense were also associated with greater improvement in worry in the CE condition. These findings suggest that writing repeatedly about the same worst case scenario may benefit people with GAD. The study also provides information on potential mechanisms of change.

Psychotropic drug utilization in children with concurrent attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and anxiety,"This study aims to describe concurrent ADHD and anxiety treatment in clinical practice. It also explores potential reasons for variations in treatment, such as socio-demographic and geographic characteristics. Pharmacotherapeutic regimens containing ADHD medications are the most common regimen for children with ADHD and anxiety. Antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics, and specifically sertraline and risperidone, are utilized as the most common non-ADHD therapies in this pediatric Medicaid population. Significant treatment differences of combination pharmacotherapy exist across gender, age, race, foster care, disability and povertybased subgroups and among study states. The understanding of the origins of the treatment differences and how they relate to best practices warrants further investigation. Comparative safety and effectiveness studies of psychotropic drug combinations for the treatment of ADHD with anxiety, and evaluation of long-term benefits and risks of combination pharmacotherapy are needed to promote evidence-based practice for this common comorbidity pairing.

The trajectories of adolescent anxiety and depressive symptoms over the course of a transdiagnostic treatment,"Anxiety and depressive disorders commonly co-occur during adolescence, share multiple vulnerability factors, and respond to similar psychosocial and pharmacological interventions. However, anxiety and depression may also be considered distinct constructs and differ on some underlying properties. Prior research efforts on evidence-based treatments for youth have been unable to examine the concurrent trajectories of primary anxiety and depressive concerns across the course of treatment. The advent of transdiagnostic approaches for these emotional disorders in youth allows for such examination. The present study examined the separate trajectories of adolescent anxiety and depressive symptoms over the course of a transdiagnostic intervention, the Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescence (UP-A; Ehrenreich et al., 2008), as well as up to six months following treatment. The sample included 59 adolescents ages 12–17 years old ( M = 15.42, SD = 1.71) who completed at least eight sessions of the UP-A as part of an open trial or randomized, controlled trial across two treatment sites. Piecewise latent growth curve analyses found adolescent self-rated anxiety and depressive symptoms showed similar rates of improvement during treatment, but while anxiety symptoms continued to improve during follow-up, depressive symptoms showed non-significant improvement after treatment. Parent-rated symptoms also showed similar rates of improvement for anxiety and depression during the UP-A to those observed for adolescent self-report, but little improvement after treatment across either anxiety or depressive symptoms. To a certain degree, the results mirror those observed among other evidence-based treatments for youth with anxiety and depression, though results hold implications for future iterations of transdiagnostic treatments regarding optimization of outcomes for adolescents with depressive symptoms.

Implicit associations in social anxiety disorder: The effects of comorbid depression,"Implicit associations of the self to concepts like “calm” have been shown to be weaker in persons with social anxiety than in non-anxious healthy controls. However, other implicit self associations, such as those to acceptance or rejection, have been less studied in social anxiety, and none of this work has been conducted with clinical samples. Furthermore, the importance of depression in these relationships has not been well investigated. We addressed these issues by administering two Implicit Association Tests (IATs; Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998), one examining the implicit association of self/other to anxiety/calmness and the other examining the association of self/other to rejection/acceptance, to individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD, n = 85), individuals with generalized SAD and a current or past diagnosis of major depressive disorder or current dysthymic disorder ( n = 47), and non-anxious, non-depressed healthy controls ( n = 44). The SAD and SAD-depression groups showed weaker implicit self-calmness associations than healthy controls, with the comorbid group showing the weakest self-calmness associations. The SAD-depression group showed the weakest implicit self-acceptance associations; no difference was found between non-depressed individuals with SAD and healthy controls. Post hoc analyses revealed that differences appeared to be driven by those with current depression. The SAD-only and SAD-depression groups did not differ in self-reported (explicit) social anxiety. The implications of these findings for the understanding of SAD-depression comorbidity and for the treatment of SAD are considered.

Acceptance and commitment therapy for anxiety and OCD spectrum disorders: An empirical review,"A fair amount of research exists on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) as a model and a treatment for anxiety disorders and OCD spectrum disorders; this paper offers a quantitative account of this research. A meta-analysis is presented examining the relationship between psychological flexibility, measured by versions of the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ and AAQ-II) and measures of anxiety. Meta-analytic results showed positive and significant relationships between the AAQ and general measures of anxiety as well as disorder specific measures. Additionally, all outcome data to date on ACT for anxiety and OCD spectrum disorders are reviewed, as are data on mediation and moderation within ACT. Preliminary meta-analytic results show that ACT is equally effective as manualized treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Future directions and limitations of the research are discussed.

Beyond generalized anxiety disorder: Psychometric properties of the GAD-7 in a heterogeneous psychiatric sample,"Background: Although developed as a screener for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in primary care, the GAD-7 is now commonly used as a measure of general anxiety symptoms across various settings and populations. However, little is known about its psychometric properties when used in such heterogeneous samples. We examined the internal consistency, convergent validity, sensitivity and specificity, sensitivity to change, and structure of the GAD-7 in patients receiving brief, intensive CBT treatment in a partial hospital setting. We also examined the properties of a modified version that assessed symptoms over the past 24-h. Methods: Participants ( n =1082) completed the GAD-7 upon admission and discharge from a partial hospital program. They also completed measures of worry, depression, and well being and a structured diagnostic interview. We examined psychometric properties in the total sample and separately for patients with GAD, post-traumatic stress disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), and panic disorder. Results: Internal consistency and convergent validity were good for the total sample and each anxiety disorder group. The GAD-7 demonstrated poor specificity and a high false positive rate for all anxiety disorders. Sensitivity to change was generally good. Factor analysis revealed that a one-factor structure did not fit the data well. The 24-h version performed similarly to the original version. Conclusions: The GAD-7 performed well as a measure of anxiety symptom severity, but not as a screener in this psychiatric sample. It is a useful outcome measure for hetereogenous samples, but it may not perform as well specifically for individuals with SAD. A modified version of the GAD-7 that assessed anxiety symptoms over the past 24-h appears to be a reliable and valid modification.

Virtual reality exposure therapy for the treatment of anxiety disorders: An evaluation of research quality,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) support the effectiveness of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) for anxiety disorders; however, the overall quality of the VRET RCT literature base has yet to be evaluated. This study reviewed 27 VRET RCTs and the degree of adherence to 8 RCT research design criteria derived from existing standards. Adherence to the study quality criteria was generally low as the articles met an average 2.85 criteria (SD = 1.56). None of the studies met more than six quality criteria. Study quality did not predict effect size; however, a reduction in effect size magnitude was observed for studies with larger sample sizes when comparing VRET to non-active control groups. VRET may be an effective method of treatment but caution should be exercised in interpreting the existing body of literature supporting VRET relative to existing standards of care. The need for well-designed VRET research is discussed.

Psychometric properties of the Brazilian-Portuguese version of the Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS): Self- and parent-report versions,"This study examined the psychometric properties of the Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS) self-and parent-report versions in a community ( n = 712) and a clinical ( n = 70) sample of Brazilian children and adolescents. Confirmatory factor analysis conducted in the community sample provided support to the original six correlated factors model of the SCAS. Moreover, the SCAS demonstrated good internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity, and a significant informant effect on the total score with higher anxiety levels in the self-report than in the parent-report version. Considering the clinical sample, we could demonstrate that the SCAS total scores have good discriminant validity differentiating: (a) anxious, community, and negative screening groups; and (b) children diagnosed with different severity levels of anxiety disorders. Our findings suggest that the SCAS (self- and parent-report versions) is suitable for assessing anxiety symptoms in Brazilian children and adolescents in community and clinical settings.

“But it might be a heart attack”: Intolerance of uncertainty and panic disorder symptoms,"Panic disorder models describe interactions between feared anxiety-related physical sensations (i.e., anxiety sensitivity; AS) and catastrophic interpretations therein. Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has been implicated as necessary for catastrophic interpretations in community samples. The current study examined relationships between IU, AS, and panic disorder symptoms in a clinical sample. Participants had a principal diagnosis of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia ( n = 132; 66% women). IU was expected to account for significant variance in panic symptoms controlling for AS. AS was expected to mediate the relationship between IU and panic symptoms, whereas IU was expected to moderate the relationship between AS and panic symptoms. Hierarchical linear regressions indicated that IU accounted for significant unique variance in panic symptoms relative to AS, with comparable part correlations. Mediation and moderation models were also tested and suggested direct and indirect effects of IU on panic symptoms through AS; however, an interaction effect was not supported. The current cross-sectional evidence supports a role for IU in panic symptoms, independent of AS.

Avoidance mediates the relationship between anxiety and depression over a decade later,"Anxiety and depression are often highly correlated with each other. To explain this connection, the present study examined the longitudinal relationship between earlier anxiety and later depression, using avoidance as a mediator and trauma as a moderator. Participants ( N = 6504 adolescents) completed baseline measures of anxiety and depression, a measure of avoidance one year later, a measure of trauma six to eight years later, and a measure of depression 12–14 years later. Analyzed with structural equation models, the results showed that anxiety predicted later depression, and this relationship was partially mediated by avoidance. The relationship between avoidance and depression was not moderated by trauma. Together, these findings suggest that anxiety may influence later depression through avoidance, and this relationship remains unaffected by experiencing a traumatic experience.

Mild to severe social fears: Ranking types of feared social situations using item response theory,"Social anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental disorders, and is associated with long term impairment, distress and vulnerability to secondary disorders. Certain types of social fears are more common than others, with public speaking fears typically the most prevalent in epidemiological surveys. The distinction between performance- and interaction-based fears has been the focus of long-standing debate in the literature, with evidence performance-based fears may reflect more mild presentations of social anxiety. This study aims to explicitly test whether different types of social fears differ in underlying social anxiety severity using item response theory techniques. Different types of social fears were assessed using items from three different structured diagnostic interviews in four different epidemiological surveys in the United States ( n = 2261, n = 5411) and Australia ( n = 1845, n = 1497); and ranked using 2-parameter logistic item response theory models. Overall, patterns of underlying severity indicated by different fears were consistent across the four samples with items functioning across a range of social anxiety. Public performance fears and speaking at meetings/classes indicated the lowest levels of social anxiety, with increasing severity indicated by situations such as being assertive or attending parties. Fears of using public bathrooms or eating, drinking or writing in public reflected the highest levels of social anxiety. Understanding differences in the underlying severity of different types of social fears has important implications for the underlying structure of social anxiety, and may also enhance the delivery of social anxiety treatment at a population level.

Genetic and environmental causes of variation in adolescent anxiety symptoms: A multiple-rater twin study,"Heritability estimates for adolescent anxiety vary across studies, partly depending on who is rating the symptoms. The goal of our study was to estimate genetic and environmental influences using a multi-informant design with responses from a population-based sample of adolescent twins, their mothers and their fathers (N =1394 families). Results from multivariate biometrical modeling indicated quantitative, but no qualitative sex differences in etiology. The best fitting model was an AE Common Pathway model, defining anxiety as a latent factor common to all informants. This model offers error free estimates of genetic and environmental influences explaining the latent factor variance. Variation in the latent factor was highly genetic, with heritability estimates of 65% for boys and 74% for girls. Non-shared environmental effects explained the remaining variance. In addition, there were significant rater-specific genetic and environmental effects for both sexes. The observed rater differences underline the importance of using several informants when studying adolescent anxiety.

An examination of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and dimensions using profile analysis via multidimensional scaling (PAMS),"Contemporary cognitive models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) emphasize the importance of various types of dysfunctional beliefs in contributing to OC symptoms, such as beliefs about excessive personal responsibility, perfectionism, and intolerance for uncertainty. The present study seeks to further our understanding of the role of these beliefs by identifying the common profiles of such beliefs, using profile analysis via multidimensional scaling (PAMS). In Study 1, a large student sample (N =4079) completed the 44-item obsessive beliefs questionnaire. One major profile, control of thoughts and perfectionism, was extracted. Study 2 examined profiles of the 87-item obsessive beliefs questionnaire in people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n =398), other anxiety disorders (n =104), and a sample of undergraduate students (n =285). Inflated responsibility was a prominent subscale in the profiles of all three groups. Only control over thoughts was a unique subscale in the profile obtained for the OCD group, with this group having lower scores compared to the other groups. The results suggest that while inflated responsibility is a significant subscale in the profile of individuals with OCD, it is not a unique contributor; instead, control over thoughts is unique to OCD. The data, as well as recent research investigating obsessive beliefs, suggest the need to revise the contemporary cognitive model of OCD.

An examination of the incremental contribution of emotion regulation difficulties to health anxiety beyond specific emotion regulation strategies,"Given the potential transdiagnostic importance of emotion dysregulation, as well as a lack of research examining emotion dysregulation in relation to health anxiety, the present study sought to examine associations among specific emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), emotion regulation difficulties, and health anxiety in a physically healthy sample of adults (N =482). As hypothesized, results of a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that emotion regulation difficulties provided a significant incremental contribution, beyond the specific emotion regulation strategies, in predicting each of the three health anxiety variables. Among the six dimensions of emotion regulation difficulties, the dimension representing perceived access to effective emotion regulation strategies was the only emotion regulation difficulty dimension that predicted all three health anxiety variables beyond the effects of the specific emotion regulation strategies. Results indicate that emotion regulation difficulties, and particularly one's subjective appraisal of his/her ability to effectively regulate emotions, may be of importance to health anxiety. Clinical implications are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",1564153652," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2014
Stereotype confirmation concern and fear of negative evaluation among African Americans and Caucasians with Social Anxiety Disorder,"Fear of negative evaluation is a central component of social anxiety. The current study examines the relation between fear of negative evaluation and fears of confirming stereotypes about social groups to which one belongs among people diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. Participants ( N = 94) with a primary diagnosis of social anxiety disorder who self-identified as either African American ( n = 41) or Caucasian ( n = 53) completed standardized self-report measures of stereotype confirmation concerns and fear of negative evaluation. Results from hierarchical logistical regression showed that stereotype confirmation concerns predicted fear of negative evaluation for both racial groups, with greater concern predicting greater fear. This association was moderated by race, B = −.24, t = −2.67, p &lt; .01, such that stereotype confirmation concerns had a stronger association with fear of negative evaluation for Caucasians ( b = .38, p &lt; .01) than for African Americans ( b = .14, p &lt; .05). This study is the first to directly examine the relation between stereotypes and fear of negative evaluation within a socially anxious sample. Although we cannot identify the specific social group to which each participant’s stereotype confirmation concerns apply, this study provides quantitative evidence that the social context within which socially anxious individuals view themselves impacts their fear of negative evaluation and highlights the need for further research in this area.

Adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies: Interactive effects during CBT for social anxiety disorder,"There has been a increasing interest in understanding emotion regulation deficits in social anxiety disorder (SAD; e.g., Hofmann, Sawyer, Fang, &amp; Asnaani, 2012). However, much remains to be understood about the patterns of associations among regulation strategies in the repertoire. Doing so is important in light of the growing recognition that people’s ability to flexibly implement strategies is associated with better mental health (e.g., Kashdan et al., 2014). Based on previous work (Aldao &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2012), we examined whether putatively adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies interacted with each other in the prediction of social anxiety symptoms in a sample of 71 participants undergoing CBT for SAD. We found that strategies interacted with each other and that this interaction was qualified by a three-way interaction with a contextual factor, namely treatment study phase. Consequently, these findings underscore the importance of modeling contextual factors when seeking to understand emotion regulation deficits in SAD.

Cognitive behavior therapy versus interpersonal psychotherapy for social anxiety disorder delivered via smartphone and computer: A randomized controlled trial,"In this study, a previously evaluated guided Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy for social anxiety disorder (SAD) was adapted for mobile phone administration (mCBT). The treatment was compared with a guided self-help treatment based on interpersonal psychotherapy (mIPT). The treatment platform could be accessed through smartphones, tablet computers, and standard computers. A total of 52 participants were diagnosed with SAD and randomized to either mCBT ( n = 27) or mIPT ( n = 25). Measures were collected at pre-treatment, during the treatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. On the primary outcome measure, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale—self-rated, both groups showed statistically significant improvements. However, mCBT performed significantly better than mIPT (between group Cohen’s d = 0.64 in favor of mCBT). A larger proportion of the mCBT group was classified as responders at post-treatment (55.6% versus 8.0% in the mIPT group). We conclude that CBT for SAD can be delivered using modern information technology. IPT delivered as a guided self-help treatment may be less effective in this format.

"The DSM-5 dissociative-PTSD subtype: Can levels of depression, anxiety, hostility, and sleeping difficulties differentiate between dissociative-PTSD and PTSD in rape and sexual assault victims?","The DSM-5 currently includes a dissociative-PTSD subtype within its nomenclature. Several studies have confirmed the dissociative-PTSD subtype in both American Veteran and American civilian samples. Studies have begun to assess specific factors which differentiate between dissociative vs. non-dissociative PTSD. The current study takes a novel approach to investigating the presence of a dissociative-PTSD subtype in its use of European victims of sexual assault and rape ( N = 351). Utilizing Latent Profile Analyses, we hypothesized that a discrete group of individuals would represent a dissociative-PTSD subtype. We additionally hypothesized that levels of depression, anger, hostility, and sleeping difficulties would differentiate dissociative-PTSD from a similarly severe form of PTSD in the absence of dissociation. Results concluded that there were four discrete groups termed baseline, moderate PTSD, high PTSD, and dissociative-PTSD. The dissociative-PTSD group encompassed 13.1% of the sample and evidenced significantly higher mean scores on measures of depression, anxiety, hostility, and sleeping difficulties. Implications are discussed in relation to both treatment planning and the newly published DSM-5.

The cost of fear: Avoidant decision making in a spider gambling task,"Individuals with anxiety disorders typically avoid fear-relevant stimuli even if they miss potential rewards. However, few studies have accounted for such costs of fear-related avoidance in doing so. In this study, 51 spider fearful and 49 non-fearful participants completed the Spider Gambling Task, our modification of the Iowa Gambling Task, to investigate whether fear-relevant stimuli trigger avoidant decisions in the presence of potential rewards. In one version, advantageous choices were associated with pictures of spiders, whereas the same pictures were associated with disadvantageous choices in another version. Fearful participants generally avoided choices associated with pictures of spiders, which resulted in lower overall gains in the version with advantageous spider decks. Although this relative avoidance was sustained, fearful participants progressively approach more advantageous spider choices. These findings demonstrate that phobic fear results in irrational avoidant decisions which can result in considerable cost. Potential long-term rewards for approach may, however, diminish absolute avoidance behavior.

Disparities in psychosocial functioning in a diverse sample of adults with anxiety disorders,"Anxiety disorders are associated with psychosocial functional impairments, but no study has compared how these impairments might vary by ethno-racial status. We examined whether minority status was uniquely associated with functional impairments in 431 adults with anxiety disorders. Functioning was measured in the rater-assessed domains of: Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF); global psychosocial functioning; work, relationship, and recreational functioning; and, self-reported: life satisfaction, mental health functioning, physical functioning, and disability status. After controlling for demographic and clinical variables, results revealed evidence of disparities, whereby African Americans (AAs), particularly those with low income, had worse GAF, worse global psychosocial functioning, and were more likely to be disabled compared to non-Latino Whites. Latinos, particularly those with low income, had worse global psychosocial functioning than non-Latino Whites. Results suggest AAs and Latinos are at increased risk for functional impairments not better accounted for by other demographic or clinical variables.

An investigation of the psychometric properties of the Social Thoughts and Beliefs Scale (STABS) and structure of cognitive symptoms in participants with social anxiety disorder and healthy controls,"Despite the recent increase of measures developed to assess the cognitive symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SOC), their validation is still largely preliminary. Thus, the present studies sought to replicate and extend the psychometric evaluation of the Social Thoughts and Beliefs Scale (STABS). Study 1 involved both participants with SOC (n =206) and healthy controls (n =222) that completed the STABS and other related measures of anxiety. In Study 2, participants with SOC (n =66) completed exposure-based psychotherapy for SOC with the STABS used to track symptom changes. Together, the two studies provided additional support for the validity and reliability of the STABS as a measure of the cognitive symptoms of SOC. However, contrary to previous research with two subscales, a single total scale was suggested as the best interpretation of the STABS, as well as the possible general presentation of the cognitive symptoms of SOC.

The development and initial validation of the Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS),"Cyberchondria is a form of anxiety characterised by excessive online health research. It may lead to increased levels of psychological distress, worry, and unnecessary medical expenses. The aim of the present study was to develop a psychometrically sound measure of this dimension. A sample of undergraduate students ( N = 208; 64% female) completed a pilot version of the cyberchondria severity scale (CSS) along with the short form version of the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21). Exploratory factor analysis identified a correlated five factor structure that were labelled ‘Compulsion’, ‘Distress’, ‘Excessiveness’, ‘Reassurance Seeking’ and ‘Mistrust of Medical Professional’. The CSS demonstrated good psychometric properties; the subscales had high internal consistency, along with good concurrent and convergent validity. The CSS may prove useful in a wide variety of future research activities. It may also facilitate the development and validation of interventions for cyberchondria.

Diagnostic accuracy of three scoring methods for the Davidson Trauma Scale among U.S. Military Veterans,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 36 of Journal of Anxiety Disorders (see record 2015-53971-018). In the original article, the formula to calculate the negative likelihood ratio may not be familiar to some readers. The formula and accompanying citation are provided..] Self-report questionnaires are frequently used to identify PTSD among U.S. military personnel and Veterans. Two common scoring methods used to classify PTSD include: (1) a cut score threshold and (2) endorsement of PTSD symptoms meeting DSM-IV-TR symptom cluster criteria (SCM). A third method requiring a cut score in addition to SCM has been proposed, but has received little study. The current study examined the diagnostic accuracy of three scoring methods for the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) among 804 Afghanistan and Iraq war-era military Service Members and Veterans. Data were weighted to approximate the prevalence of PTSD and other Axis I disorders in VA primary care. As expected, adding a cut score criterion to SCM improved specificity and positive predictive power. However, a cut score of 68–72 provided optimal diagnostic accuracy. The utility of the DTS, the role of baseline prevalence, and recommendations for future research are discussed.

A community-based epidemiological study of health anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder,"This community-based study examined the frequency of worry about personal health in respondents with and without generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and the impact of health anxiety on the disorder. A random community-based telephone survey of 5118 Chinese respondents aged 18–64 was conducted. A fully structured questionnaire covered the DSM-IV-TR criteria of GAD, major depressive episode (MDE), eight domains of worry, the seven-item Whiteley Index (WI-7), health service use, and socio-demographic information. Worry about personal health ranked fifth (75.6%) among eight domains of worries examined. GAD respondents with high level of health anxiety were significantly older, less educated, and had lower family income. High health anxiety significantly increased the occurrence of one-year MDE, previous persistent worry, previous persistent low mood, number of domains of worries, number of non-core DSM-IV-TR GAD symptoms, health service use, and mistrust of doctors. Health anxiety is common in GAD and may signify greater severity of the disorder.

Attention Bias Modification Treatment for children with anxiety disorders who do not respond to cognitive behavioral therapy: A case series,"Evidence is emerging to support the promise of Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT), a computer-based attention training program, in reducing anxiety in children. ABMT has not been tested as an adjuvant for children with anxiety disorders who do not respond to Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This case series presents findings from an open trial of ABMT among six children (four girls; M age = 11.2 years) who completed a CBT protocol and continued to meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder. All children completed the ABMT protocol with no canceled or missed sessions. Child self-ratings on anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms significantly decreased from pretreatment to posttreatment, as did parent ratings on child anxiety-related impairment. Parent ratings on child anxiety and internalizing symptoms displayed non-significant decreases from pretreatment to posttreatment. These findings support the potential promise of ABMT as a feasible adjuvant treatment that reduces anxiety and impairment among child anxiety CBT nonresponders.

Personality disorders and the persistence of anxiety disorders: Evidence of a time-of-measurement effect in NESARC,"Recent studies using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) have found that some personality disorders (PDs) increase the persistence of several Axis I disorders. However, these effects are potentially confounded with the data collection wave in which PDs were assessed. Our aim was to extend published analyses to the case of anxiety disorders and to determine the robustness of the associations to analyses examining time-of-measurement effects. Persistence of anxiety disorders was defined either as follow-up diagnosis among participants diagnosed at baseline (“prediction”) or baseline diagnosis among participants diagnosed at follow-up (“post-diction”). Results revealed a robust pattern of higher odds ratios for post-diction among PDs assessed at baseline, and lower odds ratios for post-diction among PDs assessed at follow-up, suggesting a time of measurement artifact. Although only 4% of associations were robust to both predictive and post-dictive analyses, these were consistent with previous research.

"Unique relations among anxiety sensitivity factors and anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation","Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is composed of three lower-order dimensions, cognitive concerns, physical concerns, and social concerns. We examined the relations between AS dimensions using a more adequate assessment of subscales (ASI-3) than has previously been used, and measures of anxiety and mood disorders as well as suicidal ideation in a sample of 256 ( M age = 37.10 years, SD = 16.40) treatment-seeking individuals using structural equation modeling. AS cognitive concerns was uniquely associated with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal ideation. AS physical concerns was uniquely associated with OCD, social anxiety disorder (SAD), panic disorder (PD), and specific phobia. AS social concerns was uniquely associated with SAD, GAD, OCD, and MDD. These results highlight the importance of considering the lower-order AS dimensions when examining the relations between AS and psychopathology.

Anxiety sensitivity: Another reason to separate dental fears from blood–injury fears?,"Although dental phobia is classified under the heading of blood–injury phobia, studies show differences between the two conditions in terms of frequency of fainting and gender distribution. Anxiety sensitivity (AS), which refers to discomfort and negative attributions to bodily anxiety sensations, was useful in differentiating panic anxiety from other phobic anxieties. No study has compared dental phobia with blood–injury phobia directly. We examined 61 subjects, working at a military aircraft factory, using measures on demographics, dental fears (MDAS—Modified Dental Anxiety Scale) and blood–injury fears (MBPI—Multidimensional Blood/Injury Phobia Inventory), in addition to Anxiety Sensitivity Index. Regression analyses revealed that dental phobia was predicted by ASI, whereas blood/injury phobia was not. Our results provide additional support for the proposed distinction between the two conditions.

"Anxiety disorders and onset of cardiovascular disease: The differential impact of panic, phobias and worry","Anxiety has been linked to onset of cardiovascular disease. This study examines the differential impact of types of anxiety (panic, phobia and worry) on 3-year onset of non-fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD). By investigating anxiety disorders as opposed to anxiety symptoms and by using a reliable diagnostic instrument to assess anxiety, limitations of previous studies are considered. 5149 persons at risk for CVD were interviewed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The panic-type included panic disorder and panic attacks; the phobic-type included agoraphobia and social phobia, and the worry-type included generalized anxiety disorder. CVD was self-reported and required treatment or monitoring by a doctor. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographics, behavioral variables, and comorbid somatic and psychiatric disorders. During follow-up, 62 persons (1.2%) developed CVD. Baseline generalized anxiety disorder was strongly associated with onset of CVD (adjusted OR: 3.39). Further research should replicate findings and focus on biological underpinnings of this association.

The impact of hypervigilance: Evidence for a forward feedback loop,"A number of prominent theories suggest that hypervigilance and attentional bias play a central role in anxiety disorders and PTSD. It is argued that hypervigilance may focus attention on potential threats and precipitate or maintain a forward feedback loop in which anxiety is increased. While there is considerable data to suggest that attentional bias exists, there is little evidence to suggest that it plays this proposed but critical role. This study investigated how manipulating hypervigilance would impact the forward feedback loop via self-reported anxiety, visual scanning, and pupil size. Seventy-one participants were assigned to either a hypervigilant, pleasant, or control condition while looking at a series of neutral pictures. Those in the hypervigilant condition had significantly more fixations than those in the other two groups. These fixations were more spread out and covered a greater percentage of the ambiguous scene. Pupil size was also significantly larger in the hypervigilant condition relative to the control condition. Thus the study provided support for the role of hypervigilance in increasing visual scanning and arousal even to neutral stimuli and even when there is no change in self-reported anxiety. Implications for the role this may play in perpetuating a forward feedback loop are discussed.

Which symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder are associated with suicide attempts?,"Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder are at increased risk for suicide attempts. The present study aimed to determine which of the specific DSM-IV symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are independently associated with suicide attempts. Data came from Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). The NESARC has a sample size of N = 34653. The full sample size included in analyses was 2322 individuals with PTSD. Among individuals with lifetime PTSD, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, as well as any mood, substance, personality, or anxiety disorder (excluding PTSD), increasing numbers of re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms were significantly correlated with suicide attempts. Of the specific symptoms, having physical reactions by reminders of the trauma, being unable to recall some part of it, and having the sense of a foreshortened future, were all associated with suicide attempts. These findings will help extend our understanding of the elevated risk for suicide attempts in individuals with PTSD.

Comorbidity in the prediction of cognitive processing therapy treatment outcomes for combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder,"This paper examines clinical predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment outcomes following Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) in Australian military veterans. Fifty nine treatment seeking veterans were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial comparing 12 sessions of CPT ( n = 30) with usual treatment ( n = 29) at three community-based veterans counseling centers. PTSD and key co-morbidities (depression, anxiety, anger and alcohol use) were measured. Growth curve modeling was used to examine factors which influenced PTSD severity post-treatment. For the CPT condition, baseline anger was the only co-morbidity predictive of change in PTSD severity over time. Participants with higher anger scores showed less of a decrease in PTSD severity over time. Higher anxiety in participants in treatment as usual was significantly associated with better treatment gains. This research suggests that veterans experiencing high levels of anger might benefit from targeted anger reduction strategies to increase the effectiveness of CPT treatment for PTSD.

Fearful responding to interoceptive exposure in social anxiety disorder,"There is accumulating evidence suggesting that anxiety sensitivity (AS) may play a role in social anxiety disorder (SAD; e.g., Ball, Otto, Pollack, Uccello, &amp; Rosenbaum, 1995). Precedent research has demonstrated the role of AS in panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, and subsequently, treatment techniques aimed at reducing AS (i.e., interoceptive exposure (IE)) have been studied in these populations (Schmidt &amp; Trakowski, 2004; Wald &amp; Taylor, 2008). The purpose of this study was to examine the types of responses elicited during IE exercises among individuals with SAD. This study describes the responses of individuals with SAD ( n = 37) and nonclinical control participants ( n = 28) to six IE exercises. Significant differences in responses to the IE exercises were found between participants with SAD and nonclinical controls. However, there were no significant differences in responses to the exercises among persons with SAD, depending on whether the exercises were completed in private versus group settings. Similarity to symptoms during naturally occurring anxiety significantly predicted fearful responding across all exercises in persons with SAD. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

Attentional bias and attentional control in posttraumatic stress disorder,"Extensive evidence exists for an association between attentional bias (AB; attentional vigilance or avoidance) and anxiety. Recent studies in healthy participants suggest that attentional control (AC) may facilitate inhibition of automatic attentional processes associated with anxiety. To investigate relationships among AC, trauma-related AB, symptom severity and trait anxiety in patients with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), participants ( N = 91) completed self-report measures of AC, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and trait anxiety. AB was measured with a pictorial version of the Dot Probe Test. AC moderated the relationship between PTSS and AB (threat avoidance). Patients high in PTSS and low in AC showed attentional avoidance. No association between PTSS and AB in patients with medium or high levels of AC was found. A similar pattern of results was observed for the relationship between trait anxiety, AC and AB. These results suggest that a low ability to control attention is a risk factor for AB in PTSD. This first clinical study corroborates the accumulating evidence from analog studies that individual differences in top-down attentional control are of considerable importance in the expression of AB in anxious psychopathology.

Targeted behavioral therapy for childhood generalized anxiety disorder: A time-series analysis of changes in anxiety and sleep,"This study examined the efficacy of Targeted Behavioral Therapy (TBT), a newly developed intervention targeting features of childhood generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Using a time-series design, 4 children (7–12 years) with primary GAD were treated with TBT, which includes sleep improvement strategies, systematic desensitization for reducing intolerance of uncertainty, and in vivo exposures for anxiety. Diagnostic interviews and questionnaires were administered at baseline, post-treatment and 3 months follow-up. Anxiety symptoms and sleep characteristics/problems were rated weekly during a 4-week baseline and 14-weeks of treatment. Two children remitted at post-treatment and no child had a GAD diagnosis at follow-up. Child but not parent report revealed improvements in both worry and sleep. Despite improvements from pre- to post-assessment, considerable symptom fluctuation observed during the baseline period preclude conclusion that symptom changes are specifically attributable to the course of treatment. Overall, preliminary support is provided for the efficacy of TBT for childhood GAD.

"A meta-analysis and scoping review of social cognition performance in social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders","Social cognition deficits are observed in a variety of psychiatric illnesses. However, data concerning anxiety disorders are sparse and difficult to interpret. This meta-analysis aims at determining if social cognition is affected in social phobia (SP) or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared to non-clinical controls and the specificity of such deficits relatively to other anxiety disorders. The scoping review aims to identify research gaps in the field. Forty studies assessing mentalizing, emotion recognition, social perception/knowledge or attributional style in anxiety disorders were included, totalizing 1417 anxious patients and 1321 non-clinical controls. Results indicate distinct patterns of social cognition impairments: people with PTSD show deficits in mentalizing (effect size d = −1.13) and emotion recognition ( d = −1.6) while other anxiety disorders including SP showed attributional biases ( d = −0.53 to d = −1.15). The scoping review identified several under investigated domains of social cognition in anxiety disorders. Some recommendations are expressed for future studies to explore the full range of social cognition in anxiety disorders and allow direct comparisons between different disorders.

"The SPAI-18, a brief version of the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory: Reliability and validity in clinically referred and non-referred samples","We developed a new version of the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI) in order to have a brief instrument for measuring social anxiety and social anxiety disorder (SAD) with a strong conceptual foundation. In the construction phase, a set of items representing 5 core aspects of social anxiety was selected by a panel of social anxiety experts. The selected item pool was validated using factor analysis, reliability analysis, and diagnostic analysis in a sample of healthy participants ( N = 188) and a sample of clinically referred participants diagnosed with SAD ( N = 98). This procedure resulted in an abbreviated version of the Social Phobia Subscale of the SPAI consisting of 18 items (i.e. the SPAI-18), which correlated strongly with the Social Phobia Subscale of the original SPAI (both groups r = .98). Internal consistency and diagnostic characteristics using a clinical cut-off score &gt;48 were good to excellent (Cronbach's alpha healthy group = .93; patient group = .91; sensitivity: .94; specificity: .88). The SPAI-18 was further validated in a community sample of parents-to-be without SAD ( N = 237) and with SAD ( N = 65). Internal consistency was again excellent (both groups Cronbach's alpha = .93) and a screening cut-off of &gt;36 proved to result in good sensitivity and specificity. The SPAI-18 also correlated strongly with other social anxiety instruments, supporting convergent validity. In sum, the SPAI-18 is a psychometrically sound instrument with good screening capacity for social anxiety disorder in clinical as well as community samples.

"Reduction of subjective distress in CBT for childhood OCD: Nature of change, predictors, and relation to treatment outcome","Little research has investigated changes in subjective distress during cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders in youth. In the current study, 40 youth diagnosed with primary obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; M age = 11.9 years, 60% male, 80% Caucasian) and 36 parent informants completed separate weekly ratings of child distress for each OC symptom during a 12-session course of CBT. Between-session changes in distress were calculated at the start of, on average throughout, and at the end of treatment. On average throughout treatment, child- and parent-reported decreases in child distress were significant. Baseline OCD severity, functional impairment, and internalizing symptoms predicted degree of change in child distress. Additionally, greater decreases in child distress were predictive of more improved clinical outcomes. Findings advance our understanding of the strengths and limitations of this clinical tool. Future studies should examine youth distress change between and within CBT sessions across both subjective and psychophysiological levels of analysis.

Impression formation and revision in social anxiety disorder,"Interpersonal relations are markedly impaired in social anxiety. Yet, little is known about the ways social anxiety affects social cognition. We examined impression formation and impression revision among individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD, n = 26) and non-anxious individuals ( n = 29). Participants read initial descriptions of protagonists depicted as dominant, neutral or submissive and rated them on social rank and affiliation dimensions. Next, participants were presented with behavioral acts that were either congruent, incongruent or irrelevant to the initial descriptions, and re-rated the protagonists. Individuals with SAD (a) rated others as more extreme on social rank dimension, (b) rated others as lower on the affiliation dimension, and (c) revised their impressions of others to a greater extent than did the non-anxious individuals. Understanding the ways social anxiety affects the formation and revision of perceptions of others can improve our understanding of maintaining processes in SAD.

Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI-3) subscales predict unique variance in anxiety and depressive symptoms,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS) has been implicated in the development and maintenance of a range of mental health problems. The development of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index—3, a psychometrically sound index of AS, has provided the opportunity to better understand how the lower-order factors of AS—physical, psychological, and social concerns—are associated with unique forms of psychopathology. The present study investigated these associations among 85 treatment-seeking adults with high AS. Participants completed measures of AS, anxiety, and depression. Multiple regression analyses controlling for other emotional disorder symptoms revealed unique associations between AS subscales and certain types of psychopathology. Only physical concerns predicted unique variance in panic, only cognitive concerns predicted unique variance in depressive symptoms, and social anxiety was predicted by only social concerns. Findings emphasize the importance of considering the multidimensional nature of AS in understanding its role in anxiety and depression and their treatment.

Psychometric properties of reaction time based experimental paradigms measuring anxiety-related information-processing biases in children,"Theoretical frameworks highlight the importance of threat-related information-processing biases for understanding the emergence of anxiety in childhood. The psychometric properties of several tasks measuring these biases and their associations with anxiety were examined in an unselected sample of 9-year-old children (N =155). In each task, threat bias was assessed using bias scores reflecting task performance on threat versus non-threat conditions. Reliability was assessed using split–half and test–retest correlations of mean reaction times (RTs), accuracy and bias indices. Convergence between measures was also examined. Mean RTs showed substantial split–half and test–retest correlations. Bias score reliability coefficients were near zero and non-significant, suggesting poor reliability in children of this age. Additionally, associations between bias scores and anxiety were weak and inconsistent and performance between tasks showed little convergence. Bias scores from RT based paradigms in the current study lacked adequate psychometric properties for measuring individual differences in anxiety-related information-processing in children.

"Influence of anxiety, depression and looming cognitive style on auditory looming perception","Previous studies show that individuals with an anticipatory auditory looming bias over-estimate the closeness of a sound source that approaches them. Our present study bridges cognitive clinical and perception research, and provides evidence that anxiety symptoms and a particular putative cognitive style that creates vulnerability for anxiety (looming cognitive style, or LCS) are related to how people perceive this ecologically fundamental auditory warning signal. The effects of anxiety symptoms on the anticipatory auditory looming effect synergistically depend on the dimension of perceived personal danger assessed by the LCS (physical or social threat). Depression symptoms, in contrast to anxiety symptoms, predict a diminution of the auditory looming bias. Findings broaden our understanding of the links between cognitive-affective states and auditory perception processes and lend further support to past studies providing evidence that the looming cognitive style is related to bias in threat processing.

Differential efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacological treatments for pediatric obsessive–compulsive disorder: A meta-analysis,"The aim of this paper is to present a meta-analysis about the differential efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacological and combined treatment for pediatric obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). The literature research and the application of the inclusion criteria enabled us to locate 18 studies, yielding a total of 24 independent comparisons between a treated (10 pharmacological, 11 CBT, and 3 combined interventions) and a control group. All types of interventions were efficacious in reducing obsessive–compulsive symptoms, with effect sizes adjusted by the type of control group of d =1.203 for CBT, d =0.745 for pharmacological treatments, and d =1.704 for mixed treatments. Depression, anxiety and other secondary responses were also improved, especially with CBT interventions. The analysis of moderator variables showed that the CBT protocol and the total of intervention hours exhibited a significant influence on the effect size. Within pharmacological treatment, clomipramine (d =1.305) was more efficacious than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (d =0.644), but its adverse effects were more severe. Finally, the clinical implications of the results are discussed.

Properties of the Driving Behavior Survey among individuals with motor vehicle accident-related posttraumatic stress disorder,"Data suggest anxious drivers may engage in problematic behaviors that place themselves and others at increased risk of negative traffic events. Three domains of problematic behavior – exaggerated safety/caution, performance deficits, and hostile/aggressive behaviors – previously were identified during development of the Driving Behavior Survey (DBS), a novel measure of anxiety-related behavior. Extending this research, the current study examined the psychometric properties of DBS scores among individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) subsequent to motor vehicle trauma (N =40). Internal consistencies and 12-week test–retest reliabilities for DBS scales ranged from good to excellent. Comparison of scores to normative student data indicated dose–response relationships for safety/caution and performance deficit subscales, with increased frequency of anxious behavior occurring within the PTSD sample. Associations with standard clinical measures provide additional evidence for anxiety-related driving behavior as a unique marker of functional impairment, distinct from both avoidance and disorder-specific symptoms.

"Establishing a common metric for self-reported anxiety: Linking the MASQ, PANAS, and GAD-7 to PROMIS Anxiety","Researchers and clinicians wishing to assess anxiety must choose from among numerous assessment options, many of which purport to measure the same or a similar construct. A common reporting metric would have great value and can be achieved when similar instruments are administered to a single sample and then linked to each other to produce cross-walk score tables. Using item response theory (IRT), we produced cross-walk tables linking three popular “legacy” anxiety instruments – MASQ (N =743), GAD-7 (N =748), and PANAS (N =1120) – to the anxiety metric of the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®). The linking relationships were evaluated by resampling small subsets and estimating confidence intervals for the differences between the observed and linked PROMIS scores. Our results allow clinical researchers to retrofit existing data of three commonly used anxiety measures to the PROMIS Anxiety metric and to compare clinical cut-off scores.

Examining the latent structure of worry and generalized anxiety in a clinical sample,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by “pathological” worry, suggesting that GAD worriers differ qualitatively from non-GAD worriers. However, results from taxometric studies of worry in undergraduate and community samples have been mixed and to date, no studies have utilized clinical samples. The current study examined the latent structure of worry and GAD symptoms in a diagnostically heterogeneous clinical sample. Indicators were selected from the Penn State Worry Questionnaire-Abbreviated (n =1175) and the GAD-7 (n =638) and submitted to three taxometric procedures: MAXCOV, MAMBAC, and L-Mode. Results from all three procedures suggested that both worry and generalized anxiety are best conceptualized as dimensional constructs. Findings also indicated that ongoing conceptualization, assessment, and treatment of worry and GAD may be hampered by the application of a categorical framework.

Comorbidity of social anxiety disorder and antisocial personality disorder in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC),"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) are not often thought of as being comorbid. However, recent research suggests the existence of a SAD subtype with characteristics atypical of SAD but common to ASPD. Thus, we explored two competing hypotheses: (1) SAD and ASPD represent opposite ends of a single dimension, or (2) SAD and ASPD exist on two separate dimensions that may be positively correlated. Data were obtained from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. SAD–ASPD was related to greater impairment and psychiatric comorbidity than either disorder alone. The SAD–ASPD group was also more likely to seek treatment for their SAD symptoms and to drink before/during antisocial acts than the SAD only group. The presence of SAD for individuals with ASPD (and vice versa) does not appear to provide any “protective benefits.” SAD and ASPD appear to be two separate but correlated disorders.

In the present study, we used data from the Dresden Prediction Study, in which a epidemiologic sample of young German women was tested at two time points approximately 17 months apart, allowing the study of biased interpretation as a potential risk factor. At time point one, participants completed an Interpretation Questionnaire including two types of ambiguous scenarios: panic-related and general threat-related. Analyses revealed that a panic-related interpretation bias predicted onset of panic disorder, even after controlling for two established risk factors: anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations. This is the first prospective study demonstrating the incremental validity of interpretation bias as a predictor of panic disorder onset.

Predicting adoption of exposure therapy in a randomized controlled dissemination trial,"The present study examined organizational, client, and therapist characteristics as predictors of use of and proficiency in exposure therapy (ET) after training. Therapists naïve to ET ( N = 181) were randomized to: (1) online training (OLT), (2) OLT plus motivational enhancement (ME), or (3) OLT+ME plus a learning community. Twelve weeks after training, self-reported use of ET in clinical practice was high (87.5%) and therapists demonstrated moderate clinical proficiency. Use of ET was predicted by therapist degree, self-efficacy, and knowledge. Clinical proficiency was predicted by therapist anxiety sensitivity, attitudes, and knowledge, as well as organizational and client barriers. Several of these effects were moderated by training condition, indicating that therapists who received more comprehensive training were less impacted by barriers and showed enhanced adoption in the presence of facilitating factors. Overall, these results suggest that the primary barriers to the adoption of ET are therapist, not organizational or client, factors.

Assessing therapist reservations about exposure therapy for anxiety disorders: The Therapist Beliefs about Exposure Scale,"Exposure therapy is underutilized in the treatment of pathological anxiety and is often delivered in a suboptimal manner. Negative beliefs about exposure appear common among therapists and may pose a barrier to its dissemination. To permit reliable and valid assessment of such beliefs, we constructed the 21-item Therapist Beliefs about Exposure Scale (TBES) and examined its reliability and validity in three samples of practicing clinicians. The TBES demonstrated a clear single-factor structure, excellent internal consistency (αs = .90–.96), and exceptionally high six-month test–retest reliability ( r =.89). Negative beliefs about exposure therapy were associated with therapist demographic characteristics, negative reactions to a series of exposure therapy case vignettes, and the cautious delivery of exposure therapy in the treatment of a hypothetical client with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Lastly, TBES scores decreased markedly following a didactic workshop on exposure therapy. The present findings support the reliability and validity of the TBES.

Direct-to-consumer marketing of psychological treatments for anxiety disorders,"Progress disseminating and implementing evidence-based psychological treatments (EBPTs) for the anxiety disorders has been gradual. To date, the dominant approach for promoting the uptake of EBPTs in clinical settings has been to target the education and training of mental health providers, with many consumers remaining unaware of the potential benefits of EBPTs for anxiety disorders. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) marketing may be a promising vehicle for increasing EBPT utilization rates in the treatment of anxiety disorders. This paper provides an overview of the rationale and important considerations for applying DTC efforts to promote evidence-based care in the treatment of anxiety disorders, and reviews current DTC efforts in this area, including resources on the Internet and other media and in-person events. We conclude with recommendations for future efforts in the DTC marketing of EBPTs for the anxiety disorders, including the need for increased funding and grassroots efforts to inform consumers about anxiety disorders and their most effective treatments.

Theory-based training strategies for modifying practitioner concerns about exposure therapy,"Despite the well-established efficacy of exposure therapy in the treatment of pathological anxiety, many therapists believe this treatment carries an unacceptably high risk for harm, is intolerable for patients, and poses a number of ethical quandaries. These beliefs have been shown to account for two related problems: (a) underutilization of exposure therapy, and (b) overly cautious and suboptimal delivery the treatment, which likely attenuates treatment outcomes. At present, there is little guidance for those who train exposure therapists to address these concerns. This article reviews therapist negative beliefs about exposure therapy and discusses their modification based on findings from social and cognitive psychology pertinent to belief change, including dual-processing in reasoning, the need for cognition and affect, and attitude inoculation. A number of strategies are offered for augmenting training in exposure therapy in order to promote positive beliefs about the treatment. These strategies involve: (a) therapists engaging in simulated exposure therapy exercises and presenting arguments in defense of exposure's safety, tolerability, and ethicality, and (b) training therapists using emotion-based appeals (e.g., case examples) to supplement research findings. Directions for future research on practitioner concerns about exposure therapy are discussed.

Do negative beliefs about exposure therapy cause its suboptimal delivery? An experimental investigation,"Despite its effectiveness, exposure therapy is underutilized and frequently implemented in suboptimal fashion. Research has shown negative beliefs about exposure are related to its underutilization, and these beliefs are held by exposure therapists and may play a causal role in its suboptimal delivery. This study examined the effect of negative beliefs about exposure on treatment delivery. Participants ( n = 53) received training in basic exposure implementation and were given additional information intended to elicit either positive or negative beliefs about the treatment's safety, tolerability, and ethicality prior to conducting an exposure session with a confederate client. Results indicated that participants with experimentally induced negative beliefs about exposure delivered the treatment more cautiously (e.g. creation of a less ambitious exposure hierarchy, selection of a less anxiety-provoking exposure task, attempts to minimize client anxiety during exposure) compared to participants with positive beliefs who pursued more ambitious delivery of exposure (e.g. encouraging clients’ use of oppositional actions). The present findings suggest that therapist reservations about exposure cause suboptimal delivery and may adversely affect client outcomes.

Dissemination of empirically supported treatments for anxiety disorders: Introduction to the special issue,"Effective exposure therapies for anxiety disorders have been available for half a century. Over that time we have made great strides increasing the potency of these powerful methods. Yet, most of us in practice still have a conversation like the following with our new patients: Therapist : “So what treatments have you had for your anxiety symptoms to date?” Patient : “I have seen numerous therapists over the last 10 years.” Therapist : “Great, so what did you do?” Patient : “We talked about things. And I learned relaxation and breathing techniques.” Therapist : “Did a therapist ever help you face your fears?” Patient : “What do you mean?” Therapist: “I mean did you directly confront feared situations, perhaps with your therapist outside the office?” Patient: “No, why, is that important?” This oft-repeated conversation highlights the disconnect between the well-established efficacy of exposure-based treatments for pathological anxiety and their inaccessibility to most anxious clients. This failure to successfully disseminate exposure-based empirically supported treatments is the motivation for this special issue. The articles that follow consider the causes of this dissemination failure, highlight areas of success, and offer constructive remedies for addressing this important public health problem.

Dissemination of psychosocial treatments for anxiety: The importance of taking a broad perspective,"Dissemination methods are used to increase the likelihood that a given treatment or form of clinical practice is implemented by clinicians in the community. Therapist training in treatment methods is an important component of dissemination. Successful dissemination also requires that roadblocks to treatment implementation are identified and circumvented, such as misconceptions that clinicians might hold about a given treatment. The present article offers a commentary on the papers included in the special issue on treatment dissemination for anxiety disorders. Most papers focus on issues concerning the training and education of clinicians with regard to exposure therapy. Training and education is an important step but should be part of a broad, multifaceted approach. There are several other important methods of treatment dissemination, including methods developed and implemented with success by the pharmaceutical industry, might also be used to disseminate psychosocial therapies. Optimal dissemination likely requires a broad perspective in which multiple dissemination methods are considered for implementation.

What do we know today about the prospective long-term course of social anxiety disorder? A systematic literature review,"While we know that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is today’s most common anxiety disorder knowledge on its prospective long-term course is sparse. We conducted a systematic literature search using databases Medline and PsycINFO for naturalistic and psychotherapy outcome studies with follow-up durations of at least 24 months. Four naturalistic cohorts and nine psychotherapy trials were included in the review. The naturalistic course in clinical was less favorable than in non-clinical samples (27% vs. 40% recovery rate after 5 years). Psychotherapy trials, all applying (cognitive) behavioral methods, yielded stable outcomes with overall large pre- to follow-up effect sizes on self-report scales. Observer rated remission rates varied considerably (36% to 100%) depending on study design and follow-up length. The results of psychotherapy trials and that of naturalistic studies can hardly be compared due to differences in methodology. More standardized remission and recovery criteria are needed to enhance the understanding of the longitudinal course.

"Skittish, shielded, and scared: Relations among behavioral inhibition, overprotective parenting, and anxiety in native and non-native Dutch preschool children","This study examined behavioral inhibition and overprotective parenting as correlates and predictors of anxiety disorder symptoms in preschoolers with a multi-cultural background ( N = 168). Parents of 3- to 6-year-old children completed a set of questionnaires twice, 12 months apart. Parents were also interviewed with the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV at the 12-month point to assess the clinical severity of children’s anxiety symptoms. Behavioral inhibition consistently emerged as a significant concurrent correlate of anxiety symptoms and this was particularly true for social anxiety symptoms. Overprotective parenting also emerged as a significant correlate of anxiety, but only in the case of non-social anxiety symptoms and mainly in non-native Dutch children. Prospective analyses revealed that behavioral inhibition was a significant predictor of social anxiety symptoms, while overprotective parenting did not explain significant variance in the development of children’s anxiety over time. The support for an interactive effect of behavioral inhibition and overprotective parenting was unconvincing. Finally, it was found that children who exhibited stable high levels of behavioral inhibition throughout the study ran the greatest risk for developing an anxiety disorder.

Smiles may go unseen in generalized social anxiety disorder: Evidence from binocular rivalry for reduced visual consciousness of positive facial expressions,"Research has demonstrated increased attention to negative social cues and reduced attention to positive social cues in generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD), but little is known about whether GSAD also involves differences in lower levels of visual processing. This study explored visual experience in GSAD compared to participants with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and healthy controls using binocular rivalry. Participants were presented with dissimilar images to each eye, and the two images competed for perceptual dominance. Consistent with the hypothesis that GSAD involves a reduced visual salience for positive social cues, we found that smiling faces were dominant for significantly shorter durations in GSAD compared to GAD and controls. Contrasting with our hypothesis of greater visual salience of negative social cues, we found no difference in negative stimuli salience. These findings are consistent with the broader view that a perceiver’s affective state directly influences the content of visual consciousness.

Longitudinal course of anxiety sensitivity and PTSD symptoms in cognitive-behavioral therapies for PTSD,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS) has been conceptualized as trait-like vulnerability and maintenance factor for PTSD. Although recent literature has demonstrated its malleability during treatment, few have examined its influence on and effect from PTSD treatment. Using multilevel regression analyses we examined: (a) changes in AS during treatment and (b) whether pre-treatment AS predicted PTSD treatment response, in sample of female victims of interpersonal trauma receiving one of three treatments (cognitive processing therapy, cognitive processing therapy-cognitive, and written accounts). Participants exhibited reductions in total ASI scores from pre- to post-treatment. Growth curve modeling revealed slightly different trajectories of PTSD symptoms as a function of pre-treatment AS, and overall decreases in PTSD symptoms during treatment were not associated with pretreatment AS. Pretreatment AS dimensions impacted PTSD total scores and symptoms clusters differentially. Clinical and theoretical implications for these results are discussed.

Time-course of attention biases in social phobia,"Theoretical models of social phobia implicate preferential attention to social threat in the maintenance of anxiety symptoms, though there has been limited work characterizing the nature of these biases over time. The current study utilized eye-movement data to examine the time-course of visual attention over 1500 ms trials of a probe detection task. Nineteen participants with a primary diagnosis of social phobia based on DSM-IV criteria and 20 non-clinical controls completed this task with angry, fearful, and happy face trials. Overt visual attention to the emotional and neutral faces was measured in 50 ms segments across the trial. Over time, participants with social phobia attend less to emotional faces and specifically less to happy faces compared to controls. Further, attention to emotional relative to neutral expressions did not vary notably by emotion for participants with social phobia, but control participants showed a pattern after 1000 ms in which over time they preferentially attended to happy expressions and avoided negative expressions. Findings highlight the importance of considering attention biases to positive stimuli as well as the pattern of attention between groups. These results suggest that attention “bias” in social phobia may be driven by a relative lack of the biases seen in non-anxious participants.

Responses to voluntary hyperventilation in children with separation anxiety disorder: Implications for the link to panic disorder,"Background: Biological theories on respiratory regulation have linked separation anxiety disorder (SAD) to panic disorder (PD). We tested if SAD children show similarly increased anxious and psychophysiological responding to voluntary hyperventilation and compromised recovery thereafter as has been observed in PD patients. Methods: Participants were 49 children (5–14 years old) with SAD, 21 clinical controls with other anxiety disorders, and 39 healthy controls. We assessed cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic, respiratory (including pCO₂), electrodermal, electromyographic, and self-report variables during baseline, paced hyperventilation, and recovery. Results: SAD children did not react with increased anxiety or panic symptoms and did not show signs of slowed recovery. However, during hyperventilation they exhibited elevated reactivity in respiratory variability, heart rate, and musculus corrugator supercilii activity indicating difficulty with respiratory regulation. Conclusions: Reactions to hyperventilation are much less pronounced in children with SAD than in PD patients. SAD children showed voluntary breathing regulation deficits.

Psychological treatment of social anxiety disorder improves body dysmorphic concerns,"Social anxiety disorder and body dysmorphic disorder are considered nosologically distinct disorders. In contrast, some cognitive models suggest that social anxiety disorder and body dysmorphic disorder share similar cognitive maintenance factors. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of psychological treatments for social anxiety disorder on body dysmorphic disorder concerns. In Study 1, we found that 12 weekly group sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy led to significant decreases in body dysmorphic symptom severity. In Study 2, we found that an attention retraining intervention for social anxiety disorder was associated with a reduction in body dysmorphic concerns, compared to a placebo control condition. These findings support the notion that psychological treatments for individuals with primary social anxiety disorder improve co-occurring body dysmorphic disorder symptoms.

Incremental direct medical expenditures associated with anxiety disorders for the U.S. Adult population: Evidence from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey,"Data from the 2009 and 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) were used to estimate the annual incremental healthcare expenditures associated with anxiety disorders, for the ambulatory adult population of the U.S. Individuals 18 years and older, who reported a diagnosis of, or had a medical event associated with anxiety disorder(s), were classified as anxiety population. Multivariate regression analyses, using generalized linear models, were conducted to calculate incremental costs associated with anxiety disorders. 8.74% of adult respondents reported being diagnosed with anxiety disorder(s). The annual overall healthcare expenditure associated with anxiety disorders was estimated at $1657.52 per person (SE: $238.83; p &lt; 0.001). Inpatient visits, prescription medications, and office-based visits together accounted for almost 93% of the overall cost. Given the prevalence of self-reported anxiety disorders in MEPS, their total direct medical expenditure is estimated at approximately $33.71 billion in 2013 US dollars, meaning this category of mental illnesses absorbs a significant portion of the U.S. healthcare resources.

Association of &lt;i&gt;CRHR1&lt;/i&gt; variants and posttraumatic stress symptoms in hurricane exposed adults,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a moderately heritable anxiety disorder that may develop after exposure to trauma. However, only few genetic variants that relate to PTSD have been studied. This study examined the relationship between 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 gene ( CRHR1 ) and post-disaster PTSD symptoms and diagnosis in adults exposed to 2004 Florida hurricanes. CRHR1 regulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; dysregulation of the HPA axis is characteristic of stress phenotypes. Final analyses were conducted in the European-American (EA) subsample ( n = 564) due to population stratification. After correction for multiple testing, rs12938031 and rs4792887 remained associated with post-hurricane PTSD symptoms. Additionally, rs12938031 was associated with post-hurricane diagnosis of PTSD. This study is the first to examine CRHR1 in relation to PTSD in adults, and provides evidence for the importance of CRHR1 variation in the etiology of PTSD. Although results are preliminary and require replication, they justify follow-up efforts to characterize how this gene relates to PTSD.

Psychometric properties of the Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale (CALIS),"This paper describes the development and psychometric evaluation of a parent and child report measure of life interference and impairment associated with childhood anxiety, the Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale (CALIS). The CALIS is designed to measure life interference and impairment experienced by the child from the child (9 items) and parent (16 items) point of view and also the interference experienced by the parent in their own life. A total of 622 children between 6 and 17 years of age, and their parents, completed the CALIS. Results indicated that the CALIS has good internal consistency, moderate-to-high test re-test reliability, significant inter rater reliability, good convergent and divergent validity and is sensitive to treatment change. The CALIS is a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of life interference and impairment associated with anxiety disorders in childhood.

Autonomic responses and neural-cardiac coupling during individually tailored symptom provocation in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Elevated anxiety in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been linked to cortico-limbic hyperactivation, whereas hyperarousal of the autonomous nerve system (ANS) has inconsistently been found. We investigate ANS functioning during symptom provocation with individually tailored OCD-relevant pictures in 14 unmedicated patients and 14 controls and link it to activation in brain areas involved in ANS regulation. In addition to OCD-triggers, aversive and neutral control stimuli were included. Both groups showed increased skin conductance and heart rate changes to aversive control stimuli, whereas only patients demonstrated augmented skin conductance responses to OCD-triggers. Overall ANS hyperarousal in patients relative to controls was found at trend level. Activity in limbic and paralimbic areas in OCD patients was increased to both generally aversive and OCD-relevant stimuli, whereas dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) hyperactivation, covarying with cardiac responses in patients but not in controls, was present for disorder-relevant triggers only. Despite the small study group, these preliminary findings suggest ANS hyperactivity during OCD symptom provocation that could reflect arousal to the perceived threatening value of OCD-triggers and might mediate elevated anxiety.

Trauma experience in children and adolescents: An assessment of the effects of trauma type and role of interpersonal proximity,"The psychiatric sequelae associated with childhood experience(s) of trauma is complex and distinguishable from that of adult trauma exposure. Categories of impairment associated with experiences of early trauma include internalizing and externalizing emotional and behavioral problems, posttraumatic stress symptomatology, and dissociation. The present study assessed the relationship between the type of trauma experience (i.e., non-interpersonal or interpersonal) and the manifestation of a wide range of psychiatric symptomatology using prospective longitudinal data from a community sample of ethnically diverse children and adolescents ( N = 1676; ages 4–18). The study also examined the relationship between different types of trauma experiences (e.g., direct, vicarious, interpersonal) and levels of various symptom domains (e.g., anxiety, posttraumatic stress, conduct problems). A number of factors relevant to the relationship between early trauma experience and subsequent impairment including temperament, socioeconomic status, sex, and age were included in the analyses. Results indicated that interpersonal traumas involving significant interpersonal proximity were associated with externalizing problems (i.e., oppositional defiant and conduct problems). Direct trauma experiences and emotionality were positively associated with almost all symptom domains. Implications for the relationship between trauma and developmental psychopathology are discussed.

Application of a cognitive neuroscience perspective of cognitive control to late-life anxiety,"Recent evidence supports a negative association between anxiety and cognitive control. Given age-related reductions in some cognitive abilities and the relation of late life anxiety to cognitive impairment, this negative association may be particularly relevant to older adults. This critical review conceptualizes anxiety and cognitive control from cognitive neuroscience and cognitive aging theoretical perspectives and evaluates the methodological approaches and measures used to assess cognitive control. Consistent with behavioral investigations of young adults, the studies reviewed implicate specific and potentially negative effects of anxiety on cognitive control processes in older adults. Hypotheses regarding the role of both aging and anxiety on cognitive control, the bi-directionality between anxiety and cognitive control, and the potential for specific symptoms of anxiety (particularly worry) to mediate this association, are specified and discussed.

Information processing bias and pharmacotherapy outcome in older adults with generalized anxiety disorder,"Information processing bias was evaluated in a sample of 25 older adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) over the course of 12 weeks of escitalopram pharmacotherapy. Using the CANTAB Affective Go/No Go test, treatment response (as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Severity Scale) was predicted from a bias score (i.e., difference score between response latencies for negative and positive words) using mixed-models regression. A more positive bias score across time predicted better response to treatment. Faster responses to positive words relative to negative words were associated with greater symptomatic improvement over time as reflected by scores on the GADSS. There was a trend toward significance for PSWQ scores and no significant effects related to HAMA outcomes. These preliminary findings offer further insights into the role of biased cognitive processing of emotional material in the manifestation of late-life anxiety symptoms.

Attentional bias in older adults: Effects of generalized anxiety disorder and cognitive behavior therapy,"Attentional biases are known to play a contributing, and perhaps even causal role in the etiology of anxiety and other negative affective states. The prevalence of anxiety disorders in the older cohort is growing, and there are both theoretical and empirical reasons to suspect that age-related factors could moderate attentional bias effects in the context of late-life anxiety. The current study included one of the most widely-used measures of attentional bias, the dot-probe task (Mathews &amp; MacLeod, 1985). Participants were older adults who were either nonanxious or diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. The patient subsample also completed cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or an equivalent wait list condition, after which the dot probe was administered a second time. Results showed that clinical anxiety had no particular importance for the deployment of attention, casting doubt on the universality of biased attention in older anxiety patients. Although there were no maladaptive biases detected toward either threat or depression words at pretreatment, there was nevertheless a marginally significant differential reduction in bias toward threat words following CBT. This reduction did not occur among those in the wait list condition. Implications are discussed.

Do negative affect characteristics and subjective memory concerns increase risk for late life anxiety?,"To better understand the development and exacerbation of late-life anxiety, we tested a risk model positing that trait negative affect (NA) characteristics would interact with cognitive functioning, thereby increasing some older adults’ risk for increased anxiety symptoms. The moderator–mediator model consisted of measures of NA, cognitive functioning, and their interaction, as predictors of later Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores (HARS) via a mediational process, subjective memory concerns (SMCs). Older adults (aged 65-years and over; M age = 76.7 years, SD = 6.90 years) completed evaluations four times over approximately 18 months. A latent growth curve model including Anxiety Sensitivity Index total score (ASI), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 (DRS) total raw score, the ASI × DRS interaction, a SMC measure as mediator, HARS intercept (scores at times 3 and 4), and HARS slope provided good fit. The ASI × DRS-2 interaction at Time 1 predicted HARS slope score (β = −.34, p &lt; .05). When ASI score was high, stronger cognitive functioning was associated with fewer anxiety symptoms. The indirect effect of ASI score predicting HARS score 18-months later through the SMC mediator was statistically significant (β = .08, p &lt; .05). Results suggest that the cognitive functioning changes associated with aging might contribute to the development of anxiety symptoms in older adults with specific NA traits. Implications for predicting and preventing late life anxiety disorders are discussed.

Understanding late life anxiety and cognitive processes—We are rapidly gaining momentum: Introduction to the special issue,"The older adult population is growing at an accelerated pace, thus mental health professionals must become familiar with problems of aging. This special issue of Journal of Anxiety Disorders is the first to address the independent, interactive, and mutual effects of anxiety and cognitive processes in older adults. Although there are relatively longstanding traditions of study on cognitive aging and the effects of anxiety and cognition in younger adults, our understanding of anxiety and cognitive processes in the elderly lags far behind. The articles in this issue represent one of the first collective efforts to close this gap, addressing topics such as cognitive functioning in clinical and analog groups of anxious older adults, the relation of cognitive functions to indices of treatment outcome, and longitudinal models of increased anxiety in later life.

"Influence of age, thought content, and anxiety on suppression of intrusive thoughts","Understanding differences in responses following attempts to suppress versus simply monitor intrusive thoughts is important given the established relationship between intrusive thinking and numerous forms of psychopathology. Moreover, these differences may vary as a function of age. Because of the links between aging and both enhancement in emotion regulation skills and decline in inhibition skills, older and younger adults were expected to differ in their responses (e.g., experience of negative affect and thought recurrence) to attempts at suppressing intrusive thoughts. This study examined whether efforts to suppress thought content that varied in valence and age-relevance differentially affected older ( N = 40, aged 66–92) and younger ( N = 42, aged 16–25) adults’ ability to inhibit intrusive thought recurrence and their resulting negative affect. Interestingly, older adults experienced less recurrence for most thoughts than younger adults. Also, for several dependent variables (negative affect and perceived difficulty suppressing intrusive thoughts), older adults showed less decline in their magnitude of response across thinking periods (i.e., from suppression to monitoring) than did younger adults. These age effects were not generally moderated by level of trait anxiety, though higher anxiety did predict intrusive thought responding in expected directions, such as greater negative affect. These findings point to independent influences of age and anxiety, and suggest a complex mix of risk and protective factors for older adults’ responses to intrusive thoughts.

Late life anxiety is associated with decreased memory and executive functioning in community dwelling older adults,"This study assessed the degree to which anxiety and depression symptoms are associated with memory and executive functioning among community-dwelling older adults ( N = 120; M age = 74.9 years, SD = 7.2 years; 62% women). Participants completed the Geriatric Anxiety Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Comorbidity Index, California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition (CVLT-II), and the Trail Making, Verbal Fluency, and 20 Questions subtests of the Delis–Kaplan Executive Function System (D–KEFS). Multiple regression analyses indicated that anxiety and depression predicted poorer ability to learn new information (CVLT-II, Trials 1-5). Both anxiety and depression predicted performance on the D–KEFS Trail Making test, Number–Letter Switching condition. Anxiety, but not depression, predicted decreased categorization as measured by the D–KEFS 20 Questions, Initial Abstraction Score. Depression but not anxiety, predicted performance on D–KEFS Letter Fluency and Category Fluency. Findings suggest that anxiety and depression have unique relationships with cognitive functioning in community-dwelling older adults.

Psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED),"The present study examined the psychometric properties of the Persian translation of the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders-child version (SCARED-C) in a community sample of 557 children, aged 9–13 years, in the city of Isfahan, Iran. In addition to the SCARED-C, all the participants completed the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) and the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI). The SCARED-C demonstrated moderate to high internal consistency (alpha = 0.59–0.80) and good convergent and divergent validity. The one-factor and the five-factor model of the SCARED-C fitted the data moderately. However, the five-factor model had a significantly better fit than the one-factor model (Δχ² = 287.346, df = 10, P &lt; .001). These findings showed that SCARED-C can be used as a reliable and valid measure of anxiety symptoms among children in Iran.

Psychometric properties of the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory-Child version in a Swedish clinical sample,"The Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C) is a 26 item, empirically derived self-report instrument developed for assessing social phobic fears in children. Evidence for satisfactory psychometric properties of the SPAI-C has been found in multiple community studies. Since its development, however, no study has presented an extensive psychometric evaluation of SPAI-C in a sample of carefully diagnosed children with social phobia. The present study sought to replicate and expand previous studies by administrating the SPAI-C to a sample of 59 children that fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for social phobia, and 49 children with no social phobia diagnosis. An exploratory factor analysis resulted in a three factor solution reflecting: (1) fear of social interactions, (2) fear of public performance situations, and (3) physical and cognitive symptoms connected with social phobia. These factors appear to parallel domains of social phobia also evident in adults. The SPAI-C total scale and each factor was found to possess good internal consistency, good test–retest reliability and was generally strongly correlated with both self-report and clinician measures of anxiety and fears. The discriminative properties of the total scale were satisfactory.

Acceptance and commitment group therapy for health anxiety—Results from a pilot study,"Health anxiety (or hypochondriasis) is prevalent, may be persistent and disabling for the sufferers and associated with high societal costs. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a new third-wave behavioral cognitive therapy that has not yet been tested in health anxiety. 34 consecutive Danish patients with severe health anxiety were referred from general practitioners or hospital departments and received a ten-session ACT group therapy. Patients were followed up by questionnaires for 6 months. There were significant reductions in health anxiety, somatic symptoms and emotional distress at 6 months compared to baseline: a 49% reduction in health anxiety (Whiteley-7 Index), a 47% decrease in emotional distress (SCL-8), and a 40% decrease in somatic symptoms (SCL-90R Somatization Subscale). The patients’ emotional representations and perception of the consequences of their illness (IPQ) improved significantly, and 87% of the patients were very or extremely satisfied with the treatment.

Genetic and environmental influences on relationship between anxiety sensitivity and anxiety subscales in children,"Anxiety sensitivity, a belief that symptoms of anxiety are harmful, has been proposed to influence development of panic disorder. Recent research suggests it may be a vulnerability factor for many anxiety subtypes. Moderate genetic influences have been implicated for both anxiety sensitivity and anxiety, however, little is known about the aetiology of the relationship between these traits in children. Self-reports of anxiety sensitivity and anxiety symptoms were collected from approximately 300 twin pairs at two time points. Partial correlations indicated that anxiety sensitivity at age 8 was broadly associated with most anxiety subtypes at age 10 ( r = 0.11–0.17, p &lt; 0.05). The associations were largely unidirectional, underpinned by stable genetic influences. Non-shared environment had unique influences on variables. Phenotypic results showed that anxiety sensitivity is a broad predictor of anxiety symptoms in childhood. Genetic results suggest that childhood is a developmental period characterised by genetic stability and time-specific environmental influences on anxiety-related traits.

Self-portrayal concerns mediate the relationship between recalled teasing and social anxiety symptoms in adults with anxiety disorders,"Previous research on individuals with anxiety disorders has demonstrated that both childhood peer maltreatment and concerns about negative self-portrayal are related to elevated symptoms of social anxiety (SA). In the present study, we examined whether concerns about negative self-portrayal might either moderate or mediate the relation between recalled childhood teasing history and current symptoms of SA in a non-treatment-seeking clinical sample of 238 individuals with anxiety disorders. Participants completed the Teasing Questionnaire-Revised (TQ-R), the Negative Self-Portrayal Scale (NSPS), and the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). Analyses using structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated that self-portrayal concerns mediated, but did not moderate, the relationship between recalled teasing and current SA, accounting for 51% of the total effect. Clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed.

“You can do it!”: The role of parental encouragement of bravery in child anxiety treatment,"Individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) provides anxious youth with skills and experiences to increase “brave” behavior in the face of feared situations. This study addresses whether parental encouragement of bravery during an anxiety provoking and potentially avoidable naturalistic speech task (a) differs between parents of youth (ages 9–13) with anxiety disorders ( N = 47) and parents of healthy non-anxious controls ( N = 20); (b) influences response to treatment; and (c) changes during treatment for anxious youth randomized to receive CBT ( N = 30) or Child-Centered Therapy (CCT; a non-directive active comparison treatment; N = 17). Parent–child dyads were videotaped during a discussion of whether or not the child should complete an optional speech task. Parents of anxious youth showed less encouragement of bravery than parents of controls. Encouragement of bravery increased from pre- to post-treatment for youth who received CBT but not CCT, and pre-treatment encouragement of bravery predicted a better response to treatment, particularly for youth receiving CBT.

Social anxiety disorder in the Canadian population: Exploring gender differences in sociodemographic profile,"The present study examined the prevalence and sociodemographic profile of Canadians with social anxiety disorder using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.2 ( N = 36,984). Social anxiety disorder was assessed using the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview and sociodemographic variables were explored by gender. Results suggested significant gender differences for prevalence, comorbid depression, marital status, living arrangements, employment status in the past 12 months, and self-reported mental health status. These observations suggest that individuals with social anxiety disorder experience life disruption, and that of all socially anxious respondents, females may be experiencing more distress than males (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",1420147834," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2013
Acceptance based behavior therapy for social anxiety disorder through videoconferencing,"Most individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) do not receive any type of treatment. Reasons include logistical barriers (e.g., geographic location, travel time), fear of stigmatization, and fear of the social interactions associated with seeking treatment. Videoconferencing technology holds great promise in the widespread delivery of evidence-based treatments to those who would otherwise not receive treatment. This pilot study assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of an acceptance-based behavioral intervention using Skype videoconferencing to treat adults with generalized SAD. Twenty-four participants received 12 sessions of weekly therapy and were assessed at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Participants and therapists rated the intervention as acceptable and feasible. Analyses revealed significant pre-treatment to follow-up improvements in social anxiety, depression, disability, quality of life, and experiential avoidance, with effect sizes comparable to or larger than previously published results of studies delivering in-person CBT for SAD. Implications and future directions are discussed.

The role of social isolation in social anxiety disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Introduction: Social isolation in the context of social anxiety disorder has not been closely examined. This study aimed to describe the role and measurement of social isolation in those with social anxiety disorder. Method: A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted using a prospectively prepared protocol for search strategy, selection criteria, and data extraction. DerSimonian–Laird random effects models were used to calculate pooled estimates of effect. Results: Thirty-four studies, containing 20 formal instruments and four other measures of social isolation, were included. Most formal instruments were utilized in single studies, whereas simple structural measures (e.g., living alone) were used most frequently. The pooled score was 38.1 on the Loneliness and Social Dissatisfaction Questionnaire, 33.1 on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (avoidance subscale), and 21.1 on the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale. Conclusions: Social isolation is common in social anxiety disorder but assessed by a heterogeneous mix of measures.

Posttraumatic stress disorder in OEF/OIF veterans with and without traumatic brain injury,"Veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) are presenting with high rates of co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical presentations of combat-veterans with PTSD and TBI ( N = 40) to those with PTSD only ( N = 56). Results suggest that the groups present two distinct clinical profiles, with the PTSD + TBI group endorsing significantly higher PTSD scores, higher overall anxiety, and more functional limitations. The higher PTSD scores found for the PTSD + TBI group appeared to be due to higher symptom intensity, but not higher frequency, across PTSD clusters and symptoms. Groups did not differ on additional psychopathology or self-report of PTSD symptoms or executive functioning. Further analysis indicated PTSD severity, and not TBI, was responsible for group differences, suggesting that treatments implicated for PTSD would likely be effective for this population.

Infant distress to novelty is associated with maternal anxiety disorder and especially with maternal avoidance behavior,"Research suggested that maternal anxiety disorders might be related to infants’ behavioral inhibition. This study investigated whether maternal postpartum anxiety disorder is associated with infant temperament, more precisely, infant distress to novelty, an early predictor of behavioral inhibition. Differences in the latter were analyzed in a German sample by comparing n = 38 healthy mother–infant dyads to n = 44 dyads comprised of mothers diagnosed with a DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Infant age ranged from 2.83 to 7.97 months. Infant temperament was measured by means of the Infant Behavior Questionnaire. Mothers were screened for postpartum anxiety disorder using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders. Severity of anxiety was measured by self-reported questionnaires (Anxiety Cognition Questionnaire, Body Sensations Questionnaire and Mobility Inventory). Infant salivary cortisol reaction when being confronted with a socio-emotional stressor (Face-to-Face-Still-Face paradigm) was assessed to validate infant distress. A Mann–Whitney- U analysis suggested that infants of mothers with an anxiety disorder show more distress to novelty than infants of healthy mothers. Furthermore, data reveal a positive Spearman’s ρ -correlation between infant distress to novelty and maternal avoidance behavior (Mobility Inventory). A strong correlation between infant cortisol reactivity and reported distress to novelty validated the maternal evaluation of infant temperament in our sample. Results suggest a possible approach to promote infant development by encouraging mothers with anxiety symptoms to encounter feared stimuli.

Do conversations with virtual avatars increase feelings of social anxiety?,"Virtual reality (VR) technology provides a way to conduct exposure therapy with patients with social anxiety. However, the primary limitation of current technology is that the operator is limited to pre-programed avatars that cannot be controlled to interact/converse with the patient in real time. The current study piloted new technology allowing the operator to directly control the avatar (including speaking) during VR conversations. Using an incomplete repeated measures (VR vs. in vivo conversation) design and random starting order with rotation counterbalancing, participants ( N = 26) provided ratings of fear and presence during both VR and in vivo conversations. Results showed that VR conversation successfully elevated fear ratings relative to baseline ( d = 2.29). Participants also rated their fear higher during VR conversation than during in vivo conversation ( d = 0.85). However, in vivo conversation was rated as more realistic than VR conversation ( d = 0.74). No participants dropped out and 100% completed both VR and in vivo conversations. Qualitative participant comments suggested that the VR conversations would be more realistic if they did not meet the actor/operator and if they were not in the same room as the participant. Overall, the data suggest that the novel technology allowing real time interaction/conversation in VR may prove useful for the treatment of social anxiety in future studies.

A critical review of approaches to the treatment of dental anxiety in adults,"Dental anxiety and specific phobia of dental procedures are prevalent conditions that can result in substantial distress and oral health impairment. This paper critically reviews 22 randomized treatment trials aimed at reducing dental anxiety and avoidance in adults, published in peer-reviewed journals between 1974 and 2012. The following treatment techniques are reviewed: various forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), relaxation training, benzodiazepine premedication, music distraction, hypnotherapy, acupuncture, nitrous oxide sedation, and the use of lavender oil scent. CBT delivered in a variety of formats, including one-session treatment, has the most evidence for its efficacy. Cognitive techniques, relaxation, and techniques to increase patients’ sense of control over dental care are also efficacious but perform best when combined with repeated, graduated exposure. Other interventions require further study in randomized trials before conclusions about their efficacy are warranted. Limitations of the extant outcome research and implications for future treatment and research are discussed.

Early maladaptive schemas and social anxiety in adolescents: The mediating role of anxious automatic thoughts,"Cognitive models state that cognitions are organized hierarchically, so that the underlying schemas affect behavior via more automatic, superficial cognitive processes. This study aimed to demonstrate that early maladaptive schemas predict anxious automatic thoughts, and to show that such automatic thoughts act as mediators between schemas and prospective changes in social anxiety symptoms. The study also examined an alternative reverse model in which schemas acted as mediators between automatic thoughts and social anxiety. A total of 1052 adolescents (499 girls and 553 boys; M age = 13.43; SD age = 1.29) completed measures of early maladaptive schemas, socially anxious automatic thoughts, and social anxiety symptoms at Times 1, 2, and 3. The results revealed bidirectional longitudinal relationships among schemas and automatic thoughts that were consistent in content (e.g., the disconnection/rejection schemas and automatic thoughts of negative self-concept). Furthermore, the automatic thoughts of anticipatory negative evaluation by others at Time 2 mediated the relationship between the other-directedness schemas at Time 1 and social anxiety symptoms at Time 3. These findings are consistent with hierarchical cognitive models of social anxiety given that deeper schemas predict more surface-level thoughts. They also support that these more surface-level thoughts contribute to perpetuating schemas. Finally, results show that early maladaptive schemas of the other-directedness domain play a relevant role in the development and maintenance of social anxiety.

Heterogeneous classes of co-occurring externalizing symptoms in a sample of youth referred for anxiety disorders,"The present study used latent class analysis to identify patterns of externalizing symptoms in a predominantly Hispanic sample of clinic referred anxious youth ( N = 224; 6–16 years; 54% males) and their parents. Findings revealed that the sample of youth could be classified into three distinct classes: (1) High Externalizing, (2) Moderate Externalizing, and (3) Low Externalizing. The High Externalizing Class was characterized as having a relatively high probability of all ADHD and aggressive symptoms in the clinical range. The Moderate Externalizing Class was characterized as having a relatively high probability of three symptoms in the clinical range: “argues a lot”, “disobedient at home”, and “fails to finish.” The Low Externalizing Class was characterized as having a relatively low probability of all ADHD and aggressive symptoms in the clinical range. The conceptual, empirical, and clinical implications of the findings are discussed.

Pre-treatment shyness mindset predicts less reduction of social anxiety during exposure therapy,"This study examined the moderating role of shyness mindset on the reduction of social anxiety during exposure-based treatment. Participants ( N = 60) in an intensive outpatient program for anxiety disorders were assessed at pre- and post-treatment. Social performance anxiety decreased dramatically during treatment, but the amount of decrease differed as a function of pre-treatment shyness mindset. At one standard deviation above the mean on both the social performance anxiety and shyness mindset measures, an average reduction of 15 points on the social performance anxiety measure was observed. At one standard deviation above the mean on the social performance anxiety measure and one standard deviation below the mean on the shyness mindset measure, an average reduction of 27 points on the social performance anxiety measure was observed. These results suggest that targeting shyness mindset during exposure-based treatments for social anxiety disorder might increase the effectiveness of treatment for individuals with a high shyness mindset.

Patterns and predictors of comorbidity of DSM-IV anxiety disorders in a clinical sample of children and adolescents,"This study examined the comorbidity of anxiety disorders and its predictors in a large, clinically referred sample of children and adolescents. Participants were 608 youth aged 4–18 years presenting at a large anxiety clinic for assessment and treatment of anxiety or mood related problems. The diagnoses were determined using the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule, Child/Parent versions. Sixty three percent of the participants had an additional diagnosis of an anxiety or depressive disorder. Comorbidity patterns differed based on the principal diagnostic category. Older children and females with anxiety were more likely to have a comorbid anxiety disorder. The presence of a medical condition increased the odds of having a comorbid anxiety disorder as well. This is the largest clinical sample of children and adolescents in which comorbidity of emotional disorders has been examined. Understanding the common patterns of comorbidity has important implications for future classification and treatment planning of childhood anxiety disorders.

How do attachment style and social support contribute to women's psychopathology following intimate partner violence? Examining clinician ratings versus self-report,"Concurrent associations between attachment style and social support in posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder were explored using regression analyses in a sample of 108 victims of intimate partner violence. To examine whether assessment modality influenced findings, self-report and clinician ratings of psychopathology were compared. Both lower perceived social support and higher attachment anxiety were significantly associated with higher self-reported PTSD; however, only lower social support was significantly associated with clinician assessed PTSD. Lower social support, higher attachment anxiety, and lower attachment closeness were related with higher self-reported depression; however, only lower social support was related to clinician assessed depression. Lastly, only higher attachment anxiety was associated with self-reported GAD, whereas lower attachment dependency showed the only significant association in clinician assessed GAD. Possible explanations for discrepancies between assessment modalities are discussed, with emphasis on application to intimate partner violence and suggestions for future research.

Influence of social stress on risk-taking behavior in adolescents,"Risk-taking behavior involves making choices with uncertain positive or negative outcomes. Evidence suggests that risk-taking behavior is influenced by emotional state. One such emotional experience is social anxiety, which has been related to both risk-avoidant and risk-seeking decision making. The present study examined a community sample of 34 adolescents grouped into low (Low SA Group) and high (High SA Group) social anxiety (SA). Both groups were compared on changes in performance on a risk taking task (Balloon Analogue Risk Task) between a social threat condition (modified Trier Social Stress Test, High Stress) and a control condition (Low Stress). These conditions were administered on different days, and the order was counterbalanced across subjects. A group × condition interaction revealed that the High SA Group showed greater risk-taking behavior when exposed to the High Stress Condition compared to the Low Stress Condition, while the Low SA Group evidenced no difference between the two conditions. Interpretations for the increased risk behavior under the condition of social stress for those high in social anxiety are discussed as well as implications for understanding the complex relationship between social anxiety and risk behavior.

"Temperament and parenting predicting anxiety change in cognitive behavioral therapy: The role of mothers, fathers, and children","Objective: A considerable amount of children with anxiety disorders do not benefit sufficiently from cognitive behavioral treatment. The present study examines the predictive role of child temperament, parent temperament and parenting style in the context of treatment outcome. Method: Participants were 145 children and adolescents (ages 8–18) with DSM-IV-TR anxiety disorders who received a 12-session CBT program and were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment and three months follow-up. Multiple-regression analyses were used to evaluate the following pretreatment and posttreatment variables as potential predictors of treatment response at follow-up: baseline level of anxiety symptoms, child reported maternal and paternal rearing style (emotional warmth, rejection, and overprotection), parent reported child temperament traits (negative affect, effortful control, and extraversion), and mothers’ and fathers’ self-report temperament traits. Results: More maternal negative affect and less emotional warmth as perceived by the child before treatment were related to less favorable treatment outcome (accounting for 29% of the variance in anxiety at follow-up). Furthermore, maternal negative affect and children’s extraversion measured after treatment also predicted anxiety at follow-up (together accounting for 19% of the variance). Paternal temperament and parenting style were unrelated to treatment outcome, as were children’s pretreatment temperament traits. Conclusion: The results suggest that tailoring intervention to include strategies to reduce maternal negative affect and promote an emotional warm rearing style may improve treatment outcome.

Depersonalization/derealization during acute social stress in social phobia,"The present study aimed at investigating how frequently and intensely depersonalization/derealization symptoms occur during a stressful performance situation in social phobia patients vs. healthy controls, as well as testing hypotheses about the psychological predictors and consequences of such symptoms. N = 54 patients with social phobia and N = 34 control participants without mental disorders were examined prior to, during, and after a standardized social performance situation (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). An adapted version of the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale was applied along with measures of social anxiety, depression, personality, participants’ subjective appraisal, safety behaviours, and post-event processing. Depersonalization symptoms were more frequent in social phobia patients (92%) than in controls (52%). Specifically in patients, they were highly positively correlated with safety behaviours and post-event-processing, even after controlling for social anxiety. The role of depersonalization/derealization in the maintenance of social anxiety should be more thoroughly recognized and explored.

Treating individuals with social anxiety disorder and at-risk drinking: Phasing in a brief alcohol intervention following paroxetine,"Paroxetine alone is not sufficient to decrease alcohol use in socially anxious alcoholics seeking anxiety treatment. We tested the hypothesis that adding a brief-alcohol-intervention (BI) to paroxetine would decrease alcohol use. All subjects ( N = 83) had a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, endorsed drinking to cope with anxiety, were NIAAA-defined at-risk drinkers, and were randomized to either paroxetine alone, or paroxetine plus BI. Both groups showed significant improvement in both social anxiety severity ( F (5,83) = 61.5, p &lt; 0.0001) and drinking to cope (e.g. F (4,79) = 23, p &lt; 0.0001) and these two constructs correlated with each other ( B = 3.39, SE = 0.696, t (71) = 4.88, p &lt; 0.001). BI was not effective at decreasing alcohol use (e.g. no main effect of group, all p values &gt;0.3). Paroxetine decreased social anxiety severity in the face of heavy drinking and decreasing the anxiety was related to a concurrent decrease in coping related drinking. BI was not effective at decreasing drinking or drinking to cope.

"Parenting practices, interpretive biases, and anxiety in Latino children","A number of factors are believed to confer risk for anxiety development in children; however, cultural variation of purported risk factors remains unclear. We examined relations between controlling and rejecting parenting styles, parental modeling of anxious behaviors, child interpretive biases, and child anxiety in a mixed clinically anxious ( n = 27) and non-clinical ( n = 20) sample of Latino children and at least one of their parents. Families completed discussion-based tasks and questionnaires in a lab setting. Results indicated that child anxiety was: linked with parental control and child interpretative biases, associated with parental modeling of anxious behaviors at a trend level, and not associated with low parental acceptance. Findings that controlling parenting and child interpretive biases were associated with anxiety extend current theories of anxiety development to the Latino population. We speculate that strong family ties may buffer Latino children from detrimental effects of perceived low parental acceptance.

National trends of psychotropic medication use among patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders: Results from Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 2004–2009,"Data from the 2004 to 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) were used to: (1) characterize changes in utilization and (2) identify factors associated with the use of psychotropic medication among patients with anxiety disorders. We calculated the prevalence, compared the use patterns for each year and drug class, and used logistic regression to identify the factors associated with psychotropic medication use. Patients ever using a psychotropic medication for anxiety grew from 57.4% in 2004 to 63.8% in 2009 ( p &lt; 0.01). From 2004 to 2009, use of benzodiazepines (22.7–30.5%, p &lt; 0.01) and atypical antipsychotics (2.3–3.9%, p &lt; 0.01) increased. A high prevalence in the use of benzodiazepines (41.8% in 2004 to 48.8% in 2009) was observed among older adults. Older age, having insurance coverage, and poor health status were significantly associated with self-reported psychotropic medication use. An increase of psychotropic medication use from 2004 to 2009 was observed. A high prevalence and increasing trend in the use of benzodiazepines may warrant further attention given safety concerns in older adults.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with social anxiety: Differential short and long-term treatment outcomes,"This study examined social anxiety symptoms and/or diagnosis as a predictor of differential short- and long-term cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) outcomes. Ninety-one anxiety-disordered youth participated in a randomized clinical trial of CBT. Semi-structured interviews provided dimensional clinical severity ratings (CSRs) for children’s principal anxiety disorder at pretreatment, posttreatment, 1-year and 7.4-year follow-up assessments for youth with versus without pretreatment social anxiety. Thirty-nine youth presented with either principal ( n = 17), secondary (n = 11), or tertiary social phobia diagnoses ( n = 7) or subclinical social anxiety symptoms ( n = 4). Hierarchal linear modeling (HLM) indicated that youth made similar gains from pretreatment to posttreatment and 1-year follow-up regardless of their social anxiety symptoms or diagnosis; however, youth with social anxiety symptoms or diagnosis were significantly less improved at 7.4-year follow-up. This pattern was distinct from that of youth with the most severe (CSR = 4) principal anxiety disorders at pretreatment. Though initially responsive to CBT, children who present with social anxiety diagnoses or symptoms may require an enhanced or extended treatment to maintain their gains into young adulthood whether or not social anxiety is considered their principal childhood difficulty.

Emotion dysregulation and sleep difficulties in generalized anxiety disorder,"Diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) include sleep problems, which often persist even after successful treatment of the disorder. The purpose of this study was to examine emotion dysregulation as a potential contributor to sleep problems in GAD patients. Participants comprised two groups: 59 individuals diagnosed with GAD and 66 healthy controls. They were assessed for the presence of mood and anxiety disorders and then completed self-report questionnaires assessing problems with sleep and emotion regulation. Participants in the GAD group scored significantly higher on a number of sleep outcomes than did the control group. Importantly, difficulties with emotion regulation statistically mediated the relationship between GAD and a wide range of outcomes of sleep dysfunction independently of the effects of depression and secondary anxiety diagnoses. Emotion regulation difficulties that characterize GAD mediate the relationship between symptoms of this disorder and a wide range of sleep problems. Implications for treatment and future research directions are discussed.

Intolerance of uncertainty and negative metacognitive beliefs as transdiagnostic mediators of repetitive negative thinking in a clinical sample with anxiety disorders,"This study aimed to replicate and extend a hierarchical model of vulnerability to worry, with neuroticism and extraversion as higher-order factors and negative metacognitions and intolerance of uncertainty as second-order factors. The model also included a transdiagnostic measure of repetitive negative thinking (RNT) and depression symptoms as outcome variables to determine whether relationships would extend beyond worry, which has traditionally been studied within the context of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Participants ( N = 99) were referrals to a specialist anxiety disorders clinic with a principal anxiety disorder who completed a battery of self-report questionnaires assessing neuroticism, extraversion, metacognitions, intolerance of uncertainty, worry, RNT, and depression symptoms. Mediational analyses using bootstrapping provided support for transdiagnostic and diagnosis-specific mediation effects. Negative metacognitions fully mediated the relationship between neuroticism and RNT for the whole sample and for subsamples with and without GAD. Intolerance of uncertainty mediated the relationship between neuroticism and worry (for the whole sample and for those with GAD) and between neuroticism and RNT (for those with GAD). Implications for theory, treatment, and nosology are discussed.

The authors regret that some of the numbers describing the sample were accidentally based on a subsample of the data used in the original paper. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2012-18944-002). The relationship between overprotective parenting and child anxiety has been examined repeatedly because theories emphasize its role in the maintenance of child anxiety. No study has yet tested whether this relationship is unique to child anxiety, by controlling for commonly co-occurring behavior problems within the same children. The current study examined 190 children (age 7–13, 89 boys) referred to mental health clinics and their parents. Results revealed that significant correlations between overprotective parenting and child anxiety symptoms disappear after controlling for co-occurring child behavior symptoms. It appears that overprotection is not uniquely related to child anxiety. Furthermore, overprotective parenting was significantly and uniquely related to child behavior symptoms. Researchers and practitioners need to consider co-occurring child behavior problems when working with the parents of anxious children.

The Short Health Anxiety Inventory: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Introduction: The Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) measures health anxiety in medical and non-medical contexts. Objective: To review the literature pertaining to the psychometric properties of the SHAI in non-clinical, clinical, and medical samples. Meta-analysis was also conducted to examine the strength of associations between the SHAI and other constructs. Methods: Direct search of digital databases for papers that cited the original SHAI publication. Results: Seventy-eight papers were identified, with 42 providing relevant information. The SHAI has acceptable Cronbach’s alpha scores, strong construct validity, and is sensitive to treatment. Discrepancies have been observed between the findings of factor analytic studies, largely as a result of varying methods used. Overall, there appears to be greatest support for the original two factors, with one factor assessing health anxiety and one factor assessing negative consequences of illness. As expected, individuals with hypochondriasis score higher as compared to non-clinical samples. The strongest association was observed between the SHAI and other measures of health anxiety, followed by measures related to health anxiety vulnerability, and then general anxiety and worry. Conclusions: The SHAI is a psychometrically sound tool for assessing health anxiety across samples. Future studies are needed, however, to assess test–retest reliability, incremental validity, and cut-off scores as well as use of the SHAI among diverse samples.

Attentional control mediates the effect of social anxiety on positive affect,"The goal of the present studies was to examine whether attentional control, a self-regulatory attentional mechanism, mediates the effect of social anxiety on positive affect. We tested this mediation in two studies using undergraduate students selected to represent a broad range of severity of social anxiety. Self-report assessments of social anxiety, attentional control, and positive affect were collected in a cross-sectional design (Study 1) and in a longitudinal design with three assessment points (Study 2). Results of both studies supported the hypothesized mediational model. Specifically, social anxiety was inversely related to attentional control, which itself positively predicted positive affect. This mediation remained significant even when statistically controlling for the effects of depression. Additionally, the hypothesized model provided superior model fit to theoretically-grounded equivalent models in both studies. Implications of these findings for understanding diminished positive affect in social anxiety are discussed.

Quality of attachment relationships and peer relationship dysfunction among late adolescents with and without anxiety disorders,"Little is known about the links between anxiety disorders and parent–child attachment disorganization and quality of peer relationships in late adolescence. This study examined the quality of attachment and peer relationships among adolescents with and without anxiety disorders in a sample of 109 low- to moderate-income families. Psychopathology was assessed with the SCID-I. Attachment disorganization and dysfunction in peer relationships were measured using semi-structured interviews and behavioral observations. Adolescents with anxiety disorders and comorbid conditions showed higher levels of attachment disorganization across three measurement approaches, as well as higher levels of dysfunction in peer relationships than those with no Axis I diagnosis. Adolescents without anxiety disorders but with other Axis I disorders differed only in the quality of school relationships from those with no diagnoses. The pattern of results suggests that pathological anxiety, in the context of other comorbidities, may be a marker for more pervasive levels of social impairment.

"Understanding the associations among anxiety sensitivity, distress tolerance, and discomfort intolerance: A comparison of three models","Emerging work has identified several related constructs that appear to be relevant to anxiety psychopathology including anxiety sensitivity (AS), distress tolerance (DT) and discomfort intolerance (DI). AS refers to the fear of the consequences of anxiety-related sensations. DT measures tolerance of negative emotions, whereas DI measures tolerance of uncomfortable physical sensations. Questions, however, have been raised regarding the overlap among AS, DT, and DI. The present study conducted confirmatory factor analyses to test three models of emotional and physical tolerance to determine which model provided the best fit for the associations among AS, DT, and DI. Nonclinical individuals ( N = 411) and individuals with anxiety psychopathology ( N = 253) completed self-report questionnaires. Results supported a hierarchical factor structure with 2 higher order factors with AS as a lower order factor of DT. The implications of these findings for the conceptualization of the relationships among AS, DT, and DI are discussed.

Maternal depression and treatment gains following a cognitive behavioral intervention for posttraumatic stress in preschool children,"The evidence base for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat child emotional and behavioral symptoms following exposure to trauma in youth is compelling, but relatively few studies are available on preschool children and on moderators of treatment outcomes. This paper examines maternal and child characteristics as moderators of posttraumatic stress (PTS) treatment outcomes in preschool children. Outcome data from a previously published randomized trial in three to six year old preschool children with diagnostic interview data from participating mothers were used. Hypotheses were tested via hierarchical linear modeling. Maternal depression was associated with higher initial child posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and was associated with increasing PTSD symptom trends at follow up suggesting potential child PTSD symptom relapse. Maternal PTSD symptoms similarly predicted differential child separation anxiety symptom change but not child PTSD symptom change. Targeting dyads with child PTSD symptoms and maternal depression or PTSD symptoms with enhanced interventions may be a useful strategy to improve treatment maintenance.

Technological advances in psychotherapy: Implications for the assessment and treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder,"Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and costly condition that causes significant functional impairment and reduced quality of life. Although treatments with demonstrated efficacy for OCD, such as cognitive behavior therapy and antidepressants, have existed for over three decades, many patients remain inadequately treated or untreated. Challenges encountered in the treatment of OCD include problems with homework compliance, frequent relapse, difficulties in simulating the spontaneous nature of intrusive thoughts, and infrequent treatment sessions. Accumulated research now indicates that computerized assessment and therapy tools can significantly improve the cost/time-effectiveness of conventional psychotherapeutic interventions for anxiety disorders such as OCD without impairing therapeutic progress and outcome. In this paper we examine the potential of such technology, address current challenges in the assessment and treatment of OCD, and provide a rationale for future research in the field. We outline the general utility of computer technology in psychotherapeutic interventions, critically evaluate the existing literature on computer-assisted assessment and treatment specific to OCD, as well as discuss potential implications of portable technology for OCD treatment delivery and outcomes.

Social anxiety and emotion knowledge: A meta-analysis,"It has been proposed that social anxiety is associated with poor emotion knowledge (EK), although studies have revealed mixed results. The aim of the present paper was to systematically investigate the association between EK and both non-clinical and clinical social anxiety by means of meta-analyses. Systematic, electronic database literature searches were performed, and meta-analyses were conducted on 43 included studies. Results showed that social anxiety was negatively associated with EK. The strongest association was found between clinical levels of social anxiety and the ability to understand one's own emotions (intrapersonal EK). Regarding interpersonal EK, a subgroup analysis showed that social anxiety was more strongly associated with a decreased ability to understand complex emotions than to recognize basic emotions. No differences were found between patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and patients with other anxiety disorders. Although a large between study heterogeneity and differing methodologies may prevent any firm conclusions from being reached, the results indicate that poor EK may play an important role in SAD, and that it could be beneficial to target EK in the treatment of SAD.

Executive skills in older adults with GAD: Relations with clinical variables and CBT outcome,"Although cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective intervention for treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in older adults, researchers are now considering augmenting the therapy to enhance outcome. We are also long overdue in identifying moderators of CBT response (e.g., cognitive abilities) in late life anxiety. The goals of the current investigation were to examine performance on verbal versus nonverbal tests of executive skills (ES) and to test the relation between ES and clinical indices in older GAD patients. Hierarchical and logistic regression models identified baseline ES predictors of premature termination, homework compliance and quality, and indices of cognitive restructuring, an essential component of CBT. Although the analyses of response on symptom measures did not reveal any significant baseline predictors, an alternative ES grouping scheme showed that those whose ES improved during CBT also responded best in terms of worry reduction. These findings can be applied to the optimization of treatment for older anxiety patients, who are an underserved demographic group.

Overlap of symptom domains of separation anxiety disorder in adulthood with panic disorder–agoraphobia,"There is a need to explain the high level of comorbidity between separation anxiety disorder (SAD) in adulthood and panic disorder with agoraphobia (Pd-Ag). One possibility is that inadequate specification of symptom domains and/or diagnostic questions accounts for some of the comorbidity. The present anxiety clinic study examined responses of adult patients ( n = 646) with SAD and/or Pd-Ag on eight symptom domains based on a previous factor analysis of a commonly used separation anxiety measure, the ASA-27, as well as on the Anxiety Sensitivity Index. We also examined questionnaire items that did not load on the factor structure. All separation anxiety domains distinguished strongly between SAD and Pd-Ag. Comparisons across three groups (SAD alone, Pd-Ag alone and comorbid SAD/Pd-Ag) revealed that two symptom domains (anxiety about embarking on trips, and sleep disturbances) showed some overlap between Pd-Ag and SAD. Two of the items of the ASA-27 that did not load with other items in the factor analysis also showed overlap with Pd-Ag, with both referring to anxieties about leaving home. Patients with SAD (with or without Pd-Ag) returned higher scores on anxiety sensitivity than those with Pd-Ag alone. The findings support the distinctiveness of the construct of SAD and the capacity of the ASA-27 to discriminate between that disorder and Pd-Ag. SAD appears to be a more severe form of anxiety than Pd-Ag. There may be a need to refine items to include the reasons for avoiding leaving home, reluctance to sleep alone and to embark on trips, to ensure accurate discrimination between Pd-Ag and SAD in adulthood.

Measurement invariance of the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory,"The Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI) is a commonly used self-report measure of social phobia that has demonstrated adequate reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and criterion-related validity. However, research has yet to address whether this measure functions equivalently in (a) individuals with and without a diagnosis of social phobia and (b) males and females. Evaluating measurement equivalence/invariance is necessary in order to determine that the construct of social anxiety is interpreted similarly across these populations. The results of the current investigation, using a series of nested factorial models proposed by Vandenberg and Lance (2000), provide evidence for strong equivalence across 420 individuals with and without diagnoses of social phobia and across male and female samples. Accordingly, these results provide psychometric justification for comparison of SPAI scores across the symptom continuum and sexes.

A retrospective study of anxiety disorder diagnoses in the military from 2000 to 2009,"The objective of this study was to describe trends in the diagnostic rates for anxiety disorders (ADs) types in the U.S. military from 2000 to 2009. Data for the numbers of diagnosed cases for the first documented occurrence of ADs during ambulatory visits while serving in the military were obtained from the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database for all active duty service members and examined across branch of service and by gender. Results indicate that Anxiety Not Otherwise Specified (ANOS) was the most frequently diagnosed AD type in each of the 10 years between 2000 and 2009, with an average rate of 0.8 per 100 service members for first service occurrence, followed by PTSD at a rate of 0.5 out of every 100. Starting in 2002, the yearly first occurrence rates of ANOS and PTSD were significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.001) compared to each proceeding year, with the same pattern present among males and females separately. The majority of first occurrence AD diagnoses were diagnosed in the Army (47% of Anxiety NOS and 60% of PTSD cases) compared to the other service branches (i.e., Navy, Air Force, and Marines).

Concordance of self- and proxy-rated worry and anxiety symptoms in older adults with dementia,"We compared the psychometric performance of two validated self-report anxiety symptom measures when rated by people with dementia versus collaterals (as proxies). Forty-one participants with mild-to-moderate dementia and their respective collaterals completed the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, the Penn State Worry Questionnaire-Abbreviated, and a structured diagnostic interview. We used descriptive and nonparametric statistics to compare scores according to respondent characteristics. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated to establish the predictive validity of each instrument by rater type against a clinical diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Participant and collateral ratings performed comparably for both instruments. However, collaterals tended to give more severe symptom ratings, and the best-performing cut-off scores were higher for collaterals. Our findings suggest that people with mild-to-moderate dementia can give reliable self-reports of anxiety symptoms, with validity comparable to reports obtained from collaterals. Scores obtained from multiple informants should be interpreted in context.

Anxious youth in research and service clinics,"With the current focus on increasing utilization of empirically supported treatments, knowledge of sample differences and similarities has increasing importance. The present study compared anxiety-disordered youth (age 7–13) from (a) five Norwegian service clinics (SC, N = 111) to (b) a university research clinic (RC) in Philadelphia, USA ( N = 144) on pre-treatment characteristics measured by the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, Child Behavior Checklist, Teacher Report Form, Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule, and Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). SC youth demonstrated higher levels of anxiety based on child- ( d = 0.42–1.04) and parent-report ( d = 0.53) and conduct problems based on parent-report ( d = 0.43) compared to RC youth. SC youth was more functionally impaired on the CGAS ( d = 0.97), whereas RC youth evidenced a greater number of diagnoses ( d = 0.63). The two samples were equivalent regarding parent-reported symptoms of affective, somatic, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, and oppositional problems.

"Parental adjustment, parenting attitudes and emotional and behavioral problems in children with selective mutism","The present study investigated emotional and behavioral problems in children with selective mutism (SM) along with the psychological adjustment and parenting attitudes of their mothers and fathers. Participants included 26 children with SM (mean age = 8.11 ± 2.11 years), 32 healthy controls (mean age = 8.18 ± 2.55 years) and the parents of all children. Children with SM displayed higher problem scores than controls in a variety of emotional and behavioral parameters. They predominantly displayed internalizing problems, whereas aggressive and delinquent behavior was described among a subsample of the children. Significant differences existed between the SM and control groups only in paternal psychopathology, which included anxiety and depression. They did not differ with respect to maternal psychological distress or mother or father reported parental attitudes. Another important result of the present study was that the severity of emotional and behavioral problems of children with SM was correlated with maternal psychopathology but not paternal psychopathology.

Mediators of the relationship between social anxiety and post-event rumination,"A variety of cognitive and attentional factors are hypothesised to be associated with post-event rumination, a key construct that has been proposed to contribute to the maintenance of social anxiety disorder (SAD). The present study aimed to explore factors contributing to post-event rumination following delivery of a speech in a clinical population. 121 participants with SAD completed measures of trait social anxiety a week before they undertook a speech task. After the speech, participants answered several questionnaires assessing their state anxiety, self-evaluation of performance, perceived focus of attention and probability and cost of expected negative evaluation. One-week later, participants completed measures of negative rumination experienced over the week. Results showed two pathways leading to post-event rumination: (1) a direct path from trait social anxiety to post-event rumination and (2) indirect paths from trait social anxiety to post-event rumination via its relationships with inappropriate attentional focus and self-evaluation of performance. The results suggest that post event rumination is at least partly predicted by the extent to which socially anxious individuals negatively perceive their own performance and their allocation of attentional resources to this negative self-image. Current findings support the key relationships among cognitive processes proposed by cognitive models.

Risk of co-occuring psychopathology: Testing a prediction of expectancy theory,"Despite the high impact of anxiety sensitivity (AS; a fear of anxiety related sensations) research, almost no research attention has been paid to its parent theory, Reiss' expectancy theory (ET). ET has gone largely unexamined to this point, including the prediction that AS is a better predictor of number of fears than current anxiety. To test Reiss' prediction, we used a large ( N = 317) clinical sample of anxiety outpatients. Specifically, we examined whether elevated AS predicted number of comorbid anxiety and non-anxiety disorder diagnoses in this sample. Consistent with ET, findings indicated that AS predicted number of comorbid anxiety disorder diagnoses above and beyond current anxiety symptoms. Also, AS did not predict the number of comorbid non-anxiety diagnoses when current anxiety symptoms were accounted for. These findings represent an important examination of a prediction of Reiss' ET and are consistent with the idea that AS may be a useful transdiagnostic treatment target.

Pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders: Current treatments and future directions,"Modern pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders are safer and more tolerable than they were 30 years ago. Unfortunately, treatment efficacy and duration have not improved in most cases despite a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of anxiety. Moreover, innovative treatments have not reached the market despite billions of research dollars invested in drug development. In reviewing the literature on current treatments, we argue that evidence-based practice would benefit from better research on the causes of incomplete treatment response as well as the comparative efficacy of drug combinations and sequencing. We also survey two broad approaches to the development of innovative anxiety treatments: the continued development of drugs based on specific neuroreceptors and the pharmacological manipulation of fear-related memory. We highlight directions for future research, as neither of these approaches is ready for routine clinical use.

Interpretive style and intolerance of uncertainty in individuals with anxiety disorders: A focus on generalized anxiety disorder,"Interpretations of negative, positive, and ambiguous situations were examined in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), other anxiety disorders (ANX), and no psychiatric condition (CTRL). Additionally, relationships between specific beliefs about uncertainty (Uncertainty Has Negative Behavioral and Self-Referent Implications [IUS-NI], and Uncertainty Is Unfair and Spoils Everything [IUS-US]) and interpretations were explored. The first hypothesis (that the clinical groups would report more concern for negative, positive, and ambiguous situations than would the CTRL group) was supported. The second hypothesis (that the GAD group would report more concern for ambiguous situations than would the ANX group) was not supported; both groups reported similar levels of concern for ambiguous situations. Exploratory analyses revealed no differences between the GAD and ANX groups in their interpretations of positive and negative situations. Finally, the IUS-US predicted interpretations of negative and ambiguous situations in the full sample, whereas the IUS-NI did not. Clinical implications are discussed.

"""The sound of fear"": Assessing vocal fundamental frequency as a physiological indicator of social anxiety disorder","The relationship between vocal pitch and social anxiety disorder (SAD) has been examined with encouraging initial results, highlighting increased fundamental frequency (F0) as a physiological indicator of SAD. The present series of studies examined the relationship between F0 emitted during social threat and SAD symptoms. Two independent samples of SAD patients, and a sample of demographically-equivalent non-socially anxious controls (NSACs), completed varying social threat tasks which involved speech. Mean F0 emitted throughout the tasks was examined. Male SAD patients emitted greater F0 in comparison to NSACs across studies. For females, this relationship was significant only when examined in patients with SAD of the generalized subtype, and in response to in vivo social exposures. Furthermore, gender-specific thresholds for overall F0 emitted during social threat were identified which demonstrated excellent differentiation between patients with generalized SAD and NSACs. These results provide additional support for increased F0 as a physiological indicator of SAD.

Cannabis use and mental health-related quality of life among individuals with anxiety disorders,"Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in individuals with anxiety disorders. The aim of this study was to assess mental health-related quality of life (QoL) among individuals with anxiety disorders with and without concurrent cannabis use based on a large representative US sample. Mental health-related QoL of regular cannabis users ( N = 144), occasional cannabis users ( N = 181) and non-users ( N = 4427) was assessed using the Short-Form 12-Item Health Survey (SF-12). Among individuals with anxiety disorders, mean SF-12 mental summary scores were significantly lower (indicating a lower QoL) among regular, but not occasional, cannabis users (by 0.8 standard deviations (SDs) and 0.6SD for females and males, respectively) compared to non-users. Adjusting for sociodemographic variables and co-morbid mood disorders, regular, but not occasional, cannabis use was associated with lower mental health summary and subscales scores. Out results highlight the importance of taking into account direct functional and emotional outcomes, as well as frequency of cannabis used, when assessing the impact of cannabis use among individuals with anxiety disorders.

The restrictive concept of good health in patients with hypochondriasis,"The restrictive concept of good health and the misinterpretation of bodily symptoms as a sign of illness are considered in the DSM and in well-established cognitive models as central characteristics of hypochondriasis. However, until now it has not been satisfactorily resolved whether this tendency is unique for hypochondriasis. In the current study a modified card sorting technique was used to investigate the extent to which bodily complaints were seen as compatible with a state of good health. We found that patients with hypochondriasis ( n = 45) showed a more restrictive concept of good health than anxiety patients ( n = 45) and healthy controls ( n = 45). Those differences were only observable when a concrete evaluation of own bodily symptoms was carried out in comparison to a more general evaluation of symptoms. The misinterpretation of bodily symptoms demonstrates to be a highly specific characteristic of hypochondriasis.

Examination of a cutoff score for the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) in a non-clinical Spanish population,"We aimed to find a valid cutoff score for the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders , child (SCARED-C) and parent (SCARED-P) Spanish versions for detecting Anxiety Disorders (AD) in a non-clinical population. The predictive accuracy of the SCARED-C and SCARED-P was assessed using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of ROC curves. In general, the predictive accuracy of the SCARED-C (full version, short version, and four factors) was good and better than that of the SCARED-P. To differentiate between children who meet the diagnostic criteria for any AD and children who do not, we propose cutoff scores of 25 and 17 for the SCARED-C and SCARED-P, respectively. The sensitivities are 75.9% and 62.8%, and the specificities are 68.5% and 69.5%. The SCARED-C factor that had the best predictive accuracy was Somatic panic followed by Separation Anxiety, Generalized Anxiety and Social Phobia. The SCARED-P factor with the best predictive accuracy was Separation Anxiety. The results support the use of SCARED-C as a screening test for Anxiety disorders while SCARED-P should only be used as complementary information.

Aviophobia assessment: Validating the flight anxiety situations questionnaire as a clinical identification measure,"An Internet survey was conducted to validate the Flight Anxiety Situations Questionnaire (FAS; Van Gerwen, Spinhoven, Van Dyck, &amp; Diekstra, 1999) as a clinical identification measure for aviophobia. Nine hundred and seventy six people completed the survey. Using further criteria, the total pool was reduced to 98 aviophobics and 474 non-phobics. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and chi-square tests of associations indicated that minimal scores of 56 (as previously reported in research) and 70 on the FAS were useful predictors of being a flying phobic. However, the empirically derived cut-off score of 70 on the FAS had the best overall balance of Type I and Type II error, such that the diagnostic standard for flying phobia was set neither too low nor too high. Given that 60.3% of participants were university students, results may not be generalizable to the general population but may be particularly useful for researchers at these settings.

The structure of anxiety symptoms among adolescents in Iran: A confirmatory factor analytic study of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale,"The present study examined the psychometric properties of the Iranian translation of the Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS) in a large community sample of adolescents ( N = 1984), aged 12–17 years, in Ahvaz City, Iran. In addition to the SCAS, all participants completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC). The internal consistency (Cronbach Alpha = .92) and the validity of the Iranian translation of the SCAS was excellent. The SCAS total scores correlated significantly with the CES-DC, as well as with the emotional, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention, and peer problems subscales of the SDQ. However, Steiger’s Z test demonstrated that correlations between the SCAS scores and the SDQ conduct problems or hyperactivity-inattention subscales were significantly lower than the correlations between the SCAS scores and the SDQ emotional symptoms subscale. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed the same 6-factor structure as the original SCAS. The SCAS proved to be a reliable and valid measure of anxiety symptoms among adolescents in Iran.

Does disgust increase parasympathetic activation in individuals with a history of fainting? A psychophysiological analysis of disgust stimuli with and without blood–injection–injury association,"People with blood–injection–injury fear can faint when being confronted with blood, injections or injuries. Page (1994) holds that people with blood–injury phobia faint, because they are disgust sensitive and disgust facilitates fainting by eliciting parasympathetic activity. We tested the following two hypotheses: (1) Disgusting pictures elicit more disgust in blood–injection–injury-anxious people with a history of fainting than they do in controls. (2) Disgust causes parasympathetic activation. Subjects were 24 participants with high blood–injection–injury fear and a history of fainting in anxiety relevant situations and 24 subjects with average blood–injection–injury fear and no fainting history. We analyzed self-reported feelings of disgust, anxiety and faintness and reactions in heart rate, skin conductance, blood pressure and respiratory sinus arrhythmia during the confrontation with disgusting pictures with and without blood content. We did not find any evidence that the blood–injection–injury anxious subjects were more disgust sensitive than the control subjects and we also did not find any evidence that disgust elicits parasympathetic activation.

The relationships of child and parent factors with children's anxiety symptoms: Parental anxious rearing as a mediator,"A considerable body of research has identified various child and parent factors that contribute to and maintain anxiety symptoms in children. Yet relatively few studies have examined child factors (including threat-based cognitive bias, neuroticism, gender, puberty and age) as well as parent factors (including maternal anxiety and child-rearing style) in association with child anxiety symptoms, and the extent to which these factors serve as unique predictors of child anxiety. Moreover, research is lacking on whether parent factors such as child-rearing style, which is often targeted in early intervention and treatment programs, might mediate the association between child factors such as neuroticism, and child anxiety symptoms. In a sample of 85 children between 7 and 12 years of age with varying levels of anxiety, including those with diagnosed anxiety disorders, results showed that children were more anxious when they were reported to be more advanced in pubertal status by their parents, when they had a tendency to interpret more threat in ambiguous situations, and when they self-reported more neuroticism. Regarding parent factors, maternal self-reported trait anxiety and children’s perceptions of their mother as having an anxious child-rearing style were associated with higher levels of child anxiety. Moreover, when these correlates of child anxiety were examined in a multivariate model to identify those that had direct as well as indirect associations via maternal anxious child-rearing style, child neuroticism remained as a significant and unique predictor of child anxiety that was also mediated by maternal anxious-rearing. Child neuroticism also mediated the relationship between child pubertal stage and anxiety symptoms. Results are discussed in terms of relevant theory and empirical evidence regarding the roles of both child and parent factors in the development of child anxiety.

Psychometric properties of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) in Mainland Chinese children and adolescents,"This study examined the psychometric properties of the Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS) in a Mainland Chinese community sample. The 38-item Chinese version of SCAS was administered to 1878 children and adolescents. Multiple group confirmatory factor analyses supported a common 6-factor model of SCAS for children and adolescents, and for boys and girls. The internal consistency and test–retest reliability of SCAS were satisfactory. Convergent and divergent validity of SCAS were supported by significant correlations with a measure of anxiety to a greater extent than with a measure of depression. Adolescents reported higher anxiety levels than children, and girls reported higher anxiety levels than boys. Compared to other studies, anxiety symptoms of Chinese children were found at a moderate level, but anxiety symptoms of Chinese adolescents were found at a high level. Our findings suggest that the SCAS is suitable for assessing anxiety symptoms in Mainland Chinese children and adolescents.

Anxiety and its treatment: Promoting science-based practice,"In this article we analyze ways that psychological science can inform the treatment of anxiety disorders. We focus on experimental psychopathology research to describe the structure of anxiety and the functions of danger, safety, predictability and controllability in contributing to disorder. We then address science-based practice in terms of principles of change and the benefits from the self-corrective nature of science, contrasting this form of practice with treatments that are not grounded in basic learning theory. Models for dissemination and implementation of science-based practices are described and related to practitioner attitudes regarding scientific evidence. Finally, we consider practice implications when treatments are, and are not, based on the informative role of clinical psychological science.

The dimensionality of PTSD symptoms and their relationship to health-related quality of life in Chinese earthquake survivors,"The current study investigated the latent structure of PTSD symptoms with a sample of 326 Chinese survivors who lost their children during a deadly earthquake. The results of confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a five-factor intercorrelated model comprised of intrusion, avoidance, emotional numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxiety arousal provided significant better fit than both the four-factor numbing model of King, Leskin, King, and Weathers (1998) and the four-factor dysphoria model of Simms, Watson, and Doebbeling (2002). Further analyses with structural equation modeling showed that the PTSD factors were differentially associated with external measures of psychosocial and physical health-related quality of life. The findings provide further empirical support for the novel five-factor PTSD model, and carry implications for conceptualizing and assessing PTSD for the upcoming DSM-5 .

Examining the incremental contribution of behavioral inhibition to generalized anxiety disorder relative to other Axis I disorders and cognitive-emotional vulnerabilities,"The goal of the present study was to investigate the incremental contribution of behavioral inhibition system (BIS) sensitivity to the presence of a current generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) diagnosis relative to other Axis I disorders (e.g., major depression, other anxiety disorders) and cognitive-emotional vulnerabilities (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, emotion dysregulation) previously found to be associated with GAD. Participants were 91 individuals recruited from the local community who completed a diagnostic interview and self-report questionnaires. Consistent with expectations, BIS sensitivity emerged as a significant predictor of current GAD status above and beyond major depression, anxiety disorder diagnoses, anxiety sensitivity, emotion dysregulation, and behavioral activation system sensitivity. However, emotion dysregulation also emerged as a significant predictor of GAD status in the final model. Findings speak to the importance of considering BIS sensitivity in models of the development and maintenance of GAD.

Phenotypic and genetic structure of anxiety sensitivity in adolescence and early adulthood,"Anxiety sensitivity is a risk factor for emotional disorders. The structure of anxiety sensitivity was examined using phenotypic and genetic analyses. Self-reported anxiety sensitivity was measured at three time points from adolescence into young adulthood by 2651 individuals from the G1219 twin study. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed comparable statistical support for anxiety sensitivity models consisting of three or four dimensions across all time points. The three-factor model depicting Physical, Social and Mental anxiety-related concerns was favoured due to greater interpretability and parsimony. Multivariate quantitative genetic analyses supported a hierarchical structure with general genetic (.09–.61) and non-shared environmental (.39–.72) influences acting via a higher-order factor as well as dimension-specific genetic (.09–.21) and non-shared environmental (.23–.68) influences. The findings provide further evidence for a hierarchical structure underlying different dimensions of anxiety sensitivity.

Avoidant personality disorder in individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder: What does it add?,"Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) has a high level of symptom overlap and comorbidity with generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD). We examined whether the presence of comorbid AvPD adds significant clinically relevant information for individuals seeking treatment for GSAD. Results suggested that AvPD was significantly associated with poorer quality of life and greater disability in univariate, but not multivariate analyses. Endorsement of more AvPD symptoms was associated with increased disability, increased risk of intimacy, and lower social support, even after covariate adjustment. Specifically, AvPD item 3, hard to be “open” even with people you are close to, was most strongly correlated with quality of life and disability. A binary diagnosis of AvPD alone adds little beyond a marker of greater GSAD severity and depression among patients with GSAD, while a specific feature of AvPD not captured by the GSAD diagnosis, namely emotional guardedness, may be associated with greater impairment.

Brief internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety in older adults: A feasibility trial,"This study examined the efficacy of an Internet-delivered cognitive-behavior therapy program developed for older adults. Twenty-two participants with elevated scores (≥8) on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) participated in the course, which consisted of five lessons, homework tasks, additional resources, a moderated discussion forum, and weekly telephone support from a Clinical Psychologist. Ninety-five percent of the sample met diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder at pre-treatment. All participants completed the five lessons within the allotted eight weeks. Three-month follow-up data was collected from 95% of participants. Reductions in symptoms of anxiety and stress, with large within-group effect sizes (Cohen's d) were found on the GAD-7 ( d = 1.03) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales–21 Items ( d = 0.98) at follow-up. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. These encouraging results provide tentative support for the online treatment of older adults with anxiety.

Overprotective parenting and child anxiety: The role of co-occurring child behavior problems,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 27(2) of Journal of Anxiety Disorders (see record 2013-13831-014). The authors regret that some of the numbers describing the sample were accidentally based on a subsample of the data used in the original paper. The corrections are present in the erratum.] The relationship between overprotective parenting and child anxiety has been examined repeatedly because theories emphasize its role in the maintenance of child anxiety. No study has yet tested whether this relationship is unique to child anxiety, by controlling for commonly co-occurring behavior problems within the same children. The current study examined 190 children (age 7–13, 89 boys) referred to mental health clinics and their parents. Results revealed that significant correlations between overprotective parenting and child anxiety symptoms disappear after controlling for co-occurring child behavior symptoms. It appears that overprotection is not uniquely related to child anxiety. Furthermore, overprotective parenting was significantly and uniquely related to child behavior symptoms. Researchers and practitioners need to consider co-occurring child behavior problems when working with the parents of anxious children.

Persistence of anxiety disorders and concomitant changes in cortisol,"In a clinical sample of 116 children and adolescents we studied the relation between the course of an anxiety disorder during treatment and the concomitant changes in cortisol levels. Assessments at baseline, after three months, and at one-year follow-up were performed with the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule. When we compared cortisol levels at baseline and one-year follow-up, persistence of the anxiety disorder was associated with both increased daytime cortisol production ( F = 3.2, p = 0.04) and a trend towards a decreased cortisol morning rise ( F = 2.4, p = 0.09). At one-year follow-up daytime cortisol production was lowest in the early remitters (109.7± 29.2 hmmol/l), higher in the late remitters (121.0 ± 40.0 hmmol/l) and highest in the non-remitters (131.1 ± 48.9 hmmol/l). Early remitters had the highest cortisol morning rise (1.1 ± 1.5 hmmol/l), followed by the late remitters (0.8 ± 1.8hmmol/l), the non-remitters had the lowest cortisol morning rise (0.07 ± 1.7 hmmol/l) Persistence of an anxiety disorder may thus lead to changes in HPA-axis functioning, underscoring the importance adequate treatment of anxiety disorders.

Characterizing the association between parenting and adolescent social phobia,"Objectives: For characterizing the association between parenting and offspring social phobia (SP), contrasting maternal vs. paternal contributions, putative predictors of unfavorable parenting behaviors and its specificity for SP are warranted to delineate targeted prevention and intervention strategies. Methods: A population-based sample of 1053 adolescents was followed-up using the M-CIDI. Parenting was assessed via questionnaire in offspring passing the high risk period for SP-onset. Natal complications and childhood serious health problems as assessed by maternal reports were hypothesized to relate to unfavorable parenting. Results: The pattern of maternal overprotection, paternal rejection and lower emotional warmth was associated with SP, but not with other offspring anxiety disorders. Natal complications were related to overprotection and lower emotional warmth; trend-level associations emerged for serious health problems and unfavorable parenting. Conclusions: Paternal behavior appears particularly relevant for SP. The pattern of maternal overprotection, paternal rejection and lower emotional warmth was observed in SP only, suggesting that its detailed assessment provides a promising opportunity for targeted prevention and intervention in SP.

Corrigendum to “The cortisol awakening response as a function of PTSD severity and abuse chronicity in sheltered battered women” [J. Anxiety Disord. 22 (2008) 793–800],"Reports an error in ""The cortisol awakening response as a function of PTSD severity and abuse chronicity in sheltered battered women"" by Dawn M. Johnson, Douglas L. Delahanty and Keri Pinna ( Journal of Anxiety Disorders , 2008[Jun], Vol 22[5], 793-800). In conducting analyses for another manuscript the authors discovered a typographical error in the syntax for the formula used in calculating AUC G . The authors re-ran the analyses which resulted in different findings for abuse chronicity. The results are reported in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2008-06218-004). Although intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant social problem associated with severe psychiatric problems, most notably PTSD, only a handful of studies has examined PTSD and associated physiological factors in battered women. Further, no research to date has investigated impact of abuse chronicity on HPA functioning. The present study examined the impact of PTSD severity and abuse chronicity on the cortisol awakening response in a sample of 52 sheltered battered women. Results suggest that IPV-related PTSD and abuse chronicity have opposite effects on waking salivary cortisol curves in battered women. PTSD severity was associated with significantly greater cortisol output the first hour after awakening, while more chronic abuse was associated with lower total cortisol output in the first hour after awakening. Implications of findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Non-adherence and non-response in the treatment of anxiety disorders,"Among the best established treatments for anxiety disorders are cognitive-behavioral interventions and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Although clinically useful, these therapies are far from universally efficacious; some patients are unable to complete treatment, and many treatment completers fail to achieve clinically significant improvement. A review of meta-analyses on the treatment of anxiety disorders reveals that about a fifth of patients drop out prematurely and a third of treatment completers are classified as non-responders. In this article we examine the predictors of, and potential solutions for, the problems of treatment non-adherence and non-response to cognitive-behavioral and serotonergic treatments of adult anxiety disorders. Despite decades of research, few reliable predictors have been identified, and no predictor has been consistently supported in the literature. However, there is suggestive evidence that risk of premature dropout is associated with low treatment motivation, side effects, and practical barriers to attending sessions. There is also suggestive evidence that poor response is associated with severe pretreatment psychopathology and comorbidity, as well as high expressed emotion in the patient’s family environment. Methods for better estimating treatment prognosis are proposed and possible directions for improving treatment outcome are discussed.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder and comorbid depression: The role of OCD-related and non-specific factors,"Although comorbid depression is a predictor of poor treatment response in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), there is limited understanding of factors that contribute to depression severity in OCD. The current study examines the influence of OCD-related factors (autogenous obsessions and obsessional beliefs) and non-specific factors (avoidance and anxiety) on depression severity in a sample of OCD patients. There were 56 participants with only OCD and 46 with OCD and comorbid depression. Self-report questionnaires measuring depression, OCD-related factors, and non-specific factors were completed. Although there were no significant differences between the two groups on these variables, depression severity was positively correlated with anxiety, avoidance, obsessional beliefs, and autogenous obsessions in the whole sample. When entered into a multiple regression model to predict depression severity, these factors accounted for 51% of the variance. While OCD-related factors remained significant predictors after controlling for non-specific factors, the non-specific factors made the most significant contributions to the model. Our findings suggest that in addition to dealing with autogenous obsessions, addressing anxiety and avoidance might lead to improvements in the treatment of OCD with comorbid depression.

Treating ethnic minority adults with anxiety disorders: Current status and future recommendations,"The past three decades have witnessed an increase in the number of empirical investigations examining the phenomenology of anxiety and related conditions. There has also been an increase in efforts to understand differences that may exist between ethnic groups in the expression of the anxiety disorders. In addition, there is now substantial evidence that a variety of treatment approaches (most notably behavioral and cognitive behavioral) are efficacious in remediating anxiety. However, there continues to be comparatively few treatment outcome studies investigating the efficacy of anxiety treatments among minority populations. In this paper, we review the extant treatment outcome research for African American, Hispanic/Latino[a] American, Asian American, and Native Americans suffering with one of the anxiety disorders. We discuss some of the specific problems with the research in this area, and then provide specific recommendations for conducting treatment outcome research with minority populations in the future.

"The Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Project-Phase II (HARP-II): Rationale, methods, and features of the sample at intake","We describe the rationale, method, and intake demographic and clinical findings of the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Project-Phase II (HARP-II). HARP-II is the first prospective, observational, longitudinal study to describe the characteristics and course of anxiety in African American, Latino, and Non-Latino White individuals. Participants met criteria for at least one of the following disorders: Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia, Panic Disorder with or without Agoraphobia, Agoraphobia without history of Panic Disorder, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. Initial intake data, collected between 2004 and 2011, are presented for 165 African American, 150 Latino, and 172 Non-Latino White participants. Participants evidenced substantial psychiatric comorbidity (mean number of Axis I disorders = 3.4), and moderate to severe symptoms and functional impairment. HARP-II will examine clinical course, in the context of potential socio-cultural and individual moderators (e.g., discrimination, acculturation, negative affect). Results should lead to improved understanding, prognostics, and treatment of anxiety in diverse populations.

"Family orientation, language, and anxiety among low-income Latino youth","There is emerging evidence that Latino youth report higher levels of anxiety symptoms than children from other ethnic groups. Although often implicated, cultural variables have not been systematically evaluated to determine their relationship to anxiety symptoms in Latino youth. The present study examined family orientation values, as measured by family obligation and affiliative obedience, and their relationship to youth anxiety symptoms. The sample consisted of 133 Latino students (grades 5th through 7th) of low-income backgrounds in an urban public school setting. Structural equation models revealed that higher family orientation was associated with separation anxiety/panic (β = .32) and harm avoidance (β = .51). Models employing language proficiency and use mirrored those employing family orientation, suggesting that language fluency captures, in part, family socialization values. The results provide support for the impact of culture in the assessment and specific needs of Latino youth with anxiety problems.

Contextual factors and anxiety in minority and European American youth presenting for treatment across two urban university clinics,"The current study compared ethnic minority and European American clinically-referred anxious youth ( N = 686; 2–19 years) on internalizing symptoms (i.e., primary anxiety and comorbid depression) and neighborhood context. Data were provided from multiple informants including youth, parents, and teachers. Internalizing symptoms were measured by the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, Child Depression Inventory, Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher Report Form. Diagnoses were based on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children. Neighborhood context was measured using Census tract data (i.e., owner-occupied housing, education level, poverty level, and median home value). Ethnic minority and European American youth showed differential patterns of diagnosis and severity of anxiety disorders. Further, ethnic minority youth lived in more disadvantaged neighborhoods. Ethnicity and neighborhood context appear to have an additive influence on internalizing symptoms in clinically-referred anxious youth. Implications for evidence-based treatments are discussed.

Ethnoracial differences in anxiety sensitivity: Examining the validity of competing anxiety sensitivity index subscales,"Despite the increasing number of Americans who are considered to be a part of an ethnoracial minority group, there have been few investigations of the cross-cultural validity of measures of psychopathology. The limited existing literature suggests potential differences between African American (AA) and European American (EA) individuals with respect to the utility of self-report measures, including anxiety sensitivity. Physical, mental, and social domains of anxiety sensitivity are measured using subscales derived from a 3-factor model reported in EA samples despite evidence suggesting that anxiety sensitivity in AA samples is characterized by more distinct physical concerns. The current study compared the concurrent and predictive validity of the traditional anxiety sensitivity subscales representing 3 domains and a 4-subscale formulation based on predictions about the construct in AA samples. Comparisons of both AA ( N = 41) and EA ( N = 298) samples are included. Findings suggest some ethnoracial group differences in the concurrent and predictive validity of anxiety sensitivity subscales, specifically supporting the appropriateness and specificity of the 4-factor model of anxiety sensitivity in AA samples. Implications are discussed, including identification of sociocultural mechanisms that might influence psychometric properties of measures of anxiety.

"The acting White accusation, racial identity, and anxiety in African American adolescents","Acting White is one of the most negative accusations an African American adolescent can receive from another. The accusation can either be made directly or indirectly. Research suggests that receiving the accusation may create distress for some African American adolescents. The current study examined the relationship between experiencing the acting White accusation, racial identity, and anxiety among African American adolescents. High school students completed the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM), the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) and the Acting White Experiences Questionnaire (AWEQ). Results indicated that adolescents who both directly and indirectly experienced the AWA reported higher anxiety than those who only indirectly experienced the AWA. Additionally, adolescents who reported experiencing more indirect aspects of the accusation or being “bothered” more by the accusation reported higher levels of anxiety. Findings suggest that the acting White accusation may be a culturally relevant factor influencing anxiety among African American adolescents.

Functional impairment in social anxiety disorder,"The present study examined functional impairment among treatment seekers with social anxiety disorder (SAD). We investigated the effects of diagnostic subtypes of SAD and comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders on impairment. In addition, we used cluster analysis procedures to empirically identify subgroups of individuals with distinct patterns of impairment. Participants were 216 treatment-seeking individuals with SAD. Clinical interviews were undertaken to determine diagnoses of anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, and a battery of self-report measures was administered to index symptoms of social anxiety, depression and extent of impairment. Results indicated that individuals with the generalized subtype of SAD had greater impairment in all three life domains compared to individuals with the nongeneralized subtype. Comorbidity with mood disorders was associated with greater impairment than SAD alone, but comorbidity with anxiety disorders was not. Four distinct impairment profiles emerged from the cluster analysis: primary work/studies impairment, primary social life impairment, both work/studies and social impairment, and impairment in all domains. Findings from this study suggest that SAD is associated with substantial impairment across multiple domains, and that individuals with SAD present diverse impairment profiles. These profiles may inform subtyping of the disorder as well as therapeutic interventions.

Increasingly certain about uncertainty: Intolerance of uncertainty across anxiety and depression,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU)—a dispositional characteristic resulting from negative beliefs about uncertainty and its implications—may be an important construct in anxiety disorders and depression. Despite the potential importance of IU, clinical data on the construct remains relatively scant and focused on generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The present study systematically investigated IU, as measured by the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 (IUS-12), across groups diagnosed with anxiety disorders (i.e., social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder) or depression (clinical sample: n = 376; 61% women), as well as undergraduate ( n = 428; 76% women) and community samples ( n = 571; 67% women). Analysis of variance revealed only one statistically significant difference in IUS-12 scores across diagnostic groups in the clinical sample; specifically, people with social anxiety disorder reported higher scores ( p &lt; .01; η² = .03) than people with panic disorder. People diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or depression reported significantly and substantially higher IUS-12 scores relative to community and undergraduate samples. Furthermore, IUS-12 score distributions were similar across diagnostic groups as demonstrated by Kernel density estimations, with the exception of panic disorder, which may have a relatively flat distribution of IU. Response patterns were invariant across diagnostic groups as demonstrated by multi-group confirmatory factor analyses, but varied between clinical and nonclinical samples. Overall, the findings suggest IU may serve as an important transdiagnostic feature across anxiety disorders and depression. In addition, robust support was found for the proposed 2-factor model of the IUS-12. Comprehensive findings, implications, and future research directions are discussed.

Characteristics and anxiety symptom presentation associated with autism spectrum traits in youth with anxiety disorders,"There is limited information about the nature of anxiety among youth with symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study examined (a) differences in the clinical characteristics of anxious youth with and without symptoms of ASD and (b) the symptoms of anxiety that best distinguish between these groups. Results indicated that anxious youth with elevated ASD symptoms had significantly more diagnoses (e.g., specific phobias), and were more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for social phobia (and list social concerns among their top fears) than youth without elevated ASD symptoms. At the symptom level, severity of interpersonal worry based on parent report and severity of fear of medical (doctor/dentist) visits based on youth report best differentiated ASD status. The findings inform diagnostic evaluations, case conceptualization, and treatment planning for youth with anxiety disorders and ASD symptoms.

CBT for the treatment of child anxiety disorders: A review of why parental involvement has not enhanced outcomes,"Anxiety affects 10% of all children and disrupts educational, socio-emotional development and overall functioning of the child and family. Research has shown that parenting factors (i.e. intrusiveness, negativity, distorted cognitions) contribute to the development and maintenance of childhood anxiety. Recent studies have therefore investigated if the treatment effect of traditional cognitive behavioural therapy may be enhanced by adding a parental component. However, randomised controlled trials have not shown unequivocal support for this assumption. The results are inconsistent and ambiguous. This article investigates possible reasons for this inconsistency and in particular differences in methodology and the theoretical relevance of the applied parental components are highlighted as possible contributory factors. Another factor is that treatment effect is mainly measured by change in the child’s diagnostic status rather than changes in parental or family functioning.

Robust dimensions of anxiety sensitivity: Development and initial validation of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3). Psychological Assessment, 19 , 176–188] measures three dimensions of AS: physical concerns, social concerns, and cognitive concerns. The ASI-3 shows promise, although further evaluation of its psychometric properties and validity in independent samples is needed. We evaluated the ASI-3 in a mixed sample of anxiety disorder patients ( N = 506) and undergraduate student controls ( N = 315). The measure demonstrated a stable 3-factor structure and sound psychometric properties, with the three factors showing theoretically consistent patterns of associations with anxiety symptoms and diagnoses. ASI-3 total scores were less discriminative. Implications for conceptual models of anxiety are discussed.

A multisite randomized controlled effectiveness trial of cognitive processing therapy for military-related posttraumatic stress disorder,"Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is currently applied in military veteran mental health services in many countries. This study tests the effectiveness of community-administered CPT for military-related PTSD under randomized controlled conditions. Fifty-nine treatment-seeking veterans with military-related PTSD were randomly allocated to receive 12 twice-weekly 60 min sessions of CPT or an equivalent period of usual treatment at veterans’ community based counseling services. Intent to treat analyses found significantly greater improvement for participants receiving CPT over usual treatment at post-treatment and 3 month follow-up. CPT also produced greater improvements in anxiety, depression, social and dyadic relationships than usual treatment. No CPT related adverse events occurred during the trial. This trial reports the first randomized controlled trial evidence that CPT is an effective treatment for military PTSD and co-morbid conditions when compared to usual treatment and delivered in community settings by clinicians from diverse disciplines, preferred treatment orientation and levels of experience.

Mood regulation and quality of life in social anxiety disorder: An examination of generalized expectancies for negative mood regulation,"The present study examined negative mood regulation expectancies, anxiety symptom severity, and quality of life in a sample of 167 patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and 165 healthy controls with no DSM-IV Axis I disorders. Participants completed the Generalized Expectancies for Negative Mood Regulation Scale (NMR), the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. SAD symptom severity was assessed using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Individuals with SAD scored significantly lower than controls on the NMR. Among SAD participants, NMR scores were negatively correlated with anxiety symptoms and SAD severity, and positively correlated with quality of life. NMR expectancies positively predicted quality of life even after controlling for demographic variables, comorbid diagnoses, anxiety symptoms, and SAD severity. Individuals with SAD may be less likely to engage in emotion regulating strategies due to negative beliefs regarding their effectiveness, thereby contributing to poorer quality of life.

"Psychometric properties of the GAD-Q-IV and DERS in older, community-dwelling GAD patients and controls","Thirty-seven community-dwelling, older generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients and 37 nonanxious controls completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire for DSM-IV (GAD-Q-IV; Newman et al., 2002), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004), and other measures of anxiety and depression. The GAD-Q-IV and DERS were assessed for internal consistency reliability, construct validity, and test–retest reliability, with results indicating good psychometric performance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis conducted on the full sample suggested that the optimal GAD-Q-IV cutoff for classifying GAD cases was 3.71, with .97 sensitivity and .92 specificity. The cutoff score for classifying those participants with GAD and comorbid conditions was higher, however. ROC analysis with the full sample revealed an optimal DERS cutoff score of 62.5, with .76 sensitivity and .86 specificity. Findings support the use of the GAD-Q-IV and DERS as screening instruments for GAD in older, community-dwelling adults in a research setting.

Psychometric properties of the Dutch version of the Meta-Cognitions Questionnaire-Adolescent Version (MCQ-A) in non-clinical adolescents and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Although the meta-cognitive model (Wells, 1997, 2000) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has clearly influenced research and treatment of OCD, little research has been performed in youth samples. In the present study the psychometric properties of the Dutch Meta-Cognitions Questionnaire-Adolescent Version (MCQ-A; Cartwright-Hatton et al., 2004) were examined in a clinical sample of adolescents with OCD ( N = 40, 12–18 years) and a non-clinical sample ( N = 317; 12–18 years). Results provided support for the 5-factor structure, and showed fair to good internal consistency and generally good retest reliability. Overall, adolescents with OCD reported more meta-cognitive beliefs than non-clinical adolescents. Several subscales were associated with self-reported obsessive-compulsive symptoms, anxiety and depression, but not with clinician-rated OCD severity. In conclusion, results suggest that the Dutch MCQ-A is a reliable and valid questionnaire to examine meta-cognitive beliefs in adolescents.

The effect of facial blood flow on ratings of blushing and negative affect during an embarrassing task: Preliminary findings,"Expecting to blush is a common source of social anxiety, and is associated with heightened perceptions of blushing and embarrassment. To assess whether sensory cues associated with heightened facial blood flow are an additional source of anxiety, the vasodilator niacin (100 mg) or placebo was administered double-blind to 33 participants, and facial blood flow was investigated when they sang a children’s song. Vasodilatation during singing was greater in the niacin than placebo condition, and niacin-evoked flushing and increases in pulse rate were greater in participants with high than low fear of negative evaluation. Nevertheless, ratings of embarrassment, anxiety, blushing and facial heat were similar in both drug conditions. This dissociation implies that cognitive appraisals or negative affect overrode more subtle physiological cues of blushing during embarrassment. Clarifying how judgments about blushing are made could be crucial for correcting faulty assumptions about blushing in people who are frightened of this response.

Social anxiety and cannabis use: An analysis from ecological momentary assessment,"Individuals with elevated social anxiety appear especially vulnerable to cannabis-related problems, yet little is known about the antecedents of cannabis-related behaviors among this high-risk population. The present study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine the relations among social anxiety, cannabis craving, state anxiety, situational variables, and cannabis use in the natural environment during ad-lib cannabis use episodes. Participants were 49 current cannabis users. During the two-week EMA period, social anxiety significantly interacted with cannabis craving to predict cannabis use both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Specifically, individuals with higher social anxiety and craving were most likely to use cannabis. There was a significant social anxiety ×state anxiety ×others’ use interaction such that when others were using cannabis, those with elevations in both trait social anxiety and state anxiety were the most likely to use cannabis.

Cost-effectiveness of child-focused and parent-focused interventions in a child anxiety prevention program,"In this study, the cost-effectiveness of three indicated anxiety prevention strategies was examined from a societal perspective. Children (aged 8–12) were recruited via primary schools, selecting children scoring as high-anxious on an anxiety screening questionnaire. Participating children and their parents were randomized to a child—a parent-focused, or non-intervention group. All groups completed a diagnostic interview and standardized cost-diaries at pretest, and 1- and 2-year follow-up. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per ‘ADIS improved’ child (based on diagnostic information) were calculated and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and frontiers were plotted. The base-case and most secondary analyses showed it would be cost-effective to offer high-anxious children an intervention, and the parent-focused intervention to be the optimal strategy at lower monetary threshold values than the child-focused intervention and when parents were anxious. The child-focused intervention was dominant when analyses were performed from a healthcare perspective, for boys, and for children of grades 7–8 of primary school.

Dimensional indicators of generalized anxiety disorder severity for DSM-V,"For DSM-V, simple dimensional measures of disorder severity will accompany diagnostic criteria. The current studies examine convergent validity and test–retest reliability of two potential dimensional indicators of worry severity for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): percent of the day worried and number of worry domains. In study 1, archival data from diagnostic interviews from a community sample of individuals diagnosed with one or more anxiety disorders ( n = 233) were used to assess correlations between percent of the day worried and number of worry domains with other measures of worry severity (clinical severity rating (CSR), age of onset, number of comorbid disorders, Penn state worry questionnaire (PSWQ)) and DSM-IV criteria (excessiveness, uncontrollability and number of physical symptoms). Both measures were significantly correlated with CSR and number of comorbid disorders, and with all three DSM-IV criteria. In study 2, test–retest reliability of percent of the day worried and number of worry domains were compared to test–retest reliability of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria in a non-clinical sample of undergraduate students ( n = 97) at a large west coast university. All measures had low test–retest reliability except percent of the day worried, which had moderate test–retest reliability. Findings suggest that these two indicators capture worry severity, and percent of the day worried may be the most reliable existing indicator. These measures may be useful as dimensional measures for DSM- (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",1001919844," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2012
Enhanced anger superiority effect in generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder,"People are typically faster and more accurate to detect angry compared to happy faces, which is known as the anger superiority effect. Many cognitive models of anxiety suggest anxiety disorders involve attentional biases towards threat, although the nature of these biases remains unclear. The present study used a Face-in-the-Crowd task to investigate the anger superiority effect in a control group and patients diagnosed with either generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or panic disorder (PD). The main finding was that both anxiety groups showed an enhanced anger superiority effect compared to controls, which is consistent with key theories of anxiety. Furthermore, both anxiety groups showed a differential pattern of enhanced bias towards threat depending on the crowd in the displays. The different attentional bias patterns between the GAD and PD groups may be related to the diverse symptoms in these disorders. These findings have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety.

"Treatment sensitivity of implicit threat evaluation, avoidance tendency and visual working memory bias in specific phobia","Cognitive theories of anxiety postulate that negative processing biases play a causal role in the pathogenesis of a disorder, while a normalisation of bias drives recovery. To test these assumptions it is essential to investigate whether biases seen in anxiety are treatment-sensitive, or whether they instead represent enduring vulnerability factors. Twenty-nine spider fearfuls were tested before and after brief cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT), with half of them additionally being tested before a waiting period to control for retest effects. Using three cognitive bias tasks, we measured implicit threat evaluation (Extrinsic Affective Simon Task), avoidance tendency (Approach-Avoidance Task), and working memory for threat. CBT significantly enhanced negative implicit evaluation and avoidance. This indicates that these cognitive biases are no stable risk factors and provides further evidence for their potential key role in the development and remission of anxiety.

Examining potential risk factors for anxiety in early childhood,"Anxiety disorders are amongst the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, with occurrence emerging early in the developmental trajectory. This study was one of the first to investigate potential risk factors for anxiety (i.e., behavioural inhibition, parental negative affect, parenting stress) in early childhood. Examination of risk factors was achieved through structural equation modelling and based on mothers’ and fathers’ report of 236 preschool aged children (4–6 years) in Brisbane, Australia. The structural model was found to fit the data well. All direct predictors of early childhood anxiety were significant and behavioural inhibition partially mediated parents’ negative affectivity and mother’s parenting stress. Results highlight the unique contribution of both parents in the aetiology of early childhood anxiety and assist in informing the development of intervention and prevention programs for young children.

Assessing a five factor model of PTSD: Is dysphoric arousal a unique PTSD construct showing differential relationships with anxiety and depression?,"Posttraumatic stress disorder’s (PTSD) latent structure has been widely debated. To date, two four-factor models (Numbing and Dysphoria) have received the majority of factor analytic support. Recently, Elhai et al. (2011) proposed and supported a revised (five-factor) Dysphoric Arousal model. Data were gathered from two separate samples; War veterans and Primary Care medical patients. The three models were compared and the resultant factors of the Dysphoric Arousal model were validated against external constructs of depression and anxiety. The Dysphoric Arousal model provided significantly better fit than the Numbing and Dysphoria models across both samples. When differentiating between factors, the current results support the idea that Dysphoric Arousal can be differentiated from Anxious Arousal but not from Emotional Numbing when correlated with depression. In conclusion, the Dysphoria model may be a more parsimonious representation of PTSD’s latent structure in these trauma populations despite superior fit of the Dysphoric Arousal model.

Psychometric properties of the Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire in a clinical sample,"Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is thought to contribute to the maintenance of many emotional disorders. Although several measures of RNT are available, the items of most of these instruments index RNT that is specific to particular diagnostic groups (e.g., RNT about depression symptoms). This has limited our ability to examine the relevance of RNT across diagnostic groups and advance our understanding of RNT as a transdiagnostic process. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire (RTQ), a transdiagnostic measure of RNT. In a clinical sample of individuals with anxiety and depressive disorders ( N = 186), the RTQ demonstrated good internal consistency, convergent, and divergent validity. Supporting the transdiagnostic nature of the measure, the Repetitive Negative Thinking subscale of the RTQ was associated with a variety of negative emotions and metacognitive beliefs, and significantly predicted symptoms of multiple disorders when controlling for neuroticism. Our findings support the use of the RTQ as a transdiagnostic, trans-emotional measure of maladaptive repetitive thought following distressing events, with scope to increase efficiency and reduce burden on patients by assessing RNT in clinical settings with one short measure. Experimental and longitudinal research identifying mechanisms driving RNT using the RTQ would be informative for theory and treatment developments.

Gender differences in social anxiety disorder: Results from the national epidemiologic sample on alcohol and related conditions,"This study examined gender differences among persons with lifetime social anxiety disorder (SAD). Data were derived from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions ( n = 43,093), a survey of a representative community sample of the United States adult population. Diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were based on the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule—DSM-IV Version. The lifetime prevalence of SAD was 4.20% for men and 5.67% for women. Among respondents with lifetime SAD, women reported more lifetime social fears and internalizing disorders and were more likely to have received pharmacological treatment for SAD, whereas men were more likely to fear dating, have externalizing disorders, and use alcohol and illicit drugs to relieve symptoms of SAD. Recognizing these differences in clinical symptoms and treatment-seeking of men and women with SAD may be important for optimizing screening strategies and enhancing treatment efficacy for SAD.

Interventions for generalized anxiety disorder in older adults: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Introduction: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders in later life, with widespread consequences for individuals and society. Objective: To perform a systematic review of the efficacy of controlled interventions for GAD in adults aged 55 years and older. Method: Direct search of digital databases and the main publications on aging and iterative searches of the references from retrieved articles. Results: Twenty-seven trials (14 pharmacological, 13 psychotherapeutic) fulfilled the inclusion criteria, reporting results from 2373 baseline participants. There were no differences between trials in their overall quality. Pooled treatment effects for pharmacological (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.54) and psychotherapeutic (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.66) trials were similar, with findings in each case favoring active interventions over control conditions. Conclusions: Older adults with GAD benefited from both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Future studies should investigate combined treatment with medication and psychotherapy.

"""Cognitive processing and acrophobia: Validating the heights interpretation questionnaire."": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Cognitive processing and acrophobia: Validating the heights interpretation questionnaire"" by Shari A. Steinman and Bethany A. Teachman ( Journal of Anxiety Disorders , 2011[Oct], Vol 25[7], 896-902). The authors regret errors in the original paper due to the mean of the HIQ calculated incorrectly (specifically, the average item score was multiplied by 18 to create the total, instead of by 16). Additionally, the statistics reported in Table 4 are incorrect (due to an incorrect version of the predictor variable being used): Please note that the errors do not change any of the conclusions drawn in the original paper (e.g., all results that were significant in the paper remain significant with these errors corrected). The corrections are also present in this erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2011-17425-004). Three studies were conducted to examine the psychometric properties of a new scale: the Heights Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ). This scale was designed to measure height fear-relevant interpretation bias to help assess the relationship between biased interpretations and acrophobia symptoms. Studies 1 ( N = 553) and 2 ( N = 308) established the scale’s factor structure and convergent and discriminant validity among two large undergraduate samples. Study 3 ( N = 48) evaluated the predictive validity of the HIQ by examining how well the scale predicted subjective distress and avoidance on actual heights. Factor analysis resulted in four distinct factors, and results suggest that each of the factors, along with the full HIQ, have good reliability and validity. Additionally, the scale predicts subjective distress and avoidance on heights beyond self-reported acrophobia symptoms. Overall, the HIQ shows promise as a new tool to investigate cognitive processing biases in acrophobia.

Should health anxiety be carved at the joint? A look at the health anxiety construct using factor mixture modeling in a non-clinical sample,"Cognitive-behavioral models conceptualize health anxiety as a construct that varies in degree along a continuum rather than existing as nonpathological versus pathological classes or taxons. Only two studies have empirically evaluated the latent structure of health anxiety, both using taxometric statistical methods and both supporting its conceptualization as continuous (Ferguson, 2009; Longley et al., 2010). We sought to further evaluate the latent structure of health anxiety using factor mixture modeling (FMM), which involved a combination of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and mixture modeling that allowed comparison of models comprising one or more latent classes. Health anxiety symptom data were obtained from the Illness Attitude Scales (IAS) administered to 1768 university undergraduate students. Indicators of health anxiety, derived from EFA of IAS item data, included disease worry, disease conviction, health-related safety behaviors, fear of death, somatic focus, interference due to symptoms, and treatment seeking. FMM of these indicators suggested that health anxiety consists of two classes: (a) an “anxious” class comprising 81.4% of the sample and characterized primarily by somatic focus and interference due to symptoms, and (b) a “nonanxious” class comprising 18.6% of the sample with low scores on all indicators. Contrary to current conceptualizations and taxometric findings, the FMM results indicate the latent structure of health anxiety to be taxonic rather than continuous. Implications for the measurement and conceptualization of health anxiety are discussed and future research directions are highlighted.

A meta-analysis of the cross-cultural psychometric properties of the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C),"Several studies have found that the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C), an empirically derived self-report instrument to assess DSM-IV social phobia in childhood and adolescence, has good psychometric properties. While these findings were replicated across different cultures, the overall strength of the psychometric properties of the SPAI-C remains unknown. We assessed the validity of the SPAI-C by meta-analytic techniques across studies collected from PubMed, PsycInfo and Eric databases, conducted in different countries, among subjects of different age, and sex. A total of 21 articles were retained, predominantly from Europe and North America. We found that the psychometric properties based on Cronbach alpha, mean score differences between sexes, and construct validity, were robust for the SPAI-C scale. Girls scored significantly higher than boys, and geographical differences played a moderating effect on sex-related score differences. These results further support the SPAI-C as an instrument to identify Social Phobia in youth.

Main and interactive effects of emotion dysregulation and breath-holding duration in relation to panic-relevant fear and expectancies about anxiety-related sensations among adult daily smokers,"The current study investigated the main and interactive effects of emotion dysregulation and distress tolerance in relation to panic-relevant variables among daily smokers. The sample consisted of 172 adults (61.2% male; M age = 31.58, SD = 11.51), who reported smoking an average of 15.99 cigarettes per day ( SD = 10.00). Results indicated that both emotion dysregulation and distress tolerance were significantly related to interoceptive fear and agoraphobia. Additionally, emotion dysregulation, but not distress tolerance, was significantly related to anxiety sensitivity. All effects were evident above and beyond the variance accounted for by average cigarettes per day, tobacco-related physical illness, and panic attack history. The interaction between emotion dysregulation and distress tolerance significantly predicted interoceptive and agoraphobic fears as well as the cognitive component of anxiety sensitivity. Such findings underscore the importance of emotion dysregulation and distress tolerance in regard to panic-specific fear and expectancies about anxiety-related sensations among daily smokers.

The hierarchical model of social interaction anxiety and depression: The critical roles of fears of evaluation,"In this paper, we articulate a hierarchical model of social interaction anxiety (SIA) and depression to account for their comorbidity and the uniqueness of SIA. First, negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA) are conceptualized as general factors shared by SIA and depression; the fear of negative evaluation (FNE) is operationalized as the specific factor, which accounts for more of the variance in SIA than in depression, and the fear of positive evaluation (FPE) is operationalized as the factor unique to SIA. FPE is the key feature that differentiates SIA from depression. Second, the proposed hierarchical model describes structural relationships among these factors, in which the higher-level factors (i.e., high NA and low PA) represent the vulnerability markers of both SIA and depression and the lower-level factors (i.e., FNE and FPE) are the dimensions of specific cognitive features. In addition, an alternative model, in which all of the relationships are the same, except that FPE is operationalized as a specific factor, is proposed to clarify the role of FPE. The results from the hierarchical regression and the structural equation modeling support the hypothesized hierarchical model. Further theoretical and practical implications for FPE and the multilevel model are discussed.

Sex differences in panic-relevant responding to a 10% carbon dioxide-enriched air biological challenge,"The current study examined sex differences in psychological (i.e., self-reported anxiety, panic symptoms, and avoidance) and physiological (i.e., heart rate and skin conductance level) response to, and recovery from, a laboratory biological challenge. Participants were a community-recruited sample of 128 adults (63.3% women; M age = 23.2 years, SD = 8.9) who underwent a 4-min 10% CO₂-enriched air biological challenge. As predicted, women reported more severe physical panic symptoms and avoidance (i.e., less willingness to participate in another challenge) and demonstrated increased heart rate as compared to men above and beyond the variance accounted for by other theoretically relevant variables (recent panic attack history, neuroticism, and anxiety sensitivity). Additionally, women demonstrated a faster rate of recovery with respect to heart rate compared to men. These results are in line with literature documenting sex-specific differences in panic psychopathology, and results are discussed in the context of possible mechanisms underlying sex differences in panic vulnerability.

Anxiety sensitivity and breath-holding duration in relation to PTSD symptom severity among trauma exposed adults,"The present investigation examined the main and interactive effects of anxiety sensitivity and behavioral distress tolerance, indexed using the breath-holding task, in relation to PTSD symptom severity among trauma-exposed adults. Participants were 88 adults (63.6% women; M age = 22.9, SD = 9.1, range = 18–62), recruited from the community, who met DSM-IV-TR PTSD Criterion A for lifetime trauma exposure. Covariates included number of potentially traumatic events, nonclinical panic attack history, and participant sex. Anxiety sensitivity was significantly incrementally associated with PTSD total symptom severity, as well as Avoidance and Hyperarousal symptom severity ( p’s &lt; .01). Breath-holding duration was not significantly related to PTSD symptom severity ( p’s &gt; .05). However, breath-holding duration emerged as a significant moderator of the association between anxiety sensitivity and PTSD Avoidance symptom severity, such that lower breath-holding duration exacerbated the effect of heightened anxiety sensitivity with regard to PTSD Avoidance symptom severity.

Patterns of anxiety symptoms in toddlers and preschool-age children: Evidence of early differentiation,"The degree to which young children’s anxiety symptoms differentiate according to diagnostic groupings is under-studied, especially in children below the age of 4 years. Theoretical (confirmatory factor analysis, CFA) and statistical (exploratory factor analysis, EFA) analytical methods were employed to test the hypothesis that anxiety symptoms among 2–3-year-old children from a non-clinical, representative sample would differentiate in a manner consistent with current diagnostic nosology. Anxiety symptom items were selected from two norm-referenced parent-report scales of child behavior. CFA and EFA results suggested that anxiety symptoms aggregate in a manner consistent with generalized anxiety, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, separation anxiety, and social phobia. Multi-dimensional models achieved good model fit and fit the data significantly better than undifferentiated models. Results from EFA and CFA methods were predominantly consistent and supported the grouping of early childhood anxiety symptoms into differentiated, diagnostic-specific categories.

Predictors of outcome in a cognitive-behavioral group program for children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder,"The present study examined predictors of treatment outcome among children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Seventy-five participants (8–13 years) participated in a 12-session cognitive behavioral group treatment (CBT). Potential predictors were the pre-treatment severity of anxious symptoms assessed from both the child’s and parent’s perspective as well as depressive symptoms (child report only) and general emotional distress in parent (parent self-report). Furthermore, the relationship between treatment outcome and child’s self-reported pre–post changes in self-consciousness and maladaptive anxiety regulation was investigated. Pre-treatment level of social anxiety reported by the child was a significant predictor for outcome, i.e. children with higher levels of social anxiety at pretreatment reported a greater reduction in social anxiety at post-treatment. Reduction in self-consciousness and maladaptive anxiety regulation both predicted reduction in social anxiety, although not independently. The results suggest that tailoring intervention to include strategies for emotion regulation of anxiety may improve treatment outcome.

The co-occurrence of anxiety disorders in African American parents and their children,"This study examined the co-occurrence of anxiety disorders, specifically the relationship between parent and youth anxiety, in a community-based sample of 100 African American parents and their biological child between the ages of 6 and 17 years. Data were provided by both the parent and child. Parents completed the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (ADIS-IV) Client Version about their own experiences with anxiety and related disorders and the Parent version for the child’s experiences. Children were administered the ADIS-IV Child version to assess their experiences with anxiety and related disorders. Fifty-five parents met criteria for at least one anxiety disorder while 34 children met criteria for at least one anxiety disorder. Two logistic regressions were subsequently conducted to predict the presence of any form of psychopathology from the ADIS-IV and the presence of an anxiety disorder in African American offspring. Results indicated that African American offspring with an anxious parent were 4 times more likely to meet criteria for both an anxiety disorder and other forms of psychopathology.

Seeking safety on the internet: Relationship between social anxiety and problematic internet use,"As internet use becomes increasingly integral to modern life, the hazards of excessive use are also becoming apparent. Prior research suggests that socially anxious individuals are particularly susceptible to problematic internet use. This vulnerability may relate to the perception of online communication as a safer means of interacting, due to greater control over self-presentation, decreased risk of negative evaluation, and improved relationship quality. To investigate these hypotheses, a general sample of 338 completed an online survey. Social anxiety was confirmed as a significant predictor of problematic internet use when controlling for depression and general anxiety. Social anxiety was associated with perceptions of greater control and decreased risk of negative evaluation when communicating online, however perceived relationship quality did not differ. Negative expectations during face-to-face interactions partially accounted for the relationship between social anxiety and problematic internet use. There was also preliminary evidence that preference for online communication exacerbates face-to-face avoidance.

"Gender, gender roles, and anxiety: Perceived confirmability of self report, behavioral avoidance, and physiological reactivity","Despite the well-documented gender effect in anxiety, less is known about contributing factors to women’s greater risk for anxiety and fears. The present study examined the relationship between gender, gender role orientation (i.e., expressivity/instrumentality) and fear of harmless insects (tarantula), using a multimodal approach of self-report measures, a Behavioral Approach Test (BAT), and physiological reactivity. Participants (144 college students; 67 women, 77 men) completed a questionnaire packet and then were instructed to approach a tarantula. We were unable to replicate Pierce and Kirkpatrick’s (1992) findings that men underreport anxiety. Consistent with the literature, women in the study experienced greater anxiety and avoidance compared to men. However, men and women did not differ on physiological reactivity during the first 2 min of the BAT. The concordance across avoidance, anxiety and heart rate reactivity differed by gender, suggesting that men and women have different experiences when faced with a fearful object. Furthermore, instrumentality (masculinity) was negatively related to anticipatory anxiety for women but not for men.

Cyberchondriasis: Fact or fiction? A preliminary examination of the relationship between health anxiety and searching for health information on the Internet,"This study examined the relationship between health anxiety and searching for health information online, a phenomenon dubbed ‘cyberchondria’. The majority of those with ‘high’ ( n =46) and ‘low’ ( n =36) levels of health anxiety reported seeking health information online. However, those with higher levels of health anxiety sought online health information more frequently, spent longer searching, and found searching more distressing and anxiety provoking. Furthermore, more responses in the high than low health anxiety group related to searching for information on diagnosed and undiagnosed medical conditions, descriptions of others’ experiences of illnesses and using message boards/support groups, although the largest proportion of responses in both groups was accounted for by seeking information on symptoms. Linear regression ( n =167) revealed significant relationships between health anxiety and the frequency, duration and distress and anxiety associated with searching for health information online. This preliminary data suggests that searching for health information online may exacerbate health anxiety.

Videoconference- and cell phone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder: A case series,"For most patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) the availability of exposure-based therapy is limited. In our study six outpatients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) received 15 sessions of therapy delivered only over teleconference (six sessions) and cell phones (nine sessions) over a 3-month period of time. Five of the patients were women and the average age of the participants was 31.5 (SD=8.1). Patients presented a variety of OCD symptoms which were treated with standard exposure and response prevention exercises both during treatment sessions and as a part of homework exercises. All patients rated the treatment format as acceptable and rated the quality of the working alliance as high. At the end of therapy four of the six patients were highly improved and no longer met diagnostic criteria for OCD according to the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. The same was true at 3-month follow-up although some small increases in OCD symptoms had occurred. The innovative treatment format shows promise as a method of delivery that may make treatment accessible for patients with poor access to specialty clinics.

Assessing the latent structure of the intolerance of uncertainty construct: An initial taxometric analysis,"Researchers have increasingly suggested that people with anxiety disorders share a common fear that the uncertain future will be catastrophic. Intolerance of uncertainty (IU)—the tendency to consider possible negative events as unacceptable and threatening, irrespective of probabilities—is representative of such fears. A key role has been indicated for IU in several anxiety and mood disorders; however, the present study appears to be the first latent structure examination of IU. Responses were obtained from a large sample ( n =977; 65% women) unselected with regard to IU level, comprising anxiety disorder outpatients (i.e., putative taxon members), and community residents (i.e., putative complement class members). MAXEIG, MAMBAC, and L-Mode were performed with indicator sets drawn from the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12. Assessments also included objective Comparison Curve Fit Indices. Results yielded converging evidence that IU symptoms have a dimensional latent structure. Comprehensive findings, implications, and future research directions are discussed.

Changes in risk-taking over the course of an internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy treatment for generalized anxiety disorder,"It has been proposed that a persistent and pervasive tendency to avoid risks is involved in the development and maintenance of clinically significant anxiety. Few studies, however, have examined the clinical implications of risk-aversion, and particularly the association between risk-aversion and treatment outcome. The current study investigated how risk-aversion in specific domains (Social and Recreational) related to treatment outcome in a clinical sample of patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) undergoing internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). We hypothesized that: (i) risk-taking would increase as a result of treatment and (ii) risk-taking would mediate changes in symptom severity and impairment as a result of treatment. Individuals recruited online ( N =44) meeting diagnostic criteria for GAD were randomized to the treatment ( n =24) or control group ( n =20). Participants completed measures of symptom severity, impairment and risk-taking before and after treatment. Results partially confirmed our hypotheses, demonstrating that participants in the treatment group significantly increased social and recreational risk-taking scores relative to the control group and risk-taking mediated treatment outcome for depression, but not for anxiety symptoms. The results of this study suggest that social and recreational risk-avoidance decreases following CBT treatment, and this change may mediate treatment outcome for depression. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

Validation of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale's obsessive compulsive subscale in a clinical and community sample,"This study describes the validation of the obsessive compulsive subscale on the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS OCD) for use as a clinical assessment tool. Data from 196 anxious children (102 males, ages 7–18) and their parent collected during a diagnostic assessment were compared to data from 420 children (206 males, ages 8–13) from the community collected by mail. The validity of the SCAS OCD parent- and child-report forms were supported by correlations with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and continuous OCD symptom variables from the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule: Child Version. In addition, children with OCD were found to have higher scores on the SCAS OCD subscale than patients without OCD and children from the community without a reported anxiety diagnosis. The sensitivity of the SCAS OCD to treatment effects was also demonstrated in a subset of the clinical sample that received exposure and response prevention therapy. Finally, cut-scores were identified that examine the sensitivity and predictive utility of the scales.

"The importance of worry across diagnostic presentations: Prevalence, severity and associated symptoms in a partial hospital setting","Although excessive worry has been linked primarily with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), recent work suggests worry is dimensional, with potential relevance to a range of psychiatric disorders. The current study examined associations between worry and psychological symptoms across several primary diagnoses and tested worry's hypothesized unique relation to GAD in an acute psychiatric setting. Participants were 568 patients with primary diagnoses of Major Depression, Bipolar Disorder-Depressed, Bipolar Disorder-Manic, and Psychosis. Participants completed a structured diagnostic interview and questionnaires at admission. Partial correlations controlling for GAD diagnosis indicated that worry correlated with higher depression and poorer overall well-being in the Depressed, Bipolar-Depressed, and Psychosis groups and decreased functioning in the Depressed, Bipolar-Manic, and Psychosis groups. Depressed and Bipolar-Depressed groups endorsed the highest level of worry. A comorbid anxiety disorder was associated with higher worry across primary diagnoses, even after controlling for GAD. Of the anxiety disorders, GAD and Panic Disorder diagnoses predicted higher worry scores. Results discussed in terms of conceptual implications for worry as a transdiagnostic concept and clinical interventions.

The structure of posttraumatic psychopathology in veterans attending primary care,"This study attempted to extend research indicating that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) factors of Re-experiencing, Avoidance and Hyperarousal are more related to Fear/phobic disorders, while PTSD Dysphoria is more related to Anxious-Misery disorders. Trauma exposure, PTSD and comorbidity data for 668 veteran patients were analysed using confirmatory factor analyses and relative strengths of the relationships between PTSD factors and the Fear and Anxious-Misery factors were assessed. Combining Simms, Watson, and Doebbeling's (2002) model of PTSD symptoms and Krueger's (1999) Fear/Anxious Misery model of mood and anxiety disorders fit the data well. Contrary to previous research, PTSD Re-experiencing, Avoidance and Hyperarousal did not correlate more with the Fear factor; nor did PTSD Dysphoria correlate more with Anxious-Misery. Hyperarousal was more closely related to Fear than was Re-experiencing; however, Avoidance was not. Dysphoria was more closely related to the Anxious-Misery factor than all other PTSD factors.

Anxiety disorders and substance use disorders: Different associations by anxiety disorder,"Anxiety disorders (ADs) and substance use disorders (SUDs) often occur together, but the strength of this association and their apparent order of onset differ across studies. The goals of this study were to examine: (1) which ADs were associated with which SUDs, and (2) among people who experienced both an AD and a SUD, which disorder had an earlier onset. Lifetime diagnoses from the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication ( n = 9282) were used. Social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and agoraphobia were positively associated with all SUDs. Among people with both an AD and a SUD, the order of onset differed by anxiety type: social phobia nearly always had an onset prior to any SUD; panic disorder and agoraphobia tended to occur prior to some SUDs; and generalized anxiety disorder tended to occur after the onset of at least one SUD. Therefore, all ADs are positively associated with SUDs, but ADs differ in the timing of their onset relative to comorbid SUDs.

Excessive reassurance seeking and anxiety pathology: Tests of incremental associations and directionality,"Excessive reassurance-seeking (ERS) is hypothesized to play a key role in emotional disorders but has been studied mostly in relation to depression. Study 1 reports a new measure of reassurance seeking that assessed ERS related to general and evaluative threats in a non-clinical student sample, and its factor structure was further examined in Study 2. In Study 3, the scale, along with other symptom-related measures and an existing measure of depressive ERS, was administered to an undergraduate sample at two different time points, one month apart. Greater ERS was associated with greater symptoms of social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), even after controlling for trait anxiety, depression, and intolerance of uncertainty. Among OCD symptoms, only thoughts of harm were uniquely related to ERS, a finding consistent with emerging literature. ERS involving general threats also predicted changes in social anxiety and GAD symptoms one month later. Overall, the findings implicate an important role for ERS across anxiety disorders.

Quality of life impairments among adults with social phobia: The impact of subtype,"Social phobia is characterized by extreme fear in social or performance situations in which the individual may be exposed to embarrassment or scrutiny by others, which creates occupational, social and academic impairment. To date, there are few data examining the relationship of social phobia impairments to quality of life. In this investigation, we examined how demographic characteristics, comorbidity, and social competence are related to quality of life among patients with social phobia and normal controls. In addition, we examined the impact of social phobia subtype. Results indicated that individuals with generalized social phobia had significantly impaired quality of life when compared to individuals with no disorder or individuals with nongeneralized social phobia. Comorbid disorders decreased quality of life only for patients with nongeneralized social phobia. Hierarchical linear regression revealed that a diagnosis of social phobia and observer ratings of social effectiveness exerted strong and independent effects on quality of life scores. Results are discussed in terms of the role of social anxiety, social competence, and comorbidity on the quality of life for adults with social phobia.

Positive thinking in anxiety disordered children reconsidered,"Negatively valenced thoughts are assumed to play a central role in the development and maintenance of anxiety. However, the role of positive thoughts in anxiety is rather unclear. In the current study we examined the role of negative and positive self-statements in the anxiety level of anxious and non-anxious children. Participants were 139 anxiety disordered children and 293 non-anxious children (8–18 years). Compared to non-anxious children, anxious children reported more negative thoughts, less positive thoughts and lower State of Mind (SOM) ratios (ratio of positive to negative thoughts). Negative thoughts and SOM ratios were the strongest predictors of anxiety level in anxious children; whereas both negative and positive thoughts were the strongest predictors of anxiety level in non-anxious children. To conclude, a lack of positive thoughts might be more than just an epiphenomenon of anxiety level and might deserve a place in the cognitive model of anxiety.

"Anxiety symptoms in African-American and Caucasian youth: Relations to negative life events, social support, and coping","The purpose of the present study was to determine the relations among negative life events, social support, coping and anxiety symptoms in 709 Caucasian and African-American youth between 11 and 14 years of age. Results indicated that more negative life events, less social support, more coping efforts, and African-American status were related to more anxiety symptoms. Additionally, although active coping moderated the relationship between negative life events and anxiety, these relations were qualified in separate analyses for the African-American and Caucasian youth. Negative life events were related to anxiety symptoms only for the African-American participants. When these findings were explored further for males and females of each racial group, negative life events remained significant for African-American males but not African-American females. Implications of these findings are examined and future directions for research to understand the processes underlying these relations with both Caucasian and African-American youth are addressed.

A pilot feasibility evaluation of the CALM program for anxiety disorders in early childhood,"As many as 9% of preschoolers suffer from an anxiety disorder, and earlier onset of disorder is associated with more intractable forms of psychopathology in later life. At present there is a relative dearth of empirical work examining the development of evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders presenting in early childhood. Building on previous work supporting extensions of PCIT for separation anxiety disorder, the present study examines the preliminary feasibility and efficacy of an anxiety-based modification of PCIT (The CALM Program; Coaching Approach behavior and Leading by Modeling) for the treatment of youth between the ages of three and eight presenting with separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or specific phobias ( N = 9; M age = 5.4 years, ranging 4–8 years; 55.6% of families endorsing racial or ethnic minority status). Intent-to-treat (ITT; N = 9) and treatment completer ( N = 7) analyses were conducted to evaluate diagnostic and functional response across participants. Pre- and posttreatment structured diagnostic interviews were conducted (ADIS-C/P), and clinical impression measures were completed (e.g., CGI, CGAS). Roughly 80% of the sample completed all treatment sessions. All treatment completers were categorized as global treatment responders by independent evaluators, with all but one showing full diagnostic improvements, and all but one showing meaningful functional improvements. These findings lend preliminary support for the promising role of live parent coaching for the treatment of a range of anxiety disorders that present in early childhood. Future work is needed to replicate the present findings in larger samples utilizing randomized controlled comparisons.

Health anxiety and attentional bias: The time course of vigilance and avoidance in light of pictorial illness information,"Cognitive-behavioral models of health anxiety stress the importance of selective attention not only towards internal but also towards external health threat related stimuli. Yet, little is known about the time course of this attentional bias. The current study investigates threat related attentional bias in participants with varying degrees of health anxiety. Attentional bias was assessed using a visual dot-probe task with health-threat and neutral pictures at two exposure durations, 175 ms and 500 ms. A baseline condition was added to the dot-probe task to dissociate indices of vigilance towards threat and difficulties to disengage from threat. Substantial positive correlations of health anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and absorption with difficulties to disengage from threat were detected at 500 ms exposure time. At an early stage (i.e., at 175 ms exposure time), we found significant positive correlations of health anxiety and absorption with orientation towards threat. Results suggest a vigilance avoidance pattern of selective attention associated with pictorial illness related stimuli in health anxiety.

Emotion dysregulation and anxiety in late adulthood,"Recent research has highlighted the important role of emotion dysregulation in the occurrence and maintenance of anxiety symptoms. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between anxiety symptoms and older adults’ ability to regulate emotional experiences. A total of 167 community dwelling older adults completed self-report measures of affect and were asked to report how often they use specific emotion regulation strategies. Consistent with previous theories older adults experiencing increasing levels of anxiety reported greater difficulties in regulating emotional responses. Present results provide support for previous findings demonstrating that experiencing anxiety symptoms affects the ability to regulate emotional experiences. Current findings are likely to be informative in terms of understanding emotion dysregulation in older adults at risk of experiencing clinical symptoms of anxiety.

Examination of the convergent validity of looming vulnerability in the anxiety disorders,"The looming vulnerability model proposes that individuals with anxiety generate dynamic mental scenarios of threats as intensifying and approaching faster than they can cope or respond. In addition to the looming cognitive style posing a general cognitive vulnerability for anxiety, the looming vulnerability model posits that different anxiety disorders can be distinguished based on the specific content of their looming vulnerability themes. The current study examined whether different anxiety disorders have distinct looming vulnerability content along the lines of disorder-specific themes. A treatment-seeking sample of individuals with DSM-IV anxiety disorders ( N = 172) completed measures of looming vulnerability prior to treatment initiation. Consistent with the looming vulnerability model, the results indicated that individuals with social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and panic disorder reported significantly greater disorder-specific looming content compared to non-disorder specific looming content. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder reported the same level of looming social threat as those with social phobia. The results suggest that different anxiety disorders can be distinguished by the specific content of looming vulnerability themes and provide empirical support for the convergent validity of the Looming Vulnerability Scale.

"Hoarding behaviors among nonclinical elderly adults: Correlations with hoarding cognitions, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and measures of general psychopathology","This study examines correlates of hoarding behaviors among nonclinical elderly adults, focusing upon hoarding cognitions, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and measures of general psychopathology. Two hundred and sixty-nine adults aged 56–93 years ( M = 72.49 years) completed the Saving Inventory-Revised, Savings Cognitions Inventory-Revised, Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised, Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, and Beck Depression Inventory. Our geriatric sample evidenced significantly greater severity of hoarding behaviors than did a younger community sample (24–72 years; M = 44.4 years; Frost, Steketee, &amp; Grishman, 2004). Within our sample, moderate correlations were found between hoarding behaviors and hoarding cognitions; however, controlling for obsessive–compulsive and depressive symptoms resulted in reduced-magnitude associations. As well, relationships between obsessive–compulsive symptoms and both hoarding behaviors and hoarding cognitions were generally strong, with most relationships diminishing after controlling for depressive symptoms. Associations between hoarding symptoms and symptoms of social anxiety, general worry, and depression were generally moderate. A significant regression model showed depressive symptoms explaining the most unique variance in hoarding behaviors. Findings confirm a relatively greater severity of hoarding behaviors in older adults (as compared to younger adults) and suggest that related psychopathology plays a critical role in hoarding expression among older adults. As well, the current study contributes to the ongoing investigation of the diagnostic categorization of compulsive hoarding.

Combined medication and cognitive therapy for generalized anxiety disorder,"The current study assessed efficacy of combined cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and venlafaxine XR compared to venlafaxine XR alone in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) within settings where medication is typically offered as the treatment for this disorder. Patients with DSM-IV—diagnosed GAD who were recently enrolled in a long-term venlafaxine XR study were randomly offered ( n = 77), or not offered ( n = 40), the option of adding 12 sessions of CBT. Of those offered CBT, 33% ( n = 26) accepted and attended at least one treatment session. There were no differences between the combined treatment group and the medication only group on primary or secondary efficacy measures in any of the sample comparisons. Many patients who present in medical/psychopharmacology settings seeking treatment for GAD decline the opportunity to receive adjunctive treatment. Of those that receive CBT, there appears to be no additional benefit of combined treatment compared to venlafaxine XR alone.

The association between birth weight and anxiety disorders in young adults,"Recent evidence has linked birth weight to later behaviour/mental disorders, yet studies have hitherto neglected to investigate the relationship between birth weight and adult anxiety disorders. Prospectively collected data from 2210 mother/offspring pairs of the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP) birth cohort was used to test for associations between birth weight z-score and four major groupings of DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Birth weight z-score was linearly and inversely associated with lifetime diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorders at 21 years, with those falling within the smallest birth weight quintile group at almost two-fold increased odds (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.10, 3.52) of being diagnosed with the disorder compared to those falling within the largest group. The association remained when subsequent analysis restricted the sample to those exposed to trauma. This is the first study in which birth weight has been found to be associated with post-traumatic stress disorders in adults.

A meta-analytic review on the prevention of symptoms of anxiety in children and adolescents,"Anxiety disorders are the most frequent psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents and have adverse effects on their psychosocial functioning. An increasing number of studies are aimed at its prevention. This meta-analysis included 65 studies on anxiety prevention. We found small but significant effects on anxiety at posttest (symptoms: g = .22, diagnosis: g = .23; SD units) and follow-up (symptoms: g = .19, diagnosis: g = .32). Intervention effects at posttest varied by type of prevention: Indicated/selective prevention programs showed lager effect sizes than universal programs. At follow-up, smaller effects were found in samples with higher percentages of girls and stronger effect size for programs focusing primarily on anxiety prevention. We conclude: Anxiety prevention programs produce effects size of practical relevance. More efforts are needed for assessing the long-term program effects on the risk for developing anxiety disorders and for improving long-term prevention effects on girls.

Prospective mental imagery in patients with major depressive disorder or anxiety disorders,"Prospective negative cognitions are suggested to play an important role in maintaining anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder (MDD). However, little is known about positive prospective mental imagery. This study investigated differences in prospective mental imagery among 27 patients with anxiety disorders, 24 patients with MDD, and 32 control participants. Measures of both deliberately generated and intrusive imagery were completed. Results indicated that both patients with anxiety disorders and those with MDD provided poorer vividness ratings for deliberately generated prospective positive scenarios compared to the control group. Patients with anxiety disorders showed a greater ability to vividly generate imagery for prospective negative scenarios than both patients with MDD and control participants. Finally, both clinical groups reported greater levels of intrusive prospective imagery of personally-relevant events as compared to the control group. The current findings underline the necessity to target prospective positive mental imagery in treating MDD and anxiety disorders.

How does attention training work in social phobia: Disengagement from threat or re-engagement to non-threat?,"Social phobics exhibit an attentional bias for threat in probe detection paradigms. Attention training, whereby probes always replace non-threat in a display presenting both threat and non-threat, reduces attentional bias for threat and social anxiety. However, it remains unclear whether therapeutic benefits result from learning to disengage attention from threat or learning to orient attention towards non-threat. In this experiment, social phobics were randomly assigned to one of four training conditions: (1) disengagement from threat, (2) engagement towards non-threat, (3) disengagement from threat and re-engagement towards non-threat, and (4) a control condition. Effects were examined on subjective and behavioral responses to a subsequent stressor. Data revealed that training to disengage from threat reduces behavioral indices of anxiety. Engagement towards non-threat faces did not have effects in itself. These results support that the difficulty in disengaging attention from threat is a critical process in maintenance of the disorder.

The role of depression in perceived parenting style among patients with anxiety disorders,"Despite a long tradition of research on the relationship between parenting style and anxiety disorders, few studies have taken the effect of comorbid depression into account. This study investigated perceived parenting in 504 outpatients with panic disorder/agoraphobia, social phobia or obsessive–compulsive disorder, and in 210 psychology students. The anxiety group reported both parents as less caring and their fathers as more controlling than did the student group. However, these between-group differences disappeared when taking self-reported depressive symptoms into consideration. Also no differences in parental style were found between the three diagnostic anxiety groups, when depressive symptoms were taken into account. Self-reported depressive symptoms were more consistently associated with negatively perceived parenting style than with self-reported anxiety symptoms in both the anxiety group and the student group. Results do not support theories of parental control as a specific risk factor for anxiety disorders, but they are in accordance with prior findings showing an association between depression and perceived lack of parental care.

"Anxiety, social skills, friendship quality, and peer victimization: An integrated model","This cross-sectional study investigated whether anxiety and social functioning interact in their prediction of peer victimization. A structural equation model linking anxiety, social skills, and friendship quality to victimization was tested separately for children with anxiety disorders and normal comparison children to explore whether the processes involved in victimization differ for these groups. Participants were 8–14 year old children: 55 (34 boys, 21 girls) diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and 85 (37 boys, 48 girls) normal comparison children. The final models for both groups yielded two independent pathways to victimization: (a) anxiety independently predicted being victimized; and (b) poor social skills predicted lower friendship quality, which in turn, placed a child at risk for victimization. These findings have important implications for the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders and for school-based anti-bullying interventions, but replication with larger samples is indicated.

Assessing excessive reassurance seeking in the anxiety disorders,"Reassurance seeking has long been hypothesized to be a key factor in the maintenance of anxiety within contemporary cognitive-behavioral approaches to the conceptualization and treatment of anxiety disorders. However, empirical studies have lagged due to the absence of a reliable and valid measure of reassurance seeking. The present study sought to develop and examine the psychometric properties of a theoretically derived measure of reassurance seeking in treatment-seeking participants with DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) social phobia ( n = 116), generalized anxiety disorder ( n = 75), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia ( n = 50), and obsessive compulsive disorder ( n = 42). Participants ( N = 283) completed the Reassurance Seeking Scale (RSS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. An exploratory factor analysis resulted in a coherent three factor solution reflecting the need to seek excessive reassurance regarding: (1) uncertainty about decisions, (2) attachment and the security of relationships, and (3) perceived general threat and anxiety. The RSS was found to possess good internal consistency and was moderately correlated with measures of anxiety, stress, and depression. The psychometric properties of the RSS appear promising for the promotion of programmatic research on reassurance seeking and its treatment in the anxiety disorders.

Cognitive processing and acrophobia: Validating the heights interpretation questionnaire,"[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 26(1) of Journal of Anxiety Disorders (see record 2012-00507-016). The authors regret errors in the original paper due to the mean of the HIQ calculated incorrectly (specifically, the average item score was multiplied by 18 to create the total, instead of by 16). Additionally, the statistics reported in Table 4 are incorrect (due to an incorrect version of the predictor variable being used): Please note that the errors do not change any of the conclusions drawn in the original paper (e.g., all results that were significant in the paper remain significant with these errors corrected). The corrections are also present in this erratum.] Three studies were conducted to examine the psychometric properties of a new scale: the Heights Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ). This scale was designed to measure height fear-relevant interpretation bias to help assess the relationship between biased interpretations and acrophobia symptoms. Studies 1 ( N = 553) and 2 ( N = 308) established the scale’s factor structure and convergent and discriminant validity among two large undergraduate samples. Study 3 ( N = 48) evaluated the predictive validity of the HIQ by examining how well the scale predicted subjective distress and avoidance on actual heights. Factor analysis resulted in four distinct factors, and results suggest that each of the factors, along with the full HIQ, have good reliability and validity. Additionally, the scale predicts subjective distress and avoidance on heights beyond self-reported acrophobia symptoms. Overall, the HIQ shows promise as a new tool to investigate cognitive processing biases in acrophobia.

School refusal and anxiety in adolescence: Non-randomized trial of a developmentally sensitive cognitive behavioral therapy,"The main objectives were to evaluate efficacy and acceptability of a developmentally sensitive cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety-based school refusal in adolescence. Twenty school-refusing adolescents meeting DSM-IV anxiety disorder criteria participated in a non-randomized trial, together with parents and school staff. Outcome was assessed at post-treatment and 2-month follow-up. Treated adolescents showed significant and maintained improvements across primary outcome variables (school attendance; school-related fear; anxiety), with medium to large effect sizes. Half of the adolescents were free of any anxiety disorder at follow-up. Additional improvements were observed across secondary outcome variables (depression; overall functioning; adolescent and parent self-efficacy). The treatment was rated as acceptable by adolescents, parents, and school staff, which may help explain the very low attrition rate. Social anxiety disorder was the most common disorder among adolescents still meeting anxiety disorder criteria at follow-up. Treatment modifications to improve efficacy for school-refusing adolescents presenting with social anxiety disorder are suggested.

Testing a cognitive model of generalized anxiety disorder in the eating disorders,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common comorbid disorders found in individuals with eating disorders. Despite this, little is known of shared vulnerability factors between the two disorders. The aim of the present study was to examine the four main components of a cognitive model for GAD in the eating disorders. One hundred and sixty-two females took part. Three groups were formed comprising of 19 participants with an eating disorder and GAD, 70 with an eating disorder without GAD and 73 healthy controls. All completed self-report questionnaires that measured eating attitudes, levels of GAD, intolerance of uncertainty, positive beliefs about worry, negative problem orientation, and cognitive avoidance. Participants with an eating disorder and GAD scored the highest on all four components when compared to healthy individuals and on most components when compared to those with an eating disorder. Participants with an eating disorder without GAD scored higher on all components compared to healthy controls. Findings extend our understanding of shared vulnerability factors between the eating disorders and GAD.

Attention training in socially anxious children: A multiple baseline design analysis,"Current evidence has established an association between anxiety and attentional threat biases. Emerging research suggests these attentional biases may play a causal role in anxiety development. Clinical researchers have begun to develop treatments specifically designed to address these attentional processes. As such, Attention training (ATT) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of anxiety in adults. The current study represents an early attempt to implement ATT to treat social anxiety disorder (SOC) in children. Two boys meeting criteria for DSM-IV SOC participated in the study, along with their parents. Both boys received 10, 10-min sessions of ATT. A multiple-baseline design was used.

Pathways to change in one-session exposure with and without cognitive intervention: An exploratory study in spider phobia,"It is well established that exposure therapy is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders. It is less clear, however, which mechanisms are crucial in explaining its success. In previous studies, cognitive change has been identified as a mediating variable. Several theorists have argued that the addition of cognitive interventions will, therefore, result in enhanced treatment effects. We tested this hypothesis by examining cognitive mediation of treatment in a purely behavioral versus a cognitive–behavioral exposure format. Thirty-one spider phobics were randomly assigned to either behavioral exposure or to exposure as a test for maladaptive cognitions (i.e., behavioral experiments). Both treatment formats showed large treatment effects and strong cognitive mediation of these effects. This indicates that, even when cognitions are not explicitly targeted, exposure effects are cognitively mediated. This challenges the idea that cognitions have to be explicitly challenged to elicit cognitive change in exposure treatment.

Rejection sensitivity mediates the relationship between social anxiety and body dysmorphic concerns,"The goal of this study was to examine the role of rejection sensitivity in the relationship between social anxiety and body dysmorphic concerns. To test our hypothesis that rejection sensitivity mediates the link between social anxiety and body dysmorphic concerns, we administered self-report questionnaires to 209 student volunteers. Consistent with our prediction, rejection sensitivity partially mediated the relationship between social anxiety symptoms and body dysmorphic concerns. The implications of the overlap between these constructs are discussed.

Alterations of the attentional networks in patients with anxiety disorders,"Cognitive theories of emotion try to explain how anxious people attend to the world. Despite the increase in empirical research in this field, the specific or general attentional impairments of patients with anxiety disorder is not well defined. We decided to investigate the relationship between pathological anxiety and attentional mechanisms from the broader perspective of the attentional networks. In our study, patients with anxiety disorders and control participants carried out a task to assess efficiency of three attentional networks: orienting, alerting, and executive control. The main result was that anxiety disorders are related to both reduced effectiveness of the executive control network and difficulties in disengaging attention from invalid cues, even when using emotionally neutral information. This relationship between these attentional networks and anxiety may in part explain the problems in the day-to-day functioning of these patients.

Anger suppression after imagined rejection among individuals with social anxiety,"Individuals experiencing high levels of social anxiety report frequent and intense anger. Yet, little is known about how they manage this emotion. Despite general tendencies towards anger suppression, subsets of individuals with social anxiety regulate anger through outward expression. In this study, we investigated rejection as an antecedent to anger, examined how and when individuals with high social anxiety suppress anger, and evaluated experiential avoidance (EA) as a moderator of the relationship between social anxiety and anger suppression. 170 undergraduate students described their responses to everyday social situations that were designed to elicit anger; several situations reflected instances of social rejection. Our results suggest that rejection was a potent source of anger for most people and that social anxiety predicted both anger and EA in response to imagined rejection. In addition, as evidence of a moderation model, individuals with low social anxiety and low EA reported the least anger suppression; no significant differences were found for individuals with high social anxiety. We discuss the implications for understanding the interface of social anxiety and anger.

Objective sleep patterns and severity of symptoms in pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder: A pilot investigation,"Sleep disturbances are common among youth with anxiety disorders, yet objective assessments of sleep in children with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) have been the focus of scant research. We therefore compared a small group of non-medicated, non-depressed children with primary OCD (ages 7–11 years) to matched healthy controls using home-based actigraphy during a 7-day prospective assessment. Validated parent and child sleep measures also were collected, and associations among objective sleep variables and severity of obsessions and compulsions were examined. We found significantly fragmented sleep patterns in the OCD group compared to controls including reduced total sleep time (TST) and longer wake periods after sleep onset. Severity of compulsions showed a significant negative correlation with TST. These preliminary findings indicate the presence of sleep abnormalities in pre-pubescent OCD patients with potential implications for future examinations of early developmental processes and features of the disorder.

Reliability and validity of DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder features,"The reliability of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) features has been shown to be moderate, based on research utilizing the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (ADIS-IV), a semi-structured diagnostic interview. This may be a function of the criteria for the diagnosis of GAD, which have undergone much revision since its first inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . The reliability and validity of disorder feature ratings were examined in a diverse sample of patients who presented for assessment and treatment of excessive worry, generalized anxiety, or tension at an anxiety specialty clinic and who met criteria for a principal diagnosis of GAD ( N = 129). Internal consistency of the ratings of excessiveness of worry, uncontrollability of worry, and the associated symptom cluster was moderate to low and varied by disorder feature. Inter-rater reliability for all features of GAD and severity of the disorder varied between good and poor. Additional findings showed that the GAD features, as measured using the ADIS-IV module, have modest to strong convergent validity, varying by feature, and poor discriminant validity when tested against measures of social anxiety. Potential reasons for rater disagreement are discussed. Results are also considered in terms of how they may inform the evolving criteria for GAD in DSM - V .

Termination of washing compulsions: A problem of internal reference criteria or ‘not just right’ experience?,"Recent research suggests that obsessive–compulsive washers are more likely than individuals without washing compulsions to use conscious, internal reference criteria when deciding when to terminate compulsions (Wahl, Salkovskis, &amp; Cotter, 2008). An alternative view is that they possess tendencies towards non-cognitive, automatic ‘not just right’ experiences (NJREs) that influence compulsion duration. The current study sought to investigate the latter explanation using valid behavioral tasks. Non-clinical participants ( N = 133) completed self-report measures, immersed their hands in a dirt mixture, and afterwards were allowed to wash their hands. Additionally, a subset of participants completed an in vivo assessment of NJRE using a pile of clutter. Total number and intensity of NJREs were predictive of hand-washing duration. Additionally, affective response to the clutter was uniquely predictive of hand-washing duration when controlling for pre-wash anxiety. These results suggest that internal reference criteria as well as NJREs may influence compulsive washing, though the former may be a consequence of the latter.

Does engagement with exposure yield better outcomes? Components of presence as a predictor of treatment response for virtual reality exposure therapy for social phobia,"Virtual reality exposure (VRE) has been shown to be effective for treating a variety of anxiety disorders, including social phobia. Presence, or the level of connection an individual feels with the virtual environment, is widely discussed as a critical construct both for the experience of anxiety within a virtual environment and for a successful response to VRE. Two published studies show that whereas generalized presence relates to fear ratings during VRE, it does not relate to treatment response. However, presence has been conceptualized as multidimensional, with three primary factors (spatial presence, involvement, and realness). These factors can be linked to other research on the facilitation of fear during exposure, inhibitors of treatment response (e.g., distraction), and more recent theoretical discussions of the mechanisms of exposure therapy, such as Bouton’s description of expectancy violation. As such, one or more of these components of presence may be more strongly associated with the experience of fear during VRE and treatment response than the overarching construct. The current study ( N = 41) evaluated relations between three theorized components of presence, fear ratings during VRE, and treatment response for VRE for social phobia. Results suggest that total presence and realness subscale scores were related to in-session peak fear ratings. However, only scores on the involvement subscale significantly predicted treatment response. Implications of these findings are discussed.

Clinical implications of risk aversion: An online study of risk-avoidance and treatment utilization in pathological anxiety,"Previous research suggests that the pervasive tendency to avoid perceived risks (i.e., the safety bias) may be implicated in the maintenance of pathological anxiety. These studies have not explored, however, the potential clinical implications of such a bias, such as the influence of risk aversion on treatment seeking. The aim of this study was to investigate how risk-avoidance is related to willingness to seek treatment in an online sample of clinically anxious individuals with social phobia (SP), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Healthy control participants ( n = 117) and those endorsing criteria for one or more anxiety disorder(s) ( n = 92; SP, n = 33; OCD, n = 19; GAD, n = 40) were recruited from various online sources. Respondents completed an online survey comprised of a validated diagnostic interview, self-report measures assessing for symptom severity, risk-taking across various domains, a generalized index of risk-taking and treatment utilization. Consistent with hypotheses, SP and GAD individuals reported significantly more risk-avoidance when compared to non-clinical controls. Furthermore, willingness to seek treatment was found to be positively associated with social risk-taking and generalized risk-taking orientation in clinically anxious individuals who had never sought treatment. These results suggest that certain individual cognitive factors may contribute to the decision to seek treatment and may provide an interesting avenue of future investigation for increasing service utilization and treatment seeking in anxious populations.

Addressing revisions to the &lt;i&gt;Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation scale&lt;/i&gt;: Measuring fear of negative evaluation across anxiety and mood disorders,"The fear of negative evaluation (FNE) represents a fundamental component of social anxiety and social anxiety disorder (SAD) within modern cognitive-behavioral models (Clark &amp; Wells, 1995; Rapee &amp; Heimberg, 1997). As such, access to comprehensive psychometrics for measures of FNE is an important component of thorough clinical and research efforts. Among the most popular measures of FNE have been variations of the 12-item Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation (BFNE) scale (Leary, 1983). There are currently three versions of the BFNE based on two psychometric studies (i.e., two 8-item variants and a 12-item variant). There is still substantial debate regarding which of the three alternatives should be used by researchers and clinicians. Normative data for each of the three alternatives are not available across samples of individuals with diagnosed anxiety and mood disorders; moreover, there has been no comparative assessment of responses for such samples. The present investigation was to provide more definitive recommendations about the three alternatives, to provide normative clinical data, and to explore differences in FNE endorsement across anxiety and mood disorders. Clinical participants included 381 individuals (60% women; age M = 35.61, SD = 12.49) from an established anxiety treatment and research center. Diagnoses included those with a principal diagnosis of SAD (32%), those with a diagnosis of SAD as an additional disorder (24%), those without a diagnosis of SAD (41%), and those with features of SAD (3%). Results of descriptive analyses, factor analyses, analysis of variance, and receiver operating curves demonstrated that the 12-item variant of the BFNE was inferior or comparable to the two 8-item variants. FNE scores were consistently higher among all participants with a diagnosis of SAD (either principal or additional) relative to all other diagnostic groups ( p &lt; .05). Accordingly, the current evidence, as well as parsimony and previous research, supports the utility of the 8-item variant that includes only the original straightforwardly worded items from the BFNE. Comprehensive findings, implications, and future research directions are discussed.

Parental educational practices in relation to children's anxiety disorder-related behavior,"Schoolchildren reported their parents’ use of aversive control and positive reinforcement contingencies in their educational interventions, as well as parental non-responsiveness to their requests for educational assistance. They also reported their own levels of six dimensions of anxiety disorder-related phenomena. Both parental use of aversive control and non-responsiveness were directly related to overall levels of child anxiety disorder-related behavior; these correlations were more robust than those observed in previous investigations of more diffuse dimensions of parenting style and trait anxiety. Panic disorder/agoraphobia and Generalized anxiety disorder were the dimensions most strongly correlated with both parental aversive control and non-responsiveness, while Compulsive behavior was uniquely uncorrelated with parental non-responsiveness and uniquely correlated with parental use of positive reinforcement contingencies. Differences in the magnitudes of correlations between anxiety disorder-related dimensions and parental educational practices are interpreted in terms of the probable differential effectiveness of their constituent behaviors in terminating parent-mediated negative reinforcers.

Self reported attentional control with the Attentional Control Scale: Factor structure and relationship with symptoms of anxiety and depression,"The Attentional Control Scale (ACS) is a self-report questionnaire that has been developed to measure individual differences in attentional control. Despite its fairly widespread use, little is known about the psychometric properties of the scale in adult samples. In the present study, factor structure of the ACS and its relationship with symptoms of anxiety and depression was investigated in a total sample of 728 Icelandic university students. Exploratory factor analysis in sample 1 ( n = 361), yielded two factors, labeled focusing and shifting. Confirmatory factor analysis in sample 2 ( n = 367) showed a reasonable fit of this two factor model. The two factors correlated strongly (0.73). The two subscales showed different predictive validity in a set of hierarchical regression analyses where the focusing subscale made a significant prediction of anxiety scores when depression scores were controlled for, and the shifting subscale significant prediction of depression scores when anxiety scores were controlled for. These findings are discussed in relation to previous studies on attentional and executive control in anxiety and depression.

Psychometric properties of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) in a longitudinal study of African Americans with anxiety disorders,"The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) is a widely used measure of social anxiety. However, no study has examined the psychometric properties of the LSAS in an African American sample. The current study examined the LSAS characteristics in 97 African Americans diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Overall, the original LSAS subscales showed excellent internal consistency and temporal stability. Similar to previous reports, fear and avoidance subscales were so highly correlated that they yielded redundant information. Confirmatory factor analyses for three previously proposed models failed to demonstrate an excellent fit to our data. However, a four-factor model showed minimally acceptable fit. Overall, the LSAS performed similarly in our African American sample as in previous European American samples. Exploratory factor analyses are warranted to determine whether a better factor structure exists for African Americans.

Psychometric properties of a Dutch version of the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire—Child Version (OBQ-CV),"To improve research in cognitive theories of childhood OCD, a child version of the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ-CV) has been developed (Coles et al., 2010). In the present study, psychometric properties of the Dutch OBQ-CV were examined in a community sample ( N = 547; 8–18 years) and an OCD sample ( N = 67; 8–18 years). Results revealed good internal consistency and adequate retest reliability (retest interval 7–21 weeks and 6–12 weeks, respectively). Children with OCD reported more beliefs than non-clinical children. Obsessive beliefs were related to self-reported OCD symptoms, but not to clinician-rated OCD severity. Beliefs were also related to anxiety and depression. This is the first study examining the factor structure of the OBQ-CV. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed best fit for four factors representing Perfectionism/Certainty, Importance/Control of Thoughts, Responsibility, and Threat, and a higher-order factor. This is in line with results from adult samples. These results support the reliability and validity of the Dutch OBQ-CV.

Experimental modification of interpretation bias regarding social and animal fear in children,"Using an experimental bias modification task, an interpretation bias towards or away from threat was induced about animal or social situations in a sample of 103 children split into a young (7–10 years) and old age group (11–15 years). Children rapidly learned to select outcomes of ambiguous situations which were congruent with their assigned modification condition. Following positive modification, children's threat interpretation biases significantly decreased, while threat biases increased (non-significantly) after negative modification. Bias modification effects also varied as a function of age with children appearing particularly vulnerable to acquiring biases about stimuli that were congruent with the normative fears for their age group. Weak age-related modification-congruent effects on younger but not older children's anxiety vulnerability in response to a behavioral task were also observed. However, no consistent effects of bias modification on avoidance behavior were found.

A preliminary investigation of developmentally sensitive items for the assessment of social anxiety in late life,"The current study aimed to examine the salience of anxiety-provoking social situations for older adults. A list of potentially anxiety-provoking situations was developed from a review of existing measures of social anxiety. In addition to items derived from existing measures, the investigators generated items thought to be particularly relevant for older adults. One hundred and four older adults were asked, “Please check all situations where you might feel uncomfortable, nervous, scared, worried, embarrassed, or anxious.” Participants were also prompted to record any additional situations in which they experienced anxiety. Older adults endorsed items not included on typical measures of social anxiety at high rates. Exploratory analyses of the effects of gender on item endorsement were examined and significant differences were found for several items. The authors discuss these findings and their implications for the assessment of late-life social anxiety.

Eye tracking and physiological reactivity to threatening stimuli in posttraumatic stress disorder,"This study tested the vigilance-avoidance model of anxiety and attention bias in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study used eye tracking technology to record initial fixations, pupil dilation, fixation time and concurrent skin conductance response to examine initial orienting towards threat stimuli and subsequent fixations. Twenty-one traumatized participants (11 diagnosed with PTSD and 10 trauma-exposed participants without PTSD) viewed 32 stimuli (with four words in each quadrant). Sixteen trials contained a trauma-relevant word in one quadrant and 16 had four neutral words. PTSD patients reported significantly greater number of initial fixations to trauma words, and a greater number of skin conductance responses to initial threat fixations. There were no significant differences in subsequent fixations to trauma words between groups. Although this study provides evidence of attentional bias towards threat that is accompanied by specific autonomic arousal, it does not indicate subsequent avoidance of threat stimuli in PTSD.

The comorbidity of anxiety disorders in bipolar I and bipolar II patients among Turkish population,"High rates of anxiety disorders have been reported in bipolar disorders. The study aimed to investigate prevalence of anxiety disorders in remitted bipolar subjects and their influence on the illness severity. Bipolar subjects with anxiety disorders were younger, had earlier age at onset of illness, and were overrepresented by female subjects and those with earlier onset illness compared to those without anxiety disorder. The study demonstrated that (1) anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in bipolar subjects, (2) individual anxiety disorders, particularly SP and PD seem to have an effect on illness severity, (3) bipolar subjects with comorbid anxiety tend to have a poorer course and are less responsive to treatment, and (4) anxiety tends to be associated with an earlier age at onset of bipolar disorder (BPD) and results in a more complicated and severe disease course.

What happens in session &lt;i&gt;does not&lt;/i&gt; stay in session: Changes within exposures predict subsequent improvement and dropout,"Previous exposure therapy research has suggested potential differences in emotional processing at different points in treatment (Hayes, Hope, &amp; Heimberg, 2008). For example, indicators of emotional processing may be more related to outcome during the later exposure sessions than during the initial session. This is consistent with a growing body of psychotherapy research highlighting the importance of timing and change processes across therapy. The current study examined whether the learning-but-not-benefiting hypothesis is observed in a group based intervention for clients with a range of anxiety disorders. It was hypothesized that activation and within session habituation during later, but not the initial exposure session, would be related to outcome, whereas activation and within session habituation during the first session would be related to dropout status. Results revealed that lower activation and less habituation during the first exposure was associated with increased treatment discontinuation. Second, lower peak and, to a lesser extent greater activation and habituation, during exposures were generally associated with better treatment outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of examining the complexities and timing of the exposure process.

Corrigendum to “Content and correlates of checking related to symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder”,"Reports an error in ""Content and correlates of checking related to symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder"" by Shannon L. Coleman, Ashley S. Pieterefesa, Robert M. Holaway, Meredith E. Coles and Richard G. Heimberg ( Journal of Anxiety Disorders , 2011[Mar], Vol 25[2], 293-301). In the original article, Ashley S. Pietrefesa's name was spelled incorrectly. The correction is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2011-01965-012). In addition to the central role of compulsive behaviors in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), recent data have documented the presence of compulsive behaviors in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, there is a lack of information about potential similarities and differences with regard to the quality, or content, of checking associated with worry and obsessions. The two studies presented herein are an initial step towards gathering this information. Findings of Study 1, from a large unselected undergraduate sample, showed that symptoms of OCD and GAD were both significantly associated with checking behaviors. However, while OCD symptoms were associated with checking related to both objects and interpersonal situations, GAD symptoms were only significantly associated with interpersonal checking. Findings of Study 2, using a separate sample, suggest links between interpersonal checking and features characteristic of GAD, namely emotion regulation difficulties, and between object checking and a cognitive feature of OCD, namely thought-action fusion. In summary, the current studies add to a growing body of literature suggesting that checking may be important in numerous forms of psychopathology, while also suggesting that the nature and function of checking may differ for various symptom profiles.

A meta-analysis of anxiety symptom prevention with cognitive-behavioral interventions,"This meta-analysis assessed efficacy of cognitive-behavioral interventions in preventing anxiety symptoms. A systematic review identified 15 independent pretest–posttest randomized or quasi-randomized efficacy trials for analysis. At posttest, intervention groups demonstrated significantly greater symptom reduction compared to control groups resulting in weighted mean effect sizes (Hedges’ g ) of 0.25 for general anxiety, 0.24 for disorder-specific symptoms, and 0.22 for depression after the removal of outliers. These effects appeared to diminish over 6- and 12-month follow-up. Exploratory moderator analyses indicated that individually administered media interventions were more effective than human-administered group interventions at preventing general anxiety and depression symptoms. Implications of current findings are discussed with attention to existing gaps in the literature.

Psychometric properties of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) in Brazilian children and adolescents,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Brazilian-Portuguese version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) in a large community sample of Brazilian children and adolescents. A total of 2410 students completed the 41-item Brazilian-Portuguese version of the SCARED. The one-factor and the five-factor structure of the SCARED fit this sample well. However, the five-factor model had a significantly better fit than the one-factor model and an adequate fit for age and gender subgroups. Anxiety symptoms in Brazilian youth were reported at a moderate-high level as compared to other studies. Females were found to score significantly higher on the total score and on all of the subscales as compared to the males. The total score and each of the five factors for both children and adolescents showed good internal consistency, test–retest and construct validity. According to our findings the Brazilian-Portuguese version of the SCARED is a reliable and valid instrument to assess anxiety in Brazilian children and adolescents.

Preliminary factor and psychometric analysis of the Motivation for Fear (MOTIF) survey,"To address the call for evidence-based functional assessments, this study determined the factor structure and psychometric properties (i.e., reliability, convergent and discriminant validity) of the Motivation for Fear (MOTIF) survey, a newly created, 24-item functional measure of fear and anxiety. Participants were 1277 college students (ages 18–35 years; 74.7% female). A separate questionnaire verified presence of anxiety symptoms, resulting in 583 participants. Exploratory factory analysis, scree plot, parallel analysis, and oblique rotation, were used. Results converged on a 4-factor simple structure solution with 18 items. The functions (distress, attention/comfort-seeking, tangible, and escape) explained 43% of the variance and internal consistency was above .70 for distress and attention/comfort-seeking. The distress and attention/comfort-seeking functions demonstrated clear reliability and support was found for discriminant and convergent construct validity of the MOTIF. Evidence was lacking regarding functional convergent validity, however. Implications for the findings and potential for clinical use are discussed.

"Unexpected arousal, anxiety sensitivity, and their interaction on CO₂-induced panic: Further evidence for the context-sensitivity vulnerability model","The present experiment tested several predictions derived from the context-sensitivity vulnerability model of panic. Participants ( N = 79) scoring either high or low in anxiety sensitivity (AS) and with no history of unexpected panic were randomly assigned to one of two instructional sets: expected arousal (EA) or expected relaxation (ER). All participants were administered inhalation of room air and 35% CO₂ in a counterbalanced order. Consistent with theoretical predictions, High-AS participants who received ER instructions showed greater emotional responding compared to High-AS participants who received EA instructions, while instructional set did not affect responding among Low-AS participants. Panic attacks were observed in 52% of the High-AS-ER group compared to 17%, 5%, and 5% in the High-AS-EA, Low-AS-ER, and Low-AS-EA groups respectively. These findings are consistent with the theory's assertion that dispositional tendencies, such as anxiety sensitivity potentiate the panicogenic effects of threat-relevant context variables.

Social anxiety and alcohol problems: The roles of perceived descriptive and injunctive peer norms,"Although people with higher social anxiety (HSA) appear particularly vulnerable to alcohol-related problems it remains unclear why people with HSA experience such problems. One possibility is that HSA people's drinking behavior is influenced by their beliefs about others’ drinking (i.e., descriptive norms) and/or others’ approval of drinking (i.e., injunctive norms). The current study investigated the relationship between social anxiety, alcohol-related problems, drinking frequency and quantity, and descriptive and injunctive norms. The sample consisted of current drinkers with clinically elevated social anxiety (HSA; n = 86) or lower social anxiety (LSA; n = 86). Injunctive norms moderated the relationship between social anxiety group status and alcohol-related problems such that HSA participants with higher injunctive norms reported the most alcohol-related problems. Descriptive norms moderated the relationship between social anxiety and drinking quantity such that among participants with higher descriptive norms, LSA participants drank more than HSA participants.

More reasons to be straightforward: Findings and norms for two scales relevant to social anxiety,"The validity of both the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation scale has been well-supported, yet the scales have a small number of reverse-scored items that may detract from the validity of their total scores. The current study investigates two characteristics of participants that may be associated with compromised validity of these items: higher age and lower levels of education. In community and clinical samples, the validity of each scale's reverse-scored items was moderated by age, years of education, or both. The straightforward items did not show this pattern. To encourage the use of the straightforward items of these scales, we provide normative data from the same samples as well as two large student samples. We contend that although response bias can be a substantial problem, the reverse-scored questions of these scales do not solve that problem and instead decrease overall validity.

Anorexia nervosa and generalized anxiety disorder: Further explorations of the relation between anxiety and body mass index,"We explore comorbidity of anorexia nervosa (AN) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and their relation with body mass index (BMI) and evaluate the presence of fasting and excessive exercise which both have anxiolytic and weight loss effects. All participants were female: 32 with AN only, 607 with GAD only, 22 with AN and GAD (AN+GAD), and 5424 with no history of AN or GAD (referent) from the Swedish Twin study of Adults: Genes and Environment (STAGE). Lowest adult BMI differed significantly ( p &lt; .001) and was lower in those with AN+GAD than those with AN only ( p &lt; .029). Those with AN+GAD were most likely to endorse fasting and excessive exercise, followed by women with AN only, women with GAD only, and the referent.

CBT for childhood anxiety and substance use at 7.4-year follow-up: A reassessment controlling for known predictors,"A previous report suggested that successful cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for child anxiety reduced substance use problems at 7.4-year follow-up, but that report did not include predictors of: (a) substance use disorder (SUD; e.g., attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder symptoms, negative life events, family substance abuse, additional treatment), or (b) treatment outcome (e.g., severity of internalizing pathology, age). Analyses incorporating these factors tested previously reported findings in 72 participants (ages 15–22 at follow-up; 84% of the 7.4-year follow-up sample), using parent and youth diagnostic interviews and report measures. The majority of previously reported associations between less successful treatment and later substance use problems remained significant after controlling for known predictors of SUD and treatment outcome. Our findings bolster previous conclusions that effective CBT for child anxiety may have ameliorative effects on the target disorder and later substance use problems.

"Traits and cognitions of perfectionism and their relation with coping style, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety in Japanese musicians","Research has shown that 2 major facets of perfectionism can be differentiated: perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns. In order to investigate how these different facets of perfectionism are related to coping, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety in musicians, we asked 275 professional and amateur Japanese musicians to complete measures of perfectionism traits, perfectionism cognitions, coping style, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety. While both facets of perfectionism showed a similar pattern of correlation with coping measures, they were differently associated with effort, achievement, and performance anxiety. In addition, results of hierarchical regression analysis showed the incremental validity of perfectionism cognitions in explaining variance in performance anxiety above the variance explained by other variables, such as trait perfectionism. These findings demonstrate that perfectionism in musicians has both positive and negative elements.

Fear factors: Cross validation of specific phobia domains in a community-based sample of African American adults,"The current study attempted a cross-validation of specific phobia domains in a community-based sample of African American adults based on a previous model of phobia domains in a college student sample of African Americans. Subjects were 100 African American community-dwelling adults who completed the Fear Survey Schedule-Second Edition (FSS-II). Domains of fear were created using a similar procedure as the original, college sample of African American adults. A model including all of the phobia domains from the FSS-II was initially tested and resulted in poor model fit. Cross-validation was subsequently attempted through examining the original factor pattern of specific phobia domains from the college sample (Chapman, Kertz, Zurlage, &amp; Woodruff-Borden, 2008). Data from the current, community based sample of African American adults provided poor fit to this model. The trimmed model for the current sample included the animal and social anxiety factors as in the original model. The natural environment-type specific phobia factor did not provide adequate fit for the community-based sample of African Americans. Results indicated that although different factor loading patterns of fear may exist among community-based African Americans as compared to African American college students, both animal and social fears are nearly identical in both groups, indicating a possible cultural homogeneity for phobias in African Americans. Potential explanations of these findings and future directions are discussed.

The role of anxiety sensitivity in sleep disturbance in panic disorder,"Previous research has demonstrated that individuals with panic disorder (PD) report significant sleep disturbances, although the mechanism of this disturbance is not clear. Patients with PD tend to report abnormally high levels of anxiety sensitivity (AS). Because higher AS involves increases in attention and fearfulness about anxiety and associated physical sensations, which in turn may cause excessive psychological and physiologic arousal, we hypothesized that amongst individuals with PD, higher AS would be associated with sleep disruption, particularly in the form of increased sleep latency. As expected, PD was associated with poorer sleep as measured by the Global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) compared to controls and AS was significantly associated with longer sleep latency. Our data suggest that sleep disturbance, and in particular sleep latency, in PD may be partly due to high levels of AS, which can be targeted with cognitive-behavioral therapeutic strategies.

Childhood trauma and current psychological functioning in adults with social anxiety disorder,"Etiological models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggest that early childhood trauma contributes to the development of this disorder. However, surprisingly little is known about the link between different forms of childhood trauma and adult clinical symptoms in SAD. This study (1) compared levels of childhood trauma in adults with generalized SAD versus healthy controls (HCs), and (2) examined the relationship between specific types of childhood trauma and adult clinical symptoms in SAD. Participants were 102 individuals with generalized SAD and 30 HCs who completed measures of childhood trauma, social anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and self-esteem. Compared to HCs, individuals with SAD reported greater childhood emotional abuse and emotional neglect. Within the SAD group, childhood emotional abuse and neglect, but not sexual abuse, physical abuse, or physical neglect, were associated with the severity of social anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and self-esteem.

A prospective examination of predictors of post-event processing following videotaped exposures in group cognitive behavioural therapy for individuals with social phobia,"Following social events, individuals with social phobia engage in post-event processing (PEP), namely a post-mortem detailed analysis of a social situation. This study aimed to examine cognitive and symptom correlates of PEP, as well as stability of PEP, in the context of videotaped exposures that occurred during treatment at sessions four and eight. Before treatment, 75 individuals with DSM-IV diagnosed social phobia completed measures of social anxiety, anxious rumination, fear of causing discomfort to others, and negative interpretation of positive social events. They rated their peak anxiety during the taped exposure. Then, they completed a measure of PEP one week after each videotaped exposure exercise. Results revealed that baseline social anxiety symptoms, state anxiety during the videotaping, anxious rumination, fear of causing discomfort to others, and negative interpretation of positive social events were all positively associated with PEP for the first taped exposure. Regression analyses demonstrated that unique predictors of PEP over and above baseline social anxiety were state social anxiety during the exposure, and anxious coping-focused rumination. This was largely replicated in the second taped exposure. In addition, PEP following two videotaped exposures separated by four weeks showed a moderate-to-large positive correlation. These findings highlight symptom and cognitive correlates of PEP, and underscore importance of state anxiety in social situations, as well as general anxiety focused rumination in social phobia.

Status of body dysmorphic disorder in Argentina,"Although body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) has received recent attention, it remains misunderstood and under-studied. The Argentine population seeks out plastic surgery at a disproportionate rate and exhibits high rates of preoccupation with bodily dissatisfaction, yet BDD is unrecognized and research is limited. The current study describes the prevalence, quality of life, and presentation style of BDD in depressed adolescents, as depression is the most common symptom for which adolescents seek treatment in Argentina. Twenty-five depressed adolescents and 85 non-depressed students were initially assessed for depression and BDD and subdivided depending on BDD status. Participants were assessed on various constructs including obsessions and compulsions, overvalued ideas, and overall level of impairment. A 2×2 factorial design was employed, and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to analyze the data. Significant main effects were observed for all dependent measures (BDI, OVIS, YBOCS, and Sheehan Disability Scale) for depressed vs. non-depressed participants and BDD status; significant interactions were observed between independent variables for all dependent measures. Depressed adolescents had significantly higher scores on the YBOCS-BDD, OVIS, BDI, and the Sheehan Disability Scale compared to non-depressed participants; furthermore, individuals reporting BDD symptoms reported significantly higher scores on the YBOCS-BDD, OVIS, BDI, and Sheehan Disability Scale. Significant interactions are discussed according to BDD status and depression on dependent measures. Patients with BDD have poor quality of life and present with anxiety and depression, yet it still remains underdiagnosed.

"Social support, world assumptions, and exposure as predictors of anxiety and quality of life following a mass trauma","This study examined the influence of a mass trauma (the Virginia Tech campus shootings) on anxiety symptoms and quality of life, as well as the potential vulnerability/protective roles of world assumptions and social support. Pre-trauma adjustment data, collected in the six months prior to the shooting, was examined along with two-month post-shooting data in a sample of 298 female students enrolled at the university at the time of the shootings. Linear regression analyses revealed consistent predictive roles for world assumptions pertaining to control and self-worth as well as family support. In addition, for those more severely exposed to the shooting, greater belief in a lack of control over outcomes appeared to increase vulnerability for post-trauma physiological and emotional anxiety symptoms. Implications of the results for research and intervention following mass trauma are discussed.

The temporal course of anxiety sensitivity in outpatients with anxiety and mood disorders: Relationships with behavioral inhibition and depression,"The present study evaluated the temporal course of three dimensions of anxiety sensitivity (AS; concerns over physical symptoms, mental incapacitation, and social embarrassment) and their relationships with behavioral inhibition (BI) and depression (DEP) in 606 outpatients with anxiety and mood disorders. A semi-structured interview and self-report questionnaires were administered on three occasions over a two-year period. All three constructs decreased over the study period and AS temporally functioned more similar to DEP than BI. Cross-sectional and temporal correlations supported the discriminant validity of AS from BI. As expected, initial levels of BI predicted less improvement in all AS dimensions. In contrast, higher initial levels of mental incapacitation AS were associated with greater improvement in DEP. Our results are discussed in regard to the measurement of AS in clinical samples, conceptualizations of AS as a lower-order vulnerability, and prognostic implications of directional paths between BI and AS and AS and DEP.

Psychometric properties of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale in a Hong Kong Chinese community sample,"This study evaluated the psychometric properties of a widely used self-report anxiety scale—the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) and the associated parent-report version (PSCAS)—in a Hong Kong Chinese community sample. While good psychometric properties of SCAS and PSCAS had been documented in Western cultural contexts (e.g., Australia), no systematic psychometric evaluation of the Chinese-translated SCAS and PSCAS has been published. In this study, psychometric properties of SCAS and PSCAS were examined with respect to four criteria: (a) factor structure, (b) descriptive statistics, (c) convergent validity with an anxiety cognition measure, and (d) internal consistency. Psychometric properties of SCAS and PSCAS for a Chinese community sample were found to be highly comparable with those published on Australian samples, thus providing a solid conceptual foundation for use of the Chinese version of SCAS and PSCAS.

The factor structure of the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and the Social Phobia Scale,"The Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) are two compendium measures that have become some of the most popular self-report scales of social anxiety. Despite their popularity, it remains unclear whether it is necessary to maintain two separate scales of social anxiety. The primary objective of the present study was to examine the factor analytic structure of both measures to determine the factorial validity of each scale. For this purpose, we administered both scales to 577 patients at the beginning of outpatient treatment. Analyzing both scales simultaneously, a CFA with two correlated factors showed a better fit to the data than a single factor model. An additional EFA with an oblique rotation on all 40 items using the WLSMV estimator further supported the two factor solution. These results suggest that the SIAS and SPS measure similar, but not identical facets of social anxiety. Thus, our findings provide support to retain the SIAS and SPS as two separate scales.

The Leyton Obsessional Inventory-Child Version survey form does not demonstrate adequate psychometric properties in american youth with pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder,"The psychometric properties of the Leyton Obsessional Inventory-Child Version Survey Form (LOI-CV Survey Form) and the Short Leyton Obsessional Inventory-Child Version Survey Form (Short LOI-CV Survey Form) were examined in a clinical sample of 50 children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The internal consistency of the LOI-CV and Short LOI-CV Survey Forms were acceptable and poor, respectively (α = .79 and .65). The LOI-CV Survey Form was significantly and moderately correlated with child-rated OCD-related impairment, but was not significantly correlated with any other measures of OCD symptom frequency or severity, OCD-related impairment, global symptom severity, child reports of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and parent reports of children's obsessive-compulsive, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms. Modest support for the cognitive-behavioral treatment sensitivity of the LOI-CV Survey Form (Cohen's d = 0.98) but not the Short LOI-CV Survey Form (Cohen's d = 0.09) was demonstrated. Diagnostic sensitivity was poor for the LOI-CV Survey Form at both pre- (0.14) and post-treatment (0.06). Overall, these results suggest that the psychometric properties of the LOI-CV and Short LOI-CV Survey Forms are not adequate for use as a screening instrument or in assessing symptom severity in pediatric OCD.

Factors contributing to anxious driving behavior: The role of stress history and accident severity,"Although fear and travel avoidance among anxious drivers are well documented, relatively little is known about the behavior of anxious individuals who continue to drive. Previous research has identified three broad domains of anxious driving behavior: exaggerated safety/caution behaviors, anxiety-based performance deficits, and hostile/aggressive driving behaviors. In an effort to explicate factors associated with the development of anxious driving behavior, associations with objective accident severity, accident-related distress, and life stress history were explored among individuals reporting accident involvement ( N = 317). Interactive effects of accident distress and self-reported stress history were noted across all three domains of anxious driving behavior. Examination of these effects indicates unique associations between accident distress and anxious behavior only in those reporting more severe life stress. Consistent with contemporary models of anxiety, these data suggest stress history may serve as a general vulnerability factor for development of anxious driving behavior following accident involvement.

Health anxiety: Comparison of the latent structure in medical and non-medical samples,"The Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI; Salkovskis, Rimes, Warwick, &amp; Clark, 2002) is a self-report measure designed to assess health anxiety in both medical and non-medical samples. The invariance of the factor structure across these samples has not been examined in the 14-item version of the SHAI. In the current study, the SHAI was completed by a community sample with no serious medical conditions ( n = 232) and a medical sample with multiple sclerosis ( n = 245). Factor analysis implied the same two-factor solution for both samples, with the two factors labelled: (1) Thought Intrusion, and (2) Fear of Illness. Item loadings were invariant across the medical and non-medical samples, but the two factors were more strongly correlated in the non-medical sample. Implications of the findings as well as directions for future research are discussed.

The discovery of chlordiazepoxide and the clinical introduction of benzodiazepines: Half a century of anxiolytic drugs,"The clinical introduction of chlordiazepoxide half a century ago was one of the major breakthroughs in the history of psychopharmacology, as it opened the door for the benzodiazepine saga, the pharmacological family par excellence in the treatment of anxiety disorders. This review analyses the discovery of this drug, which was filled with chance events, and numerous chemical and clinical errors of approach. Chlordiazepoxide, initially called methaminodiazepoxide, was patented in 1958 and introduced in clinical treatment in 1960 under the brand name Librium ® . The benzodiazepines became the most widely prescribed drugs worldwide, provided truly effective treatment for “minor forms” (neuroses) of mental disorders for the first time, increased the quality of scientific methodology in clinical research, and enabled the development of new etiopathogenic theories for anxiety disorders, especially after the discovery in 1977 of their high-affinity receptor complex.

The relations between social anxiety and social intelligence: A latent variable analysis,"Social anxiety has been associated with biases in cognitive processing and deficits in social performances. Yet, it remains unclear if these variations may be partly attributable to deficits in fundamental social abilities: for example, social intelligence (SI). Using the Magdeburg Test of Social Intelligence (MTSI) as an objective and performance based SI measure, we examined the relationship between social anxiety and SI in a general population sample ( N = 110) using Structural Equation Modeling. Dimensions of social anxiety as postulated by Clark and Wells (1995) and facets of SI (social understanding, social memory, and social perception), were negatively correlated. Use of safety-behavior in particular was related to deficits in social understanding ( r = −0.25; p &lt; 0.05) and social perception and memory ( r = −0.24; p &lt; 0.05). Results suggest small to medium sized relationships between specific facets of social anxiety and certain domains of SI. Therapeutic implications for socially anxious individuals concerning SI are discussed.

Posttraumatic stress symptoms and postpartum depression in couples after childbirth: The role of partner support and attachment,"Aim: The roles of partner attachment and perceptions of partner support were explored in relation to symptoms of posttraumatic stress and postpartum depression in couples within the first three postnatal months. Methods: Participants ( n = 372) were recruited within the first seven days postpartum, and completed questionnaire measures of trait anxiety, symptoms of acute posttraumatic stress, and perceptions of partner support. Postal questionnaires were completed at six weeks and three months, assessing attachment, perception of partner support, symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and postpartum depression. Two hundred and twelve couples completed all time-points. Results: Results indicated that symptoms were significantly related within couples. Men's acute trauma symptoms predicted their partner's subsequent symptoms of posttraumatic stress. Less secure attachment and dissatisfaction with partner support were associated with higher levels of postpartum depression and posttraumatic stress. Conclusions: Men's and women's responses following childbirth appear to be strongly interlinked; services should target both members of the dyad.

The Multi-Dimensional Blood/Injury Phobia Inventory: Its psychometric properties and relationship with disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity,"The Multi-Dimensional Blood Phobia Inventory (MBPI; Wenzel &amp; Holt, 2003) is the only instrument available that assesses both disgust and anxiety for blood-phobic stimuli. As inflated levels of disgust propensity (i.e., tendency to experience disgust more readily) are often observed in blood phobia, the MBPI appears a promising instrument for disgust research. First, we examined its psychometric properties. Next, it was examined whether disgust sensitivity (i.e., considering experiencing disgust as something horrid) had added predictive value compared to disgust propensity in blood phobia. Therefore, students and university employees ( N = 616) completed the MBPI, indices on blood phobia, disgust propensity and sensitivity. The MBPI proved to be reliable and valid. Further, it correlated moderately to high with disgust propensity and sensitivity. Additionally, disgust propensity and sensitivity were both significant predictors for blood phobia. In conclusion, the MBPI appears a valuable addition to the currently available arsenal of indices to investigate blood phobia.

Relational treatment strategies increase social approach behaviors in patients with generalized social anxiety disorder,"We incorporated strategies based on relational and interpersonal circumplex research within a standard cognitive-behavioral regimen for Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder (GSAD, Generalized Social Phobia) to determine whether these techniques increased the social approach behaviors that facilitate relationship development. Individuals seeking treatment for GSAD were randomly assigned to either the integrated interpersonal cognitive-behavioral group treatment (ICBT) or a wait list condition (WL). Results revealed that the interpersonal techniques were readily implemented by the majority of patients. ICBT produced significant increases in frequency of social approach behaviors and relationship satisfaction, in addition to GSAD symptom reductions comparable to other group CBT regimens. The current research highlights the feasibility and potential benefit of incorporating strategies based on relational and circumplex theories into cognitive-behavioral regimens for GSAD.

Prevalence and Axis I comorbidity of full and partial posttraumatic stress disorder in the United States: Results from Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions,"The present study used data from the Wave 2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions ( n = 34,653) to examine lifetime Axis I psychiatric comorbidity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Lifetime prevalences ± standard errors of PTSD and partial PTSD were 6.4% ± 0.18 and 6.6% ± 0.18, respectively. Rates of PTSD and partial PTSD were higher among women (8.6% ± 0.26 and 8.6% ± 0.26) than men (4.1% ± 0.19 and 4.5% ± 0.21). Respondents with both PTSD and partial PTSD most commonly reported unexpected death of someone close, serious illness or injury to someone close, and sexual assault as their worst stressful experiences. PTSD and partial PTSD were associated with elevated lifetime rates of mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, and suicide attempts. Respondents with partial PTSD generally had intermediate odds of comorbid Axis I disorders and psychosocial impairment relative to trauma controls and full PTSD.

Mother–child disagreement in reports of child anxiety: Effects of child age and maternal anxiety,"The present study examined effects of maternal anxiety, child age, and their interaction on mother–child anxiety reporting disagreement while taking into account the direction of each informant's report relative to the other. Participants were 41 dyads of mothers and clinically anxious children aged 7–13. A hierarchical regression revealed a significant interaction between maternal anxiety and child age ( β = .30, p &lt; .05). A graph of this interaction indicated that when maternal anxiety is high and the child is older, maternal report of anxiety is relatively higher, and when maternal anxiety is high and the child is younger, child report of anxiety is relatively higher. When maternal anxiety is low, the reporting discrepancy is relatively stable across age. Results may help explain previous mixed findings regarding effects of age and maternal anxiety on reporting discrepancies. Possible explanations for these results are discussed.

Measuring social anxiety related interpersonal constraint with the flexible iterated prisoner's dilemma,"Data from self-report and observational studies make it clear that problematic social anxiety confers interpersonal constraint that may contribute to the interpersonal dysfunction reported by individuals with social anxiety disorder. Direct observation of interpersonal behavior in established relationships is rare and difficult to obtain for practical reasons. We tested a flexible iterated prisoner's dilemma computer task to examine whether it might capture interpersonal constraint related to social anxiety. Our first study suggested that, at least for men, the task directly captures social anxiety's constraint on responses to friendly giving. Our second study more strongly supported the assertion that the task directly assesses interpersonal constraint. The data support a model in which social anxiety directly confers trait-like tendencies toward interpersonal constraint and indirectly constrains behavior in specific interactions. These studies provide further evidence that constrained responses to positive social behaviors are characteristic of people with problematic social anxiety and may be particularly important to dysfunctions in the close relationships of these individuals.

The temporal precedence of metacognition in the development of anxiety and depression symptoms in the context of life-stress: A prospective study,"According to the metacognitive theory of psychological disorder, metacognitions are vulnerability factors in predicting development of psychological symptoms. The present study investigated metacognitive factors and life stress in a prospective test of their proposed temporal precedence in the development of anxiety and depression symptoms. Participants were 172 students and adults recruited in Ankara and Bolu, Turkey. Two separate sets of hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. In these analyses, Time 2 anxiety or depression was regressed on the main and interaction effects of metacognition and stress after controlling for baseline symptom levels measured at Time 1, age, and gender. Results revealed that negative metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of worry significantly predicted residual change in both anxiety and depression after controlling for the negative effect of stressful life events. Furthermore, lack of cognitive confidence interacted with daily hassles to predict the change in anxiety, when the baseline level of anxiety and other individual differences were controlled. Our results support the metacognitive theory of psychopathology.

An evidence-based causal model of panic disorder,"Recently, Fava and Morton (2009) described what they termed a ‘causal model’ of panic disorder (Causal modeling of panic disorder theories, Clinical Psychology Review , 29 , 623–637). We examined several critical tenets of this proposed model, and offer significant revisions. Our revised causal model includes elements that have received empirical support, and exclude those with known limitations in explaining the etiology and treatment of panic disorder. Chief among these revisions are (1) an increased emphasis on anxiety sensitivity, (2) elimination of the more general psychodynamic conceptualization in favor of empirically supported findings regarding early attachment, and (3) placing biological and psychophysiological reactions as outcomes of false alarm threat, rather than causal mechanisms of panic.

Testing a developmental model of anxiety with the Parental Facilitation of Mastery Scale,"Parents who are not overly protective and who encourage children to take on challenging experiences may help children develop an enhanced sense of control, thereby reducing the risk for subsequent anxiety. We developed the Parental Facilitation of Mastery Scale (PFMS) to assess parenting behaviors that may promote mastery experiences in childhood. Undergraduates and their biological siblings were recruited to complete the PFMS as well as other measures of parenting behaviors, perceived control, and anxiety. A factor analysis of the PFMS revealed two components representing parental overprotection and parental challenge. These two factors demonstrated adequate psychometric properties. We therefore used this measure to test a model in which perceived control mediated the relationship between parenting behaviors and anxiety. The hypothesized model demonstrated good fit, suggesting that the PFMS may be a useful tool for measuring parental behaviors that promote a sense of mastery and ultimately buffer against anxiety in adulthood.

Perceived burden in spouses of National Guard/Reserve service members deployed during Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom,"Spouses of combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experience elevated psychological distress. Recent research indicates that spouses’ perceptions of burden may be one mechanism of such distress, but there are several gaps in this literature. No research has examined perceived burden in relation to symptoms other than PTSD or subclinical levels of psychological distress, and very little research has focused on characteristics of spouses that may be related to their perceptions of burden. The current study examined these variables in 130 spouses of reserve component troops deployed during Operations Enduring/Iraqi Freedom. Spouses’ burden was positively associated with symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety in service members, regardless of clinical severity. Moreover, burden fully mediated the relation between each type of symptom and spouses’ own psychological distress. Furthermore, levels of burden were significantly related to spouses’ neuroticism, avoidant coping, and self-efficacy, but only avoidant coping remained a significant predictor of burden when accounting for service members’ distress. These results suggest that a broad range of service members’ symptoms are related to spouses’ burden and distress, and although individual characteristics of spouses may be related to their perceptions of burden, service members’ symptoms play a primary role.

The prevalence and clinical implications of self-medication among individuals with anxiety disorders,"Alcohol dependence (AD) is more likely to occur among individuals with rather than without an anxiety disorder. Self-medication theory (SMT) holds that drinking behavior is negatively reinforced when alcohol temporarily reduces anxiety and that the resulting escalation of drinking increases the risk for AD. We set out to empirically scrutinize SMT using the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) dataset. We found that only a minority (about 20%) of anxiety disordered individuals endorsed drinking to control anxiety symptoms. This minority drank more alcohol, had a higher cross-sectional rate of AD, and was at higher risk for developing new AD over four years compared to anxiety disordered non-self-medicators and individuals with no anxiety disorder. Consistent with SMT, increased prospective risk for AD among self-medicators is partially mediated by an increased level of alcohol use. Understanding the processes that promote and inhibit self-medication should be a priority for anxiety disorder researchers.

Social anxiety and discomfort with friendly giving,"Individuals higher in social anxiety report more impaired friendship quality, which past research suggests may stem from constrained warmth. We examined three motivations for constrained warmth in friendships and determined how these motivations related to social anxiety and friendship impairment. To do so, we assessed the psychometric properties of the Favor Scale (FS), which measures an individual's response to friendly giving. Results indicated that the FS has three subscales: negative reactions to favors (NEG), positive reactions to favors (POS), and expectation of tit-for-tat behavior (E-TFT). Structural equation modeling demonstrated that social anxiety related directly to NEG, and indirectly to POS and E-TFT through NEG. POS related directly to friendship quality, indicating that friendships may be impaired in social anxiety disorder due to the cumulative effects of responding negatively to friendly behavior.

The moderational role of anxiety sensitivity in flight phobia,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is the tendency to interpret anxiety-related bodily sensations in a threatening way. Previous research in a subclinical population identified AS as a vulnerability factor in flight phobia: AS moderates the relationship between somatic sensations and flight anxiety. The present study aimed at gaining further evidence for the moderational role of AS in a large clinical population with flight phobia. The data were obtained from 103 participants: 54 flight phobic participants and 49 controls. Just before taking a flight participants were asked to complete the Anxiety Sensitivity Index and to report their level of anxiety and bodily sensations. Results showed that AS moderates the relationship between somatic sensations and flight phobia: somatic sensations significantly predicted flight anxiety in subjects with higher AS scores, while this was not the case for subjects scoring lower on AS. Present findings implicate that treatment protocols should be supplemented by interventions specifically aimed at reducing AS, especially for individuals high in AS.

A community study of generalized anxiety disorder with vs. without health anxiety in Hong Kong,"Background: Although generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by multiple worries, anxiety about one's health is absent in the DSM-IV description of the illness. Method: A random community-based telephone survey ( N = 2005) that covered DSM-IV symptoms of GAD, two core symptoms of major depression, Rome-III criteria of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and help-seeking behavior was conducted. Results: The 1-year prevalence of 3-month GAD was 5.4%. Among affected individuals, 78.9% reported worry about personal health while 21.1% did not. The former subgroup was significantly older, had higher mean numbers of associated anxiety symptoms and worries, more likely to have worry about finances and sought professional help than the latter subgroup. The two subgroups had similar sex distribution, core depressive symptoms, IBS, distress and SDS impairment profiles. Conclusion: Health anxiety is common in GAD. Some but not all illness severity indicators differed between GAD with and without health anxiety.

Differential activity of subgenual cingulate and brainstem in panic disorder and PTSD,"Most functional neuroimaging studies of panic disorder (PD) have focused on the resting state, and have explored PD in relation to healthy controls rather than in relation to other anxiety disorders. Here, PD patients, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients, and healthy control subjects were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging utilizing an instructed fear conditioning paradigm incorporating both Threat and Safe conditions. Relative to PTSD and control subjects, PD patients demonstrated significantly less activation to the Threat condition and increased activity to the Safe condition in the subgenual cingulate, ventral striatum and extended amygdala, as well as in midbrain periaquaeductal grey, suggesting abnormal reactivity in this key region for fear expression. PTSD subjects failed to show the temporal pattern of activity decrease found in control subjects.

Do beliefs about the utility of worry facilitate worry?,"Various theoretical models have pointed out the role of positive beliefs in the worry process (Dugas, Gagnon, Ladouceur, &amp; Freeston, 1998; Wells, 1995). Two studies were conducted to search for experimental support for this possibility. After trait worry was controlled, a persuasion procedure was used to induce diverse beliefs about worry (positive, negative, or neutral). It was hypothesized that participants persuaded of the usefulness of worry would be more worried and more anxious after listening to a worrisome message. In the first study, 90 participants (62 females and 28 males) were exposed to a novel worrisome message, and in the second study, 60 participants (34 females and 26 males) were exposed to a more personally relevant worry. Results indicate that persuasion about the utility of worry does not trigger worry, and when prior positive beliefs about worry were controlled, they do not correlate with the change in anxiety after worrisome induction.

Associations between parental posttraumatic stress disorder and both offspring internalizing problems and parental aggression within the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication,"Data from the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication were used to evaluate links between parental posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and elevated (1) offspring internalizing problems and (2) parental physical aggression toward children. We extended prior tests via the use of an independent nationally representative sample and by examining specific associations between these outcomes and PTSD above and beyond variance accounted for by several theoretically relevant demographic factors and PTSD-related comorbidity. As hypothesized, offspring anxiety and depression was elevated among parents with PTSD compared to those without the condition. Parents with PTSD also were more likely to endorse the use of both moderate (e.g., pushing) and severe (e.g., hitting with a fist) physical aggression with their children. These findings advance work in the area by suggesting that there is a unique relation between PTSD and these outcomes, which sets the stage for research to elucidate factors uniquely introduced by PTSD.

Content and correlates of checking related to symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder,"[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 25(5) of Journal of Anxiety Disorders (see record 2011-09732-018). In the original article, Ashley S. Pietrefesa's name was spelled incorrectly. The correction is given in the erratum.] In addition to the central role of compulsive behaviors in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), recent data have documented the presence of compulsive behaviors in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, there is a lack of information about potential similarities and differences with regard to the quality, or content, of checking associated with worry and obsessions. The two studies presented herein are an initial step towards gathering this information. Findings of Study 1, from a large unselected undergraduate sample, showed that symptoms of OCD and GAD were both significantly associated with checking behaviors. However, while OCD symptoms were associated with checking related to both objects and interpersonal situations, GAD symptoms were only significantly associated with interpersonal checking. Findings of Study 2, using a separate sample, suggest links between interpersonal checking and features characteristic of GAD, namely emotion regulation difficulties, and between object checking and a cognitive feature of OCD, namely thought-action fusion. In summary, the current studies add to a growing body of literature suggesting that checking may be important in numerous forms of psychopathology, while also suggesting that the nature and function of checking may differ for various symptom profiles.

Overcoming barriers to disseminating exposure therapies for anxiety disorders: A pilot randomized controlled trial of training methods,"The present study evaluated methods for training mental health providers ( N = 46) in exposure therapies (ETs) for anxiety disorders. A pilot randomized controlled trial compared: (1) an interactive, multimedia online training (ET OLT), (2) the ET OLT plus a brief Motivational Interviewing-based intervention (ET OLT + MI), and (3) a placebo control OLT. Assessments were completed at baseline, post-training, and one-week following training. Both ET OLT and ET OLT + MI received high satisfaction ratings and were comparably effective at increasing knowledge of ETs as well as clinicians' overt efforts to learn and use the treatment. ET OLT + MI was the most effective method for improving clinicians' attitudes toward ETs. Results indicate that OLT is effective for disseminating knowledge about ETs to clinicians, and suggest that supplementing OLT with a brief MI-based intervention may be a promising direction to address potential attitudinal barriers to adopting these highly efficacious treatments.

The temporal relationship between anxiety disorders and urinary incontinence among community-dwelling adults,"Objective: The purpose of this paper was to carefully examine the temporal relationships between anxiety disorders and urinary incontinence among community-dwelling adults. Method: In all, 1071 persons aged 30 and over were the continuing participants in a population-based longitudinal study of community-dwelling adults. Participants were classified as incontinent if any uncontrolled urine loss within the 12 months prior to the interview was reported. Condition-specific functional loss secondary to urinary incontinence was further assessed based on a series of questions relating directly to participants’ inability to engage in certain activities due to their urinary incontinence. Anxiety disorders were assessed with standardized interviews keyed to the diagnostic criteria. Results: In multivariate models that controlled for potentially influential characteristics the association between urinary incontinence with condition-specific functional loss and newly-incident anxiety disorders was statistically significant (adjusted relative odds (RO) = 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.05, 6.20]). Conclusions: Urinary incontinence with condition-specific functional loss predicted onset of newly-incident anxiety disorders among community-dwelling adults.

Dental anxiety in relation to neuroticism and pain sensitivity. A twin study,"Predisposing personality traits as well as heightened pain sensitivity and fear of pain have been hypothesized as central factors in the development of dental anxiety. The aim of the study was to estimate the heritability of dental anxiety, and to investigate the genetic and environmental sources of covariance between dental anxiety on one hand, and pain sensitivity and the neuroticism trait on the other. A sample comprising 188 twins, aged 23–35 years (53 monozygotic and 39 dizygotic twin pairs, and 4 single twins whose co-twin did not participate), was included in the study. Measures of dental anxiety and personality were obtained using Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale and the NEO Personality Inventory Revised, respectively. Heat pain and cold pressor pain sensitivity were assessed using standard pain testing procedures. Bivariate Cholesky models were employed to decompose the correlations between phenotypes into genetic and environmental factors. Using models with common additive genetic (A) and individual-specific environmental (E) factors, moderate heritability (i.e., .41) for dental anxiety was demonstrated. Virtually all of the phenotypic correlation between neuroticism and dental anxiety could be accounted for by A. Furthermore, a substantial part of the variance in dental anxiety was due to specific genetic and individual environmental influences unrelated to neuroticism. The phenotypic correlations between dental anxiety and the pain sensitivity indices were close to zero. Thus, while neuroticism and dental anxiety share a sizeable proportion of genetic (but not environmental) risk factors, the results also suggest that these two attributes are distinct entities with overlapping, but not identical, etiologies.

"The relationship between perceived discrimination and Generalized Anxiety Disorder among African Americans, Afro Caribbeans, and non-Hispanic Whites","The present study examined the relationship between frequency of race based and non-race based discrimination experiences and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in a sample of 3570 African Americans, 1438 Afro Caribbeans, and 891 non-Hispanic Whites from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL). Because GAD and the experience of racial discrimination are both associated with symptoms of worry and tension, we expected race based discrimination to predict GAD prevalence for African Americans, but not other groups. We did not expect non-race based discrimination to predict GAD. Results showed that while more frequent experiences of non-race based discrimination predicted GAD for all groups, experiencing race based discrimination was associated with significantly higher odds of endorsing lifetime GAD for African Americans only. Results are interpreted in light of the different contexts that these three ethnic groups represent relative to their history within the United States as well as their present day circumstances.

The prevalence of dental anxiety across previous distressing experiences,"Aims: To compare the prevalence of high dental anxiety across a variety of past distressing experiences with a previously reported Dutch sample. Method: University students from the UK ( N = 1024) completed an online survey containing; the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale, and the Level of Exposure-Dental Experiences Questionnaire (LOE-DEQ). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated to assess the association of self-reported distressing experiences and dental anxiety. Results: The percentage of respondents with high dental anxiety (HDA) (total MDAS score ≥ 19) was 11.2%. Significant prevalence of HDA across several distressing experiences was shown in both UK and Dutch samples notably: extreme helplessness during dental treatment, lack of understanding of the dentist and extreme embarrassment during dental treatment. There were little or no effects of non-dental trauma, with the exception of sexual abuse in the UK sample. Conclusions: Trauma from various past experiences may be implicated in an increased risk of high dental anxiety.

The roles of anxiety and depression in connecting tic severity and functional impairment,"The current study examined relationships between tic severity and both functional impairment and perceived quality of life (QOL) in adults with a chronic tic disorder. The authors explored whether these relationships were moderated by anxiety and depressive symptoms. Five-hundred adults with Tourette's Disorder, Chronic Motor Tic Disorder, or Chronic Vocal Tic Disorder participated in a comprehensive self-report internet-based survey. Anxiety and depressive symptoms moderated the relationship between tic severity and functional impairment such that stronger relationships were documented in participants with elevated depressive or anxious symptoms. Limitations and implications for research and clinical practice are discussed.

Psychometric properties of the Spence Child Anxiety Scale with adolescents from five European countries,"This study examined the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the original Spence Child Anxiety Scale (SCAS) and its four translations (German, Cypriot Greek, Swedish, Italian). A total of 2558 adolescents from five European countries (Germany = 495; Cyprus = 611; UK = 469; Sweden = 484; Italy = 499), ages 12–17 years, participated in the study. In addition to the SCAS, all participants completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, a measure of general difficulties and positive attributes. The internal consistency and validity (convergent and discriminant) of the SCAS were excellent. Multiple group confirmatory factor analysis provided strong support for the generalizability of a 6-factor inter-correlated model across five European countries. Adolescents in the UK had significantly higher anxiety levels than adolescents in four other European countries. Our findings suggest that the SCAS is suitable for assessing anxiety disorder symptoms in adolescents in Germany, the UK, Cyprus, Sweden, and in Italy.

Self-compassion is a better predictor than mindfulness of symptom severity and quality of life in mixed anxiety and depression,"Mindfulness has received considerable attention as a correlate of psychological well-being and potential mechanism for the success of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). Despite a common emphasis of mindfulness, at least in name, among MBIs, mindfulness proves difficult to assess, warranting consideration of other common components. Self-compassion, an important construct that relates to many of the theoretical and practical components of MBIs, may be an important predictor of psychological health. The present study compared ability of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) to predict anxiety, depression, worry, and quality of life in a large community sample seeking self-help for anxious distress ( N = 504). Multivariate and univariate analyses showed that self-compassion is a robust predictor of symptom severity and quality of life, accounting for as much as ten times more unique variance in the dependent variables than mindfulness. Of particular predictive utility are the self-judgment and isolation subscales of the SCS. These findings suggest that self-compassion is a robust and important predictor of psychological health that may be an important component of MBIs for anxiety and depression.

Age of onset of social anxiety disorder in depressed outpatients,"Onset of social anxiety disorder (SAD) often precedes that of major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients with this comorbidity pattern. The current study examined the association between three SAD onset groups (childhood, adolescent, adulthood) and clinical characteristics of 412 psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with MDD and SAD based on a semi-structured diagnostic interview. Childhood and adolescent SAD onset groups were more likely to report an onset of MDD prior to age 18 and have made at least one prior suicide attempt compared to the adulthood onset group. The childhood SAD onset group also was more likely to have chronic MDD, poorer past social functioning, and an increased hazard of MDD onset compared to the adulthood onset group. Findings suggest that patients with an onset of SAD in childhood or adolescence may be particularly at risk for a more severe and chronic course of depressive illness.

"The Skin Picking Impact Project: Phenomenology, interference, and treatment utilization of pathological skin picking in a population-based sample","The current study examined the characteristics of pathological skin picking (PSP) in a population-based sample. Participants were recruited through several online resources for PSP and related conditions to complete a web-based survey assessing the functional and topographical phenomenology, physical and psychosocial impact, treatment utilization, and associated psychopathology of PSP. A total of 1663 participants consented, of whom 760 were over 18 and met study criteria for PSP. Results showed considerable heterogeneity in picking methods, body sites, and function (e.g., regulation of emotional, sensory, and cognitive states). Participants generally reported moderate psychosocial and physical impact from picking and tended to perceive available treatment as poor in quality. Severity of associated symptoms of psychopathology (depression, anxiety, and stress) was comparable to severity levels found in previous samples of persons with trichotillomania and obsessive–compulsive disorder. Severity of PSP was a statistically significant predictor of overall impairment after controlling for depression and anxiety symptoms. Results suggest that PSP is a significant public health concern in need of further rigorous investigation.

The role of meta-cognition and parenting in adolescent worry,"In the meta-cognitive model of worry, positive, and negative beliefs about worry interact to make worry problematic. These beliefs have been found to be associated with anxiety in adolescents, but it is unknown whether they are associated with worry. Furthermore, it may be via cognitive mechanisms such as these, or directly through behavior, that parents influence their child's worry. The current study aimed to explore whether adolescent meta-cognition and parenting behaviors and meta-cognitions were associated with adolescent worry. Results indicated that meta-cognitions were specifically associated with worry in adolescents, but there was little evidence that parenting was. Parental worry on the other hand was associated with both parent and child reported parenting. It is concluded that the meta-cognitive model of worry may be relevant in adolescents, but that further research is required to explore how parents influence adolescent worry.

Hoarding among patients seeking treatment for anxiety disorders,"The aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence of hoarding symptoms among individuals presenting for treatment of anxiety symptoms. Participants included 130 adults who were seeking treatment at an outpatient anxiety disorders clinic between January 2004 and February 2006. During their initial assessment, participants (31 with panic disorder, 15 specific phobia, 27 social phobia, 36 obsessive-compulsive disorder, 21 generalized anxiety disorder, mean age 37 years, 57% female, 88% White) completed the Saving Inventory-Revised, a self-report measure of hoarding symptoms, and several measures of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and functional impairment. Approximately 12–25% of anxious patients reported significant hoarding symptoms. Patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder were more likely to report significant hoarding symptoms than were those with panic disorder or specific phobia. Hoarding symptoms were positively correlated with trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, and functional impairment. These findings suggest that hoarding symptoms may be associated with anxiety disorders other than obsessive-compulsive disorder. The findings further suggest that hoarding symptoms may be underreported by anxious populations since typical intake assessments do not include specific questions about hoarding and individuals with hoarding symptoms may be unlikely to spontaneously report them.

Revisiting the latent structure of the anxiety sensitivity construct: More evidence of dimensionality,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS) was initially conceptualized as existing along a continuum; however, emerging evidence from taxometric analyses is mixed as to whether the latent structure of AS is dimensional or taxonic. The purpose of the present study was to further evaluate the latent structure of AS in an effort to clarify the contrasting findings reported in the literature. To do so, we examined the latent structure of AS in two large independent samples unselected with regard to AS level (comprising undergraduate respondents and/or community residents). MAXEIG and MAMBAC analyses were performed with indicator sets drawn from distinct self-report measures of AS within either sample. MAXEIG and MAMBAC, as well as comparison analyses utilizing simulated taxonic and dimensional datasets, yielded converging evidence that AS has a dimensional latent structure. Implications of these finding for the conceptualization and measurement of AS are discussed and future research directions are highlighted.

A population-based study on phobic fears and &lt;i&gt;DSM-IV&lt;/i&gt; specific phobia in 70-year olds,"This population-based study reports on the prevalence and characteristics of specific phobia (SP) and phobic fears in an elderly population. A representative population sample of Swedish 70-year-olds without dementia ( N =558) was examined using semi-structured interviews. Phobic fears included fear of animals, natural environment, specific situations, blood-injection-injury and ‘other’. Mental disorders, including SP, were diagnosed according to DSM-IV . Phobic fears (71.0% vs. 37.9%) and SP (13.8% vs. 4.5%) were more common in women than in men. Among those with phobic fears, more than 80% reported onset before age 21. Of those with SP, 35.7% had another DSM-IV diagnosis compared to 8.5% of those reporting no fear. Fear of specific situations and ‘other’ fears were related to SP and other anxiety disorders. SP was related to lower global functioning. We conclude that specific phobia in the elderly should receive attention from health professionals as it is common and associated with a decrease in global functioning.

A multidimensional anxiety assessment of adolescents after Typhoon Morakot-associated mudslides,"The aims of this study were to examine the factor structure, reliability and validity of the Taiwanese version of the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC-T) in a group of adolescents in mountainous regions worst affected by Typhoon Morakot-associated mudslides. In total, 271 adolescents in grades 7–9 completed the MASC-T and the Chinese version of the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (C-IES-R). They also received a diagnostic interview to determine whether they had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We examined adequacy of the original four-factor structure of the MASC-T using confirmatory factor analysis, as well as its internal reliability, discriminant and predictive validities for PTSD, and convergent validity with the C-IES-R. Results support adequacy of the four-factor structure and internal reliability of the MASC-T in adolescents affected by Typhoon Morakot. Scores for the total MASC-T and subscales significantly discriminated adolescents with PTSD from those without PTSD. However, levels of predictive values for PTSD and the convergent validity with the C-IES-R differed among the MASC-T subscales and the total scale. The physical symptoms and harm avoidance subscales had the highest and lowest predictive accuracies for presence of PTSD, respectively. The MASC-T combined with diagnostic interviews for PTSD and self-report measures for assessing PTSD-specific symptoms can be used to evaluate a broad range of anxiety symptoms.

The Driving Behavior Survey: Scale construction and validation,"Although long recognized in the clinical literature, problematic behavior characteristic of anxious drivers has received little empirical attention. The current research details development of a measure of anxious driving behavior conducted across three studies. Factor analytic techniques identified three dimensions of maladaptive behaviors across three college samples: anxiety-based performance deficits, exaggerated safety/caution behavior, and anxiety-related hostile/aggressive behavior. Performance deficits evidenced convergent associations with perceived driving skill and were broadly related to driving fear. Safety/caution behaviors demonstrated convergence with overt travel avoidance, although this relationship was inconsistent across studies. Safety/caution scores were associated specifically with accident-and social-related driving fears. Hostile/aggressive behaviors evidenced convergent relationships with driving anger and were associated specifically with accident-related fear. Internal consistencies were adequate, although some test–retest reliabilities were marginal in the unselected college sample. These data provide preliminary evidence for utility of the measure for both research and clinical practice.

Achieving certainty about the structure of intolerance of uncertainty in a treatment-seeking sample with anxiety and depression,"Evidence is accumulating that intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may be a transdiagnostic maintaining factor across the anxiety disorders and depression. However, psychometric studies of the most commonly used measure of IU have typically used undergraduate students, and the factor structure has been highly inconsistent. Previous studies have also tended to focus on one diagnostic subgroup or related symptom, thereby limiting transdiagnostic comparisons. The first aim of this study was to test the latent structure of a commonly used measure of IU in a treatment-seeking sample with anxiety and depression ( n =463). The second aim was to examine psychometric properties of the best fitting solution, including internal reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to compare the goodness of fit of five models previously found with undergraduate and community samples. A two-factor solution, comprising of prospective anxiety and inhibitory anxiety, was the best fitting model. The total scale and subscales demonstrated excellent internal reliability. Convergent validity was demonstrated by the scales correlating with symptoms associated with five anxiety disorders and depression, as well as neuroticism, distress and disability. IU explained unique variance in all symptom measures, even after controlling for neuroticism and other symptom measures. Evidence of discriminant validity was also found for each IU subscale. Findings support reliability and validity of the two-factor solution, and are consistent with IU being a transdiagnostic maintaining factor.

Disgust and the development of posttraumatic stress among soldiers deployed to afghanistan,"Although the DSM-IV recognizes that events can traumatize by evoking horror, not just fear, the role of disgust in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has received little research attention. In a study of soldiers deployed to Afghanistan, we examined whether reports of peritraumatic disgust and trait disgust vulnerability factors (disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity) predict PTSD-symptoms, independently of peritraumatic fear, neuroticism, and anxiety sensitivity. Participants ( N = 174) enrolled in this study before deployment, and were retested around 6 months ( N = 138; 79%) and, again, 15 months ( N = 107; 62%) after returning home. The results showed that (1) greater peritraumatic disgust and fear independently predicted PTSD-symptom severity at 6 months, (2) greater disgust propensity predicted more peritraumatic disgust, but not PTSD-symptom severity, and (3) disgust sensitivity moderated the relationship between peritraumatic disgust and PTSD-symptom severity. Implications of these findings for broadening the affective vulnerabilities that may contribute to PTSD will be discussed.

Social anxiety and posttraumatic stress symptoms: The impact of distressing social events,"Recent evidence supports the notion that relatively common social events, such as public humiliation and teasing, may precipitate or exacerbate symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAD; Erwin et al., 2006; McCabe et al., 2010). In addition, individuals with SAD often report event-specific hallmark symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTSS; e.g., intrusive memories, avoidance, hyperarousal) following significant negative social events. Although intriguing, there is a paucity of research data to date exploring the relationships between negative social events, social anxiety, and PTSS. The present study (1) assessed endorsement rates of negative social events; (2) compared patterns of social anxiety and PTSS reporting among persons reporting negative social events relative to persons reporting the Criterion A1 events associated with posttraumatic stress disorder; and (3) evaluated the interrelationships between social anxiety and PTSS, and common constructs including fear of negative evaluation, anxiety sensitivity, and depression. Participants included community members ( n = 601; 74% women; M age = 25.8, SD = 9.8) who endorsed experiencing a significantly negative social event. Approximately 55% of all participants reported experiencing a negative social event, with one-third of those indicating it was worse than the Criterion A events they had experienced. Participants reporting negative social events scored higher on measures of social anxiety and PTSS than those reporting only Criterion A events. Trauma symptoms only predicted social anxiety symptoms for participants who reported a negative social event. Comprehensive results and directions for future research are discussed.
