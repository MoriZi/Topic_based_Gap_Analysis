Ensemble Learning for Low-Level Hardware-Supported Malware Detection,"Recent work demonstrated hardware-based online malware detection using only low-level features. This detector is envisioned as a first line of defense that prioritizes the application of more expensive and more accurate software detectors. Critical to such a framework is the detection performance of the hardware detector. In this paper, we explore the use of both specialized detectors and ensemble learning techniques to improve performance of the hardware detector. The proposed detectors reduce the false positive rate by more than half compared to a single detector, while increasing the detection rate. We also contribute approximate metrics to quantify the detection overhead, and show that the proposed detectors achieve more than 11x reduction in overhead compared to a software only detector (1.87x compared to prior work), while improving detection time. Finally, we characterize the hardware complexity by extending an open core and synthesizing it on an FPGA platform, showing that the overhead is minimal."
Physical-Layer Detection of Hardware Keyloggers,"This work examines the general problem of detecting the presence of hardware keyloggers (HKLs), and specifically focuses on HKLs that are self-powered and take measures, such as passively tapping the keyboard line, to avoid detection. The work is inspired by the observer effect, which maintains that the act of observation impacts the observed. First, a model for HKLs is proposed, and experimentally validated, that explains how attaching a HKL necessarily affects the electrical characteristics of the system it is attached to. The model then motivates the selection of features that can be used for detection. A comparison framework is put forth that is sensitive enough to identify the minute changes in these features caused by HKLs. Experimental work carried out on a custom keylogger designed to conceal its presence, at the expense of reliability, shows that it is possible to detect stealthy and evasive keyloggers by observing as few as five keystrokes. Optimal attack strategies are devised to evade detection by the proposed approach and countermeasures evaluated that show detection is still possible. Environmental effects on detection performance are also examined and accounted for."
Reverse Engineering Intel Last-Level Cache Complex Addressing Using Performance Counters,"Cache attacks, which exploit differences in timing to perform covert or side channels, are now well understood. Recent works leverage the last level cache to perform cache attacks across cores. This cache is split in slices, with one slice per core. While predicting the slices used by an address is simple in older processors, recent processors are using an undocumented technique called complex addressing. This renders some attacks more difficult and makes other attacks impossible, because of the loss of precision in the prediction of cache collisions.In this paper, we build an automatic and generic method for reverse engineering Intel’s last-level cache complex addressing, consequently rendering the class of cache attacks highly practical. Our method relies on CPU hardware performance counters to determine the cache slice an address is mapped to. We show that our method gives a more precise description of the complex addressing function than previous work. We validated our method by reversing the complex addressing functions on a diverse set of Intel processors. This set encompasses Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge and Haswell micro-architectures, with different number of cores, for mobile and server ranges of processors. We show the correctness of our function by building a covert channel. Finally, we discuss how other attacks benefit from knowing the complex addressing of a cache, such as sandboxed rowhammer."
Hardware-Assisted Fine-Grained Code-Reuse Attack Detection,"Code-reuse attacks have become the primary exploitation technique for system compromise despite of the recently introduced Data Execution Prevention technique in modern platforms. Different from code injection attacks, they result in unintended control-flow transfer to victim programs without adding malicious code. This paper proposes a practical scheme named as CFIGuard to detect code-reuse attacks on user space applications. CFIGuard traces every branch execution by leveraging hardware features of commodity processors, and then validates the traces based on fine-grained control flow graphs. We have implemented a prototype of CFIGuard on Linux and the experiments show that it only incurs around 2.9 % runtime overhead for a set of typical server applications."
Haetae: Scaling the Performance of Network Intrusion Detection with Many-Core Processors,"In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Haetae, a high-performance Suricata-based NIDS on many-core processors (MCPs). Haetae achieves high performance with three design choices. First, Haetae extensively exploits high parallelism by launching NIDS engines that independently analyze the incoming flows at high speed as much as possible. Second, Haetae fully leverages programmable network interface cards to offload common packet processing tasks from regular cores. Also, Haetae minimizes redundant memory access by maintaining the packet metadata structure as small as possible. Third, Haetae dynamically offloads flows to the host-side CPU when the system experiences a high load. This dynamic flow offloading utilizes all processing power on a given system regardless of processor types. Our evaluation shows that Haetae achieves up to 79.3 Gbps for synthetic traffic or 48.5 Gbps for real packet traces. Our system outperforms the best-known GPU-based NIDS by 2.4 times and the best-performing MCP-based system by 1.7 times. In addition, Haetae is 5.8 times more power efficient than the state-of-the-art GPU-based NIDS."
Demystifying the IP Blackspace,"A small part of the IPv4 address space has still not been assigned for use to any organization. However, some of this IP space is announced through BGP, and is, therefore, globally reachable. These prefixes which are a subset of the bogon prefixes, constitute what we call the blackspace.It is generally admitted that the blackspace stands to be abused by anybody who wishes to carry out borderline and/or illegal activities without being traced.The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel methodology to accurately identify the IP blackspace. Based on data collected over a period of seven months, we study the routing-level characteristics of these networks and identify some benign reasons why these networks are announced on the Internet. Second, we focus on the security threat associated with these networks by looking at their application-level footprint. We identify live IP addresses and leverage them to fingerprint services running in these networks. Using this data we uncover a large amount of spam and scam activities. Finally, we present a case study of confirmed fraudulent routing of IP blackspace."
Providing Dynamic Control to Passive Network Security Monitoring,"Passive network intrusion detection systems detect a wide range of attacks, yet by themselves lack the capability to actively respond to what they find. Some sites thus provide their IDS with a separate control channel back to the network, typically by enabling it to dynamically insert ACLs into a gateway router for blocking IP addresses. Such setups, however, tend to remain narrowly tailored to the site’s specifics, with little opportunity for reuse elsewhere, as different networks deploy a wide array of hard- and software and differ in their network topologies. To overcome the shortcomings of such ad-hoc approaches, we present a novel network control framework that provides passive network monitoring systems with a flexible, unified interface for active response, hiding the complexity of heterogeneous network equipment behind a simple task-oriented API. Targeting operational deployment in large-scale network environments, we implement the design of our framework on top of an existing open-source IDS. We provide exemplary backends, including an interface to OpenFlow hardware, and evaluate our approach in terms of functionality and performance."
Probabilistic Inference on Integrity for Access Behavior Based Malware Detection,"Integrity protection has proven an effective way of malware detection and defense. Determining the integrity of subjects (programs) and objects (files and registries) plays a fundamental role in integrity protection. However, the large numbers of subjects and objects, and intricate behaviors place burdens on revealing their integrities either manually or by a set of rules. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model of integrity in modern operating system. Our model builds on two primary security policies, “no read down” and “no write up”, which make connections between observed access behaviors and the inherent integrity ordering between pairs of subjects and objects. We employ a message passing based inference to determine the integrity of subjects and objects under a probabilistic graphical model. Furthermore, by leveraging a statistical classifier, we build an integrity based access behavior model for malware detection. Extensive experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our model is capable of detecting 7,257 malware samples from 27,840 benign processes at 99.88 % true positive rate under 0.1 % false positive rate. These results indicate the feasibility of our probabilistic integrity model."
Counteracting Data-Only Malware with Code Pointer Examination,"As new code-based defense technologies emerge, attackers move to data-only malware, which is capable of infecting a system without introducing any new code. To manipulate the control flow without code, data-only malware inserts a control data structure into the system, for example in the form of a ROP chain, which enables it to combine existing instructions into a new malicious program. Current systems try to hinder data-only malware by detecting the point in time when the malware starts executing. However, it has been shown that these approaches are not only performance consuming, but can also be subverted.In this work, we introduce a new approach, Code Pointer Examination (CPE), which aims to detect data-only malware by identifying and classifying code pointers. Instead of targeting control flow changes, our approach targets the control structure of data-only malware, which mainly consists of pointers to the instruction sequences that the malware reuses. Since the control structure is comparable to the code region of traditional malware, this results in an effective detection approach that is difficult to evade. We implemented a prototype for recent Linux kernels that is capable of identifying and classifying all code pointers within the kernel. As our experiments show, our prototype is able to detect data-only malware in an efficient manner (less than 1 % overhead)."
Xede: Practical Exploit Early Detection,"Code reuse and code injection attacks have become the popular techniques for advanced persistent threat (APT) to bypass exploit-mitigation mechanisms deployed in modern operating systems. Meanwhile, complex, benign programs such as Microsoft Office employ many advanced techniques to improve the performance. Code execution patterns generated by these techniques are surprisingly similar to exploits. This makes the practical exploit detection very challenging, especially on the Windows platform. In this paper, we propose a practical exploit early detection system called Xede to comprehensively detect code reuse and code injection attacks. Xede can effectively reduce false positives and false negatives in the exploit detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Xede by experimenting with exploit samples and deploying Xede on the Internet. Xede can accurately detect all types of exploits. In particular, it can capture many exploits that cannot be captured by mainstream anti-virus software and detect exploits that fail to compromise the systems due to variations in the system configurations."
Preventing Exploits in Microsoft Office Documents Through Content Randomization,"Malware laden documents are a common exploit vector, often used as attachments to phishing emails. Current approaches seek to detect the malicious attributes of documents through signature matching, dynamic analysis, or machine learning. We take a different approach: we perform transformations on documents that render exploits inoperable while maintaining the visual interpretation of the document intact. Our exploit mitigation techniques are similar in effect to address space layout randomization and data randomization, but we implement them through permutations to the document file layout.We randomize the data block order of Microsoft OLE files in a manner similar to the inverse of a filesystem defragmention tool. This relocates malicious payloads in both the original document file and in the memory of the reader program. Through dynamic analysis, we demonstrate that our approach indeed subdues in the wild exploits in both Office 2003 and Office 2007 documents while the transformed documents continue to render benign content properly. We also show that randomizing the compression used in zip based OOXML files mitigates some attacks. The strength of these mechanisms lie in the number of content representation permutations, and the method applies where raw document content is used in attacks. Content randomization methods can be performed offline and require only a single document scan while the user-perceived delay when opening the transformed document is negligible."
Improving Accuracy of Static Integer Overflow Detection in Binary,"Integer overflow presents a major source of security threats to information systems. However, current solutions are less effective in detecting integer overflow vulnerabilities: they either produce unacceptably high false positive rates or cannot generate concrete inputs towards vulnerability exploration. This limits the usability of these solutions in analyzing real-world applications, especially those in the format of binary executables.In this paper, we present a platform, called INDIO, for accurately detecting integer overflow vulnerabilities in Windows binaries. INDIO integrates the techniques of pattern-matching (for quick identification of potential vulnerabilities), vulnerability ranking (for economic elimination of false positives), and selective symbolic execution (for rigorous elimination of false positives). As a result, INDIO can detect integer overflow with low false positive and false negative rates.We have applied INDIO to several real-world, large-size Windows binaries, and the experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of INDIO (all known and two previously unknown integer overflows vulnerabilities were detected). The experiments also demonstrate that the vulnerability ranking technique and other optimization techniques employed in INDIO can significantly reduce false positives with economic costs."
A Formal Framework for Program Anomaly Detection,"Program anomaly detection analyzes normal program behaviors and discovers aberrant executions caused by attacks, misconfigurations, program bugs, and unusual usage patterns. The merit of program anomaly detection is its independence from attack signatures, which enables proactive defense against new and unknown attacks. In this paper, we formalize the general program anomaly detection problem and point out two of its key properties. We present a unified framework to present any program anomaly detection method in terms of its detection capability. We prove the theoretical accuracy limit for program anomaly detection with an abstract detection machine. We show how existing solutions are positioned in our framework and illustrate the gap between state-of-the-art methods and the theoretical accuracy limit. We also point out some potential modeling features for future program anomaly detection evolution."
jÄk: Using Dynamic Analysis to Crawl and Test Modern Web Applications,"Web application scanners are popular tools to perform black box testing and are widely used to discover bugs in websites. For them to work effectively, they either rely on a set of URLs that they can test, or use their own implementation of a crawler that discovers new parts of a web application. Traditional crawlers would extract new URLs by parsing HTML documents and applying static regular expressions. While this approach can extract URLs in classic web applications, it fails to explore large parts of modern JavaScript-based applications.In this paper, we present a novel technique to explore web applications based on the dynamic analysis of the client-side JavaScript program. We use dynamic analysis to hook JavaScript APIs, which enables us to detect the registration of events, the use of network communication APIs, and dynamically-generated URLs or user forms. We then propose to use a navigation graph to perform further crawling. Based on this new crawling technique, we present jÄk, a web application scanner. We compare jÄk  against four existing web-application scanners on 13 web applications. The experiments show that our approach can explore a surface of the web applications that is 86 % larger than with existing approaches."
WYSISNWIV: What You Scan Is Not What I Visit,"A variety of attacks, including remote-code execution exploits, malware, and phishing, are delivered to users over the web. Users are lured to malicious websites in various ways, including through spam delivered over email and instant messages, and by links injected in search engines and popular benign websites. In response to such attacks, many initiatives, such as Google’s Safe Browsing, are trying to make the web a safer place by scanning URLs to automatically detect and blacklist malicious pages. Such blacklists are then used to block dangerous content, take down domains hosting malware, and warn users that have clicked on suspicious links. However, they are only useful, when scanners and browsers address the web the same way. This paper presents a study that exposes differences on how browsers and scanners parse URLs. These differences leave users vulnerable to malicious web content, because the same URL leads the browser to one page, while the scanner follows the URL to scan another page. We experimentally test all major browsers and URL scanners, as well as various applications that parse URLs, and discover multiple discrepancies. In particular, we discover that pairing Firefox with the blacklist produced by Google’s Safe Browsing, leaves Firefox users exposed to malicious content hosted under URLs including the backslash character. The problem is a general one and affects various applications and URL scanners. Even though, the solution is technically straightforward, it requires that multiple parties follow the same standard when parsing URLs. Currently, the standard followed by an application, seems to be unconsciously dictated by the URL parser implementation it is using, while most browsers have strayed from the URL RFC."
SDN Rootkits: Subverting Network Operating Systems of Software-Defined Networks,"The new paradigm of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enables exciting new functionality for building networks. Its core component is the so called SDN controller (also termed network operating system). An SDN controller is logically centralized and crucially important, thus, exploiting it can significantly harm SDN-based networks. As recent work considers only flaws and rudimentary malicious logic inside SDN applications, we focus on rootkit techniques which enable attackers to subvert network operating systems. We present two prototype implementations: a SDN rootkit for the industry’s leading open source controller OpenDaylight as well as a version with basic rootkit functions for the commercial and non-OpenDaylight-based HP controller. Our SDN rootkit is capable of actively hiding itself and malicious network programming as well as providing remote access. Since OpenDaylight intends to establish a reference framework for network operating systems (both open source and commercial), our work demonstrates potential threats for a wide range of network operating systems."
AppSpear: Bytecode Decrypting and DEX Reassembling for Packed Android Malware,"As the techniques for Android malware detection are progressing, malware also fights back through deploying advanced code encryption with the help of Android packers. An effective Android malware detection therefore must take the unpacking issue into consideration to prove the accuracy. Unfortunately, this issue is not easily addressed. Android packers often adopt multiple complex anti-analysis defenses and are evolving frequently. Current unpacking approaches are either based on manual efforts, which are slow and tedious, or based on coarse-grained memory dumping, which are susceptible to a variety of anti-monitoring defenses.This paper conducts a systematic study on existing Android malware which is packed. A thorough investigation on 37,688 Android malware samples is conducted to take statistics of how widespread are those samples protected by Android packers. The anti-analysis techniques of related commercial Android packers are also summarized. Then, we propose AppSpear, a generic and fine-grained system for automatically malware unpacking. Its core technique is a bytecode decrypting and Dalvik executable (DEX) reassembling method, which is able to recover any protected bytecode effectively without the knowledge of the packer. AppSpear directly instruments the Dalvik VM to collect the decrypted bytecode information from the Dalvik Data Struct (DDS), and performs the unpacking by conducting a refined reassembling process to create a new DEX file. The unpacked app is then available for being analyzed by common program analysis tools or malware detection systems. Our experimental evaluation shows that AppSpear could sanitize mainstream Android packers and help detect more malicious behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, AppSpear is the first automatic and generic unpacking system for current commercial Android packers."
HelDroid: Dissecting and Detecting Mobile Ransomware,"In ransomware attacks, the actual target is the human, as opposed to the classic attacks that abuse the infected devices (e.g., botnet renting, information stealing). Mobile devices are by no means immune to ransomware attacks. However, there is little research work on this matter and only traditional protections are available. Even state-of-the-art mobile malware detection approaches are ineffective against ransomware apps because of the subtle attack scheme. As a consequence, the ample attack surface formed by the billion mobile devices is left unprotected.First, in this work we summarize the results of our analysis of the existing mobile ransomware families, describing their common characteristics. Second, we present HelDroid, a fast, efficient and fully automated approach that recognizes known and unknown scareware and ransomware samples from goodware. Our approach is based on detecting the “building blocks” that are typically needed to implement a mobile ransomware application. Specifically, HelDroid detects, in a generic way, if an app is attempting to lock or encrypt the device without the user’s consent, and if ransom requests are displayed on the screen. Our technique works without requiring that a sample of a certain family is available beforehand.We implemented HelDroid and tested it on real-world Android ransomware samples. On a large dataset comprising hundreds of thousands of APKs including goodware, malware, scareware, and ransomware, HelDroid exhibited nearly zero false positives and the capability of recognizing unknown ransomware samples."
"Continuous Authentication on Mobile Devices Using Power Consumption, Touch Gestures and Physical Movement of Users","Handheld devices today do not continuously verify the identity of the user while sensitive activities are performed. This enables attackers, who can either compromise the initial password or grab the device after login, full access to sensitive data and applications on the device. To mitigate this risk, we propose continuous user monitoring using a machine learning based approach comprising of an ensemble of three distinct modalities: power consumption, touch gestures, and physical movement. Users perform different activities on different applications: we consider application context when we model user behavior. We employ anomaly detection algorithms for each modality and place a bound on the fraction of anomalous events that can be considered “normal” for any given user. We evaluated our system using data collected from 73 volunteer participants. We were able to verify that our system is functional in real-time while the end-user was utilizing popular mobile applications."
Privacy Risk Assessment on Online Photos,"With the rising popularity of cameras and people’s increasing desire to share photos, an overwhelming number of photos have been posted all over the Web. A digital photo usually contains much information in its metadata. Once published online, a photo could disclose much more information beyond what is visually depicted in the photo and what the owner expects to share. The metadata contained in digital photos could pose significant privacy threats to their owners. Our work aims to raise public awareness of privacy risks resulting from sharing photos online and subsequent photo handling conducted by contemporary media sites. To this end, we investigated the prevalence of metadata information among digital photos and assessed the potential privacy risks arising from the metadata information. We also studied the policies adopted by online media sites on handling the metadata information embedded in the photos they host. We examined nearly 100,000 photos collected from over 600 top-ranked websites in seven categories and found that the photo handling policy adopted by a site largely varies depending on the category of the site. We demonstrated that some trivial looking metadata information suffices to mount real-world attacks against photo owners."
Privacy is Not an Option: Attacking the IPv6 Privacy Extension,"The IPv6 privacy extension introduces temporary addresses to protect against address-based correlation, i.e., the attribution of different transactions to the same origin using addresses, and is considered as state-of-the-art mechanism for privacy protection in IPv6. In this paper, we scrutinize the extension’s capability for protection by analyzing its algorithm for temporary address generation in detail. We develop an attack that is based on two insights and shows that the notion of protection is false: First, randomization is scarce and future identifiers can be predicted once the algorithm’s internal state is known. Second, a victim’s temporary addresses form a side channel and allow an adversary to synchronize to this internal state. Finally, we highlight mitigation strategies, and recommend a revision of the extension’s specification."
Evaluation of Intrusion Detection Systems in Virtualized Environments Using Attack Injection,"The evaluation of intrusion detection systems (IDSes) is an active research area with many open challenges, one of which is the generation of representative workloads that contain attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the rigorous evaluation of IDSes in virtualized environments, with a focus on IDSes designed to detect attacks leveraging or targeting the hypervisor via its hypercall interface. We present hInjector, a tool for generating IDS evaluation workloads by injecting such attacks during regular operation of a virtualized environment. We demonstrate the application of our approach and show its practical usefulness by evaluating a representative IDS designed to operate in virtualized environments. The virtualized environment of the industry-standard benchmark SPECvirt_sc2013 is used as a testbed, whose drivers generate workloads representative of workloads seen in production environments. This work enables for the first time the injection of attacks in virtualized environments for the purpose of generating representative IDS evaluation workloads."
Security Analysis of PHP Bytecode Protection Mechanisms,"PHP is the most popular scripting language for web applications. Because no native solution to compile or protect PHP scripts exists, PHP applications are usually shipped as plain source code which is easily understood or copied by an adversary. In order to prevent such attacks, commercial products such as ionCube, Zend Guard, and Source Guardian promise a source code protection.In this paper, we analyze the inner working and security of these tools and propose a method to recover the source code by leveraging static and dynamic analysis techniques. We introduce a generic approach for decompilation of obfuscated bytecode and show that it is possible to automatically recover the original source code of protected software. As a result, we discovered previously unknown vulnerabilities and backdoors in 1 million lines of recovered source code of 10 protected applications."
Radmin: Early Detection of Application-Level Resource Exhaustion and Starvation Attacks,"Software systems are often engineered and tested for functionality under normal rather than worst-case conditions. This makes the systems vulnerable to denial of service attacks, where attackers engineer conditions that result in overconsumption of resources or starvation and stalling of execution. While the security community is well familiar with volumetric resource exhaustion attacks at the network and transport layers, application-specific attacks pose a challenging threat. In this paper, we present Radmin, a novel system for early detection of application-level resource exhaustion and starvation attacks. Radmin works directly on compiled binaries. It learns and executes multiple probabilistic finite automata from benign runs of target programs. Radmin confines the resource usage of target programs to the learned automata, and detects resource usage anomalies at their early stages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Radmin by testing it over a variety of resource exhaustion and starvation weaknesses on commodity off-the-shelf software."
Towards Automatic Inference of Kernel Object Semantics from Binary Code,"This paper presents Argos, the first system that can automatically uncover the semantics of kernel objects directly from a kernel binary. Based on the principle of data use reveals data semantics, it starts from the execution of system calls (i.e., the user level application interface) and exported kernel APIs (i.e., the kernel module development interface), and automatically tracks how an instruction accesses the kernel object and assigns a bit-vector for each observed kernel object. This bit-vector encodes which system call accesses the object and how the object is accessed (e.g., read, write, create, destroy), from which we derive the meaning of the kernel object based on a set of rules developed according to the general understanding of OS kernels. The experimental results with Linux kernels show that Argos is able to recognize the semantics of kernel objects of our interest, and can even directly pinpoint the important kernel data structures such as the process descriptor and memory descriptor across different kernels. We have applied Argos to recognize internal kernel functions by using the kernel objects we inferred, and we demonstrate that with Argos we can build a more precise kernel event tracking system by hooking these internal functions."
[equation],"Botnets are one of the most serious threats to Internet security today. Modern botnets have complex infrastructures consisting of multiple components, which can be dynamically installed, updated, and removed at any time during the botnet operation. Tracking botnets is essential for understanding the current threat landscape. However, state-of-the-art analysis approaches have several limitations. Many malware analysis systems like sandboxes have a very limited analysis time-out, and thus only allow limited insights into the long-time behavior of a botnet. In contrast, customized tracking systems are botnet-specific and need to be adopted to each malware family, which requires tedious manual reverse engineering.In this paper, we present BotWatcher, a novel approach for transparent and generic botnet tracking. To this end, we leverage dynamic analysis and memory forensics techniques to execute the initial malware sample and later installed modules in a controlled environment and regularly obtain insights into the state of the analysis system. The key idea behind BotWatcher is that by reasoning about the evolution of system state over time, we can reconstruct a high-level overview of the botnet lifecycle, i.e., the sequence of botnet actions that caused this evolution. Our approach is generic since it relies neither on previous knowledge of the botnet nor on OS-specific features. Transparency is achieved by performing outside-OS monitoring and not installing any analysis tools in the analysis environment. We implemented BotWatcher for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X (both 32- and 64-bit architectures), and applied it to monitor four botnets targeting Microsoft Windows. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a generic, transparent, and fully automated botnet tracking system."
Elite: Automatic Orchestration of Elastic Detection Services to Secure Cloud Hosting,"Intrusion detection on today’s cloud is challenging: a user’s application is automatically deployed through new cloud orchestration tools (e.g., OpenStack Heat, Amazon CloudFormation, etc.), and its computing resources (i.e., virtual machine instances) come and go dynamically during its runtime, depending on its workloads and configurations. Under such a dynamic environment, a centralized detection service needs to keep track of the state of the whole deployment (a cloud stack), size up and down its own computing power and dynamically allocate its existing resources and configure new resources to catch up with what happens in the application. Particularly in the case of anomaly detection, new application instances created at runtime are expected to be protected instantly, without going through conventional profile learning, which disrupts the operations of the application.To address those challenges, we developed Elite, a new elastic computing framework, to support high-performance detection services on the cloud. Our techniques are designed to be fully integrated into today’s cloud orchestration mechanisms, allowing an o rdinary cloud user to requ est a detection service and specify its parameters conveniently, through the cloud-formation file she submits for deploying her application. Such a detection service is supported by a high-performance stream-processing engine, and optimized for concurrent analysis of a large amount of data streamed from application instances and automatic adaptation to different computing scales. It is linked to the cloud orchestration engine through a communication mechanism, which provides the runtime information of the application (e.g., the types of new instances created) necessary for the service to dynamically configure its resources. To avoid profile learning, we further studied a set of techniques that enable reuse of normal behavior profiles across different instances within one user’s cloud stack, and across different users (in a privacy-preserving way). We evaluated our implementation of Elite on popular web applications deployed over 60 instances. Our study shows that Elite efficiently shares profiles without losing their accuracy and effectively handles dynamic, intensive workloads incurred by these applications."
AmpPot: Monitoring and Defending Against Amplification DDoS Attacks,"The recent amplification DDoS attacks have swamped victims with huge loads of undesired traffic, sometimes even exceeding hundreds of Gbps attack bandwidth. We analyze these amplification attacks in more detail. First, we inspect the reconnaissance step, i.e., how both researchers and attackers scan for amplifiers that are open for abuse. Second, we design AmpPot, a novel honeypot that tracks amplification attacks. We deploy 21 honeypots to reveal previously-undocumented insights about the attacks. We find that the vast majority of attacks are short-lived and most victims are attacked only once. Furthermore, 96 % of the attacks stem from single sources, which is also confirmed by our detailed analysis of four popular Linux-based DDoS botnets."
