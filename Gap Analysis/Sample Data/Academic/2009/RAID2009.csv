Panacea: Automating Attack Classification for Anomaly-Based Network Intrusion Detection Systems,"Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems are usually criticized because they lack a classification of attacks, thus security teams have to manually inspect any raised alert to classify it. We present a new approach, Panacea, to automatically and systematically classify attacks detected by an anomaly-based network intrusion detection system."
Protecting a Moving Target: Addressing Web Application Concept Drift,"Because of the ad hoc nature of web applications, intrusion detection systems that leverage machine learning techniques are particularly well-suited for protecting websites. The reason is that these systems are able to characterize the applications’ normal behavior in an automated fashion. However, anomaly-based detectors for web applications suffer from false positives that are generated whenever the applications being protected change. These false positives need to be analyzed by the security officer who then has to interact with the web application developers to confirm that the reported alerts were indeed erroneous detections.In this paper, we propose a novel technique for the automatic detection of changes in web applications, which allows for the selective retraining of the affected anomaly detection models. We demonstrate that, by correctly identifying legitimate changes in web applications, we can reduce false positives and allow for the automated retraining of the anomaly models.We have evaluated our approach by analyzing a number of real-world applications. Our analysis shows that web applications indeed change substantially over time, and that our technique is able to effectively detect changes and automatically adapt the anomaly detection models to the new structure of the changed web applications."
Adaptive Anomaly Detection via Self-calibration and Dynamic Updating,"The deployment and use of Anomaly Detection (AD) sensors often requires the intervention of a human expert to manually calibrate and optimize their performance. Depending on the site and the type of traffic it receives, the operators might have to provide recent and sanitized training data sets, the characteristics of expected traffic (i.e. outlier ratio), and exceptions or even expected future modifications of system’s behavior. In this paper, we study the potential performance issues that stem from fully automating the AD sensors’ day-to-day maintenance and calibration. Our goal is to remove the dependence on human operator using an unlabeled, and thus potentially dirty, sample of incoming traffic.To that end, we propose to enhance the training phase of AD sensors with a self-calibration phase, leading to the automatic determination of the optimal AD parameters. We show how this novel calibration phase can be employed in conjunction with previously proposed methods for training data sanitization resulting in a fully automated AD maintenance cycle. Our approach is completely agnostic to the underlying AD sensor algorithm. Furthermore, the self-calibration can be applied in an online fashion to ensure that the resulting AD models reflect changes in the system’s behavior which would otherwise render the sensor’s internal state inconsistent. We verify the validity of our approach through a series of experiments where we compare the manually obtained optimal parameters with the ones computed from the self-calibration phase. Modeling traffic from two different sources, the fully automated calibration shows a 7.08% reduction in detection rate and a 0.06% increase in false positives, in the worst case, when compared to the optimal selection of parameters. Finally, our adaptive models outperform the statically generated ones retaining the gains in performance from the sanitization process over time."
Runtime Monitoring and Dynamic Reconfiguration for Intrusion Detection Systems,"Our work proposes a generic architecture for runtime monitoring and optimization of IDS based on the challenge insertion. The challenges, known instances of malicious or legitimate behavior, are inserted into the network traffic represented by NetFlow records, processed with the current traffic and the system’s response to the challenges is used to determine its effectiveness and to fine-tune its parameters. The insertion of challenges is based on the threat models expressed as attack trees with attached risk/loss values. The use of threat model allows the system to measure the expected undetected loss and to improve its performance with respect to the relevant threats, as we have verified in the experiments performed on live network traffic."
Malware Behavioral Detection by Attribute-Automata Using Abstraction from Platform and Language,"Most behavioral detectors of malware remain specific to a given language and platform, mostly executables for Windows. The objective of this paper is to define a generic approach for behavioral detection based on two layers respectively responsible for abstraction and detection. The abstraction layer is specific to a platform and a language. It interprets the collected instructions, API calls and arguments and classifies these operations, as well as the objects involved, according to their purpose in the malware lifecycle. The detection layer remains generic and interoperable with different abstraction components. It relies on parallel automata parsing attribute-grammars where semantic rules are used for object typing (object classification) and object binding (data-flow). Theoretical results are first given with respect to the grammatical constraints weighting on the signature construction as well as to the resulting complexity of the detection. For experimentation purposes, two abstraction components have then been developed: one processing system call traces and the other processing the VBScript interpreted language. Experimentations have provided promising detection rates, in particular for scripts (89%), with almost no false positives. In the case of process traces, the detection rate remains significant (51%) but could be increased by sophisticated collection tools."
Automatic Generation of String Signatures for Malware Detection,"Scanning files for signatures is a proven technology, but exponential growth in unique malware programs has caused an explosion in signature database sizes. One solution to this problem is to use string signatures, each of which is a contiguous byte sequence that potentially can match many variants of a malware family. However, it is not clear how to automatically generate these string signatures with a sufficiently low false positive rate. Hancock is the first string signature generation system that takes on this challenge on a large scale.To minimize the false positive rate, Hancock features a scalable model that estimates the occurrence probability of arbitrary byte sequences in goodware programs, a set of library code identification techniques, and diversity-based heuristics that ensure the contexts in which a signature is embedded in containing malware files are similar to one another. With these techniques combined, Hancock is able to automatically generate string signatures with a false positive rate below 0.1%."
PE-Miner: Mining Structural Information to Detect Malicious Executables in Realtime,"In this paper, we present an accurate and realtime PE-Miner framework that automatically extracts distinguishing features from portable executables (PE) to detect zero-day (i.e. previously unknown) malware. The distinguishing features are extracted using the structural information standardized by the Microsoft Windows operating system for executables, DLLs and object files. We follow a threefold research methodology: (1) identify a set of structural features for PE files which is computable in realtime, (2) use an efficient preprocessor for removing redundancy in the features’ set, and (3) select an efficient data mining algorithm for final classification between benign and malicious executables.We have evaluated PE-Miner on two malware collections, VX Heavens and Malfease datasets which contain about 11 and 5 thousand malicious PE files respectively. The results of our experiments show that PE-Miner achieves more than 99% detection rate with less than 0.5% false alarm rate for distinguishing between benign and malicious executables. PE-Miner has low processing overheads and takes only 0.244 seconds on the average to scan a given PE file. Finally, we evaluate the robustness and reliability of PE-Miner under several regression tests. Our results show that the extracted features are robust to different packing techniques and PE-Miner is also resilient to majority of crafty evasion strategies."
Automatically Adapting a Trained Anomaly Detector to Software Patches,"In order to detect a compromise of a running process based on it deviating from its program’s normal system-call behavior, an anomaly detector must first be trained with traces of system calls made by the program when provided clean inputs. When a patch for the monitored program is released, however, the system call behavior of the new version might differ from that of the version it replaces, rendering the anomaly detector too inaccurate for monitoring the new version. In this paper we explore an alternative to collecting traces of the new program version in a clean environment (which may take effort to set up), namely adapting the anomaly detector to accommodate the differences between the old and new program versions. We demonstrate that this adaptation is feasible for such an anomaly detector, given the output of a state-of-the-art binary difference analyzer. Our analysis includes both proofs of properties of the adapted detector, and empirical evaluation of adapted detectors based on four software case studies."
Towards Generating High Coverage Vulnerability-Based Signatures with Protocol-Level Constraint-Guided Exploration,"Signature-based input filtering is an important and widely deployed defense. But current signature generation methods have limited coverage and the generated signatures often can be easily evaded by an attacker with small variations of the exploit message. In this paper, we propose protocol-level constraint-guided exploration, a new approach towards generating high coverage vulnerability-based signatures. In particular, our approach generates high coverage, yet compact, vulnerability point reachability predicates, which capture many paths to the vulnerability point. In our experimental results, our tool, Elcano, generates compact, high coverage signatures for real-world vulnerabilities."
Automated Behavioral Fingerprinting,"This paper addresses the fingerprinting of devices that speak a common, yet unknown to the fingerprinting engine, protocol. We consider a behavioral approach, where the fingerprinting of an unknown protocol is based on detecting and exploiting differences in the observed behavior from two or more devices. Our approach assumes zero knowledge about the syntax and state machine underlying the protocol. The main contribution of this paper consists in a two phased method. The first phase identifies the different message types using an unsupervised support vector clustering algorithm. The second phase is leveraging recent advances in tree support kernel in order to learn and differentiate different implementations of that protocol. The key idea is to represent behavior in terms of trees and learn the distinctive subtrees that are specific to one particular device. Our solution is passive and does not assume active and stimulus triggered behavior templates. We instantiate our solution to the particular case of a VoIP specific protocol (SIP) and validate it using extensive data sets collected on a large size VoIP testbed."
SMS-Watchdog: Profiling Social Behaviors of SMS Users for Anomaly Detection,"With more than one trillion mobile messages delivered worldwide every year, SMS has been a lucrative playground for various attacks and frauds such as spamming, phishing and spoofing. These SMS-based attacks pose serious security threats to both mobile users and cellular network operators, such as information stealing, overcharging, battery exhaustion, and network congestion. Against the backdrop that approaches to protecting SMS security are lagging behind, we propose a lightweight scheme called SMS-Watchdog that can detect anomalous SMS behaviors with high accuracy. Our key contributions are summarized as follows: (1) After analyzing an SMS trace collected within a five-month period, we conclude that for the majority of SMS users, there are window-based regularities regarding whom she sends messages to and how frequently she sends messages to each recipient. (2) With these regularities, we accordingly propose four detection schemes that build normal social behavior profiles for each SMS user and then use them to detect SMS anomalies in an online and streaming fashion. Each of these schemes stores only a few states (typically, at most 12 states) in memory for each SMS user, thereby imposing very low overhead for online anomaly detection. (3) We evaluate these four schemes and also two hybrid approaches with realistic SMS traces. The results show that the hybrid approaches can detect more than 92% of SMS-based attacks with false alarm rate 8.5%, or about two thirds of the attacks without any false alarm, depending on their parameter settings."
Keystroke-Based User Identification on Smart Phones,"Smart phones are now being used to store users’ identities and sensitive information/data. Therefore, it is important to authenticate legitimate users of a smart phone and to block imposters. In this paper, we demonstrate that keystroke dynamics of a smart phone user can be translated into a viable features’ set for accurate user identification. To this end, we collect and analyze keystroke data of 25 diverse smart phone users. Based on this analysis, we select six distinguishing keystroke features that can be used for user identification. We show that these keystroke features for different users are diffused and therefore a fuzzy classifier is well-suited to cluster and classify them. We then optimize the front-end fuzzy classifier using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as back-end dynamic optimizers to adapt to variations in usage patterns. Finally, we provide a novel keystroke dynamics based PIN (Personal Identification Number) verification mode to ensure information security on smart phones. The results of our experiments show that the proposed user identification system has an average error rate of 2% after the detection mode and the error rate of rejecting legitimate users drops to zero in the PIN verification mode. We also compare error rates (in terms of detecting both legitimate users and imposters) of our proposed classifier with 5 existing state-of-the-art techniques for user identification on desktop computers. Our results show that the proposed technique consistently and considerably outperforms existing schemes."
VirusMeter: Preventing Your Cellphone from Spies,"Due to the rapid advancement of mobile communication technology, mobile devices nowadays can support a variety of data services that are not traditionally available. With the growing popularity of mobile devices in the last few years, attacks targeting them are also surging. Existing mobile malware detection techniques, which are often borrowed from solutions to Internet malware detection, do not perform as effectively due to the limited computing resources on mobile devices.In this paper, we propose VirusMeter, a novel and general malware detection method, to detect anomalous behaviors on mobile devices. The rationale underlying VirusMeter is the fact that mobile devices are usually battery powered and any malicious activity would inevitably consume some battery power. By monitoring power consumption on a mobile device, VirusMeter catches misbehaviors that lead to abnormal power consumption. For this purpose, VirusMeter relies on a concise user-centric power model that characterizes power consumption of common user behaviors. In a real-time mode, VirusMeter can perform fast malware detection with trivial runtime overhead. When the battery is charging (referred to as a battery-charging mode), VirusMeter applies more sophisticated machine learning techniques to further improve the detection accuracy. To demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness, we have implemented a VirusMeter prototype on Nokia 5500 Sport and used it to evaluate some real cellphone malware, including FlexiSPY and Cabir. Our experimental results show that VirusMeter can effectively detect these malware activities with less than 1.5% additional power consumption in real time."
Regular Expression Matching on Graphics Hardware for Intrusion Detection,"The expressive power of regular expressions has been often exploited in network intrusion detection systems, virus scanners, and spam filtering applications. However, the flexible pattern matching functionality of regular expressions in these systems comes with significant overheads in terms of both memory and CPU cycles, since every byte of the inspected input needs to be processed and compared against a large set of regular expressions.In this paper we present the design, implementation and evaluation of a regular expression matching engine running on graphics processing units (GPUs). The significant spare computational power and data parallelism capabilities of modern GPUs permits the efficient matching of multiple inputs at the same time against a large set of regular expressions. Our evaluation shows that regular expression matching on graphics hardware can result to a 48 times speedup over traditional CPU implementations and up to 16 Gbit/s in processing throughput. We demonstrate the feasibility of GPU regular expression matching by implementing it in the popular Snort intrusion detection system, which results to a 60% increase in the packet processing throughput."
Multi-byte Regular Expression Matching with Speculation,"Intrusion prevention systems determine whether incoming traffic matches a database of signatures, where each signature in the database represents an attack or a vulnerability. IPSs need to keep up with ever-increasing line speeds, which leads to the use of custom hardware. A major bottleneck that IPSs face is that they scan incoming packets one byte at a time, which limits their throughput and latency. In this paper, we present a method for scanning multiple bytes in parallel using speculation. We break the packet in several chunks, opportunistically scan them in parallel and if the speculation is wrong, correct it later. We present algorithms that apply speculation in single-threaded software running on commodity processors as well as algorithms for parallel hardware. Experimental results show that speculation leads to improvements in latency and throughput in both cases."
Toward Revealing Kernel Malware Behavior in Virtual Execution Environments,"Using a sandbox for malware analysis has proven effective in helping people quickly understand the behavior of unknown malware. This technique is also complementary to other malware analysis techniques such as static code analysis and debugger-based code analysis. This paper presents Rkprofiler, a sandbox-based malware tracking system that dynamically monitors and analyzes the behavior of Windows kernel malware. Kernel malware samples run inside a virtual machine (VM) that is supported and managed by a PC emulator. By building its monitoring component into the PC emulator, Rkprofiler is able to inspect each instruction executed by the kernel malware and therefore possesses a powerful weapon against the malware. Rkprofiler provides several capabilities that other malware tracking systems do not. First, it can detect the execution of malicious kernel code regardless of how the monitored kernel malware is loaded into the kernel and whether it is packed or not. Second, it captures all function calls made by the kernel malware and constructs call graphs from the trace files. Third, a technique called aggressive memory tagging (AMT) is proposed to track the dynamic data objects that the kernel malware visit. Last, Rkprofiler records and reports the hardware access events of kernel malware (e.g., MSR register reads and writes). Our evaluation results show that Rkprofiler can quickly expose the security-sensitive activities of kernel malware and thus reduces the effort exerted in conducting tedious manual malware analysis."
Exploiting Temporal Persistence to Detect Covert Botnet Channels,"We describe a method to detect botnet command and control traffic and individual end-hosts. We introduce the notion of “destination traffic atoms” which aggregate the destinations and services that are communicated with. We then compute the ”persistence”, which is a measure of temporal regularity and that we propose in this paper, for individual destination atoms. Very persistent destination atoms are added to a host’s whitelist during a training period. Subsequently, we track the persistence of new destination atoms not already whitelisted in order to identify suspicious C&C destinations. A particularly novel aspect is that we track persistence at multiple timescales concurrently. Importantly, our method does not require any a-priori information about destinations, ports, or protocols used by the C&C communication, nor do we require payload inspection. We evaluate our system using extensive user traffic traces collected from an enterprise network, along with collected botnet traces.We demonstrate that our method correctly identifies a botnet’s C&C traffic, even when it is very stealthy. We also show that filtering outgoing traffic with the constructed whitelists dramatically improves the performance of traditional anomaly detectors. Finally, we show that the C&C detection can be achieved with a very low false positive rate."
An Experimental Study on Instance Selection Schemes for Efficient Network Anomaly Detection,"Traditional researches on network anomaly detection have been solely focused on the detection algorithms, whereas an important issue that has not been well studied so far is the selection of normal training data for network anomaly detection algorithm, which is highly related to the detection performance and computational complexities. In this poster, we present two instance selection mechanism – EFCM (Enhanced Fuzzy C-Means) as well asGA (Genetic Algorithm) for network anomaly detection algorithm, aiming at limiting the size of training dataset, thus reducing the computational cost of them, as well as boosting their detection performance. We report our experimental results on several classic network anomaly detection algorithms by using the network traffic trace collected from a real network environment."
Automatic Software Instrumentation for the Detection of Non-control-data Attacks,"To detect intrusions resulting of an attack that corrupted data items used by a program to perform its computation, we propose an approach that automatically instruments programs to control a data-based behavior model during their execution. We build our model by discovering the sets of data the system calls depend on and which constraints these sets must verify at runtime. We have implemented our approach using a static analysis framework called Frama-C and we present the results of experimentations on a vulnerable version of OpenSSH."
BLADE: Slashing the Invisible Channel of Drive-by Download Malware,"Drive-by downloads, which result in the unauthorized installation of code through the browser and into the victim host, have become one of the dominant means through which mass infections now occur. We present BLADE (Block All Drive-by download Exploits), a browserindependent system that seeks to eliminate the drive-by threat. BLADE prudently assumes that the legitimate download of any executable must result from explicit user consent. BLADE transparently redirects every browser download into a non-executable safe zone on disk, unless it is associated with a programmatically inferred user-consent event. BLADE thwarts the necessary underlying transaction on which all drive-by downloads rely, therefore it requires no prior knowledge of the exploit methods, and is not subject to circumvention by obfuscations or zero-day threats."
CERN Investigation of Network Behaviour and Anomaly Detection,"The CINBAD (CERN Investigation of Network Behaviour and Anomaly Detection) project was launched in 2007 in collaboration with ProCurve Networking by HP. The project mission is to understand the behaviour of large computer networks in the context of high performance computing and large campus installations such as at CERN, whose network today counts roughly 70,000 Gigabit user ports. The goals of the project are to be able to detect traffic anomalies in such systems, perform trend analysis, automatically take counter measures and provide post-mortem analysis facilities. This paper will present the main project principles, data sources, data collection and analysis approaches as well as the initial findings."
Blare Tools: A Policy-Based Intrusion Detection System Automatically Set by the Security Policy,"We present here an intrusion detection system automatically parameterized by the security policy. The main idea consists in monitoring information flows in an operating system in order to detect those not allowed by the security policy. In previous works ([1,2] and [3]), the security policy set at the initialization of the IDS and can not be updated. We focus here on the dynamism of the security policy monitored."
"Detection, Alert and Response to Malicious Behavior in Mobile Devices: Knowledge-Based Approach","In this research, we evaluate a knowledge-based approach for detecting instances of known classes of mobile devices malware based on their temporal behavior. The framework relies on lightweight agent that continuously monitors time-stamped security data within the mobile device and then processes the data using a light version of the Knowledge-Based Temporal Abstraction (KBTA) methodology. The new approach was applied for detecting malware on Google Android powered-devices. Evaluation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
Autonomic Intrusion Detection System,"We propose a novel framework of autonomic intrusion detection that fulfills online and adaptive intrusion detection in unlabeled audit data streams. The framework owns ability of self-managing: self-labeling, self-updating and self-adapting. Affinity Propagation (AP) uses the framework to learn a subject’s behavior through dynamical clustering of the streaming data. The testing results with a large real HTTP log stream demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method."
ALICE@home: Distributed Framework for Detecting Malicious Sites,"Malware silently infects millions of systems every year through drive-by downloads, i.e., client-side exploits against web browsers or browser helper objects that are triggered when unsuspecting users visit a page containing malicious content. Identifying and blacklisting websites that distribute malicious content or redirect to a distributing page is an important part of our defense strategy against such attacks. However, building such lists is fraught with challenges of scale, timeliness and deception due to evasive strategies employed by adversaries. In this work, we describe alice@home, a distributed approach to overcoming these challenges and actively identifying malware distribution sites."
Packet Space Analysis of Intrusion Detection Signatures,"It is often the case that more than one signature is triggered on a given group of packets, depending on the signature database used by the IDS. For performance reasons, network IDSs often impose an alert limit (i.e., they restrict) on the number of signatures that can be triggered on a given group of packets. Thus, it is possible that some signatures that should be triggered to properly identify attacks are not verified by the IDS and lead to an IDS Evasion attack. In this poster, we introduce the concept of packet space analysis as a solution to address these problems."
Traffic Behaviour Characterization Using NetMate,"Previous studies have shown the feasibility of deriving simple indicators of file transfers, human-interactivity, and other important behavioural characteristics. We are proposing a practical implementation and use of such indicators with NetMate. In its current state as a work in progress, our extended version of NetMate will already be of interest to network security practitioners conducting incident analysis. The tool can be used to post-process traffic traces containing suspicious flows in order to obtain a behavioural description of the incident and surrounding traffic activities. With further development, the approach has great potential for other use cases such as intrusion detection, insider threat detection, and traffic classification."
On the Inefficient Use of Entropy for Anomaly Detection,"Entropy-based measures have been widely deployed in anomaly detection systems (ADSes) to quantify behavioral patterns. The entropy measure has shown significant promise in detecting diverse set of anomalies present in networks and end-hosts. We argue that the full potential of entropy-based anomaly detection is currently not being exploited because of its inefficient use. In support of this argument, we highlight three important shortcomings of existing entropy-based ADSes. We then propose efficient entropy usage – supported by preliminary evaluations – to mitigate these shortcomings."
Browser-Based Intrusion Prevention System,"This work proposes a novel intrusion prevention technique that leverages information located in the browser in order to mitigate client-side web attacks such as login cross-site request forgery, session hijacking, etc. The browser intrusion prevention system enforces a new fine-grained policy, which complements the same-origin policy, that restricts interaction between authenticated and unauthenticated regions of a page or its associated stored data objects. The browser intrusion prevention system monitors page interactions that occur through script processing or URL fetches. The outcome of this technique is a system that can prevent attacks that are perpetuated by exploiting a user’s browser into making malicious request."
Using Formal Grammar and Genetic Operators to Evolve Malware,"In this paper, we leverage the concepts of formal grammar and genetic operators to evolve malware. As a case study, we take COM infectors and design their formal grammar with production rules in the BNF form. The chromosome (abstract representation) of an infector consists of genes (production rules). The code generator uses these production rules to derive the source code. The standard genetic operators – crossover and mutation – are applied to evolve population. The results of our experiments show that the evolved population contains a significant proportion of valid COM infectors. Moreover, approximately 7% of the evolved malware evade detection by COTS anti-virus software."
Method for Detecting Unknown Malicious Executables,"We present a method for detecting new malicious executables, which comprises the steps of: (a) in a training phase, finding a collection of system call sequences that are characteristic only to malicious files, and storing said sequences in a database; (b) in a runtime phase, for each running executable, continuously monitoring its issued run-time system calls and comparing with the stored sequences within the database, and when a match is found, declaring said executable as malicious."
Brave New World: Pervasive Insecurity of Embedded Network Devices,"Embedded network devices have become an ubiquitous fixture in the modern home, office as well as in the global communication infrastructure. Devices like routers, NAS appliances, home entertainment appliances, wifi access points, web cams, VoIP appliances, print servers and video conferencing units reside on the same networks as our personal computers and enterprise servers and together form our world-wide communication infrastructure. Widely deployed and often misconfigured, they constitute highly attractive targets for exploitation. In this study we present the results of a vulnerability assessment of embedded network devices within the world’s largest ISPs and civilian networks, spanning North America, Europe and Asia. The observed data confirms the intuition that these devices are indeed vulnerable to trivial attacks and that such devices can be found throughout the world in large numbers."
DAEDALUS: Novel Application of Large-Scale Darknet Monitoring for Practical Protection of Live Networks,"Large-scale darknet monitoring is an effective approach to grasp a global trend of malicious activities on the Internet, such as the world-wide spread of malwares. There, however, have been a gap between the darknet monitoring and actual security operations on live networks, namely the global trend has less direct contribution to protect the live networks. Therefore, we propose a novel application of large-scale darknet monitoring that significantly contributes to the security of live networks. In contrast to the conventional method, wherein the packets received from the outside are observed, we employ a large-scale distributed darknet that consists of several organizations that mutually observe the malicious packets transmitted from the inside of the organizations. Based on this approach, we have developed an alert system called DAEDALUS (direct alert environment for darknet and livenet unified security). We present the primary experimental results obtained from the actual deployment of DAEDALUS."
