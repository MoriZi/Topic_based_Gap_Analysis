A Network Access Control Mechanism Based on Behavior Profiles - IEEE Conference Publication,"Current network access control (NAC) technologies manage the access of new devices into a network to prevent rogue devices from attacking network hosts or services. Typically, new devices are checked against a set of manually defined policies (rules) before being granted access by the NAC enforcer. The main difficulty with this approach lies in the generation and update of new policies manually as time elapses and all devices have to reestablish their access rights. The BB-NAC mechanism was the first to introduce a novel behavior-based network access control architecture based on behavior profiles and not rules, where behavior-based access control policies were automatically generated. As originally presented, BB-NAC relied on manually pre-determined clusters of behavior which required human intervention and prevented the fully automation of the mechanism. In this paper, we present an enhanced BB-NAC mechanism that fully automatizes the creation of clusters of behavior. The access control is enhanced with the incorporation of automatic behavior clustering, which improves the intrusion detection capabilities by allowing for a more fine-grained definition of normal behavior. Apart from the lack of automatic clustering, the original BB-NAC overlooked the evolution of the mechanism as new behavior profiles were computed over time. As part of our enhancements, we also present an incremental-learning algorithm that automatically updates the behavior-based access control policies. We show that the algorithm is resilient to compromised or fabricated profiles trying to manipulate the policies. We provide extensive experiments with real user profiles computed with their network flows processed from Cisco NetFlow logs captured at our host institution. Our results show that behavior-based access control policies enhance conventional NAC technologies. Specifically, we achieve true rejection rates of 95% for anomalous user profiles separated by one standard deviation from the normal user network behavior. In addition, we also show that the enhanced mechanism can differentiate between normal changes in the behavior profiles (concept drift) and attacks."
RoleVAT: Visual Assessment of Practical Need for Role Based Access Control - IEEE Conference Publication,"Role based access control (RBAC) is a powerful security administration concept that can simplify permission assignment management. Migration to and maintenance of RBAC requires role engineering, the identification of a set of roles that offer administrative benefit. However, establishing that RBAC is desirable in a given enterprise is lacking in current role engineering processes. To help identify the practical need for RBAC, we propose RoleVAT, a Role engineering tool for the Visual Assessment of user and permission Tendencies. User and permission clusters can be visually identified as potential user groups or roles. The benefit and impact of this visual analysis in enterprise environments is discussed and demonstrated through testing on real life as well as synthetic datasets. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of RoleVAT as well as interesting user and role tendencies in real enterprise environments."
How to Securely Break into RBAC: The BTG-RBAC Model - IEEE Conference Publication,"Access control models describe frameworks that dictate how subjects (e.g. users) access resources. In the role-based access control (RBAC) model access to resources is based on the role the user holds within the organization. RBAC is a rigid model where access control decisions have only two output options: grant or deny. break the glass (BTG) policies on the other hand are flexible and allow users to break or override the access controls in a controlled and justifiable manner. The main objective of this paper is to integrate BTG within the NIST/ANSI RBAC model in a transparent and secure way so that it can be adopted generically in any domain where unanticipated or emergency situations may occur. The new proposed model, called BTG-RBAC, provides a third decision option BTG, which grants authorized users permission to break the glass rather than be denied access. This can easily be implemented in any application without major changes to either the application code or the RBAC authorization infrastructure, apart from the decision engine. Finally, in order to validate the model, we discuss how the BTG-RBAC model is being introduced within a Portuguese healthcare institution where the legislation requires that genetic information must be accessed by a restricted group of healthcare professionals. These professionals, advised by the ethical committee, have required and asked for the implementation of the BTG concept in order to comply with the said legislation."
Computer-Related Risk Futures - IEEE Conference Publication,"This paper reflects on many risks in the development and use of computer-related systems. It considers past and future alternatives, suggests some remedial approaches, and offers a few broad conclusions. Various long-touted common-sense approaches that are holistic and proactive are more urgently needed now than ever before."
Evaluation of a DPA-Resistant Prototype Chip - IEEE Conference Publication,"The recently proposed masked logic style iMDPL seems to eradicate many of the latest points of criticism against masked logic styles in general. By means of a prototype chip containing different implementations we analyze the DPA resistance of iMDPL. Furthermore we compare the results with the logic styles' predecessor MDPL, which verifiably suffers from an effect called early propagation. We also investigate iMDPL regarding an advanced attack approach that claims to be able to almost completely remove the effect of masking in masked logic styles."
FPValidator: Validating Type Equivalence of Function Pointers on the Fly - IEEE Conference Publication,"Validating function pointers dynamically is very useful for intrusion detection since many runtime attacks exploit function pointer vulnerabilities. Most current solutions tackle this problem through checking whether function pointers target the addresses within the code segment or, more strictly, valid function entries. However, they cannot detect function entry attacks that manipulate function pointers to target valid function entries but invoke them maliciously. This paper proposes FPValidator, a new solution capable of dynamically validating the type equivalence between function pointers and target functions, which can detect all function entry attacks that violate type equivalence. An effective and efficient type matching approach based on labeled type signature is proposed to perform fast type equivalence checking. The validation code and necessary type information are inserted by a compilation-stage instrumentation mechanism, bringing no extra burden to developers. We integrate FPValidator into GCC and evaluation shows that its performance overhead is only about 2%."
Surgically Returning to Randomized lib(c) - IEEE Conference Publication,"To strengthen systems against code injection attacks, the write or execute only policy (W¿X) and address space layout randomization (ASLR) are typically used in combination. The former separates data and code, while the latter randomizes the layout of a process. In this paper we present a new attack to bypass W¿X and ASLR. The state-of-the-art attack against this combination of protections is based on brute-force, while ours is based on the leakage of sensitive information about the memory layout of the process. Using our attack an attacker can exploit the majority of programs vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflows surgically, i.e., in a single attempt. We have estimated that our attack is feasible on 95.6% and 61.8% executables (of medium size) for Intel x86 and x86-64 architectures, respectively. We also analyze the effectiveness of other existing protections at preventing our attack. We conclude that position independent executables (PIE) are essential to complement ASLR and to prevent our attack. However, PIE requires recompilation, it is often not adopted even when supported, and it is not available on all ASLR-capable operating systems. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new protection that is as effective as PIE, does not require recompilation, and introduces only a minimal overhead."
SecureMR: A Service Integrity Assurance Framework for MapReduce - IEEE Conference Publication,"MapReduce has become increasingly popular as a powerful parallel data processing model. To deploy MapReduce as a data processing service over open systems such as service oriented architecture, cloud computing, and volunteer computing, we must provide necessary security mechanisms to protect the integrity of MapReduce data processing services. In this paper, we present SecureMR, a practical service integrity assurance framework for MapReduce. SecureMR consists of five security components, which provide a set of practical security mechanisms that not only ensure MapReduce service integrity as well as to prevent replay and denial of service (DoS) attacks, but also preserve the simplicity, applicability and scalability of MapReduce. We have implemented a prototype of SecureMR based on Hadoop, an open source MapReduce implementation. Our analytical study and experimental results show that SecureMR can ensure data processing service integrity while imposing low performance overhead."
Justifying Integrity Using a Virtual Machine Verifier - IEEE Conference Publication,"Emerging distributed computing architectures, such as grid and cloud computing, depend on the high integrity execution of each system in the computation. While integrity measurement enables systems to generate proofs of their integrity to remote parties, we find that current integrity measurement approaches are insufficient to prove runtime integrity for systems in these architectures. Integrity measurement approaches that are flexible enough have an incomplete view of runtime integrity, possibly leading to false integrity claims, and approaches that provide comprehensive integrity do so only for computing environments that are too restrictive. In this paper, we propose an architecture for building comprehensive runtime integrity proofs for general purpose systems in distributed computing architectures. In this architecture, we strive for classical integrity, using an approximation of the Clark-Wilson integrity model as our target. Key to building such integrity proofs is a carefully crafted host system whose long-term integrity can be justified easily using current techniques and a new component, called a VM verifier, which comprehensively enforces our integrity target on VMs. We have built a prototype based on the Xen virtual machine system for SELinux VMs, and find that distributed compilation can be implemented, providing accurate proofs of our integrity target with less than 4% overhead."
Scalable Web Content Attestation - IEEE Conference Publication,"The Web is a primary means of information sharing for most organizations and people. Currently, a recipient of Web content knows nothing about the environment in which that information was generated other than the specific server from whence it came (and even that information can be unreliable). In this paper, we develop and evaluate the Spork system that uses the trusted platform module (TPM) to tie the Web server integrity state to the Web content delivered to browsers, thus allowing a client to verify that the origin of the content was functioning properly when the received content was generated and/or delivered. We discuss the design and implementation of the Spork service and its browser-side Firefox validation extension. In particular, we explore the challenges and solutions of scaling the delivery of mixed static and dynamic content using exceptionally slow TPM hardware. We perform an in-depth empirical analysis of the Spork system within Apache Web servers. This analysis shows Spork can deliver nearly 8,000 static or over 7,000 dynamic integrity-measured Web objects per-second. More broadly, we identify how TPM-based content Web services can scale with manageable overheads and deliver integrity-measured content with manageable overhead."
A Study of User-Friendly Hash Comparison Schemes - IEEE Conference Publication,"Several security protocols require a human to compare two hash values to ensure successful completion. When the hash values are represented as long sequences of numbers, humans may make a mistake or require significant time and patience to accurately compare the hash values. To improve usability during comparison, a number of researchers have proposed various hash representations that use words, sentences, or images rather than numbers. This is the first work to perform a comparative study of these hash comparison schemes to determine which scheme allows the fastest and most accurate comparison. To evaluate the schemes, we performed an online user study with more than 400 participants. Our findings indicate that only a small number of schemes allow quick and accurate comparison across a wide range of subjects from varying backgrounds."
Modeling Modern Network Attacks and Countermeasures Using Attack Graphs - IEEE Conference Publication,"By accurately measuring risk for enterprise networks, attack graphs allow network defenders to understand the most critical threats and select the most effective countermeasures. This paper describes substantial enhancements to the NetSPA attack graph system required to model additional present-day threats (zero-day exploits and client-side attacks) and countermeasures (intrusion prevention systems, proxy firewalls, personal firewalls, and host-based vulnerability scans). Point-to-point reachability algorithms and structures were extensively redesigned to support \""reverse\"" reachability computations and personal firewalls. Host-based vulnerability scans are imported and analyzed. Analysis of an operational network with 84 hosts demonstrates that client-side attacks pose a serious threat. Experiments on larger simulated networks demonstrated that NetSPA's previous excellent scaling is maintained. Less than two minutes are required to completely analyze a four-enclave simulated network with more than 40,000 hosts protected by personal firewalls."
Evaluating Network Security With Two-Layer Attack Graphs - IEEE Conference Publication,"Attack graphs play important roles in analyzing network security vulnerabilities, and previous works have provided meaningful conclusions on the generation and security measurement of attack graphs. However, it is still hard for us to understand attack graphs in a large network, and few suggestions have been proposed to prevent inside malicious attackers from attacking networks. To address these problems, we propose a novel approach to generate and describe attack graphs. Firstly, we construct a two-layer attack graph, where the upper layer is a hosts access graph and the lower layer is composed of some host-pair attack graphs. Compared with previous works, our attack graph has simpler structures, and reaches the best upper bound of computation cost in O(N2). Furthermore, we introduce the adjacency matrix to efficiently evaluate network security, with overall evaluation results presented by gray scale images vividly. Thirdly, by applying prospective damage and important weight factors on key hosts with crucial resources, we can create prioritized lists of potential threatening hosts and stepping stones, both of which can help network administrators to harden network security. Analysis on computation cost shows that the upper bound computation cost of our measurement methodology is O(N3), which could also be completed in real time. Finally, we give some examples to show how to put our methods in practice."
Unifying Broadcast Encryption and Traitor Tracing for Content Protection - IEEE Conference Publication,"In this paper we study the design of efficient trace-revoke schemes for content protection. In state-of-art, broadcast encryption and traitor tracing are viewed as two orthogonal problems. Good traceability and efficient revocation seem to demand different types of design. When combined into trace-revoke schemes, existing schemes only offer efficiency on one aspect but weak on the other. Moreover, there are two major styles of pirate attacks, namely the clone device attack and anonymous re-broadcasting attack. In current state-of-art, defending against these two attacks are viewed as two different problems that demand different trace-revoke schemes. In current state-of-practice, a content protection system has to deploy two trace-revoke schemes in order to provide complete protections against both attacks. As a result, the system incurs the complexity of having to manage two schemes, even worse the overall strength of the system is the weakest link in either scheme. In this paper we present a unified trace-revoke system that can offer superior efficiency on both traceability and revocation capability as well as simultaneously defend against two attacks in a unified way. Our unified system offers everything that the original two schemes combined can provide, but our system is much simpler and more efficient. The design of our unified framework carries both scientific and real world practical significance. We reduce the tracing time from tens of years to hours. The much improved simplicity and efficiency of our unified system caused it to be adopted by the new version of AACS, advanced access content system, the industry content protection standard for the new Blu-ray high-definition-video optical discs. Scientifically our design shows it is possible to design an efficient broadcast encryption scheme and traitor tracing scheme in a unified way. We also showed the equivalence of the two major types of attacks which are currently viewed as different attacks. This opens brand new directions for future research on broadcast encryption and traitor tracing."
Detecting Software Theft via System Call Based Birthmarks - IEEE Conference Publication,"Along with the burst of open source projects, software theft (or plagiarism) has become a very serious threat to the healthiness of software industry. Software birthmark, which represents the unique characteristic of a program, can be used for software theft detection. We propose two system call based software birthmarks: SCSSB (system call short sequence birthmark) and IDSCSB (input dependant system call subsequence birthmark), and examine how well they reflect unique behavioral characteristics of a program. To our knowledge, our detection system based on SCSSB and IDSCSB is the first one that is capable of software component theft detection where only partial code is stolen. We demonstrate the strength of our birthmarks against various evasion techniques, including those based on different compilers and different compiler optimization levels as well as those based on very powerful obfuscation techniques supported by SandMark. Unlike the existing work that were evaluated through small or toy software, we also evaluate our birthmarks on a set of large software (Web browsers). Our results show that system call based birthmarks are very practical and effective in detecting software theft that even adopts advanced evasion techniques."
Reflections on UNIX Vulnerabilities - IEEE Conference Publication,"The UNIX operating system was developed in a friendly, collaborative environment without any particular predefined objectives. As it entered less friendly environments, expanded its functionality, and became the basis for commercial, infrastructure, and home systems, vulnerabilities in the system affected its robustness and security. This paper presents a brief history of UNIX vulnerabilities, beginning with a report written in 1981-1983, but never published. It examines how the nature of vulnerabilities has (and has not) changed since then, and presents some thoughts on the future of vulnerabilities in the UNIX operating system and its variants and other UNIX-like systems."
"The Good, the Bad, And the Ugly: Stepping on the Security Scale - IEEE Conference Publication","Metrics are both fashionable and timely: many regulations that affect cybersecurity rely upon metrics - albeit, of the checklist variety in many cases - to ascertain compliance. However, there are far more effective uses of security metrics than external compliance exercises. The most effective use of security metrics is to manage better, which may include: 1. Make a business case for needed change; 2. Focus scarce resource on most pressing problems (with the biggest payoff for resolution); 3. Help spot problems early - or successes early; and 4. Address ¿outside¿ concerns or criticisms fairly and objectively. A successful security metric should: 1. Motivate good/correct behavior (not promote evasive tactics just to make the numbers look good); 2. Prompt additional questions (?Why? How??) to understand what is influencing the numbers; 3. Answer basic questions of goodness (e.g., ¿Are we doing better or worse?¿); and 4. Be objective and measurable, even if correlation may not equal causality. This paper explores the qualities of good security metrics and their application in security vulnerability handling as well as a software assurance program."
A New Approach for Anonymous Password Authentication - IEEE Conference Publication,"Anonymous password authentication reinforces password authentication with the protection of user privacy. Considering the increasing concern of individual privacy nowadays, anonymous password authentication represents a promising privacy-preserving authentication primitive. However, anonymous password authentication in the standard setting has several inherent weaknesses, making its practicality questionable. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient approach for anonymous password authentication. Our approach assumes a different setting where users do not register their passwords to the server; rather, they use passwords to protect their authentication credentials. We present a concrete scheme, and get over a number of challenges in securing password-protected credentials against off-line guessing attacks. Our experimental results confirm that conventional anonymous password authentication does not scale well, while our new scheme demonstrates very good performance."
On the Security of PAS (Predicate-Based Authentication Service) - IEEE Conference Publication,"Recently a new human authentication scheme called PAS (predicate-based authentication service) was proposed, which does not require the assistance of any supplementary device. The main security claim of PAS is to resist passive adversaries who can observe the whole authentication session between the human user and the remote server. In this paper we show that PAS is insecure against both brute force attack and a probabilistic attack. In particular, we show that its security against brute force attack was strongly overestimated. Furthermore, we introduce a probabilistic attack, which can break part of the password even with a very small number of observed authentication sessions. Although the proposed attack cannot completely break the password, it can downgrade the PAS system to a much weaker system similar to common OTP (one-time password) systems."
BAF: An Efficient Publicly Verifiable Secure Audit Logging Scheme for Distributed Systems - IEEE Conference Publication,"Audit logs, providing information about the current and past states of systems, are one of the most important parts of modern computer systems. Providing security for audit logs on an untrusted machine in a large distributed system is a challenging task, especially in the presence of active adversaries. In such a system, it is critical to have forward security such that when an adversary compromises a machine, she cannot modify or forge the log entries accumulated before the compromise. Unfortunately, existing secure audit logging schemes have significant limitations that make them impractical for real-life applications: existing public key cryptography (PKC) based schemes are computationally expensive for logging in task intensive or resource-constrained systems, while existing symmetric schemes are not publicly verifiable and incur significant storage and communication overheads. In this paper, we propose a novel forward secure and aggregate logging scheme called blind-aggregate-forward (BAF) logging scheme, which is suitable for large distributed systems. BAF can produce publicly verifiable forward secure and aggregate signatures with near-zero computational, storage, and communication costs for the loggers, without requiring any online trusted third party (TTP) support. We prove that BAF is secure under appropriate computational assumptions, and demonstrate that BAF is significantly more efficient and scalable than the previous schemes. Therefore, BAF is an ideal solution for secure logging in both task intensive and resource-constrained systems."
FIRE: FInding Rogue nEtworks - IEEE Conference Publication,"For many years, online criminals have been able to conduct their illicit activities by masquerading behind disreputable Internet service providers (ISPs). For example, organizations such as the Russian business network (RBN), Atrivo (a.k.a., Intercage), McColo, and most recently, the triple fiber network (3FN) operated with impunity, providing a safe haven for Internet criminals for their own financial gain. What primarily sets these ISPs apart from others is the significant longevity of the malicious activities on their networks and the apparent lack of action taken in response to abuse reports. Interestingly, even though the Internet provides a certain degree of anonymity, such ISPs fear public attention. Once exposed, rogue networks often cease their malicious activities quickly, or are de-peered (disconnected) by their upstream providers. As a result, the Internet criminals are forced to relocate their operations. In this paper, we present FIRE, a novel system to identify and expose organizations and ISPs that demonstrate persistent, malicious behavior. The goal is to isolate the networks that are consistently implicated in malicious activity from those that are victims of compromise. To this end, FIRE actively monitors Botnet communication channels, drive-by-download servers, and phishing Web sites. This data is refined and correlated to quantify the degree of malicious activity for individual organizations. We present our results in real-time via the Web site maliciousnetworks.org. These results can be used to pinpoint and to track the activity of rogue organizations, preventing criminals from establishing strongholds on the Internet. Also, the information can be compiled into a null-routing blacklist to immediately halt traffic from malicious networks."
Active Botnet Probing to Identify Obscure Command and Control Channels - IEEE Conference Publication,"We consider the problem of identifying obscure chat-like botnet command and control (C & C) communications, which are indistinguishable from human-human communication using traditional signature-based techniques. Existing passive-behavior-based anomaly detection techniques are limited because they either require monitoring multiple bot-infected machines that belong to the same botnet or require extended monitoring times. In this paper, we explore the potential use of active botnet probing techniques in a network middle-box as a means to augment and complement existing passive botnet C & C detection strategies, especially for small botnets with obfuscated C & C content and infrequent C & C interactions. We present an algorithmic framework that uses hypothesis testing to separate botnet C & C dialogs from human-human conversations with desired accuracy and implement a prototype system called BotProbe. Experimental results on multiple real-world IRC bots demonstrate that our proposed active methods can successfully identify obscure and obfuscated botnet communications. A real-world user study on about one hundred participants also shows that the technique has a low false positive rate on human-human conversations. We discuss the limitations of BotProbe and hope this preliminary feasibility study on the use of active techniques in botnet research can inspire new thoughts and directions within the malware research community."
TrustGraph: Trusted Graphics Subsystem for High Assurance Systems - IEEE Conference Publication,"High assurance MILS and MLS systems require strict limitation of the interactions between different security compartments based on a security policy. Virtualization can be used to provide a high degree of separation in such systems. Even with perfect isolation, however, the I/O devices are shared between different security compartments. Among the I/O controllers, the graphics subsystem is the largest and the most complex. This paper describes the design and implementation of TrustGraph, a trusted graphics subsystem for high assurance systems. First, we explain the threats and attacks possible against an unsecured graphics subsystem. We then describe the design of TrustGraph, the security principles it is built upon, and its implementation. Finally, we verify our implementation through different levels of verification which include functionality testing for simple operations, attack testing for security mechanisms, and formal verification for the critical components of the implementation. An analysis of the graphics API covert channel attack is presented, its channel capacity is measured, and the capacity is reduced using the idea of fuzzy time."
RAD: Reflector Attack Defense Using Message Authentication Codes - IEEE Conference Publication,"Reflector attacks are a variant of denial-of-service attacks that use unwitting, legitimate servers to flood a target. The attacker spoofs the target's address in legitimate service requests, such as TCP SYN packets. The servers, called \""reflectors,'' reply to these requests, flooding the target. RAD is a novel defense against reflector attacks. It has two variants -- locally-deployed (L-RAD) and core-deployed (C-RAD). Local RAD uses message authentication codes (MACs) to mark outgoing requests at their source, so the target of a reflector attack can differentiate between replies to legitimate and spoofed requests. MACs can be validated either at the target machine or on a gateway router at the target's network. Core RAD, which is deployed at the AS level, handles larger attacks that overwhelm L-RAD. The source AS marks each packet it sends with a hash message authentication code (HMAC) and core ASes filter packets that carry incorrect HMACs. C-RAD prevents reflector attacks by filtering spoofed requests, rather than filtering reflected replies. We tested both variants using the DETER testbed by replaying backbone traces from the MAWI project archive in a congestion-responsive manner. Our tests show that local RAD is better than the no-defense case, but gets overwhelmed when the attack exceeds the target's network capacity. Core-deployed RAD successfully handles attacks of all rates."
A Guided Tour Puzzle for Denial of Service Prevention - IEEE Conference Publication,"Various cryptographic puzzle schemes are proposed as a defense mechanism against denial of service attack. But, all these puzzle schemes face a dilemma when there is a large disparity between the computational power of attackers and legitimate clients: increasing the difficulty of puzzles might unnecessarily restrict legitimate clients too much, and lower difficulty puzzles cannot sufficiently block attackers with large computational resources. In this paper, we introduce guided tour puzzle, a novel puzzle scheme that is not affected by such resource disparity. A guided tour puzzle requires a client to visit a predefined set of nodes, called tour guides, in a certain sequential order to retrieve an n piece answer, one piece from each tour guide that appears in the tour. This puzzle solving process is non-parallelizable, thus cheating by trying to solve the puzzle in parallel is not possible. Guided tour puzzle not only achieves all previously defined desired properties of a cryptographic puzzle scheme, but it also satisfies more important requirements, such as puzzle fairness and minimum interference, that we identified. The number of tour guides required by the scheme can be as few as two, and this extra cost can be amortized by sharing the same set of tour guides among multiple servers."
Online Signature Generation for Windows Systems - IEEE Conference Publication,"In this paper, we present a new, light-weight approach for generating filters for blocking buffer overflow attacks on Microsoft Windows systems. It is designed to be deployable as an \""always on'' component on production systems. To achieve this goal, it avoids expensive and intrusive techniques such as taint-tracking. The online nature of our system enables it to provide protection from a range of memory corruption exploits, including those involving unknown vulnerabilities, or known vulnerabilities but unknown exploits. In contrast, most previous signature generation techniques need to be run in sandboxed environments, and need working exploits to generate signatures. Moreover, our technique overcomes the \""gap'' problem faced by previous signature generation mechanisms, i.e., when the vulnerable memory region is corrupted between the overflow and the time an attack is detected. Another novel feature of our approach is that it is able to reason about likely lengths of vulnerable buffers, which can lead to more accurate signatures. Our experimental results are very promising, and demonstrate that the approach can generate effective signatures for many synthetic and real-world vulnerabilities."
Protecting Commodity Operating System Kernels from Vulnerable Device Drivers - IEEE Conference Publication,"Device drivers on commodity operating systems execute with kernel privilege and have unfettered access to kernel data structures. Several recent attacks demonstrate that such poor isolation exposes kernel data to exploits against vulnerable device drivers, for example through buffer overruns in packet processing code. Prior architectures to isolate kernel data from driver code either sacrifice performance, execute too much driver code with kernel privilege, or are incompatible with commodity operating systems. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of a novel security architecture that better isolates kernel data from device drivers without sacrificing performance or compatibility. In this architecture, a device driver is partitioned into a small, trusted kernel-mode component and an untrusted user-mode component. The kernel-mode component contains privileged and performance-critical code. It communicates via RPC with the user-mode component which contains the rest of the driver code. A RPC monitor mediates all control and data transfers between the kernel- and user-mode components. In particular, it verifies that all data transfers from the untrusted user-mode component to the kernel-mode component preserve kernel data structure integrity. We also present a runtime technique to automatically infer such integrity specifications. Our experiments with a Linux implementation of this architecture show that it can prevent compromised device drivers from affecting the integrity of kernel data and do so without impacting common-case performance."
Detecting Malicious Flux Service Networks through Passive Analysis of Recursive DNS Traces - IEEE Conference Publication,"In this paper we propose a novel, passive approach for detecting and tracking malicious flux service networks. Our detection system is based on passive analysis of recursive DNS (RDNS) traffic traces collected from multiple large networks. Contrary to previous work, our approach is not limited to the analysis of suspicious domain names extracted from spam emails or precompiled domain blacklists. Instead, our approach is able to detect malicious flux service networks in-the-wild, i.e., as they are accessed by users who fall victims of malicious content advertised through blog spam, instant messaging spam, social Website spam, etc., beside email spam. We experiment with the RDNS traffic passively collected at two large ISP networks. Overall, our sensors monitored more than 2.5 billion DNS queries per day from millions of distinct source IPs for a period of 45 days. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to accurately detect malicious flux service networks. Furthermore, we show how our passive detection and tracking of malicious flux service networks may benefit spam filtering applications."
Identification of Bot Commands by Run-Time Execution Monitoring - IEEE Conference Publication,"Botnets pose serious threats to the Internet. In spite of substantial efforts to address the issue, botnets are dramatically spreading. Bots in a botnet execute commands under the control of the botnet owner or controller. A first step in protecting against botnets is identification of their presence, and activities. In this paper, we propose a method of identifying the high-level commands executed by bots. The method uses run- time monitoring of bot execution to capture and analyze run- time call behavior. We find that bots have distinct behavior patterns when they perform pre-programmed bot commands. The patterns are characterized by sequences of common API calls at regular intervals. We demonstrate that commands aiming to achieve the same result have very similar API call behavior in bot variants, even when they are from different bot families. We implemented and evaluated a prototype of our method. Run-time monitoring is accomplished by user-level hooking. In the experiments, the proposed method successfully identified the bot commands being executed with a success rate of 97%. The ability of the method to identify bot commands despite the use of execution obfuscation is also addressed."
Transparent Encryption for External Storage Media with Key Management Adapted to Mobile Use - IEEE Conference Publication,"External storage devices, such as USB-sticks, SD-cards, or other flash memory devices, are widely used today. These devices may pose a threat if they contain sensitive data and are then lost or forgotten somewhere. Usability of existing encryption solutions for such external storage media is limited because of the need to reenter keys or authentication credentials every time the media is plugged to a different device. We present a solution to the usability problem by caching the key with time delayed deletion. We implemented two variations of this concept. One solution does not require any explicit user interaction, thus limiting the use of the external storage device to short term data transfer, only. The second solution allows multiple encryption keys for different files of the file system to be managed on a trusted host, using the timed key caching to avoid handing out keys or passwords."
Semantically Rich Application-Centric Security in Android - IEEE Conference Publication,"Smartphones are now ubiquitous. However, the security requirements of these relatively new systems and the applications they support are still being understood. As a result, the security infrastructure available in current smartphone operating systems is largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we consider the security requirements of smartphone applications and augment the existing Android operating system with a framework to meet them. We present Secure Application INTeraction (Saint), a modified infrastructure that governs install-time permission assignment and their run-time use as dictated by application provider policy. An in-depth description of the semantics of application policy is presented. The architecture and technical detail of Saint is given, and areas for extension, optimization, and improvement explored. As we show through concrete example, Saint provides necessary utility for applications to assert and control the security decisions on the platform."
Leveraging Cellular Infrastructure to Improve Fraud Prevention - IEEE Conference Publication,"The relationship between physical security and critical infrastructure has traditionally been unidirectional - the former being necessary to sustain the latter. However, certain pieces of critical infrastructure hold the potential to significantly improve the security of individuals and their most sensitive information. In this paper, we develop a pair of mechanisms for cellular networks and mobile devices that augment the physical security of their users' financial credentials. In particular, we create FrauVent, a multi-modal protocol that provides users with information related to a pending questionable transaction (e.g., transaction value, location, vendor) in a way that improves the available context for approving or rejecting such exchanges. Through protocol design, formal verification and implementation of an application for the Android platform, we develop a robust tool to help reduce the costs of fraud without requiring financial institutions to significantly change their extensively deployed end systems (i.e., card readers). More critically, we provide a general framework that allows cellular infrastructure to actively improve the physical security of sensitive information."
Analyzing and Detecting Malicious Flash Advertisements - IEEE Conference Publication,"The amount of dynamic content on the Web has been steadily increasing. Scripting languages such as JavaScript and browser extensions such as Adobe's Flash have been instrumental in creating Web-based interfaces that are similar to those of traditional applications. Dynamic content has also become popular in advertising, where Flash is used to create rich, interactive ads that are displayed on hundreds of millions of computers per day. Unfortunately, the success of Flash-based advertisements and applications attracted the attention of malware authors, who started to leverage Flash to deliver attacks through advertising networks. This paper presents a novel approach whose goal is to automate the analysis of Flash content to identify malicious behavior. We designed and implemented a tool based on the approach, and we tested it on a large corpus of real-world Flash advertisements. The results show that our tool is able to reliably detect malicious Flash ads with limited false positives. We made our tool available publicly and it is routinely used by thousands of users."
Symmetric Cryptography in Javascript - IEEE Conference Publication,"We take a systematic approach to developing a symmetric cryptography library in Javascript. We study various strategies for optimizing the code for the Javascript interpreter, and observe that traditional crypto optimization techniques do not apply when implemented in Javascript. We propose a number of optimizations that reduce both running time and code size. Our optimized library is about four times faster and 12% smaller than the fastest and smallest existing symmetric Javascript encryption libraries. On Internet Explorer 8, our library is about 11 times faster than the fastest previously existing code. In addition, we show that certain symmetric systems that are faster than AES when implemented in native x86 code, are in fact much slower than AES when implemented in Javascript. As a result, the choice of ciphers for a Javascript crypto library may be substantially different from the choice of ciphers when implementing crypto natively. Finally, we study the problem of generating strong randomness in Javascript and give extensive measurements validating our techniques."
Analyzing Information Flow in JavaScript-Based Browser Extensions - IEEE Conference Publication,"JavaScript-based browser extensions (JSEs) enhance the core functionality of Web browsers by improving their look and feel, and are widely available for commodity browsers. To enable a rich set of functionalities, browsers typically execute JSEs with elevated privileges. For example, unlike JavaScript code in a Web application, code in a JSE is not constrained by the same-origin policy. Malicious JSEs can misuse these privileges to compromise confidentiality and integrity, e.g., by stealing sensitive information, such as cookies and saved passwords, or executing arbitrary code on the host system. Even if a JSE is not overtly malicious, vulnerabilities in the JSE and the browser may allow a remote attacker to compromise browser security. We present Sabre (Security Architecture for Browser Extensions), a system that uses in-browser information-flow tracking to analyze JSEs. Sabre associates a label with each in-memory JavaScript object in the browser, which determines whether the object contains sensitive information. Sabre propagates labels as objects are modified by the JSE and passed between browser subsystems. Sabre raises an alert if an object containing sensitive information is accessed in an unsafe way, e.g., if a JSE attempts to send the object over the network or write it to a file. We implemented Sabre by modifying the Firefox browser and evaluated it using both malicious JSEs as well as benign ones that contained exploitable vulnerabilities. Our experiments show that Sabre can precisely identify potential information flow violations by JSEs."
Java Security: A Ten Year Retrospective - IEEE Conference Publication,"The first edition of Java (both the language and the platform) was released in 1995, which contained the all-or-nothing security access model. A mid-1997 paper I published in IEEE Micro laid out a vision for the future of Java security, which notably included a model for fine-grained access control, a crypto architecture, and a number of other security mechanisms. The first implementation of these features was officially released in late 1998 as part of the JDK 1.2 platform. Ten years on, the original vision of Java security was largely realized and the overall architecture had in fact been carried over to both the enterprise Java and mobile Java platforms. This paper reflects on lessons - technical and otherwise - learned in the process of designing and implementing the Java security architecture and in the aftermath of its release into the real world."
Secure Web 2.0 Content Sharing Beyond Walled Gardens - IEEE Conference Publication,"Web 2.0 users need usable mechanisms for sharing their content with each other in a controlled manner across boundaries of content-hosting or application-service providers (CSPs). In this paper, we describe the architecture, design, and implementation of a proposed system for Web 2.0 content sharing across CSPs. With our approach, users use their existing email account to login to CSPs, and content owners use their email-based contact-lists to specify access policies. Users are assumed to be equipped only with a Web browser and CSPs do not need to change their existing access-control mechanisms. In addition, policy statements are URI-addressable, and the same access policies can be reused and enforced across CSPs."
Enabling Secure Secret Sharing in Distributed Online Social Networks - IEEE Conference Publication,"We study a new application of threshold-based secret sharing in a distributed online social network (DOSN), where users need a means to back up and recover their private keys in a network of untrusted servers. Using a simple threshold-based secret sharing in such an environment is insufficiently secured since delegates keeping the secret shares may collude to steal the user's private keys. To mitigate this problem, we propose using different techniques to improve the system security: by selecting only the most reliable delegates for keeping these shares and further by encrypting the shares with passwords. We develop a mechanism to select the most reliable delegates based on an effective trust measure. Specifically, relationships among the secret owner, delegate candidates and their related friends are used to estimate the trustworthiness of a delegate. This trust measure minimizes the likelihood of the secret being stolen by an adversary and is shown to be effective against various collusive attacks. Extensive simulations show that the proposed trust-based delegate selection performs very well in highly vulnerable environments where the adversary controls many nodes with different distributions and even with spreading of infections in the network. In fact, the number of keys lost is very low under extremely pessimistic assumptions of the adversary model."
Deploying and Monitoring DNS Security (DNSSEC) - IEEE Conference Publication,"SecSpider is a DNSSEC monitoring system that helps identify operational errors in the DNSSEC deployment and discover unforeseen obstacles. It collects, verifies, and publishes the DNSSEC keys for DNSSEC-enabled zones, which enables operators of both authoritative zones and recursive resolvers to deploy DNSSEC immediately, and benefit from its cryptographic protections. In this paper we present the design and implementation of SecSpider as well as several general lessons that stem from its design and implementation."
MAVMM: Lightweight and Purpose Built VMM for Malware Analysis - IEEE Conference Publication,"Malicious software is rampant on the Internet and costs billions of dollars each year. Safe and thorough analysis of malware is key to protecting vulnerable systems and cleaning those that have already been infected. Most current state-of-the-art analysis platforms run alongside the malware, increasing their detectability. This reduces the value of analysis because some malware is known to behave differently when being analyzed. Virtualization offers a compelling platform for malware analysis, with strong isolation and the ability to save and restore guest state. Current virtual machine monitors (VMMs), however, are not designed for malware analysis. Due to their complexity, they often fail to provide transparency and even expose vulnerabilities which could be exploited by the malware running inside guest system. We propose a lightweight VMM (namely MAVMM) that is designed specially for a single job: malware analysis. MAVMM does not implement unnecessary virtualization features commonly found in general purpose hypervisors, including virtual device emulation. We take advantage of hardware virtualization support to make MAVMM more simple, secure and transparent. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of MAVMM, and the features that we can extract from programs running inside the guest OS. We evaluate our platform in three aspects: functionality, detectability and performance. We show that our system can extract useful information from malicious software, and that it is not susceptible to known virtualization detection techniques."
Protecting Kernel Code and Data with a Virtualization-Aware Collaborative Operating System - IEEE Conference Publication,"The traditional virtual machine usage model advocates placing security mechanisms in a trusted VM layer and letting the untrusted guest OS run unaware of the presence of virtualization. In this work we challenge this traditional model and propose a collaboration approach between a virtualization-aware operating system and a VM layer to prevent tampering against kernel code and data. Our integrity model is a relaxed version of Biba's and the main idea is to have all attempted writes into kernel code and data segments checked for validity at VM level. The OS-VM collaboration bridges the semantic gap between tracing low integrity objects at OS-level (files, processes, modules, allocated areas) and architecture-level (memory and registers). We have implemented this approach in a proof-of-concept prototype and have successfully tested it against 6 rootkits (including a non-control data attack) and 4 real-world benign LKM/drivers. All rootkits were prevented from corrupting kernel space and no false positive was triggered for benign modules. Performance measurements show that the average overhead to the VM for the OS-VM communication is low (7%, CPU benchmarks). The greatest overhead is caused by the memory monitoring module inside the VM: 1.38X alone and 1.46X when combined with the OS-VM communication. For OS microbenchmarks the slowdown for the OS-VM communication was 1.16X on average."
HIMA: A Hypervisor-Based Integrity Measurement Agent - IEEE Conference Publication,"Integrity measurement is a key issue in building trust in distributed systems. A good solution to integrity measurement has to provide both strong isolation between the measurement agent and the measurement target and time of check to time of use (TOCTTOU) consistency (i.e., the consistency between measured version and executed version throughout the lifetime of the target). Unfortunately, none of the previous approaches provide (or can be easily modified to provide) both capabilities. This paper presents HIMA, a hypervisor-based agent that measures the integrity of virtual machines (VMs) running on top of the hypervisor, which provides both capabilities identified above. HIMA performs two complementary tasks: (1) active monitoring of critical guest events and (2) guest memory protection. The former guarantees that the integrity measures are refreshed whenever the guest VM memory layout changes (e.g., upon creation of processes), while the latter ensures that integrity measurement of user programs cannot be bypassed without HIMA's knowledge. This paper also reports the experimental evaluation of a HIMA prototype using both micro-benchmark and application benchmark; the experimental results indicate that HIMA is a practical solution for real world applications."
Online Sketching of Network Flows for Real-Time Stepping-Stone Detection - IEEE Conference Publication,"We present an efficient and robust stepping-stone detection scheme based on succinct packet-timing sketches of network flows. The proposed scheme employs an online algorithm to continuously maintain short sketches of flows from a stream of captured packets at the network boundary. These sketches are then used to identify pairs of network flows with similar packet-timing characteristics, which indicates potential stepping-stones. Succinct flow sketches enable the proposed scheme to compare a given pair of flows in constant time. In addition, flow sketches identify pairs of correlated flows from a given list of flows in sub-quadratic time, thereby allowing a more scalable solution as compared to known schemes. Finally, the proposed scheme is resistant to random delays and chaff, which are often employed by attackers to evade detection. To explore its efficacy, we mathematically analyze the robustness properties of the proposed flow sketch. We also experimentally measure the detection performance of the proposed scheme."
SHELF: Preserving Business Continuity and Availability in an Intrusion Recovery System - IEEE Conference Publication,"Recovering from intrusions for a compromised computer system is a challenging job, especially for systems that run continuous services. Current intrusion recovery techniques often do not preserve the accumulated useful state of running applications and have very limited system availability when performing recovery routines. In this paper, we propose SHELF, an on-the-fly intrusion recovery prototype system that provides a comprehensive solution to preserve business continuity, availability and recovery accuracy. SHELF preserves accumulated clean states for infected applications and files so that they can continue with the most recent pre-infection states after recovery. Moreover, SHELF leverages OS-aware taint tracking techniques to swiftly determine the sources of intrusion and assess system-wide damages caused by the intrusion. SHELF uses quarantine methods to prevent infection propagation so that uninfected and recovered objects can provide availability during the recovery phase. We integrate SHELF prototype in a virtualization environment to achieve user transparency and protection. Our evaluation shows that SHELF can perform accurate recovery on-the-fly effectively with an acceptable performance overhead."
An Empirical Approach to Modeling Uncertainty in Intrusion Analysis - IEEE Conference Publication,"Uncertainty is an innate feature of intrusion analysis due to the limited views provided by system monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various types of logs. Attackers are essentially invisible in cyber space and monitoring tools can only observe the symptoms or effects of malicious activities. When mingled with similar effects from normal or non-malicious activities they lead intrusion analysis to conclusions of varying confidence and high false positive/negative rates. This paper presents an empirical approach to the problem of uncertainty where the inferred security implications of low-level observations are captured in a simple logical language augmented with certainty tags. We have designed an automated reasoning process that enables us to combine multiple sources of system monitoring data and extract highly-confident attack traces from the numerous possible interpretations of low-level observations. We have developed our model empirically: the starting point was a true intrusion that happened on a campus network that we studied to capture the essence of the human reasoning process that led to conclusions about the attack. We then used a Datalog-like language to encode the model and a Prolog system to carry out the reasoning process. Our model and reasoning system reached the same conclusions as the human administrator on the question of which machines were certainly compromised. We then automatically generated the reasoning model needed for handling Snort alerts from the natural-language descriptions in the Snort rule repository, and developed a Snort add-on to analyze Snort alerts. Keeping the reasoning model unchanged, we applied our reasoning system to two third-party data sets and one production network. Our results showed that the reasoning model is effective on these data sets as well. We believe such an empirical approach has the potential of codifying the seemingly ad-hoc human reasoning of uncertain events, and can yield useful tools for automated intrusion analysis."
The Design of a Trustworthy Voting System - IEEE Conference Publication,"After the voting debacle in the Florida Presidential election of 2000 with its now-fabled hanging chads and pregnant chads, many voting jurisdictions turned to electronic voting machines. This transition has had at least as many problems as punch-card systems and added the additional one of making recounts impossible. As a result, many jurisdictions have gone back to paper ballots in despair. We believe that electronic voting can have many benefits including accessibility and usability but requires regarding voting as a system of which the voting machine is only a (small) part. In this paper we describe all the components of an electronic voting system that is practical and difficult to tamper with. We emphasize the importance of systems aspects, defense in depth, and being paranoiac."
Privacy through Noise: A Design Space for Private Identification - IEEE Conference Publication,"To protect privacy in large systems, users should be able to authenticate against a central server without disclosing their identity to others. Private identification protocols based on public key cryptography are computationally expensive and cannot be implemented on small devices like RFID tags. Symmetric key protocols, on the other hand, provide only modest levels of privacy, but can be efficiently executed on servers and cheaply implemented on devices. The privacy of symmetric-key privacy protocols derives from the fact that an attacker only ever knows a small fraction of the keys in a system while the legitimate reader knows all keys. We propose to amplify this gap in the ability to distinguish users by adding noise to user responses. We focus on scenarios where an attacker is not able to acquire multiple different reads known to be from the same device, and justify this threat model by proposing a simple modification to RFID tag designs. In such scenarios, we can use noise to blur the borders between groups of users that the attacker would otherwise be able to distinguish. We evaluate the effectiveness and cost of this randomization and find that the information leakage from the tree protocol can be decreased to two thousandths of its original value with 150 times the number of server-side cryptographic operations and minimal cost to the tag. Degrees of privacy up to those achieved by public key protocols can be reached while staying well below the cost of public key cryptography."
A Survey of Vendor Software Assurance Practices - IEEE Conference Publication,"Books and articles frequently exhort developers to build secure software by designing security in. A few large companies (most notably Microsoft) have completely reengineered their development process to include a focus on security. However, for all except the largest vendors, software security (or software assurance) is a relatively recent phenomenon, and one with an uncertain payoff. In this paper, we examine what real vendors do to ensure that their products are reasonably secure. Our conclusion is that software vendors put significant energy into software security, but there is significant variation in where they invest their money."
