CastSan: Efficient Detection of Polymorphic C++ Object Type Confusions with LLVM,"C++ object type confusion vulnerabilities as the result of illegal object casting have been threatening systems’ security for decades. While there exist several solutions to address this type of vulnerability, none of them are sufficiently practical for adoption in production scenarios. Most competitive and recent solutions require object type tracking for checking polymorphic object casts, and all have prohibitively high runtime overhead. The main source of overhead is the need to track the object type during runtime for both polymorphic and non-polymorphic object casts. In this paper, we present CastSan, a C++ object type confusion detection tool for polymorphic objects only, which scales efficiently to large and complex code bases as well as to many concurrent threads. To considerably reduce the object type cast checking overhead, we employ a new technique based on constructing the whole virtual table hierarchy during program compile time. Since CastSan does not rely on keeping track of the object type during runtime, the overhead is drastically reduced. Our evaluation results show that complex applications run insignificantly slower when our technique is deployed, thus making CastSan a real-world usage candidate. Finally, we envisage that based on our object type confusion detection technique, which relies on ordered virtual tables (vtables), even non-polymorphic object casts could be precisely handled by constructing auxiliary non-polymorphic function table hierarchies for static classes as well."
On Leveraging Coding Habits for Effective Binary Authorship Attribution,"We propose BinAuthor, a novel and the first compiler-agnostic method for identifying the authors of program binaries. Having filtered out unrelated functions (compiler and library) to detect user-related functions, it converts user-related functions into a canonical form to eliminate compiler/compilation effects. Then, it leverages a set of features based on collections of authors’ choices made during coding. These features capture an author’s coding habits. Our evaluation demonstrated that BinAuthor outperforms existing methods in several respects. First, when tested on large datasets extracted from selected open-source C/C++ projects in GitHub, Google Code Jam events, and Planet Source Code contests, it successfully attributed a larger number of authors with a significantly higher accuracy: around  90   when the number of authors is 1000. Second, when the code was subjected to refactoring techniques, code transformation, or processing using different compilers or compilation settings, there was no significant drop in accuracy, indicating that BinAuthor is more robust than previous methods."
Synthesis of a Permissive Security Monitor,"In this paper, we propose a new sound method to synthesize a permissive monitor using boolean supervisory controller synthesis that observes a Java program at certain checkpoints, predicts information flow violations and applies suitable countermeasures to prevent violations. To improve the permissiveness, we train the monitor and remove false positives by executing the program along with its executable model. If a security violation is detected, the user can define sound countermeasures, including declassification to apply in the checkpoints. We implement a tool that automates the whole process and generates a monitor. We evaluate our method by applying it on the Droidbench benchmark and one real-life Android application."
MobileFindr: Function Similarity Identification for Reversing Mobile Binaries,"Identifying binary code at function level has been applied to a broad range of software security applications and reverse engineering tasks, including patch analysis, vulnerability assessment, code plagiarism detection, malware analysis, etc. However, various anti-reverse engineering techniques (e.g., obfuscation, anti-emulator, etc.) employed by the mobile apps make existing approaches ineffective when performing function identification. In this paper, we propose MobileFindr, an on-device trace-based function similarity identification framework on the mobile platform. MobileFindr runs on real mobile devices and mitigates many prevalent anti-reversing techniques by extracting function execution behaviors via dynamic instrumentation, then characterizing functions with collected behaviors and performing function matching via distance calculation. We have evaluated MobileFindr using real-world top-ranked mobile frameworks and applications. The experimental results showed that MobileFindr outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools in terms of better obfuscation resilience and accuracy."
Strain: A Secure Auction for Blockchains,"We present Strain, a new auction protocol running on top of blockchains and guaranteeing bid confidentiality against fully-malicious parties. As our goal is efficiency and low blockchain latency, we abstain from using traditional, highly interactive MPC primitives such as secret shares. We focus on a slightly weaker adversary model than MPC which allows Strain to achieve constant latency in both the number of parties and the bid length. The main idea behind Strain is a new maliciously-secure two-party comparison mechanism executed between any pair of bids in parallel. Using zero-knowledge proofs, Strain broadcasts the outcome of comparisons on the blockchain in a way that all parties can verify each outcome. Strain’s latency is not only asymptotically optimal, but also efficient in practice, requiring a total of just 4 blocks of the underlying blockchain. Strain provides typical auction security requirements such as non-retractable bids against fully-malicious adversaries."
Channels: Horizontal Scaling and Confidentiality on Permissioned Blockchains,"Sharding, or partitioning the system’s state so that different subsets of participants handle it, is a proven approach to building distributed systems whose total capacity scales horizontally with the number of participants. Many distributed ledgers have adopted this approach to increase their performance, however, they focus on the permissionless setting that assumes the existence of a strong adversary. In this paper, we deploy channels for permissioned blockchains. Our first contribution is to adapt sharding on asset-management applications for the permissioned setting, while preserving liveness and safety even on transactions spanning across-channels. Our second contribution is to leverage channels as a confidentiality boundary, enabling different organizations and consortia to preserve their privacy within their channels and still be part of a bigger collaborative ecosystem. To make our system concrete we map it on top of Hyperledger Fabric."
Stay On-Topic: Generating Context-Specific Fake Restaurant Reviews,"Automatically generated fake restaurant reviews are a threat to online review systems. Recent research has shown that users have difficulties in detecting machine-generated fake reviews hiding among real restaurant reviews. The method used in this work (char-LSTM) has one drawback: it has difficulties staying in context, i.e. when it generates a review for specific target entity, the resulting review may contain phrases that are unrelated to the target, thus increasing its detectability. In this work, we present and evaluate a more sophisticated technique based on neural machine translation (NMT) with which we can generate reviews that stay on-topic. We test multiple variants of our technique using native English speakers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We demonstrate that reviews generated by the best variant have almost optimal undetectability (class-averaged F-score 47%). We conduct a user study with experienced users and show that our method evades detection more frequently compared to the state-of-the-art (average evasion 3.2 / 4 vs 1.5 / 4) with statistical significance, at level    = 1   (Sect. 4.3). We develop very effective detection tools and reach average F-score of  97   in classifying these. Although fake reviews are very effective in fooling people, effective automatic detection is still feasible."
Efficient Proof Composition for Verifiable Computation,"Outsourcing machine learning algorithms helps users to deal with large amounts of data without the need to develop the expertise required by these algorithms. Outsourcing however raises severe security issues due to potentially untrusted service providers. Verifiable computing (VC) tackles some of these issues by assuring computational integrity for an outsourced computation. In this paper, we design a VC protocol tailored to verify a sequence of operations for which no existing VC scheme is suitable to achieve realistic performance objective for the entire sequence. We thus suggest a technique to compose several specialized and efficient VC schemes with a general purpose VC protocol, like Parno et al.’s Pinocchio, by integrating the verification of the proofs generated by these specialized schemes as a function that is part of the sequence of operations verified using the general purpose scheme. The resulting scheme achieves the objectives of the general purpose scheme with increased efficiency for the prover. The scheme relies on the underlying cryptographic assumptions of the composed protocols for correctness and soundness."
Navigating the Samsung TrustZone and Cache-Attacks on the Keymaster Trustlet,"The ARM TrustZone is a security extension helping to move the “root of trust” further away from the attacker, which is used in recent Samsung flagship smartphones. These devices use the TrustZone to create a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) called a Secure World, which runs secure processes called Trustlets. The Samsung TEE is based on the Kinibi OS and includes cryptographic key storage and functions inside the Keymaster trustlet.Using static and dynamic reverse engineering techniques, we present a critical review of Samsung’s proprietary TrustZone architecture. We describe the major components and their interconnections, focusing on their security aspects. During this review we identified some design weaknesses, including one actual vulnerability. Next, we identify that the ARM32 assembly-language AES implementation used by the Keymaster trustlet is vulnerable to cache side-channel attacks. Finally, we demonstrate realistic cache attack artifacts on the Keymaster cryptographic functions, despite the recently discovered Autolock feature on ARM CPUs."
Combination of Hardware and Software: An Efficient AES Implementation Resistant to Side-Channel Attacks on All Programmable SoC,"With the rapid development of IoT devices in the direction of multifunction and personalization, All Programmable SoC has been used more and more frequently because of its unrivaled levels of system performance, flexibility, and scalability. On the other hand, this type of SoC faces a growing range of security threats. Among these threats, cache timing attacks and power/elctromagnetic analysis attacks are two considerable ones which have been widely studied. Although many countermeasures have been proposed to resist these two types of attacks, most of them can only withstand a single type but are often incapable when facing multi-type attacks. In this paper, we utilize the special architecture of All Programmable SoC to implement a secure AES encryption scheme which can efficiently resist both cache timing and power/electromagnetic analysis attacks. The AES implementation has a beginning software stage, a middle hardware stage and a final software stage. Operations in software and start/end round of hardware are all randomized, which allow our implementation to withstand two types of attacks. To illustrate the security of the implementation, we conduct the three types of attacks on unprotected software/hardware AES, shuffled software AES and our scheme. Furthermore, we use Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA) to test their security on encryption times and power/electromagnetic traces. The final result indicates that our encryption implementation achieves a high secure level with almost 0.86 times data throughput of the shuffled software AES implementation."
How Secure Is Green IT? The Case of Software-Based Energy Side Channels,"Software-based energy measurement features in contemporary CPUs allow one to track and to limit energy consumption, e.g., for realizing green IT. The security implications of software-based energy measurement, however, are not well understood. In this article, we study such security implications of green IT. More concretely, we show that side-channel attacks can be established using software-based energy measurement at the example of a popular RSA implementation. Using distinguishing experiments, we identify a side-channel vulnerability that enables attackers to distinguish RSA keys by measuring energy consumption. We demonstrate that a surprisingly low number of sample measurements suffices to succeed in an attack with high probability. In contrast to traditional power side-channel attacks, no physical access to hardware is needed. This makes the vulnerabilities particularly serious."
Phishing Attacks Modifications and Evolutions,"So-called “phishing attacks” are attacks in which phishing sites are disguised as legitimate websites in order to steal sensitive information.Our previous research [1] showed that phishing attacks tend to be relaunched many times, after sometimes small modifications. In this paper, we look into the details of these modifications and their evolution over time. We propose a model called the “Semi-Complete Linkage” (SCL) graph to perform our evaluation, and we show that unlike usual software, phishing attacks tend to be derived from a small set of master versions, and even the most active attacks in our database only go through a couple of iterations on average over their lifespan.We also show that phishing attacks tend to evolve independently from one another, without much cross-coordination."
SILK-TV: Secret Information Leakage from Keystroke Timing Videos,"Shoulder surfing attacks are an unfortunate consequence of entering passwords or PINs into computers, smartphones, PoS terminals, and ATMs. Such attacks generally involve observing the victim’s input device. This paper studies leakage of user secrets (passwords and PINs) based on observations of output devices (screens or projectors) that provide “helpful” feedback to users in the form of masking characters, each corresponding to a keystroke. To this end, we developed a new attack called Secret Information Leakage from Keystroke Timing Videos (SILK-TV). Our attack extracts inter-keystroke timing information from videos of password masking characters displayed when users type their password on a computer, or their PIN at an ATM or PoS. We conducted several studies in various envisaged attack scenarios. Results indicate that, while in some cases leakage is minor, it is quite substantial in others. By leveraging inter-keystroke timings, SILK-TV recovers 8-character alphanumeric passwords in as little as 19 attempts. However, when guessing PINs, SILK-TV yields no substantial speedup compared to brute force. Our results strongly indicate that secure password masking GUIs must consider the information leakage identified in this paper."
A Formal Approach to Analyzing Cyber-Forensics Evidence,"The frequency and harmfulness of cyber-attacks are increasing every day, and with them also the amount of data that the cyber-forensics analysts need to collect and analyze. In this paper, we propose a formal analysis process that allows an analyst to filter the enormous amount of evidence collected and either identify crucial information about the attack (e.g., when it occurred, its culprit, its target) or, at the very least, perform a pre-analysis to reduce the complexity of the problem in order to then draw conclusions more swiftly and efficiently.We introduce the Evidence Logic    {EL}  for representing simple and derived pieces of evidence from different sources. We propose a procedure, based on monotonic reasoning, that rewrites the pieces of evidence with the use of tableau rules, based on relations of trust between sources and the reasoning behind the derived evidence, and yields a consistent set of pieces of evidence. As proof of concept, we apply our analysis process to a concrete cyber-forensics case study."
Beneath the Bonnet: A Breakdown of Diagnostic Security,"An Electronic Control Unit (ECU) is an automotive computer essential to the operation of a modern car. Diagnostic protocols running on these ECUs are often too powerful, giving an adversary full access to the ECU if they can bypass the diagnostic authentication mechanism. Firstly, we present three ciphers used in the diagnostic access control, which we reverse engineered from the ECU firmware of four major automotive manufacturers. Next, we identify practical security vulnerabilities in all three ciphers, which use proprietary cryptographic primitives and a small internal state. Subsequently, we propose a generic method to remotely execute code on an ECU over CAN exclusively through diagnostic functions, which we have tested on units of three major automotive manufacturers. Once authenticated, an adversary with access to the CAN network can download binary code to the RAM of the microcontroller and execute it, giving them full access to the ECU and its peripherals, including the ability to read/write firmware at will. Finally, we conclude with recommendations to improve the diagnostic security of ECUs."
Extending Automated Protocol State Learning for the 802.11 4-Way Handshake,"We show how state machine learning can be extended to handle time out behaviour and unreliable communication mediums. This enables us to carry out the first fully automated analysis of 802.11 4-Way Handshake implementations. We develop a tool that uses our learning method and apply this to 7 widely used Wi-Fi routers, finding 3 new security critical vulnerabilities: two distinct downgrade attacks and one router that can be made to leak some encrypted data to an attacker before authentication."
Automatic Detection of Various Malicious Traffic Using Side Channel Features on TCP Packets,"Modern intrusion detection systems struggle to detect advanced, custom attacks against most vectors; from web application injections to malware reverse connections with encrypted traffic. Current solutions mostly utilize complex patterns or behavioral analytics on software, user actions and services historical data together with traffic analysis, in an effort to detect specific types of attacks. Still, false positives and negatives plague such systems. Behavioral-based security solutions provides good results but need large amounts of time and data to train (often spanning months or even years of surveillance) - especially when encryption comes into play. In this paper, we present a network traffic monitoring system that implements a detection method using machine learning over side channel characteristics of TCP/IP packets and not deep packet inspection, user analytics or binary analysis. We were able to efficiently distinguish normal from malicious traffic over a wide range of attacks with a true positive detection rate of about 94%. Few similar efforts have been made for the classification of malicious traffic but existing methods rely on complex feature selection and deep packet analysis to achieve similar (or worse) detection rates. Most focus on encrypted malware traffic. We manage to distinguish malicious from normal traffic in a wide range of different types of attacks (e.g. unencrypted and encrypted malware traffic and/or shellcode connections, website defacing attacks, ransomware downloaded cryptolocker attacks, etc.) using only few side channel packet characteristics and we achieve similar or better overall detection rates from similar detection systems. We compare seven different machine learning algorithms on multiple traffic sets to produce the best possible results. We use less features than other proposed solutions and thus require less data and achieve short times during training and classification."
PwIN – Pwning Intel piN: Why DBI is Unsuitable for Security Applications,"Binary instrumentation is a robust and powerful technique which facilitates binary code modification of computer programs even when no source code is available. This is achieved either statically by rewriting the binary instructions of the program and then executing the altered program or dynamically, by changing the code at run-time right before it is executed. The design of most Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) frameworks puts emphasis on ease-of-use, portability, and efficiency, offering the possibility to execute inspecting analysis code from an interpositioned perspective maintaining full access to the instrumented program. This has established DBI as a powerful tool utilized for analysis tasks such as profiling, performance evaluation, and prototyping.The interest of employing DBI tools for binary hardening techniques (e.g. Program Shepherding) and malware analysis is constantly increasing among researchers. However, the usage of DBI for security related tasks is questionable, as in such scenarios it is important that analysis code runs isolated from the instrumented program in a stealthy way.In this paper, we show (1) that a plethora of literature implicitly seems to assume isolation and stealthiness of DBI frameworks and strongly challenge these assumptions. We use Intel Pin running on x86-64 Linux as an example to show that assuming a program is running in context of a DBI framework (2) the presence thereof can be detected, (3) policies introduced by binary hardening mechanisms can be subverted, and (4) otherwise hard-to-exploit bugs can be escalated to full code execution."
POR for Security Protocol Equivalences,"Formal methods have proved effective to automatically analyse protocols. Recently, much research has focused on verifying trace equivalence on protocols, which is notably used to model interesting privacy properties such as anonymity or unlinkability. Several tools for checking trace equivalence rely on a naive and expensive exploration of all interleavings of concurrent actions, which calls for partial-order reduction (POR) techniques. In this paper, we present the first POR technique for protocol equivalences that does not rely on an action-determinism assumption: we recast trace equivalence as a reachability problem, to which persistent and sleep set techniques can be applied, and we show how to effectively apply these results in the context of symbolic execution. We report on a prototype implementation, improving the tool DeepSec."
Automated Identification of Desynchronisation Attacks on Shared Secrets,"Key-updating protocols are a class of communication protocol that aim to increase security by having the participants change encryption keys between protocol executions. However, such protocols can be vulnerable to desynchronisation attacks, a denial of service attack in which the agents are tricked into updating their keys improperly, impeding future communication. In this work we introduce a method that can be used to automatically verify (or falsify) resistance to desynchronisation attacks for a range of protocols. This approach is then used to identify previously unreported vulnerabilities in two published RFID grouping protocols."
Stateful Protocol Composition,"We prove a parallel compositionality result for protocols with a shared mutable state, i.e., stateful protocols. For protocols satisfying certain compositionality conditions our result shows that verifying the component protocols in isolation is sufficient to prove security of their composition. Our main contribution is an extension of the compositionality paradigm to stateful protocols where participants maintain shared databases. Because of the generality of our result we also cover many forms of sequential composition as a special case of stateful parallel composition. Moreover, we support declassification of shared secrets. As a final contribution we prove the core of our result in Isabelle/HOL, providing a strong correctness guarantee of our proofs."
Towards Understanding Privacy Implications of Adware and Potentially Unwanted Programs,"Web advertisements are the primary financial source for many online services, but also for adversaries. Successful ad campaigns rely on good online profiles of their potential customers. The financial potentials of displaying ads have led to the rise of malicious software that injects or replaces ads on websites, in particular, so-called adware. This development leads to continuously further optimized and customized advertising. For these customization’s, various tracking methods are used. However, only little work has gone into privacy issues emerging from adware.In this paper, we investigate the tracking capabilities and related privacy implications of adware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs). Therefore, we developed a framework that allows us to analyze any network communication of the Firefox browser on the application level to circumvent encryption like TLS. We use this framework to dynamically analyze the communication streams of over 16,000 adware or potentially unwanted programs samples that tamper with the users’ browser session. Our results indicate that roughly 37% of the requests issued by the analyzed samples contain private information and are accordingly able to track users. Additionally, we analyze which tracking techniques and services are used by attackers."
A no nymous Si ngle-Sig n-O n for n Desig nated Services with Traceability,"Anonymous Single-Sign-On authentication schemes have been proposed to allow users to access a service protected by a verifier without revealing their identity. This has become more important with the introduction of strong privacy regulations. In this paper we describe a new approach whereby anonymous authentication to different verifiers is achieved via authorisation tags and pseudonyms. The particular innovation of our scheme is that authentication can occur only between a user and its designated verifier for a service, and the verification cannot be performed by any other verifier. The benefit of this authentication approach is that it prevents information leakage of a user’s service access information, even if the verifiers for these services collude. Our scheme also supports a trusted third party who is authorised to de-anonymise the user and reveal her whole service access information if required. Furthermore, our scheme is lightweight because it does not rely on attribute or policy-based signature schemes to enable access to multiple services. The scheme’s security model is given together with a security proof, an implementation and a performance evaluation."
Efficiently Deciding Equivalence for Standard Primitives and Phases,"Privacy properties like anonymity or untraceability are now well identified, desirable goals of many security protocols. Such properties are typically stated as equivalence properties. However, automatically checking equivalence of protocols often yields efficiency issues.We propose an efficient algorithm, based on graph planning and SAT-solving. It can decide equivalence for a bounded number of sessions, for protocols with standard cryptographic primitives and phases (often necessary to specify privacy properties), provided protocols are well-typed, that is encrypted messages cannot be confused. The resulting implementation, SAT-Equiv, demonstrates a significant speed-up w.r.t. other existing tools that decide equivalence, covering typically more than 100 sessions. Combined with a previous result, SAT-Equiv can now be used to prove security, for some protocols, for an unbounded number of sessions."
DigesTor: Comparing Passive Traffic Analysis Attacks on Tor,"The Tor anonymity network represents a rewarding target for de-anonymization attacks, in particular by large organizations and governments. Tor is vulnerable to confirmation attacks, in which powerful adversaries compromise user anonymity by correlating transmissions between entry and exit nodes. As the experimental evaluation of such attacks is challenging, a fair comparison of passive traffic analysis techniques is hardly possible. In this work, we provide a first comparative evaluation of confirmation attacks and assess their impact on the real world. For this purpose, we release DigesTor, an analysis framework that delivers a foundation for comparability to support future research in this context. The framework runs a virtual private Tor network to generate traffic for representative scenarios, on which arbitrary attacks can be evaluated. Our results show the effects of recent and novel attack techniques and we demonstrate the capabilities of DigesTor using the example of mixing as a countermeasure against traffic analysis attacks."
Deriving a Cost-Effective Digital Twin of an ICS to Facilitate Security Evaluation,"Industrial control systems (ICSs), and particularly supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, are used in many critical infrastructures and are inherently insecure, making them desirable targets for attackers. ICS networks differ from typical enterprise networks in their characteristics and goals; therefore, security assessment methods that are common in enterprise networks (e.g., penetration testing) cannot be directly applied in ICSs. Thus, security experts recommend using an isolated environment that mimics the real one for assessing the security of ICSs. While the use of such environments solves the main challenge in ICS security analysis, it poses another one: the trade-off between budget and fidelity. In this paper we suggest a method for creating a digital twin that is network-specific, cost-efficient, highly reliable, and security test-oriented. The proposed method consists of two modules: a problem builder that takes facts about the system under test and converts them into a rules set that reflects the system’s topology and digital twin implementation constraints; and a solver that takes these inputs and uses 0–1 non-linear programming to find an optimal solution (i.e., a digital twin specification), which satisfies all of the constraints. We demonstrate the application of our method on a simple use case of a simplified ICS network."
Tracking Advanced Persistent Threats in Critical Infrastructures Through Opinion Dynamics,"Advanced persistent threats pose a serious issue for modern industrial environments, due to their targeted and complex attack vectors that are difficult to detect. This is especially severe in critical infrastructures that are accelerating the integration of IT technologies. It is then essential to further develop effective monitoring and response systems that ensure the continuity of business to face the arising set of cyber-security threats. In this paper, we study the practical applicability of a novel technique based on opinion dynamics, that permits to trace the attack throughout all its stages along the network by correlating different anomalies measured over time, thereby taking the persistence of threats and the criticality of resources into consideration. The resulting information is of essential importance to monitor the overall health of the control system and correspondingly deploy accurate response procedures."
Hide Your Hackable Smart Home from Remote Attacks: The Multipath Onion IoT Gateways,"The rapid expansion of IoT-enabled home automation is accompanied by substantial security and privacy risks. A large number of real-world security incidents exploiting various device vulnerabilities have been revealed. The Onion IoT gateways have been proposed to provide strong security protection for potentially vulnerable IoT devices by hiding them behind IoT gateways running the Tor hidden services, in which the gateways can only be accessed by authorized users with the .onion addresses of the gateways and correct credentials. However, the limited bandwidth of Tor makes this approach very impractical and unscalable. To tackle this issue, we present two novel designs of multipath Onion IoT gateway and split channel Onion IoT gateway. The first design implements a customized multipath routing protocol in Tor to construct a multi-circuit anonymous tunnel between the user and the Onion gateway to support applications that require low latency and high bandwidth. The second scheme splits command and data channels so that small-sized command packets are transmitted through the more secure channel over the Tor hidden service, while the less secure data channel over the public network is used for outbound very-high-bandwidth data traffic. Experiment results show that the proposed approaches significantly improve the performance of Onion IoT gateways, so that they can be practically adopted to securely transmit low-latency and high-bandwidth data, such as HD video streams from home surveillance cameras. We also prove the security guarantees of the proposed mechanism through security analysis."
SCIoT: A Secure and sCalable End-to-End Management Framework for IoT Devices,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is connecting billions of smart devices. One of the emerging challenges in the IoT scenario is how to efficiently and securely manage large deployments of devices. This includes sending commands, monitoring status and execution results, updating devices firmware, and interactively resolving problems.In this paper we propose SCIoT, a Secure and sCalable framework for IoT management. SCIoT guarantees low complexity in terms of communication, storage and computation on both managed devices and the management entity. SCIoT enables secure management of large deployments with a single low-power management device, by leveraging trees of common untrusted intermediate infrastructures. SCIoT brings three technical contributions: (1) a domain-independent management specification by means of extended finite state machines, which specifies states and desired transitions to describe the whole management process; (2) a protocol for securely and efficiently distributing applicable transitions of the automaton corresponding to commands; and (3) a protocol for securely aggregating status responses from the managed nodes using a tree of untrusted nodes. We show feasibility and efficiency of SCIoT by both a proof-of-concept implementation of the client agent on Riot-OS – an operating system for the IoT, and a large scale evaluation, using realistic assumptions. Our thorough evaluation highlights the efficiency of our command distribution protocol, as well as the small (logarithmic) runtime and overhead of data collection."
Workflow-Aware Security of Integrated Mobility Services,"The Connected Mobility Lab (CML) is a mobility solution created in collaboration between Siemens and BMW. The CML provides a multi-tenant cloud infrastructure where entities – mobility providers, financial service providers, users – might know each other or might be complete strangers. The CML encapsulates core services from different stakeholders and exposes an integrated, comprehensive, and innovative mobility service to its users. The different owners may have different security goals and impose their own rules and workflows on entities interacting with their services. Thus, there is a need to negotiate in order to reach mutually acceptable compromises, and inter-operate services within the CML. Especially, when different services collaborate to fulfill a purpose it is important to allow only authorized entities to execute the required tasks. To enforce such tasks to be executed in a particular order we need a workflow specification and enforcement method.This paper presents a workflow specification and enforcement framework that guarantees the process integrity (for instance, a technical process) by enforcing an access control method that restricts the entities to do only what is allowed in the specified workflow. The framework also supports dynamic workflows that adapt to error conditions, and a method to support accountability. We evaluate our proposed framework on a CML business mobility use case. We extend the Petri Nets based workflow specification and enforcement framework proposed in [2] to achieve our goals."
Emulation-Instrumented Fuzz Testing of 4G/LTE Android Mobile Devices Guided by Reinforcement Learning,"The proliferation of 4G/LTE (Long Term Evolution)-capable mobile devices calls for new techniques and tools for assessing their vulnerabilities effectively and efficiently. Existing methods require significant human efforts, such as manual examination of LTE protocol specifications or manual analysis of LTE network traffic, to identify potential vulnerabilities. In this work, we investigate the possibility of automating vulnerability assessment of 4G/LTE mobile devices based on AI (Artificial Intelligence) techniques. Towards this end, we develop LEFT (LTE-Oriented Emulation-Instrumented Fuzzing Testbed), which perturbs the behavior of LTE network modules to elicit vulnerable internal states of mobile devices under test. To balance exploration and exploitation, LEFT uses reinforcement learning to guide behavior perturbation in an instrumented LTE network emulator. We have implemented LEFT in a laboratory environment to fuzz two key LTE protocols and used it to assess the vulnerabilities of four COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) Android mobile phones. The experimental results have shown that LEFT can evaluate the security of 4G/LTE-capable mobile devices automatically and effectively."
PIAnalyzer: A Precise Approach for PendingIntent Vulnerability Analysis,"PendingIntents are a powerful and universal feature of Android for inter-component communication. A PendingIntent holds a base intent to be executed by another application with the creator’s permissions and identity without the creator necessarily residing in memory. While PendingIntents are useful for many scenarios, e.g., for setting an alarm or getting notified at some point in the future, insecure usage of PendingIntents causes severe security threats in the form of denial-of-service, identity theft, and privilege escalation attacks. An attacker may gain up to SYSTEM privileges to perform the most sensitive operations, e.g., deleting user’s data on the device. However, so far no tool can detect these PendingIntent vulnerabilities.In this work we propose PIAnalyzer, a novel approach to analyze PendingIntent related vulnerabilities. We empirically evaluate PIAnalyzer on a set of 1000 randomly selected applications from the Google Play Store and find 1358 insecure usages of PendingIntents, including 70 severe vulnerabilities. We manually inspected ten reported vulnerabilities out of which nine correctly reported vulnerabilities, indicating a high precision. The evaluation shows that PIAnalyzer is efficient with an average execution time of 13 seconds per application."
Investigating Fingerprinters and Fingerprinting-Alike Behaviour of Android Applications,"Fingerprinting of browsers has been thoroughly investigated. In contrast, mobile phone applications offer a far wider array of attributes for profiling, yet fingerprinting practices on this platform have hardly received attention.In this paper, we present the first (to our knowledge) investigation of Android libraries by commercial fingerprinters. Interestingly enough, there is a marked difference with fingerprinting desktop browsers. We did not find evidence of typical fingerprinting techniques such as canvas fingerprinting. Secondly, we searched for behaviour resembling that of commercial fingerprinters. We performed a detailed analysis of six similar libraries. Thirdly, we investigated     30,000 apps and found that roughly 19% of these apps is using one of the these libraries. Finally, we checked how often these libraries were used by apps subject to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (i.e. apps targeted explicitly at children), and found that these libraries were included 21 times."
Towards Efficient Verifiable Conjunctive Keyword Search for Large Encrypted Database,"Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) enables a client to securely outsource large encrypted database to a server while supporting efficient keyword search. Most of the existing works are designed against the honest-but-curious server. That is, the server will be curious but execute the protocol in an honest manner. Recently, some researchers presented various verifiable SSE schemes that can resist to the malicious server, where the server may not honestly perform all the query operations. However, they either only considered single-keyword search or cannot handle very large database. To address this challenge, we propose a new verifiable conjunctive keyword search scheme by leveraging accumulator. Our proposed scheme can not only ensure verifiability of search result even if an empty set is returned but also support efficient conjunctive keyword search with sublinear overhead. Besides, the verification cost of our construction is independent of the size of search result. In addition, we introduce a sample check method for verifying the completeness of search result with a high probability, which can significantly reduce the computation cost on the client side. Security and efficiency evaluation demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only can achieve high security goals but also has a comparable performance."
Order-Revealing Encryption: File-Injection Attack and Forward Security,"Order-preserving encryption (OPE) and order-revealing encryption (ORE) are among the core ingredients for encrypted databases (EDBs). In this work, we study the leakage of OPE and ORE and their forward security.We propose generic yet powerful file-injection attacks (FIAs) on OPE/ORE, aimed at the situations of possessing order by and range queries. Our FIAs only exploit the ideal leakage of OPE/ORE (in particular, no need of data denseness or frequency). We executed some experiments on real datasets to test the performance, and the results show that our FIAs can cause an extreme hazard on most of the existing OPEs and OREs with high efficiency and 100% recovery rate.We then formulate forward security of ORE, which is of independent of interest, and propose a practical compilation framework for achieving forward secure ORE in order to resist the perniciousness of FIA. The compilation framework can transform most of the existing OPEs/OREs into forward secure OREs, with the goal of minimizing the extra burden incurred on computation and storage. We also execute some experiments to analyze its performance."
SEISMIC: SEcure In-lined Script Monitors for Interrupting Cryptojacks,"A method of detecting and interrupting unauthorized, browser-based cryptomining is proposed, based on semantic signature-matching. The approach addresses a new wave of cryptojacking attacks, including XSS-assisted, web gadget-exploiting counterfeit mining. Evaluation shows that the approach is more robust than current static code analysis defenses, which are susceptible to code obfuscation attacks. An implementation based on in-lined reference monitoring offers a browser-agnostic deployment strategy that is applicable to average end-user systems without specialized hardware or operating systems."
Detecting and Characterizing Web Bot Traffic in a Large E-commerce Marketplace,"A certain amount of web traffic is attributed to web bots on the Internet. Web bot traffic has raised serious concerns among website operators, because they usually consume considerable resources at web servers, resulting in high workloads and longer response time, while not bringing in any profit. Even worse, the content of the pages it crawled might later be used for other fraudulent activities. Thus, it is important to detect web bot traffic and characterize it. In this paper, we first propose an efficient approach to detect web bot traffic in a large e-commerce marketplace and then perform an in-depth analysis on the characteristics of web bot traffic. Specifically, our proposed bot detection approach consists of the following modules: (1) an Expectation Maximization (EM)-based feature selection method to extract the most distinguishable features, (2) a gradient based decision tree to calculate the likelihood of being a bot IP, and (3) a threshold estimation mechanism aiming to recover a reasonable amount of non-bot traffic flow. The detection approach has been applied on Taobao/Tmall platforms, and its detection capability has been demonstrated by identifying a considerable amount of web bot traffic. Based on data samples of traffic originating from web bots and normal users, we conduct a comparative analysis to uncover the behavioral patterns of web bots different from normal users. The analysis results reveal their differences in terms of active time, search queries, item and store preferences, and many other aspects. These findings provide new insights for public websites to further improve web bot traffic detection for protecting valuable web contents."
Dissemination of Authenticated Tree-Structured Data with Privacy Protection and Fine-Grained Control in Outsourced Databases,"The advent of cloud computing has inspired an increasing number of users outsourcing their data to remote servers to enjoy flexible and affordable data management services. However, storing data in a remote cloud server raises data privacy and security concerns, i.e., the integrity and origin of the query results. Although some solutions have been proposed to address these issues, none of them consider the arbitrary dissemination control of authenticated tree-structured data while disseminating to other users.To address the above concerns, in this paper, we first propose a novel and efficient redactable signature scheme which features editable homomorphic operation and redaction control on tree-structured data. Subsequently, we prove the security properties of our scheme and conduct extensive theoretical and experimental analyses. The experimental results show that our scheme outperforms the existing solutions in disseminating of authenticated tree-structured data with privacy protection and dissemination control in outsourced database (ODB) model."
Efficient and Secure Outsourcing of Differentially Private Data Publication,"While big data becomes a main impetus to the next generation of IT industry, big data privacy, as an unevadable topic in big data era, has received considerable attention in recent years. To deal with the privacy challenges, differential privacy has been widely discussed as one of the most popular privacy-enhancing techniques. However, with today’s differential privacy techniques, it is impossible to generate a sanitized dataset that can suit different algorithms or applications regardless of the privacy budget. In other words, in order to adapt to various applications and privacy budgets, different kinds of noises have to be added, which inevitably incur enormous costs for both communication and storage. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel scheme for outsourcing differential privacy in cloud computing, where an additive homomorphic encryption (e.g., Paillier encryption) is employed to compute noise for differential privacy by cloud servers to boost efficiency. The proposed scheme allows data providers to outsource their dataset sanitization procedure to cloud service providers with a low communication cost. In addition, the data providers can go offline after uploading their datasets and noise parameters, which is one of the critical requirements for a practical system. We present a detailed theoretical analysis of our proposed scheme, including proofs of differential privacy and security. Moreover, we also report an experimental evaluation on real UCI datasets, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."
Symmetric Searchable Encryption with Sharing and Unsharing,"In this paper, we study Symmetric Searchable Encryption (SSE) in a multi-user setting in which each user dynamically shares its documents with selected other users, allowing sharees also to perform searches. We introduce the concept of a Symmetric Searchable Encryption with Sharing and Unsharing, an extension of Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (NSDI ’14), that supports dynamic sharing and unsharing of documents amongst users. We also strengthen the security notion by considering a simulation-based notion that does not restrict sharing between honest and compromised users.We present the notion of cross-user leakage, the information leaked about a user’s documents and/or queries from the queries of other users, and introduce a novel technique to quantify cross-user leakage. Specifically, we model cross-user leakage by using a graph where nodes correspond to users and the presence of edges between two nodes indicates the existence of cross-user leakage between the two adjacent users. The statistics on the connected components of the cross-user leakage graph provide a quantifiable way to compare the leakage of multi-user schemes which has eluded previous works.Our main technical contribution is mx-u, an efficient scheme with small cross-user leakage, whose security is based on the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. We prove a tight bound on the leakage of mx-u in the presence of an honest-but-curious adversary that colludes with a non-adaptively chosen subset of users. We report on experiments showing that mx-u is efficient and that cross-user leakage grows slowly as queries are performed."
Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption Schemes Supporting Range Queries with Forward (and Backward) Security,"Dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE) is a useful cryptographic tool in encrypted cloud storage. However, it has been reported that DSSE usually suffers from file-injection attacks and content leak of deleted documents. To mitigate these attacks, forward security and backward security have been proposed. Nevertheless, the existing forward/backward-secure DSSE schemes can only support single keyword queries. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose two DSSE schemes supporting range queries. One is forward-secure and supports a large number of documents. The other can achieve both forward security and backward security, while it can only support a limited number of documents. Finally, we also give the security proofs of the proposed DSSE schemes in the random oracle model."
Breaking Message Integrity of an End-to-End Encryption Scheme of LINE,"In this paper, we analyze the security of an end-to-end encryption scheme (E2EE) of LINE, a.k.a Letter Sealing. LINE is one of the most widely-deployed instant messaging applications, especially in East Asia. By a close inspection of their protocols, we give several attacks against the message integrity of Letter Sealing. Specifically, we propose forgery and impersonation attacks on the one-to-one message encryption and the group message encryption. All of our attacks are feasible with the help of an end-to-end adversary, who has access to the inside of the LINE server (e.g. service provider LINE themselves). We stress that the main purpose of E2EE is to provide a protection against the end-to-end adversary. In addition, we found some attacks that even do not need the help of E2E adversary, which shows a critical security flaw of the protocol. Our results reveal that the E2EE scheme of LINE do not sufficiently guarantee the integrity of messages compared to the state-of-the-art E2EE schemes such as Signal, which is used by WhatApp and Facebook Messenger."
Scalable Wildcarded Identity-Based Encryption,"Wildcarded identity-based encryption allows a sender to simultaneously encrypt messages to a group of users matching a certain pattern, defined as a sequence of identifiers and wildcards. We propose a new wildcarded identity-based encryption scheme with generalized key delegation, which reduces the ciphertext size to be constant. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first wildcarded identity-based encryption scheme that generates a constant size ciphertext regardless of the depth of the identities. The proposed scheme also improves the decryption time by minimizing the wildcard conversion cost. According to our experiment results, decryption of the proposed scheme is 3, 10, and 650 times faster than existing WIBE, WW-IBE, and CCP-ABE schemes. The proposal also subsumes the generalized key derivation naturally by allowing wildcards in the key delegation process. We prove CPA security of the proposed scheme and extend it to be CCA secure."
Logarithmic-Size Ring Signatures with Tight Security from the DDH Assumption,"Ring signatures make it possible for a signer to anonymously and, yet, convincingly leak a secret by signing a message while concealing his identity within a flexibly chosen ring of users. Unlike group signatures, they do not involve any setup phase or tracing authority. Despite a lot of research efforts in more than 15 years, most of their realizations require linear-size signatures in the cardinality of the ring. In the random oracle model, two recent constructions decreased the signature length to be only logarithmic in the number N of ring members. On the downside, their suffer from rather loose reductions incurred by the use of the Forking Lemma. In this paper, we consider the problem of proving them tightly secure without affecting their space efficiency. Surprisingly, existing techniques for proving tight security in ordinary signature schemes do not trivially extend to the ring signature setting. We overcome these difficulties by combining the Groth-Kohlweiss     -protocol (Eurocrypt’15) with dual-mode encryption schemes. Our main result is a fully tight construction based on the Decision Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model. By full tightness, we mean that the reduction’s advantage is as large as the adversary’s, up to a constant factor."
RiffleScrambler – A Memory-Hard Password Storing Function,"We introduce RiffleScrambler: a new family of directed acyclic graphs and a corresponding data-independent memory hard function with password independent memory access. We prove its memory hardness in the random oracle model.RiffleScrambler is similar to Catena – updates of hashes are determined by a graph (bit-reversal or double-butterfly graph in Catena). The advantage of the RiffleScrambler over Catena is that the underlying graphs are not predefined but are generated per salt, as in Balloon Hashing. Such an approach leads to higher immunity against practical parallel attacks. RiffleScrambler offers better efficiency than Balloon Hashing since the in-degree of the underlying graph is equal to 3 (and is much smaller than in Ballon Hashing). At the same time, because the underlying graph is an instance of a Superconcentrator, our construction achieves the same time-memory trade-offs."
Practical Strategy-Resistant Privacy-Preserving Elections,"Recent advances in cryptography promise to let us run complex algorithms in the encrypted domain. However, these results are still mostly theoretical since the running times are still much larger than their equivalents in the plaintext domain. In this context, Majority Judgment is a recent proposal for a new voting system with several interesting practical advantages, but which implies a more involved tallying process than first-past-the-post voting. To protect voters’ privacy, such a process needs to be done by only manipulating encrypted data.In this paper, we then explore the possibility of computing the (ordered) winners in the Majority Judgment election without leaking any other information, using homomorphic encryption and multiparty computation. We particularly focus on the practicality of such a solution and, for this purpose, we optimize both the algorithms and the implementations of several cryptographic building blocks. Our result is very positive, showing that this is as of now possible to attain practical running times for such a complex privacy-protecting tallying process, even for large-scale elections."
Formal Analysis of Vote Privacy Using Computationally Complete Symbolic Attacker,"We analyze the FOO electronic voting protocol in the provable security model using the technique of Computationally Complete Symbolic Attacker (CCSA). The protocol uses commitments, blind signatures and anonymous channels to achieve vote privacy. Unlike the Dolev-Yao analyses of the protocol, we assume neither perfect cryptography nor existence of perfectly anonymous channels. Our analysis reveals new attacks on vote privacy, including an attack that arises due to the inadequacy of the blindness property of blind signatures and not due to a specific implementation of anonymous channels. With additional assumptions and modifications, we were able to show that the protocol satisfies vote privacy in the sense that switching votes of two honest voters is undetectable to the attacker. Our techniques demonstrate effectiveness of the CCSA technique for both attack detection and verification."
Location Proximity Attacks Against Mobile Targets: Analytical Bounds and Attacker Strategies,"Location privacy has mostly focused on scenarios where users remain static. However, investigating scenarios where the victims present a particular mobility pattern is more realistic. In this paper, we consider abstract attacks on services that provide location information on other users in the proximity. In that setting, we quantify the required effort of the attacker to localize a particular mobile victim. We prove upper and lower bounds for the effort of an optimal attacker. We experimentally show that a Linear Jump Strategy (LJS) practically achieves the upper bounds for almost uniform initial distributions of victims. To improve performance for less uniform distributions known to the attacker, we propose a Greedy Updating Attack Strategy (GUAS). Finally, we derive a realistic mobility model from a real-world dataset and discuss the performance of our strategies in that setting."
Constant-Round Client-Aided Secure Comparison Protocol,"We present an improved constant-round secure two-party protocol for integer comparison functionality, which is one of the most fundamental building blocks in secure computation.Our protocol is in the so-called client-server model, which is utilized in real-world MPC products such as Sharemind, where any number of clients can create shares of their input and distribute to the servers who then jointly compute over the shares and return the shares of result to the client. In the client-aided client-server model, as mentioned briefly by Mohassel and Zhang (S&P’17), a client further generates and distributes some necessary correlated randomness to servers. Such correlated randomness admits efficient protocols since otherwise servers have to jointly generate randomness by themselves, which can be inefficient.In this paper, we improve the state-of-the-art constant-round comparison protocols by Damgård et al. (TCC’06) and Nishide and Ohta (PKC’07) in the client-aided model. Our techniques include identifying correlated randomness in these comparison protocols. Along the way, we also use tree-based techniques for a building block, which deviate from the above two works. Our proposed protocol requires only 5 communication rounds, regardless of the bit length of inputs. This is at least 5 times fewer rounds than existing protocols. We implement our secure comparison protocol in C++. Our experimental results show that this low-round complexity benefits in low-latency networks such as WAN."
Towards Practical RAM Based Secure Computation,"Secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols are powerful privacy enhancing technologies. Yet, their scalability is limited for data intensive applications due to the circuit computation model. Therefore, RAM based secure computation (RAM-SC) has been proposed, which combines MPC with Oblivious RAM (ORAM). Unfortunately, realizing efficient RAM-SC applications by hand is a tedious and error-prone task, which requires expert knowledge in both cryptographic primitives and circuit design. To make things worse, a multitude of ORAMs with different trade-offs has been proposed. To overcome this entry barrier to RAM-SC, we present a two-fold approach. First, we explore all cost dimensions of relevant ORAMs in various deployment scenarios. Second, we present a fully automatized compilation approach from ANSI-C to RAM-SC. The presented compiler analyzes the input source code and extracts relevant information about the usage patterns of all arrays in the code. The results of the analysis are then used to predict the runtime of suitable ORAMs and to identify the ORAM that achieves minimal runtime. Thus, for the first time, RAM-SC also becomes accessible to non-domain experts."
Improved Signature Schemes for Secure Multi-party Computation with Certified Inputs,"The motivation for this work comes from the need to strengthen security of secure multi-party protocols with the ability to guarantee that the participants provide their truthful inputs in the computation. This is outside the traditional security models even in the presence of malicious participants, but input manipulation can often lead to privacy and result correctness violations. Thus, in this work we treat the problem of combining secure multi-party computation (SMC) techniques based on secret sharing with signatures to enforce input correctness in the form of certification. We modify two currently available signature schemes to achieve private verification and efficiency of batch verification and show how to integrate them with two prominent SMC protocols."
Stealthy Probing-Based Verification (SPV): An Active Approach to Defending Software Defined Networks Against Topology Poisoning Attacks,"Since a key advantage of Software Defined Networks (SDN) is providing a logically centralized view of the network topology, the correctness of such a view becomes critical for SDN applications to make the right management decisions. However, recently discovered vulnerabilities in OpenFlow Discovery Protocol (OFDP) show that malicious hosts and switches can poison the network view of the SDN controller and consequently lead to more severe security attacks, such as man-in-the-middle or denial of service. Existing solutions mostly rely on passive techniques, which only work for known attacking methods. In this paper, we propose a novel stealthy probing-based verification approach, namely, SPV, to detect fake links regardless of the attacking methods used to fabricate them. Specifically, SPV incrementally verifies legitimate links and detects fake links by sending stealthy probing packets designed to be indistinguishable from normal traffic. To illustrate the feasibility of our approach, we implement SPV in an emulated SDN environment using Mininet and OpenDaylight. We further evaluate the applicability and the performance of SPV based on a real SDN/cloud topology. The experimental results show that SPV can respond in near real-time (e.g., less than 120 ms) in both real and emulated environments, which makes SPV a scalable solution for large SDN networks."
Trust Anchors in Software Defined Networks,"Advances in software virtualization and network processing lead to increasing network softwarization. Software network elements running on commodity platforms replace or complement hardware components in cloud and mobile network infrastructure. However, such commodity platforms have a large attack surface and often lack granular control and tight integration of the underlying hardware and software stack. Often, software network elements are either themselves vulnerable to software attacks or can be compromised through the bloated trusted computing base. To address this, we protect the core security assets of network elements - authentication credentials and cryptographic context - by provisioning them to and maintaining them exclusively in isolated execution environments. We complement this with a secure and scalable mechanism to enroll network elements into software defined networks. Our evaluation results show a negligible impact on run-time performance and only a moderate performance impact at the deployment stage."
Concessive Online/Offline Attribute Based Encryption with Cryptographic Reverse Firewalls—Secure and Efficient Fine-Grained Access Control on Corrupted Machines,"Attribute based encryption (ABE) has potential to be applied in various cloud computing applications. However, the Snowden revelations show that powerful adversaries can corrupt users’ machines to compromise the security, and many implementations of provably secure encryption schemes may present undetectable vulnerabilities that can expose secret, e.g., the scheme still works properly even some backdoors have been stealthily engineered on users’ machines. Undoubtedly, ABE is also facing the above security threats. Recently, Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz proposed cryptographic reverse firewall (CRF) to solve the problem. Unfortunately, no CRF-based protection for ABE has been proposed so far due to the complex system model and the extra access structure component. Besides, the encryption scheme in the CRF framework will suffer double computation latency, which is worse for ABE that has already yielded expensive operations. In this paper, we propose a concessive online/offline ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption with cryptographic reverse firewalls (COO-CP-ABE-CRF), which can resist the exfiltration of secret information and achieve selective CPA security. Furthermore, compared with the original scheme without CRF, our scheme reduces the total computation cost by half. Moreover, we develop an extensible library called   {libabe}  that is compatible with Android devices, and we implement the prototype on a laptop and a mobile phone. The experimental results indicate that the scheme is efficient and practical."
"Making Any Attribute-Based Encryption Accountable, Efficiently","Attribute-based encryption (ABE) as one of the most interesting multi-recipient public encryption systems, naturally requires some “tracing mechanisms” to identify misbehaving users to foster accountability when unauthorized key re-distributions are taken place.We give a generic construction of (black-box) traceable ABE which only doubles the ciphertext size of the underlying ABE scheme. When instantiating properly, it yields the first such scheme with constant size ciphertext and expressive access control.Furthermore, we extend our generic construction of traceable ABE to support authority accountability. This property is essential for generating an un-deniable proof for user misbehaviors. Our new generic construction gives the first black-box traceable ABE with authority accountability, and constant size ciphertext. All properties are achieved in standard security models."
Decentralized Policy-Hiding ABE with Receiver Privacy,"Attribute-based encryption (ABE) enables limiting access to encrypted data to users with certain attributes. Different aspects of ABE were studied, such as the multi-authority setting (MA-ABE), and policy hiding, meaning the access policy is unknown to unauthorized parties. However, no practical scheme so far provably provides both properties, which are often desirable in real-world applications: supporting decentralization while hiding the access policy. We present the first practical decentralized ABE scheme with a proof of being policy-hiding. Our construction is based on a decentralized inner-product predicate encryption scheme, introduced in this paper, which hides the encryption policy. It results in an ABE scheme supporting conjunctions, disjunctions and threshold policies, that protects the access policy from parties that are not authorized to decrypt the content. Further, we address the issue of receiver privacy. By using our scheme in combination with vector commitments, we hide the overall set of attributes possessed by the receiver from individual authorities, only revealing the attribute that the authority is controlling. Finally, we propose randomizing-polynomial encodings that immunize the scheme in the presence of corrupt authorities."
