Practical Covertly Secure MPC for Dishonest Majority – Or: Breaking the SPDZ Limits,"SPDZ (pronounced “Speedz”) is the nickname of the MPC protocol of Damgård et al. from Crypto 2012. In this paper we both resolve a number of open problems with SPDZ; and present several theoretical and practical improvements to the protocol. In detail, we start by designing and implementing a covertly secure key generation protocol for obtaining a BGV public key and a shared associated secret key. We then construct both a covertly and actively secure preprocessing phase, both of which compare favourably with previous work in terms of efficiency and provable security.We also build a new online phase, which solves a major problem of the SPDZ protocol: namely prior to this work preprocessed data could be used for only one function evaluation and then had to be recomputed from scratch for the next evaluation, while our online phase can support reactive functionalities. This improvement comes mainly from the fact that our construction does not require players to reveal the MAC keys to check correctness of MAC’d values."
Practical and Employable Protocols for UC-Secure Circuit Evaluation over ℤn,"We present a set of new, efficient, universally composable two-party protocols for evaluating reactive arithmetic circuits modulo n, where n is a safe RSA modulus of unknown factorization. Our protocols are based on a homomorphic encryption scheme with message space ℤn, zero-knowledge proofs of existence, and a novel “mixed” trapdoor commitment scheme. Our protocols are proven secure against adaptive corruptions (assuming secure erasures) under standard assumptions in the CRS model (without random oracles). Our protocols appear to be the most efficient ones that satisfy these security requirements. In contrast to prior protocols, we provide facilities that allow for the use of our protocols as building blocks of higher-level protocols."
Privacy-Preserving Accountable Computation,"Accountability of distributed systems aims to ensure that whenever a malicious behavior is observed, it can be irrefutably linked to a malicious node and that every honest node can disprove false accusations. Recent work, such as PeerReview and its extensions, shows how to achieve accountability in both deterministic and randomized systems. The basic idea is to generate tamper-evident logs of the performed computations such that an external auditor can check the system’s actions by mere recomputation. For randomized computations it is more challenging: revealing the seed of the pseudo-random generator in the logs would break the unpredictability of future values. This problem has been addressed in a previous work, CSAR, which formalizes a notion of accountable randomness and presents a realization. Although all these techniques have been proven practical, they dramatically (and inevitably) expose a party’s private data, e.g., secret keys. In many scenarios, such a privacy leak would clearly be unaccepable and thus prevent a successful deployment of accountability systems.In this work, we study a notion of privacy-preserving accountability for randomized systems. While for deterministic computations zero-knowledge proofs offer a solution (which is even efficient for some computations), for randomized computations we argue that efficient solutions are less trivial. In particular, we show that zero-knowledge proofs are incompatible with the notion of accountable randomness considered in CSAR if we aim at efficient solutions. Therefore, we propose an alternative definition of accountable randomness, and we use it as a building block to develop the new notion of privacy-preserving accountable randomized computation. We present efficient instantiations for interesting classes of computations, in particular for digital signature schemes as the arguably most important cryptographic primitive."
Verifying Web Browser Extensions’ Compliance with Private-Browsing Mode,"Modern web browsers implement a private browsing mode that is intended to leave behind no traces of a user’s browsing activity on their computer. This feature is in direct tension with support for extensions, which can silently void this guarantee.We create a static type system to analyze JavaScript extensions for observation of private browsing mode. Using this type system, extension authors and app stores can convince themselves of an extension’s safety for private browsing mode. In addition, some extensions intentionally violate the private browsing guarantee; our type system accommodates this with a small annotation overhead, proportional to the degree of violation. These annotations let code auditors narrow their focus to a small fraction of the extension’s codebase.We have retrofitted type annotations to Firefox’s apis and to a sample of actively used Firefox extensions. We used the type system to verify several extensions as safe, find actual bugs in several others (most of which have been confirmed by their authors), and find dubious behavior in the rest. Firefox 20, released April 2, 2013, implements a finer-grained private browsing mode; we sketch both the new challenges in this implementation and how our approach can handle them."
A Quantitative Evaluation of Privilege Separation in Web Browser Designs,"Privilege separation is a fundamental security concept that has been used in designing many secure systems. A number of recent works propose re-designing web browsers with greater privilege separation for better security. In practice, however, privilege-separated designs require a fine balance between security benefits and other competing concerns, such as performance. In fact, performance overhead has been a main cause that prevents many privilege separation proposals from being adopted in real systems. In this paper, we develop a new measurement-driven methodology that quantifies security benefits and performance costs for a given privilege-separated browser design. Our measurements on a large corpus of web sites provide key insights on the security and performance implications of partitioning dimensions proposed in 9 recent browser designs. Our results also provide empirical guidelines to resolve several design decisions being debated in recent browser re-design efforts."
Estimating Asset Sensitivity by Profiling Users,"We introduce algorithms to automatically score and rank information technology (IT) assets in an enterprise, such as computer systems or data files, by their business value and criticality to the organization. Typically, information assets are manually assigned classification labels with respect to the confidentiality, integrity and availability. In this paper, we propose semi-automatic machine learning algorithms to automatically estimate the sensitivity of assets by profiling the users. Our methods do not require direct access to the target assets or privileged knowledge about the assets, resulting in a more efficient, scalable and privacy-preserving approach compared with existing data security solutions relying on data content classification. Instead, we rely on external information such as the attributes of the users, their access patterns and other published data content by the users. Validation with a set of 8,500 computers collected from a large company show that all our algorithms perform significantly better than two baseline methods."
Practical Secure Logging: Seekable Sequential Key Generators,"In computer forensics, log files are indispensable resources that support auditors in identifying and understanding system threats and security breaches. If such logs are recorded locally, i.e., stored on the monitored machine itself, the problem of log authentication arises: if a system intrusion takes place, the intruder might be able to manipulate the log entries and cover her traces. Mechanisms that cryptographically protect collected log messages from manipulation should ideally have two properties: they should be forward-secure (the adversary gets no advantage from learning current keys when aiming at forging past log entries), and they should be seekable (the auditor can verify the integrity of log entries in any order, at virtually no computational cost).We propose a new cryptographic primitive, a seekable sequential key generator (SSKG), that combines these two properties and has direct application in secure logging. We rigorously formalize the required security properties and give a provably-secure construction based on the integer factorization problem. We further optimize the scheme in various ways, preparing it for real-world deployment. As a byproduct, we develop the notion of a shortcut one-way permutation (SCP), which might be of independent interest.Our work is highly relevant in practice. Indeed, our SSKG implementation has become part of the logging service of the systemd system manager, a core component of many modern commercial Linux-based operating systems."
Request-Based Comparable Encryption,"An order-preserving encryption (OPE) scheme preserves the numerical order of numbers under encryption while hiding their original values in a some extent. However, if all the numbers in a certain domain are encrypted by an OPE, the original numbers can be restored from their order. We introduce a notion of novel encryption scheme “request-based comparable encryption” that provides a certain level of security even when OPEs cannot. A request-based comparable encryption hides original values, but it enables any pair of encrypted values to be compared each other when and only when one of them is accompanied by a “token”. We also consider its weaker notion and a concrete construction satisfying it. We consider a request-based comparable encryption complements OPEs and can be an essential security primitive."
Ensuring File Authenticity in Private DFA Evaluation on Encrypted Files in the Cloud,"Cloud storage, and more specifically the encryption of file contents to protect them in the cloud, can interfere with access to these files by partially trusted third-party service providers and customers. To support such access for pattern-matching applications (e.g., malware scanning), we present a protocol that enables a client authorized by the data owner to evaluate a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) on a file stored at a server (the cloud), even though the file is encrypted by the data owner for protection from the server. Our protocol contributes over previous work by enabling the client to detect any misbehavior of the server; in particular, the client can verify that the result of its DFA evaluation is based on the file stored there by the data owner, and in this sense the file and protocol result are authenticated to the client. Our protocol also protects the privacy of the file and the DFA from the server, and the privacy of the file (except the result of evaluating the DFA on it) from the client. A special case of our protocol solves private DFA evaluation on a private and authenticated file in the traditional two-party model, in which the file contents are known to the server. Our protocol provably achieves these properties for an arbitrarily malicious server and an honest-but-curious client, in the random oracle model."
HI-CFG: Construction by Binary Analysis and Application to Attack Polymorphism,"Security analysis often requires understanding both the control and data-flow structure of a binary. We introduce a new program representation, a hybrid information- and control-flow graph (HI-CFG), and give algorithms to infer it from an instruction-level trace. As an application, we consider the task of generalizing an attack against a program whose inputs undergo complex transformations before reaching a vulnerability. We apply the HI-CFG to find the parts of the program that implement each transformation, and then generate new attack inputs under a user-specified combination of transformations. Structural knowledge allows our approach to scale to applications that are infeasible with monolithic symbolic execution. Such attack polymorphism shows the insufficiency of any filter that does not support all the same transformations as the vulnerable application. In case studies, we show this attack capability against a PDF viewer and a word processor."
AnDarwin: Scalable Detection of Semantically Similar Android Applications,"The popularity and utility of smartphones rely on their vibrant application markets; however, plagiarism threatens the long-term health of these markets. We present a scalable approach to detecting similar Android apps based on their semantic information. We implement our approach in a tool called AnDarwin and evaluate it on 265,359 apps collected from 17 markets including Google Play and numerous thirdparty markets. In contrast to earlier approaches, AnDarwin has four advantages: it avoids comparing apps pairwise, thus greatly improving its scalability; it analyzes only the app code and does not rely on other information - such as the app’s market, signature, or description - thus greatly increasing its reliability; it can detect both full and partial app similarity; and it can automatically detect library code and remove it from the similarity analysis. We present two use cases for AnDarwin: finding similar apps by different developers (“clones”) and similar apps from the same developer (“rebranded”). In ten hours, AnDarwin detected at least 4,295 apps that have been the victims of cloning and 36,106 apps that are rebranded. By analyzing the clusters found by AnDarwin, we found 88 new variants of malware and identified 169 malicious apps based on differences in the requested permissions. Our evaluation demonstrates AnDarwin’s ability to accurately detect similar apps on a large scale."
BISTRO: Binary Component Extraction and Embedding for Software Security Applications,"In software security and malware analysis, researchers often need to directly manipulate binary program – benign or malicious – without source code. A useful pair of binary manipulation primitives are binary functional component extraction and embedding, for extracting a functional component from a binary program and for embedding a functional component in a binary program, respectively. Such primitives are applicable to a wide range of security scenarios such as legacy program hardening, binary semantic patching, and malware function analysis. Unfortunately, existing binary rewriting techniques are inadequate to support binary function carving and embedding. In this paper, we present bistro, a system that supports these primitives without symbolic information, relocation information, or compiler support. Bistro preserves functional correctness of both the extracted functional component and the stretched binary program (with the component embedded) by patching them in a systematic fashion. We have implemented an IDA Pro-based prototype of Bistro and evaluated it using real-world Windows software. Our results show the effectiveness of Bistro, with each stretched binary incurring low time and space overhead. Furthermore, we demonstrate Bistro’s capabilities in various security applications."
Vulnerable Delegation of DNS Resolution,"A growing number of networks delegate their DNS resolution to trusted upstream resolvers. The communication to and from the upstream resolver is invisible to off-path attackers. Hence, such delegation is considered to improve the resilience of the resolvers to cache-poisoning and DoS attacks, and also to provide other security, performance, reliability and management advantages.We show that, merely relying on an upstream resolver for security may in fact result in vulnerability to DNS poisoning and DoS attacks. The attack proceeds in modular steps: detecting delegation of DNS resolution, discovering the IP address of the internal (proxy) resolver, discovering the source port used for the (victim) DNS request and then completing the attack. The steps of the attack can be of independent use, e.g., proxy resolver can be exposed to denial of service attacks once its IP address is discovered.We provide recommendations for securing the DNS service delegation, to avoid these vulnerabilities."
Formal Approach for Route Agility against Persistent Attackers,"To proactively defend against denial of service attacks, we propose an agile multipath routing approach called random route mutation (RRM) which combines game theory and constraint satisfaction optimization to determine the optimal strategy for attack deterrence while satisfying security, performance and QoS requirements of the network. Our contribution in this paper is fourfold: (1) we model the interaction between RRM defender and DoS attacker as a game in order to determine the parameters by which the defender can maximize her benefit, (2) we model route selection as a constraint satisfaction optimization and formalize it using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) to identify efficient practical routes, (3) we provide algorithms for sound and smooth deployment of RRM on conventional as well as software-defined networks, and (4) we develop analytical and experimental models to investigate the effectiveness and limitation of RRM under different network and adversarial parameters. Our analysis and preliminary implementation show that RRM can protect up to 90% of flow packets from being attacked against persistent attackers, as compared with single-path routing schemes. Moreover, our implementation shows that RRM can be efficiently deployed on networks without causing any disruption for flows."
Plug-and-Play IP Security,"We present the Plug-and-Play IP Security (PnP-IPsec) protocol. PnP-IPsec automatically establishes IPsec security associations between gateways, avoiding the need for manual administration and coordination between gateways, and the dependency on IPsec public key certificates - the two problems which are widely believed to have limited the use of IPsec mostly to intra-organization communication.PnP-IPsec builds on Self-validated Public Data Distribution (SvPDD), a protocol that we present to establish secure connections between remote peers/networks, without depending on pre-distributed keys or certification infrastructure. Instead, SvPDD uses available anonymous communication infrastructures such as Tor, which we show to allow detection of MitM attacker interfering with communication. SvPDD may also be used in other scenarios lacking secure public key distribution, such as the initial connection to an SSH server.We provide an open-source implementation of PnP-IPsec and SvPDD, and show that the resulting system is practical and secure."
Managing the Weakest Link,"We introduce a two-player stochastic game for modeling secure team selection to add resilience against insider threats. A project manager, Alice, has a secret she wants to protect but must share with a team of individuals selected from within her organization; while an adversary, Eve, wants to learn this secret by bribing one potential team member. Eve does not know which individuals will be chosen by Alice, but both players have information about the bribeability of each potential team member. Specifically, the amount required to successfully bribe each such individual is given by a random variable with a known distribution but an unknown realization.We characterize best-response strategies for both players, and give necessary conditions for determining the game’s equilibria. We find that Alice’s best strategy involves minimizing the information available to Eve about the team composition. In particular, she should select each potential team member with a non-zero probability, unless she has a perfectly secure strategy. In the special case where the bribeability of each employee is given by a uniformly-distributed random variable, the equilibria can be divided into two outcomes – either Alice is perfectly secure, or her protection is based only on the randomness of her selection."
Automated Security Proofs for Almost-Universal Hash for MAC Verification,"Message authentication codes (MACs) are an essential primitive in cryptography. They are used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of a message, and can also be used as a building block for larger schemes, such as chosen-ciphertext secure encryption, or identity-based encryption. MACs are often built in two steps: first, the ‘front end’ of the MAC produces a short digest of the long message, then the ‘back end’ provides a mixing step to make the output of the MAC unpredictable for an attacker. Our verification method follows this structure. We develop a Hoare logic for proving that the front end of the MAC is an almost-universal hash function. The programming language used to specify these functions is fairly expressive and can be used to describe many block-cipher and compression function-based MACs. We implemented this method into a prototype that can automatically prove the security of almost-universal hash functions. This prototype can prove the security of the front-end of many CBC-based MACs (DMAC, ECBC, FCBC and XCBC to name only a few), PMAC and HMAC. We then provide a list of options for the back end of the MAC, each consisting of only two or three instructions, each of which can be composed with an almost-universal hash function to obtain a secure MAC."
Bounded Memory Protocols and Progressing Collaborative Systems,"It is well-known that the Dolev-Yao adversary is a powerful adversary. Besides acting as the network, intercepting, sending, and composing messages, he can remember as much information as he needs. That is, his memory is unbounded. We recently proposed a weaker Dolev-Yao like adversary, which also acts as the network, but whose memory is bounded. We showed that this Bounded Memory Dolev-Yao adversary, when given enough memory, can carry out many existing protocol anomalies. In particular, the known anomalies arise for bounded memory protocols, where there is only a bounded number of concurrent sessions and the honest participants of the protocol cannot remember an unbounded number of facts nor an unbounded number of nonces at a time. This led us to the question of whether it is possible to infer an upper-bound on the memory required by the Dolev-Yao adversary to carry out an anomaly from the memory restrictions of the bounded protocol. This paper answers this question negatively (Theorem 2). The second contribution of this paper is the formalization of Progressing Collaborative Systems that may create fresh values, such as nonces. In this setting there is no unbounded adversary, although bounded memory adversaries may be present. We prove the NP-completeness of the reachability problem for Progressing Collaborative Systems that may create fresh values."
Universally Composable Key-Management,"We present the first universally composable key-management functionality, formalized in the GNUC framework by Hofheinz and Shoup. It allows the enforcement of a wide range of security policies and can be extended by diverse key usage operations with no need to repeat the security proof. We illustrate its use by proving an implementation of a security token secure with respect to arbitrary key-usage operations and explore a proof technique that allows the storage of cryptographic keys externally, a novel development in simulation-based security frameworks."
A Cryptographic Analysis of OPACITY,"We take a closer look at the Open Protocol for Access Control, Identification, and Ticketing with privacY (OPACITY). This Diffie-Hellman-based protocol is supposed to provide a secure and privacy-friendly key establishment for contactless environments. It is promoted by the US Department of Defense and meanwhile available in several standards such as ISO/IEC 24727-6 and ANSI 504-1. To the best of our knowledge, so far no detailed cryptographic analysis has been publicly available. Thus, we investigate in how far the common security properties for authenticated key exchange and impersonation resistance, as well as privacy-related properties like untraceability and deniability, are met.OPACITY is not a single protocol but, in fact, a suite consisting of two protocols, one called Zero-Key Management (ZKM) and the other one named Fully Secrecy (FS). Our results indicate that the ZKM version does not achieve even very basic security guarantees. The FS protocol, on the other hand, provides a decent level of security for key establishment. Yet, our results show that the persistent-binding steps, for re-establishing previous connections, conflict with fundamental privacy properties."
Symbolic Probabilistic Analysis of Off-Line Guessing,"We introduce a probabilistic framework for the automated analysis of security protocols. Our framework provides a general method for expressing properties of cryptographic primitives, modeling an attacker more powerful than conventional Dolev-Yao attackers. It allows modeling equational properties of cryptographic primitives as well as property statements about their weaknesses, e.g. primitives leaking partial information about messages or the use of weak random generation algorithms. These properties can be used to automatically find attacks and estimate their success probability. Existing symbolic methods can neither model such properties nor find such attacks. We show that the probability estimates we obtain are negligibly different from those yielded by a generalized random oracle model based on sampling terms into bitstrings while respecting the stipulated properties of cryptographic primitives.As case studies, we use a prototype implementation of our framework to model non-trivial properties of RSA encryption and automatically estimate the probability of off-line guessing attacks on the EKE protocol."
ASICS: Authenticated Key Exchange Security Incorporating Certification Systems,"Most security models for authenticated key exchange (AKE) do not explicitly model the associated certification system, which includes the certification authority (CA) and its behaviour. However, there are several well-known and realistic attacks on AKE protocols which exploit various forms of malicious key registration and which therefore lie outside the scope of these models. We provide the first systematic analysis of AKE security incorporating certification systems (ASICS). We define a family of security models that, in addition to allowing different sets of standard AKE adversary queries, also permit the adversary to register arbitrary bitstrings as keys. For this model family we prove generic results that enable the design and verification of protocols that achieve security even if some keys have been produced maliciously. Our approach is applicable to a wide range of models and protocols; as a concrete illustration of its power, we apply it to the CMQV protocol in the natural strengthening of the eCK model to the ASICS setting."
Efficient Privacy-Enhanced Familiarity-Based Recommender System,"Recommender systems can help users to find interesting content, often based on similarity with other users. However, studies have shown that in some cases familiarity gives comparable results to similarity. Using familiarity has the added bonus of increasing privacy between users and utilizing a smaller dataset. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-enhanced recommender system that is based on familiarity. It is built on top of any given social network (without changing its behaviour) that already has information about the social relations between users. Using secure multi-party computation techniques and somewhat homomorphic encryption the privacy of the users can be ensured, assuming honest-but-curious participants. Two different solutions are given, one where all users are online, and another where most users are offline. Initial results on a prototype and a dataset of 50 familiar users and 1000 items show a recommendation time of four minutes for the solution with online users and of five minutes for the solution with offline users."
Privacy-Preserving User Data Oriented Services for Groups with Dynamic Participation,"In recent years, services that process user-generated data have become increasingly popular due to the spreading of social technologies in online applications. The data being processed by these services are mostly considered sensitive personal information, which raises privacy concerns. Hence, privacy related problems have been addressed by the research community and privacy-preserving solutions based on cryptography, like [1-5], have been proposed. Unfortunately, the existing solutions consider static settings, where the computation is executed only once for a fixed number of users, while in practice applications have a dynamic environment, where users come and leave between the executions. In this work we show that user-data oriented services, which are privacy-preserving in static settings, leak information in dynamic environments. We then present building blocks to be used in the design of privacy-preserving cryptographic protocols for dynamic settings. We also present realizations of our ideas in two different attacker models, namely semi-honest and malicious."
Privacy-Preserving Matching of Community-Contributed Content,"Popular consumer review sites, such as Yelp and Tripadvisor, are based upon massive amounts of voluntarily contributed content. Sharing of data among different review sites can offer certain benefits, such as more customized service and better-targeted advertisements. However, business, legal and ethical issues prevent review site providers from sharing data in bulk.This paper investigates how two parties can privately compare their review datasets. It presents a technique for two parties to determine which (or how many) users have contributed to both review sites. This is achieved based only upon review content, rather than personally identifying information (PII). The proposed technique relies on extracting certain key features from textual reviews, while the privacy-preserving user matching protocol is built using additively homomorphic encryption and garbled circuit evaluation. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed technique offers highly accurate results with reasonable performance."
Ballot Secrecy and Ballot Independence Coincide,"We formally define ballot independence as a cryptographic game and prove that ballot secrecy implies ballot independence.We introduce a notion of controlled malleability and show that it is sufficient for ballot independence. We also show that non-malleable ballots are sufficient, but not necessary, for ballot independence.We prove that ballot independence is sufficient for ballot secrecy under practical assumptions."
Election Verifiability or Ballot Privacy: Do We Need to Choose?,"We propose a new encryption primitive, commitment consistent encryption (CCE), and instances of this primitive that enable building the first universally verifiable voting schemes with a perfectly private audit trail (PPAT) and practical complexity. That is:the audit trail that is published for verifying elections guarantees everlasting privacy, andthe computational load required from the participants is only increased by a small constant factor compared to traditional voting schemes, and is optimal in the sense of Cramer, Gennaro and Schoenmakers [16].These properties make it possible to introduce election verifiability in large scale elections as a pure benefit, that is, without loss of privacy compared to a non-verifiable scheme and at a similar level of efficiency.We propose different approaches for constructing voting schemes with PPAT from CCE, as well as two efficient CCE constructions: one is tailored for elections with a small number of candidates, while the second is suitable for elections with complex ballots."
"Enforcing Privacy in the Presence of Others: Notions, Formalisations and Relations","Protecting privacy against bribery/coercion is a necessary requirement in electronic services, like e-voting, e-auction and e-health. Domain-specific privacy properties have been proposed to capture this. We generalise these properties as enforced privacy: a system enforces a user’s privacy even when the user collaborates with the adversary. In addition, we account for the influence of third parties on a user’s privacy. Third parties can help to break privacy by collaborating with the adversary, or can help to protect privacy by cooperating with the target user. We propose independency of privacy to capture the negative privacy impact that third parties can have, and coalition privacy to capture their positive privacy impact. We formally define these privacy notions in the applied pi calculus and build a hierarchy showing their relations."
Mining Malware Specifications through Static Reachability Analysis,"The number of malicious software (malware) is growing out of control. Syntactic signature based detection cannot cope with such growth and manual construction of malware signature databases needs to be replaced by computer learning based approaches. Currently, a single modern signature capturing the semantics of a malicious behavior can be used to replace an arbitrarily large number of old-fashioned syntactical signatures. However teaching computers to learn such behaviors is a challenge. Existing work relies on dynamic analysis to extract malicious behaviors, but such technique does not guarantee the coverage of all behaviors. To sidestep this limitation we show how to learn malware signatures using static reachability analysis. The idea is to model binary programs using pushdown systems (that can be used to model the stack operations occurring during the binary code execution), use reachability analysis to extract behaviors in the form of trees, and use subtrees that are common among the trees extracted from a training set of malware files as signatures. To detect malware we propose to use a tree automaton to compactly store malicious behavior trees and check if any of the subtrees extracted from the file under analysis is malicious. Experimental data shows that our approach can be used to learn signatures from a training set of malware files and use them to detect a test set of malware that is 10 times the size of the training set."
Patrol: Revealing Zero-Day Attack Paths through Network-Wide System Object Dependencies,"Identifying attack paths in enterprise network is strategically necessary and critical for security defense. However, there has been insufficient efforts in studying how to identify an attack path that goes through unknown security holes. In this paper, we define such attack paths as zero-day attack paths, and propose a prototype system named Patrol to identify them at runtime. Using system calls, Patrol builds a network-wide system object dependency graph that captures dependency relations between OS objects, and identifies suspicious intrusion propagation paths in it as candidate zero-day attack paths through forward and backward tracking from intrusion symptoms. Patrol further identifies highly suspicious candidates among these paths, by recognizing indicators of unknown vulnerability exploitations along the paths through rule-based checking. Our evaluation shows that Patrol can work accurately and effectively at runtime with an acceptable performance overhead."
Measuring and Detecting Malware Downloads in Live Network Traffic,"In this paper, we present AMICO, a novel system for measuring and detecting malware downloads in live web traffic. AMICO learns to distinguish between malware and benign file downloads from the download behavior of the network users themselves. Given a labeled dataset of past benign and malware file downloads, AMICO learns a provenance classifier that can accurately detect future malware downloads based on information about where the downloads originated from. The main intuition is that to avoid current countermeasures, malware campaigns need to use an “agile” distribution infrastructure, e.g., frequently changing the domains and/or IPs of the malware download servers. We engineer a number of statistical features that aim to capture these fundamental characteristics of malware distribution campaigns.We have deployed AMICO at the edge of a large academic network for almost nine months, where we continuously witness hundreds of new malware downloads per week, including many zero-days. We show that AMICO is able to accurately detect malware downloads with up to 90% true positives at a false positives rate of 0.1% and can detect zero-day malware downloads, thus providing an effective way to complement current malware detection tools."
Automated Certification of Authorisation Policy Resistance,"Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) extends traditional Access Control by considering an access request as a set of pairs attribute name-value, making it particularly useful in the context of open and distributed systems, where security relevant information can be collected from different sources. However, ABAC enables attribute hiding attacks, allowing an attacker to gain some access by withholding information.In this paper, we first introduce the notion of policy resistance to attribute hiding attacks. We then propose the tool ATRAP (Automatic Term Rewriting for Authorisation Policies), based on the recent formal ABAC language PTaCL, which first automatically searches for resistance counter-examples using Maude, and then automatically searches for an Isabelle proof of resistance. We illustrate our approach with two simple examples of policies and propose an evaluation of ATRAP performances."
Fine-Grained Access Control System Based on Outsourced Attribute-Based Encryption,"As cloud computing becomes prevalent, more and more sensitive data is being centralized into the cloud for sharing, which brings forth new challenges for outsourced data security and privacy. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a promising cryptographic primitive, which has been widely applied to design fine-grained access control system recently. However, ABE is being criticized for its high scheme overhead as the computational cost grows with the complexity of the access formula. This disadvantage becomes more serious for mobile devices because they have constrained computing resources.Aiming at tackling the challenge above, we present a generic and efficient solution to implement attribute-based access control system by introducing secure outsourcing techniques into ABE. More precisely, two cloud service providers (CSPs), namely key generation-cloud service provider (KG-CSP) and decryption-cloud service provider (D-CSP) are introduced to perform the outsourced key-issuing and decryption on behalf of attribute authority and users respectively. In order to outsource heavy computation to both CSPs without private information leakage, we formulize an underlying primitive called outsourced ABE (OABE) and propose several constructions with outsourced decryption and key-issuing. Finally, extensive experiment demonstrates that with the help of KG-CSP and D-CSP, efficient key-issuing and decryption are achieved in our constructions."
Purpose Restrictions on Information Use,"Privacy policies in sectors as diverse as Web services, finance and healthcare often place restrictions on the purposes for which a governed entity may use personal information. Thus, automated methods for enforcing privacy policies require a semantics of purpose restrictions to determine whether a governed agent used information for a purpose. We provide such a semantics using a formalism based on planning. We model planning using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), which supports an explicit model of information. We argue that information use is for a purpose if and only if the information is used while planning to optimize the satisfaction of that purpose under the POMDP model. We determine information use by simulating ignorance of the information prohibited by the purpose restriction, which we relate to noninterference. We use this semantics to develop a sound audit algorithm to automate the enforcement of purpose restrictions."
Distributed Shuffling for Preserving Access Confidentiality,"The shuffle index has been recently proposed for organizing and accessing data in outsourcing scenarios while protecting the confidentiality of the data as well as of the accesses to them. In this paper, we extend the shuffle index to the use of multiple servers for storing data, introducing a new protection technique (shadow) and enriching the original ones by operating in a distributed scenario. Our distributed shuffle index produces a significant increase in the protection of the system, with no additional costs."
Range Extension Attacks on Contactless Smart Cards,"The security of many near-field RFID systems such as credit cards, access control, e-passports, and e-voting, relies on the assumption that the tag holder is in close proximity to the reader. This assumption should be reasonable due to the fact that the nominal operation range of the RFID tag is only few centimeters. In this work we demonstrate a range extension setup which breaks this proximity assumption. Our system allows full communications with a near-field RFID reader from a range of 115cm – two orders of magnitude greater than nominal range – and uses power that can be supplied by a car battery. The added flexibility offered to an attacker by this range extension significantly improves the effectiveness and practicality of relay attacks on real-world systems."
CellFlood: Attacking Tor Onion Routers on the Cheap,"In this paper, we introduce a new Denial-of-Service attack against Tor Onion Routers and we study its feasibility and implications. In particular, we exploit a design flaw in the way Tor software builds virtual circuits and demonstrate that an attacker needs only a fraction of the resources required by a network DoS attack for achieving similar damage. We evaluate the effects of our attack on real Tor routers and we propose an estimation methodology for assessing the resources needed to attack any publicly accessible Tor node. Finally, we present the design and implementation of an effective solution to the problem that relies on cryptographic client puzzles, and we present results from its performance and effectiveness evaluation."
Nowhere to Hide: Navigating around Privacy in Online Social Networks,"In this paper, we introduce a navigation privacy attack, where an external adversary attempts to find a target user by exploiting publicly visible attributes of intermediate users. If such an attack is successful, it implies that a user cannot hide simply by excluding himself from a central directory or search function. The attack exploits the fact that most attributes (such as place of residence, age, or alma mater) tend to correlate with social proximity, which can be exploited as navigational cues while crawling the network. The problem is exacerbated by privacy policies where a user who keeps his profile private remains nevertheless visible in his friends’ “friend lists”; such a user is still vulnerable to our navigation attack. Experiments with Facebook and Google+ show that the majority of users can be found efficiently using our attack, if a small set of attributes are known about the target as side information. Our results suggest that, in an online social network where many users reveal a (even limited) set of attributes, it is nearly impossible for a specific user to “hide in the crowd”."
Current Events: Identifying Webpages by Tapping the Electrical Outlet,"Computers plugged into power outlets leak identifiable information by drawing variable amounts of power when performing different tasks. This work examines the extent to which this side channel leaks private information about web browsing to an observer taking measurements at the power outlet. Using direct measurements of AC power consumption with an instrumented outlet, we construct a classifier that correctly identifies unlabeled power traces of webpage activity from a set of 51 candidates with 99% precision and 99% recall. The classifier rejects samples of 441 pages outside the corpus with a false-positive rate of less than 2%. It is also robust to a number of variations in webpage loading conditions, including encryption. When trained on power traces from two computers loading the same webpage, the classifier correctly labels further traces of that webpage from either computer. We identify several reasons for this consistently recognizable power consumption, including system calls, and propose countermeasures to limit the leakage of private information. Characterizing the AC power side channel may help lead to practical countermeasures that protect user privacy from an untrustworthy power infrastructure."
Eliminating Cache-Based Timing Attacks with Instruction-Based Scheduling,"Information flow control allows untrusted code to access sensitive and trustworthy information without leaking this information. However, the presence of covert channels subverts this security mechanism, allowing processes to communicate information in violation of IFC policies. In this paper, we show that concurrent deterministic IFC systems that use time-based scheduling are vulnerable to a cache-based internal timing channel. We demonstrate this vulnerability with a concrete attack on Hails, one particular IFC web framework. To eliminate this internal timing channel, we implement instruction-based scheduling, a new kind of scheduler that is indifferent to timing perturbations from underlying hardware components, such as the cache, TLB, and CPU buses. We show this scheduler is secure against cache-based internal timing attacks for applications using a single CPU. To show the feasibility of instruction-based scheduling, we have implemented a version of Hails that uses the CPU retired-instruction counters available on commodity Intel and AMD hardware. We show that instruction-based scheduling does not impose significant performance penalties. Additionally, we formally prove that our modifications to Hails’ underlying IFC system preserve non-interference in the presence of caches."
Data-Confined HTML5 Applications,"Rich client-side applications written in HTML5 proliferate on diverse platforms, access sensitive data, and need to maintain data-confinement invariants. Applications currently enforce these invariants using implicit, ad-hoc mechanisms. We propose a new primitive called a data-confined sandbox or DCS. A DCS enables complete mediation of communication channels with a small TCB. Our primitive extends currently standardized primitives and has negligible performance overhead and a modest compatibility cost. We retrofit our design on four real-world HTML5 applications and demonstrate that a small amount of effort enables strong data-confinement guarantees."
KQguard: Binary-Centric Defense against Kernel Queue Injection Attacks,"Kernel callback queues (KQs) are the mechanism of choice for handling events in modern kernels. KQs have been misused by real-world malware to run malicious logic. Current defense mechanisms for kernel code and data integrity have difficulties with kernel queue injection (KQI) attacks, since they work without necessarily changing legitimate kernel code or data. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of KQguard, an efficient and effective protection mechanism of KQs. KQguard uses static and dynamic analysis of kernel and device drivers to learn the legitimate event handlers. At runtime, KQguard rejects all the unknown KQ requests that cannot be validated. We implement KQguard on the Windows Research Kernel (WRK) and Linux and extensive experimental evaluation shows that KQguard is efficient (up to ~5% overhead) and effective (capable of achieving zero false positives against representative benign workloads after appropriate training and very low false negatives against 125 real-world malware and nine synthetic attacks). KQguard protects 20 KQs in WRK, can accommodate new device drivers, and through dynamic analysis of binary code can support closed source device drivers."
Run-Time Enforcement of Information-Flow Properties on Android,"Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number and importance of mobile devices. The security properties that these devices provide to their applications, however, are inadequate to protect against many undesired behaviors. A broad class of such behaviors is violations of simple information-flow properties. This paper proposes an enforcement system that permits Android applications to be concisely annotated with information-flow policies, which the system enforces at run time. Information-flow constraints are enforced both between applications and between components within applications, aiding developers in implementing least privilege. We model our enforcement system in detail using a process calculus, and use the model to prove noninterference. Our system and model have a number of useful and novel features, including support for Android’s single- and multiple-instance components, floating labels, declassification and endorsement capabilities, and support for legacy applications. We have developed a prototype of our system on Android 4.0.4 and tested it on a Nexus S phone, verifying that it can enforce practically useful policies that can be implemented with minimal modification to off-the-shelf applications."
