SybilLimit: A Near-Optimal Social Network Defense against Sybil Attacks - IEEE Conference Publication,"Decentralized distributed systems such as peer-to-peer systems are particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks, where a malicious user pretends to have multiple identities (called sybil nodes). Without a trusted central authority, defending against sybil attacks is quite challenging. Among the small number of decentralized approaches, our recent SybilGuard protocol [H. Yu et al., 2006] leverages a key insight on social networks to bound the number of sybil nodes accepted. Although its direction is promising, SybilGuard can allow a large number of sybil nodes to be accepted. Furthermore, SybilGuard assumes that social networks are fast mixing, which has never been confirmed in the real world. This paper presents the novel SybilLimit protocol that leverages the same insight as SybilGuard but offers dramatically improved and near-optimal guarantees. The number of sybil nodes accepted is reduced by a factor of ominus(radicn), or around 200 times in our experiments for a million-node system. We further prove that SybilLimit's guarantee is at most a log n factor away from optimal, when considering approaches based on fast-mixing social networks. Finally, based on three large-scale real-world social networks, we provide the first evidence that real-world social networks are indeed fast mixing. This validates the fundamental assumption behind SybilLimit's and SybilGuard's approach."
Anonymous Networking with Minimum Latency in Multihop Networks - IEEE Conference Publication,"The problem of security against timing based traffic analysis in multihop networks is considered in this work. In particular, the relationship between the level of anonymity provided and the quality of service, as measured by network latency, is analyzed theoretically. Using an information theoretic measure of anonymity of routes in eavesdropped networks is considered, and packet scheduling strategies are designed to guarantee any desired level of anonymity. In particular, for individual relays, scheduling strategies based on mixing are designed so that the incoming and outgoing transmission epochs do not reveal any information. The proposed strategies utilize a limited fraction of dummy transmissions, and a significant reduction in packet latency at individual relays is demonstrated analytically for Poisson distributed arrivals. To minimize overall network latency, a randomized selection strategy is considered to choose the set of relays that use the designed scheduling strategies. The random selection is optimized for the desired level of anonymity using a well known distortion rate optimization in information theory. The tradeoff between overall network latency and anonymity in the network is characterized for centralized and decentralized scheduling strategies."
Spot Me if You Can: Uncovering Spoken Phrases in Encrypted VoIP Conversations - IEEE Conference Publication,"Despite the rapid adoption of Voice over IP (VoIP), its security implications are not yet fully understood. Since VoIP calls may traverse untrusted networks, packets should be encrypted to ensure confidentiality. However, we show that when the audio is encoded using variable bit rate codecs, the lengths of encrypted VoIP packets can be used to identify the phrases spoken within a call. Our results indicate that a passive observer can identify phrases from a standard speech corpus within encrypted calls with an average accuracy of 50%, and with accuracy greater than 90% for some phrases. Clearly, such an attack calls into question the efficacy of current VoIP encryption standards. In addition, we examine the impact of various features of the underlying audio on our performance and discuss methods for mitigation."
Preserving Caller Anonymity in Voice-over-IP Networks - IEEE Conference Publication,"Applications such as VoIP need to provide anonymity to clients while maintaining low latency to satisfy quality of service (QoS) requirements. Existing solutions for providing anonymity such as mix networks are not well suited to applications like VoIP, SSH, and gaming which require low communication latency. This paper investigates the problem of on-demand construction of QoS sensitive routes on anonymizing networks using the VoIP application. We first describe triangulation based timing analysis attacks on shortest path route set up protocols. We show that even when a small fraction (~1%) of the network is malicious, the adversary can infer the source (caller) with reasonably high probability. Second, we describe random walk based route set up protocols that significantly improve anonymity while satisfying latency- based QoS guarantees. We describe a prototype implementation of our proposal and show that our protocols can significantly reduce the probability of inferring the caller. We present a detailed experimental evaluation to demonstrate our attacks and quantify the performance and scalability of our guards."
Jamming-resistant Key Establishment using Uncoordinated Frequency Hopping - IEEE Conference Publication,"We consider the following problem: how can two devices that do not share any secrets establish a shared secret key over a wireless radio channel in the presence of a communication jammer? An inherent challenge in solving this problem is that known anti-jamming techniques (e.g., frequency hopping or direct-sequence spread spectrum) which should support device communication during the key establishment require that the devices share a secret spreading key (or code) prior to the start of their communication. This requirement creates a circular dependency between antijamming spread-spectrum communication and key establishment, which has so far not been addressed. In this work, we propose an uncoordinated frequency hopping (UFH) scheme that breaks this dependency and enables key establishment in the presence of a communication jammer. We perform a detailed analysis of our UFH scheme and show its feasibility, both in terms of execution time and resource requirements."
Casting out Demons: Sanitizing Training Data for Anomaly Sensors - IEEE Conference Publication,"The efficacy of anomaly detection (AD) sensors depends heavily on the quality of the data used to train them. Artificial or contrived training data may not provide a realistic view of the deployment environment. Most realistic data sets are dirty; that is, they contain a number of attacks or anomalous events. The size of these high-quality training data sets makes manual removal or labeling of attack data infeasible. As a result, sensors trained on this data can miss attacks and their variations. We propose extending the training phase of AD sensors (in a manner agnostic to the underlying AD algorithm) to include a sanitization phase. This phase generates multiple models conditioned on small slices of the training data. We use these \""micro- models\"" to produce provisional labels for each training input, and we combine the micro-models in a voting scheme to determine which parts of the training data may represent attacks. Our results suggest that this phase automatically and significantly improves the quality of unlabeled training data by making it as \""attack-free\"" and \""regular\"" as possible in the absence of absolute ground truth. We also show how a collaborative approach that combines models from different networks or domains can further refine the sanitization process to thwart targeted training or mimicry attacks against a single site."
Efficient and Robust TCP Stream Normalization - IEEE Conference Publication,"Network intrusion detection and prevention systems are vulnerable to evasion by attackers who craft ambiguous traffic to breach the defense of such systems. A normalizer is an inline network element that thwarts evasion attempts by removing ambiguities in network traffic. A particularly challenging step in normalization is the sound detection of inconsistent TCP retransmissions, wherein an attacker sends TCP segments with different payloads for the same sequence number space to present a network monitor with ambiguous analysis. Normalizers that buffer all unacknowledged data to verify the consistency of subsequent retransmissions consume inordinate amounts of memory on highspeed links. On the other hand, normalizers that buffer only the hashes of unacknowledged segments cannot verify the consistency of 20-30% of retransmissions that, according to our traces, do not align with the original transmissions. This paper presents the design of RoboNorm, a normalizer that buffers only the hashes of unacknowledged segments, and yet can detect all inconsistent retransmissions in any TCP byte stream. RoboNorm consumes 1-2 orders of magnitude less memory than normalizers that buffers all unacknowledged data, and is amenable to a high-speed implementation. RoboNorm is also robust to attacks that attempt to compromise its operation or exhaust its resources."
Robust De-anonymization of Large Sparse Datasets - IEEE Conference Publication,"We present a new class of statistical de- anonymization attacks against high-dimensional micro-data, such as individual preferences, recommendations, transaction records and so on. Our techniques are robust to perturbation in the data and tolerate some mistakes in the adversary's background knowledge. We apply our de-anonymization methodology to the Netflix Prize dataset, which contains anonymous movie ratings of 500,000 subscribers of Netflix, the world's largest online movie rental service. We demonstrate that an adversary who knows only a little bit about an individual subscriber can easily identify this subscriber's record in the dataset. Using the Internet Movie Database as the source of background knowledge, we successfully identified the Netflix records of known users, uncovering their apparent political preferences and other potentially sensitive information."
Pacemakers and Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators: Software Radio Attacks and Zero-Power Defenses - IEEE Conference Publication,"Our study analyzes the security and privacy properties of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Introduced to the U.S. market in 2003, this model of ICD includes pacemaker technology and is designed to communicate wirelessly with a nearby external programmer in the 175 kHz frequency range. After partially reverse-engineering the ICD's communications protocol with an oscilloscope and a software radio, we implemented several software radio-based attacks that could compromise patient safety and patient privacy. Motivated by our desire to improve patient safety, and mindful of conventional trade-offs between security and power consumption for resource-constrained devices, we introduce three new zero-power defenses based on RF power harvesting. Two of these defenses are human-centric, bringing patients into the loop with respect to the security and privacy of their implantable medical devices (IMDs). Our contributions provide a scientific baseline for understanding the potential security and privacy risks of current and future IMDs, and introduce human-perceptible and zero-power mitigation techniques that address those risks. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first in our community to use general-purpose software radios to analyze and attack previously unknown radio communications protocols."
Automatic Patch-Based Exploit Generation is Possible: Techniques and Implications - IEEE Conference Publication,"The automatic patch-based exploit generation problem is: given a program P and a patched version of the program P', automatically generate an exploit for the potentially unknown vulnerability present in P but fixed in P'. In this paper, we propose techniques for automatic patch-based exploit generation, and show that our techniques can automatically generate exploits for 5 Microsoft programs based upon patches provided via Windows Update. Although our techniques may not work in all cases, a fundamental tenant of security is to conservatively estimate the capabilities of attackers. Thus, our results indicate that automatic patch-based exploit generation should be considered practical. One important security implication of our results is that current patch distribution schemes which stagger patch distribution over long time periods, such as Windows Update, may allow attackers who receive the patch first to compromise the significant fraction of vulnerable hosts who have not yet received the patch."
Compromising Reflections-or-How to Read LCD Monitors around the Corner - IEEE Conference Publication,"We present a novel eavesdropping technique for spying at a distance on data that is displayed on an arbitrary computer screen, including the currently prevalent LCD monitors. Our technique exploits reflections of the screen's optical emanations in various objects that one commonly finds in close proximity to the screen and uses those reflections to recover the original screen content. Such objects include eyeglasses, tea pots, spoons, plastic bottles, and even the eye of the user. We have demonstrated that this attack can be successfully mounted to spy on even small fonts using inexpensive, off-the-shelf equipment (less than 1500 dollars) from a distance of up to 10 meters. Relying on more expensive equipment allowed us to conduct this attack from over 30 meters away, demonstrating that similar attacks are feasible from the other side of the street or from a close-by building. We additionally establish theoretical limitations of the attack; these limitations may help to estimate the risk that this attack can be successfully mounted in a given environment."
ClearShot: Eavesdropping on Keyboard Input from Video - IEEE Conference Publication,"Eavesdropping on electronic communication is usually prevented by using cryptography-based mechanisms. However, these mechanisms do not prevent one from obtaining private information through side channels, such as the electromagnetic emissions of monitors or the sound produced by keyboards. While extracting the same information by watching somebody typing on a keyboard might seem to be an easy task, it becomes extremely challenging if it has to be automated. However, an automated tool is needed in the case of long-lasting surveillance procedures or long user activity, as a human being is able to reconstruct only a few characters per minute. This paper presents a novel approach to automatically recovering the text being typed on a keyboard, based solely on a video of the user typing. As part of the approach, we developed a number of novel techniques for motion tracking, sentence reconstruction, and error correction. The approach has been implemented in a tool, called ClearShot, which has been tested in a number of realistic settings where it was able to reconstruct a substantial part of the typed information."
XFA: Faster Signature Matching with Extended Automata - IEEE Conference Publication,"Automata-based representations and related algorithms have been applied to address several problems in information security, and often the automata had to be augmented with additional information. For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite- state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several classes of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Using nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) to represent NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space- efficient but time-inefficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs. For our test set, XFAs use 10 times less memory than a DFA-based solution, yet achieve 20 times higher matching speeds."
Zero-Knowledge in the Applied Pi-calculus and Automated Verification of the Direct Anonymous Attestation Protocol - IEEE Conference Publication,We devise an abstraction of zero-knowledge protocols that is accessible to a fully mechanized analysis. The abstraction is formalized within the applied pi-calculus using a novel equational theory that abstractly characterizes the cryptographic semantics of zero-knowledge proofs. We present an encoding from the equational theory into a convergent rewriting system that is suitable for the automated protocol verifier ProVerif. The encoding is sound and fully automated. We successfully used ProVerif to obtain the first mechanized analysis of (a simplified variant of) the Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) protocol. This required us to devise novel abstractions of sophisticated cryptographic security definitions based on interactive games. The analysis reported a novel attack on DAA that was overlooked in its existing cryptographic security proof. We propose a revised variant of DAA that we successfully prove secure using ProVerif.
Towards Practical Privacy for Genomic Computation - IEEE Conference Publication,"Many basic tasks in computational biology involve operations on individual DNA and protein sequences. These sequences, even when anonymized, are vulnerable to re-identification attacks and may reveal highly sensitive information about individuals. We present a relatively efficient, privacy-preserving implementation of fundamental genomic computations such as calculating the edit distance and Smith- Waterman similarity scores between two sequences. Our techniques are crypto graphically secure and significantly more practical than previous solutions. We evaluate our prototype implementation on sequences from the Pfam database of protein families, and demonstrate that its performance is adequate for solving real-world sequence-alignment and related problems in a privacy- preserving manner. Furthermore, our techniques have applications beyond computational biology. They can be used to obtain efficient, privacy-preserving implementations for many dynamic programming algorithms over distributed datasets."
Lares: An Architecture for Secure Active Monitoring Using Virtualization - IEEE Conference Publication,"Host-based security tools such as anti-virus and intrusion detection systems are not adequately protected on today's computers. Malware is often designed to immediately disable any security tools upon installation, rendering them useless. While current research has focused on moving these vulnerable security tools into an isolated virtual machine, this approach cripples security tools by preventing them from doing active monitoring. This paper describes an architecture that takes a hybrid approach, giving security tools the ability to do active monitoring while still benefiting from the increased security of an isolated virtual machine. We discuss the architecture and a prototype implementation that can process hooks from a virtual machine running Windows XP on Xen. We conclude with a security analysis and show the performance of a single hook to be 28 musecs in the best case."
Practical Proactive Integrity Preservation: A Basis for Malware Defense - IEEE Conference Publication,"Unlike today's reactive approaches, information flow based approaches can provide positive assurances about overall system integrity, and hence can defend against sophisticated malware. However, there hasn't been much success in applying information flow based techniques to desktop systems running modern COTS operating systems. This is, in part, due to the fact that a strict application of information flow policy can break existing applications and OS services. Another important factor is the difficulty of policy development, which requires us to specify integrity labels for hundreds of thousands of objects on the system. This paper develops a new approach for proactive integrity protection that overcomes these challenges by decoupling integrity labels from access policies. We then develop an analysis that can largely automate the generation of integrity labels and policies that preserve the usability of applications in most cases. Evaluation of our prototype implementation on a Linux desktop distribution shows that it does not break or inconvenience the use of most applications, while stopping a variety of sophisticated malware attacks."
Preventing Memory Error Exploits with WIT - IEEE Conference Publication,"Attacks often exploit memory errors to gain control over the execution of vulnerable programs. These attacks remain a serious problem despite previous research on techniques to prevent them. We present write integrity testing (WIT), a new technique that provides practical protection from these attacks. WIT uses points-to analysis at compile time to compute the control-flow graph and the set of objects that can be written by each instruction in the program. Then it generates code instrumented to prevent instructions from modifying objects that are not in the set computed by the static analysis, and to ensure that indirect control transfers are allowed by the control-flow graph. To improve coverage where the analysis is not precise enough, WIT inserts small guards between the original program objects. We describe an efficient implementation with optimizations to reduce space and time overhead. This implementation can be used in practice because it compiles C and C++ programs without modifications, it has high coverage with no false positives, and it has low overhead. WIT's average runtime overhead is only 7% across a set of CPU intensive benchmarks and it is negligible when IO is the bottleneck."
Thinking Inside the Box: System-Level Failures of Tamper Proofing - IEEE Conference Publication,"PIN entry devices (PEDs) are critical security components in EMV smartcard payment systems as they receive a customer's card and PIN. Their approval is subject to an extensive suite of evaluation and certification procedures. In this paper, we demonstrate that the tamper proofing of PEDs is unsatisfactory, as is the certification process. We have implemented practical low-cost attacks on two certified, widely-deployed PEDs - the Ingenico 13300 and the Dione Xtreme. By tapping inadequately protected smartcard communications, an attacker with basic technical skills can expose card details and PINs, leaving cardholders open to fraud. We analyze the anti-tampering mechanisms of the two PEDs and show that, while the specific protection measures mostly work as intended, critical vulnerabilities arise because of the poor integration of cryptographic, physical and procedural protection. As these vulnerabilities illustrate a systematic failure in the design process, we propose a methodology for doing it better in the future. These failures also demonstrate a serious problem with the Common Criteria. So we discuss the incentive structures of the certification process, and show how they can lead to problems of the kind we identified. Finally we recommend changes to the Common Criteria framework in light of the lessons learned."
Cloaker: Hardware Supported Rootkit Concealment - IEEE Conference Publication,"Rootkits are used by malicious attackers who desire to run software on a compromised machine without being detected. They have become stealthier over the years as a consequence of the ongoing struggle between attackers and system defenders. In order to explore the next step in rootkit evolution and to build strong defenses, we look at this issue from the point of view of an attacker. We construct Cloaker, a proof-of-concept rootkit for the ARM platform that is non- persistent and only relies on hardware state modifications for concealment and operation. A primary goal in the design of Cloaker is to not alter any part of the host operating system (OS) code or data, thereby achieving immunity to all existing rootkit detection techniques which perform integrity, behavior and signature checks of the host OS. Cloaker also demonstrates that a self-contained execution environment for malicious code can be provided without relying on the host OS for any services. Integrity checks of hardware state in each of the machine's devices are required in order to detect rootkits such as Cloaker. We present a framework for the Linux kernel that incorporates integrity checks of hardware state performed by device drivers in order to counter the threat posed by rootkits such as Cloaker."
Predictable Design of Network-Based Covert Communication Systems - IEEE Conference Publication,"This paper presents a predictable and quantifiable approach to designing a covert communication system capable of effectively exploiting covert channels found in the various layers of network protocols. Two metrics are developed that characterize the overall system. A measure of probability of detection is derived using statistical inference techniques. A measure of reliability is developed as the bit error rate of the combined noisy channel and an appropriate error-correcting code. To support reliable communication, a family of error-correcting codes are developed that handle the high symbol insertion rates found in these covert channels. The system metrics are each shown to be a function of the covert channel signal-to-noise ratio, and as such the two can be used to perform system level design trade-offs. Validation of the system design methodology is provided by means of an experiment using real network traffic data."
Verifying the Safety of User Pointer Dereferences - IEEE Conference Publication,"Operating systems divide virtual memory addresses into kernel space and user space. The interface of a modern operating system consists of a set of system call procedures that may take pointer arguments called user pointers. It is safe to dereference a user pointer if and only if it points into user space. If the operating system dereferences a user pointer that does not point into user space, then a malicious user application could gain control of the operating system, reveal sensitive data from kernel space, or crash the machine. Because the operating system cannot trust user processes, the operating system must check that the user pointer points to user space before dereferencing it. In this paper, we present a scalable and precise static analysis capable of verifying the absence of unchecked user pointer dereferences. We evaluate an implementation of our analysis on the entire Linux operating system with over 6.2 million lines of code with false alarms reported on only 0.05% of dereference sites."
Expressive Declassification Policies and Modular Static Enforcement - IEEE Conference Publication,"This paper provides a way to specify expressive declassification policies, in particular, when, what, and where policies that include conditions under which downgrading is allowed. Secondly, an end-to-end semantic property is introduced, based on a model that allows observations of intermediate low states as well as termination. An attacker's knowledge only increases at explicit declassification steps, and within limits set by policy. Thirdly, static enforcement is provided by combining type-checking with program verification techniques applied to the small subprograms that carry out declassifications. Enforcement is proved sound for a simple programming language and the extension to object-oriented programs is described."
Civitas: Toward a Secure Voting System - IEEE Conference Publication,"Civitas is the first electronic voting system that is coercion-resistant, universally and voter verifiable, and suitable for remote voting. This paper describes the design and implementation of Civitas. Assurance is established in the design through security proofs, and in the implementation through information-flow security analysis. Experimental results give a quantitative evaluation of the tradeoffs between time, cost, and security."
Fable: A Language for Enforcing User-defined Security Policies - IEEE Conference Publication,"This paper presents FABLE, a core formalism for a programming language in which programmers may specify security policies and reason that these policies are properly enforced. In FABLE, security policies can be expressed by associating security labels with the data or actions they protect. Programmers define the semantics of labels in a separate part of the program called the enforcement policy. FABLE prevents a policy from being circumvented by allowing labeled terms to be manipulated only within the enforcement policy; application code must treat labeled values abstractly. Together, these features facilitate straightforward proofs that programs implementing a particular policy achieve their high-level security goals. FABLE is flexible enough to implement a wide variety of security policies, including access control, information flow, provenance, and security automata. We have implemented FABLE as part of the LINKS web programming language; we call the resulting language SELlNKS. We report on our experience using SELlNKS to build two substantial applications, a wiki and an on-line store, equipped with a combination of access control and provenance policies. To our knowledge, no existing framework enables the enforcement of such a wide variety of security policies with an equally high level of assurance."
Saner: Composing Static and Dynamic Analysis to Validate Sanitization in Web Applications - IEEE Conference Publication,"Web applications are ubiquitous, perform mission- critical tasks, and handle sensitive user data. Unfortunately, web applications are often implemented by developers with limited security skills, and, as a result, they contain vulnerabilities. Most of these vulnerabilities stem from the lack of input validation. That is, web applications use malicious input as part of a sensitive operation, without having properly checked or sanitized the input values prior to their use. Past research on vulnerability analysis has mostly focused on identifying cases in which a web application directly uses external input in critical operations. However, little research has been performed to analyze the correctness of the sanitization process. Thus, whenever a web application applies some sanitization routine to potentially malicious input, the vulnerability analysis assumes that the result is innocuous. Unfortunately, this might not be the case, as the sanitization process itself could be incorrect or incomplete. In this paper, we present a novel approach to the analysis of the sanitization process. More precisely, we combine static and dynamic analysis techniques to identify faulty sanitization procedures that can be bypassed by an attacker. We implemented our approach in a tool, called Saner, and we applied it to a number of real-world applications. Our results demonstrate that we were able to identify several novel vulnerabilities that stem from erroneous sanitization procedures."
Secure Web Browsing with the OP Web Browser - IEEE Conference Publication,"Current Web browsers are plagued with vulnerabilities, providing hackers with easy access to computer systems via browser-based attacks. Browser security efforts that retrofit existing browsers have had limited success because the design of modern browsers is fundamentally flawed. To enable more secure web browsing, we design and implement a new browser, called the OP Web browser, that attempts to improve the state-of-the-art in browser security. Our overall design approach is to combine operating system design principles with formal methods to design a more secure Web browser by drawing on the expertise of both communities. Our overall design philosophy is to partition the browser into smaller subsystems and make all communication between subsystems simple and explicit. At the core of our design is a small browser kernel that manages the browser subsystems and interposes on all communications between them to enforce our new browser security features. To show the utility of our browser architecture, we design and implement three novel security features. First, we develop novel and flexible security policies that allows us to include plugins within our security framework. Our policy removes the burden of security from plugin writers, and gives plugins the flexibility to use innovative network architectures to deliver content while still maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of our browser, even if attackers compromise the plugin. Second, we use formal methods to prove that the address bar displayed within our browser user interface always shows the correct address for the current Web page. Third, we design and implement a browser-level information-flow tracking system to enable post-mortem analysis of browser-based attacks. If an attacker is able to compromise our browser, we highlight the subset of total activity that is causally related to the attack, thus allowing users and system administrators to determine easily which Web site lead to the compromise and to assess the damage of a successful attack. To evaluate our design, we implemented OP and tested both performance and filesystem impact. To test performance, we measure latency to verify OP's performance penalty from security features are be minimal from a users perspective. Our experiments show that on average the speed of the OP browser is comparable to Firefox and the audit log occupies around 80 KB per page on average."
Automated Formal Analysis of a Protocol for Secure File Sharing on Untrusted Storage - IEEE Conference Publication,"We study formal security properties of a state-of-the-art protocol for secure file sharing on untrusted storage, in the automatic protocol verifier ProVerif. As far as we know, this is the first automated formal analysis of a secure storage protocol. The protocol, designed as the basis for the file system Plutus, features a number of interesting schemes like lazy revocation and key rotation. These schemes improve the protocol's performance, but complicate its security properties. Our analysis clarifies several ambiguities in the design and reveals some unknown attacks on the protocol. We propose corrections, and prove precise security guarantees for the corrected protocol."
