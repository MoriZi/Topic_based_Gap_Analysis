From Intrusion Detection to Software Design,"I believe the single most important reason why we are so helpless against cyber-attackers is that present systems are not supervisable. This opinion is developed in years spent working on network intrusion detection, both as academic and entrepreneur. I believe we need to start writing software and systems that are supervisable by design; in particular, we should do this for embedded devices. In this paper, I present a personal view on the field of intrusion detection, and conclude with some consideration on software design."
Justifying Security Measures — a Position Paper,There is a problem with the way we reason about problems in security. The justifications that we offer for many security measures reduce to unfalsifiable claims or circular statements. This position paper argues that reliance on less-than-solid arguments acts as a brake on progress in security.
The Once and Future Onion,"Onionsites are Internet sites accessed via protocols offering security protections beyond those provided by the usual protocols and infrastructure of the Internet, such as confidentiality of address lookup, and that significantly strengthen commonly offered protections; for example, their self-authenticating addresses preclude the kinds of certificate hijacks that have occurred against registered domain names. I will sketch the properties and design of onion services, including early history as well as recent developments. I will also describe integration of onionsites much more fully into conventional Internet sites in ways that promote their general widescale adoption."
Tightly Secure Ring-LWE Based Key Encapsulation with Short Ciphertexts,"We provide a tight security proof for an IND-CCA Ring-LWE based Key Encapsulation Mechanism that is derived from a generic construction of Dent (IMA Cryptography and Coding, 2003). Such a tight reduction is not known for the generic construction. The resulting scheme has shorter ciphertexts than can be achieved with other generic constructions of Dent or by using the well-known Fujisaki-Okamoto constructions (PKC 1999, Crypto 1999). Our tight security proof is obtained by reducing to the security of the underlying Ring-LWE problem, avoiding an intermediate reduction to a CPA-secure encryption scheme. The proof technique maybe of interest for other schemes based on LWE and Ring-LWE."
Tree-Based Cryptographic Access Control,"As more and more data is outsourced to third party servers, the enforcement of access control policies using cryptographic techniques becomes increasingly important. Enforcement schemes based on symmetric cryptography typically issue users a small amount of secret material which, in conjunction with public information, allows the derivation of decryption keys for all data objects for which they are authorized.We generalize the design of prior enforcement schemes by mapping access control policies to a graph-based structure. Unlike prior work, we envisage that this structure may be defined independently of the policy to target different efficiency goals; the key issue then is how best to map policies to such structures. To exemplify this approach, we design a space-efficient KAS based on a binary tree which imposes a logarithmic bound on the required number of derivations whilst eliminating public information. In the worst case, users may require more cryptographic material than in prior schemes; we mitigate this by designing heuristic optimizations of the mapping and show through experimental results that our scheme performs well compared to existing schemes."
Source Code Authorship Attribution Using Long Short-Term Memory Based Networks,"Machine learning approaches to source code authorship attribution attempt to find statistical regularities in human-generated source code that can identify the author or authors of that code. This has applications in plagiarism detection, intellectual property infringement, and post-incident forensics in computer security. The introduction of features derived from the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of source code has recently set new benchmarks in this area, significantly improving over previous work that relied on easily obfuscatable lexical and format features of program source code. However, these AST-based approaches rely on hand-constructed features derived from such trees, and often include ancillary information such as function and variable names that may be obfuscated or manipulated.In this work, we provide novel contributions to AST-based source code authorship attribution using deep neural networks. We implement Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models to automatically extract relevant features from the AST representation of programmers’ source code. We show that our models can automatically learn efficient representations of AST-based features without needing hand-constructed ancillary information used by previous methods. Our empirical study on multiple datasets with different programming languages shows that our proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance for source code authorship attribution on AST-based features, despite not leveraging information that was previously thought to be required for high-confidence classification."
Is My Attack Tree Correct?,Attack trees are a popular way to represent and evaluate potential security threats on systems or infrastructures. The goal of this work is to provide a framework allowing to express and check whether an attack tree is consistent with the analyzed system. We model real systems using transition systems and introduce attack trees with formally specified node labels. We formulate the correctness properties of an attack tree with respect to a system and study the complexity of the corresponding decision problems. The proposed framework can be used in practice to assist security experts in manual creation of attack trees and enhance development of tools for automated generation of attack trees.
Server-Aided Secure Computation with Off-line Parties,"Online social networks (OSNs) allow users to jointly compute on each other’s data (e.g., profiles, geo-locations, etc.). Privacy issues naturally arise in this setting due to the sensitive nature of the exchanged information. Ideally, nothing about a user’s data should be revealed to the OSN provider or non-friends, and even her friends should only learn the output of a specific computation. A natural approach for achieving these strong privacy guarantees is via secure multi-party computation (MPC). However, existing MPC-based approaches do not capture two key properties of OSN setting: Users does not need to be online while their friends query the OSN server on their data; and, once uploaded, user’s data can be repeatedly queried by the server on behalf of user’s friends. In this work, we present two concrete MPC constructions that achieve these properties. The first is an adaptation of garbled circuits that converts inputs under different keys to ones under the same key, and the second is based on 2-party mixed protocols and involves a novel 2-party re-encryption module. Using state- of-the-art cryptographic tools, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation of our schemes for two concrete use cases, overall validating their efficiency and efficacy in protecting privacy in OSNs."
We Are Family: Relating Information-Flow Trackers,"While information-flow security is a well-established area, there is an unsettling gap between heavyweight information-flow control, with formal guarantees yet limited practical impact, and lightweight tainting techniques, useful for bug finding yet lacking formal assurance. This paper proposes a framework for exploring the middle ground in the range of enforcement from tainting (tracking data flows only) to fully-fledged information-flow control (tracking both data and control flows). We formally illustrate the trade-offs between the soundness and permissiveness that the framework allows to achieve. The framework is deployed in a staged fashion, statically embedding a dynamic monitor, being parametric in security policies, as they do not need to be fixed until the final deployment. This flexibility facilitates a secure app store architecture, where the static stage of verification is performed by the app store and the dynamic stage is deployed on the client. To illustrate the practicality of the framework, we implement our approach for a core of Java and evaluate it on a use case with enforcing privacy policies in the Android setting. We also show how a state-of-the-art dynamic monitor for JavaScript can be easily adapted to implement our approach."
Labeled Homomorphic Encryption,"In privacy-preserving processing of outsourced data a Cloud server stores data provided by one or multiple data providers and then is asked to compute several functions over it. We propose an efficient methodology that solves this problem with the guarantee that a honest-but-curious Cloud learns no information about the data and the receiver learns nothing more than the results. Our main contribution is the proposal and efficient instantiation of a new cryptographic primitive called Labeled Homomorphic Encryption (labHE). The fundamental insight underlying this new primitive is that homomorphic computation can be significantly accelerated whenever the program that is being computed over the encrypted data is known to the decrypter and is not secret—previous approaches to homomorphic encryption do not allow for such a trade-off. Our realization and implementation of labHE targets computations that can be described by degree-two multivariate polynomials. As an application, we consider privacy preserving Genetic Association Studies (GAS), which require computing risk estimates from features in the human genome. Our approach allows performing GAS efficiently, non interactively and without compromising neither the privacy of patients nor potential intellectual property of test laboratories."
MTD CBITS: Moving Target Defense for Cloud-Based IT Systems,"The static nature of current IT systems gives attackers the extremely valuable advantage of time, as adversaries can take their time and plan attacks at their leisure. Although cloud infrastructures have increased the automation options for managing IT systems, the introduction of Moving Target Defense (MTD) techniques at the entire IT system level is still very challenging. The core idea of MTD is to make a system change proactively as a means to eliminating the asymmetric advantage the attacker has on time. However, due to the number and complexity of dependencies between IT system components, it is not trivial to introduce proactive changes without breaking the system or severely impacting its performance.In this paper, we present an MTD platform for Cloud-Based IT Systems (MTD CBITS), evaluate its practicality, and perform a detailed analysis of its security benefits. To the best of our knowledge MTD CBITS is the first MTD platform that leverages the advantages of a cloud-automation framework (ANCOR) that captures an IT system’s setup parameters and dependencies using a high-level abstraction. This allows our platform to make automated changes to the IT system, in particular, to replace running components of the system with fresh new instances. To evaluate MTD CBITS’ practicality, we present a series of experiments that show negligible (statistically non-significant) performance impacts. To evaluate effectiveness, we analyze the costs and security benefits of MTD CBITS using a practical attack window model and show how a system managed using MTD CBITS will increase attack difficulty."
Modular Verification of Protocol Equivalence in the Presence of Randomness,"Security protocols that provide privacy and anonymity guarantees are growing increasingly prevalent in the online world. The highly intricate nature of these protocols makes them vulnerable to subtle design flaws. Formal methods have been successfully deployed to detect these errors, where protocol correctness is formulated as a notion of equivalence (indistinguishably). The high overhead for verifying such equivalence properties, in conjunction with the fact that protocols are never run in isolation, has created a need for modular verification techniques. Existing approaches in formal modeling and (compositional) verification of protocols for privacy have abstracted away a fundamental ingredient in the effectiveness of these protocols, randomness. We present the first composition results for equivalence properties of protocols that are explicitly able to toss coins. Our results hold even when protocols share data (such as long term keys) provided that protocol messages are tagged with the information of which protocol they belong to."
Non-interactive Provably Secure Attestations for Arbitrary RSA Prime Generation Algorithms,"RSA public keys are central to many cryptographic applications; hence their validity is of primary concern to the scrupulous cryptographer. The most relevant properties of an RSA public key  (n, e)  depend on the factors of  n : are they properly generated primes? are they large enough? is  e  co-prime with    (n) ? etc. And of course, it is out of question to reveal  n ’s factors.Generic non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs can be used to prove such properties. However, NIZK proofs are not practical at all. For some very specific properties, specialized proofs exist but such ad hoc proofs are naturally hard to generalize.This paper proposes a new type of general-purpose compact non-interactive proofs, called attestations, allowing the key generator to convince any third party that  n  was properly generated. The proposed construction applies to any prime generation algorithm, and is provably secure in the Random Oracle Model.As a typical implementation instance, for a 138-bit security, verifying or generating an attestation requires  k=1024  prime generations. For this instance, each processed message will later need to be signed or encrypted 14 times by the final users of the attested moduli."
Reusing Nonces in Schnorr Signatures,"The provably secure Schnorr signature scheme is popular and efficient. However, each signature requires a fresh modular exponentiation, which is typically a costly operation. As the increased uptake in connected devices revives the interest in resource-constrained signature algorithms, we introduce a variant of Schnorr signatures that mutualises exponentiation efforts.Combined with precomputation techniques (which would not yield as interesting results for the original Schnorr algorithm), we can amortise the cost of exponentiation over several signatures: these signatures share the same nonce. Sharing a nonce is a deadly blow to Schnorr signatures, but is not a security concern for our variant.Our Scheme is provably secure, asymptotically-faster than Schnorr when combined with efficient precomputation techniques, and experimentally 2 to 6 times faster than Schnorr for the same number of signatures when using 1 MB of static storage."
WebPol: Fine-Grained Information Flow Policies for Web Browsers,"In the standard web browser programming model, third-party scripts included in an application execute with the same privilege as the application’s own code. This leaves the application’s confidential data vulnerable to theft and leakage by malicious code and inadvertent bugs in the third-party scripts. Security mechanisms in modern browsers (the same-origin policy, cross-origin resource sharing and content security policies) are too coarse to suit this programming model. All these mechanisms (and their extensions) describe whether or not a script can access certain data, whereas the meaningful requirement is to allow untrusted scripts access to confidential data that they need and to prevent the scripts from leaking data on the side. Motivated by this gap, we propose WebPol, a policy mechanism that allows a website developer to include fine-grained policies on confidential application data in the familiar syntax of the JavaScript programming language. The policies can be associated with any webpage element, and specify what aspects of the element can be accessed by which third-party domains. A script can access data that the policy allows it to, but it cannot pass the data (or data derived from it) to other scripts or remote hosts in contravention of the policy. To specify the policies, we expose a small set of new native APIs in JavaScript. Our policies can be enforced using any of the numerous existing proposals for information flow tracking in web browsers. We have integrated our policies into one such proposal that we use to evaluate performance overheads and to test our examples."
Verifying Constant-Time Implementations by Abstract Interpretation,"Constant-time programming is an established discipline to secure programs against timing attackers. Several real-world secure C libraries such as NaCl, mbedTLS, or Open Quantum Safe, follow this discipline. We propose an advanced static analysis, based on state-of-the-art techniques from abstract interpretation, to report time leakage during programming. To that purpose, we analyze source C programs and use full context-sensitive and arithmetic-aware alias analyses to track the tainted flows.We give semantic evidences of the correctness of our approach on a core language. We also present a prototype implementation for C programs that is based on the CompCert compiler toolchain and its companion Verasco static analyzer. We present verification results on various real-world constant-time programs and report on a successful verification of a challenging SHA-256 implementation that was out of scope of previous tool-assisted approaches."
Mirage: Toward a Stealthier and Modular Malware Analysis Sandbox for Android,"Nowadays, malware is affecting not only PCs but also mobile devices, which became pervasive in everyday life. Mobile devices can access and store personal information (e.g., location, photos, and messages) and thus are appealing to malware authors. One of the most promising approach to analyze malware is by monitoring its execution in a sandbox (i.e., via dynamic analysis). In particular, most malware sandboxing solutions for Android rely on an emulator, rather than a real device. This motivates malware authors to include runtime checks in order to detect whether the malware is running in a virtualized environment. In that case, the malicious app does not trigger the malicious payload. The presence of differences between real devices and Android emulators started an arms race between security researchers and malware authors, where the former want to hide these differences and the latter try to seek them out.In this paper we present Mirage, a malware sandbox architecture for Android focused on dynamic analysis evasion attacks. We designed the components of Mirage to be extensible via software modules, in order to build specific countermeasures against such attacks. To the best of our knowledge, Mirage is the first modular sandbox architecture that is robust against sandbox detection techniques. As a representative case study, we present a proof of concept implementation of Mirage with a module that tackles evasion attacks based on sensors API return values."
Zero Round-Trip Time for the Extended Access Control Protocol,"The Extended Access Control (EAC) protocol allows to create a shared cryptographic key between a client and a server. While originally used in the context of identity card systems and machine readable travel documents, the EAC protocol is increasingly adopted as a universal solution to secure transactions or for attribute-based access control with smart cards. Here we discuss how to enhance the EAC protocol by a so-called zero-round trip time (0RTT) mode. Through this mode the client can, without further interaction, immediately derive a new key from cryptographic material exchanged in previous executions. This makes the 0RTT mode attractive from an efficiency viewpoint such that the upcoming TLS 1.3 standard, for instance, will include its own 0RTT mode. Here we show that also the EAC protocol can be augmented to support a 0RTT mode. Our proposed EAC+0RTT protocol is compliant with the basic EAC protocol and adds the 0RTT mode smoothly on top. We also prove the security of our proposal according to the common security model of Bellare and Rogaway in the multi-stage setting."
Server-Supported RSA Signatures for Mobile Devices,"We propose a new method for shared RSA signing between the user and the server so that: (a) the server alone is unable to create valid signatures; (b) having the client’s share, it is not possible to create a signature without the server; (c) the server detects cloned client’s shares and blocks the service; (d) having the password-encrypted client’s share, the dictionary attacks cannot be performed without alerting the server; (e) the composite RSA signature “looks like” an ordinary RSA signature and verifies with standard crypto-libraries. We use a modification of the four-prime RSA scheme of Damgård, Mikkelsen and Skeltved from 2015, where the client and the server have independent RSA private keys. As their scheme is vulnerable to dictionary attacks, in our scheme, the client’s RSA private exponent is additively shared between server and client. Our scheme has been deployed and has over 200,000 users."
Verifiable Document Redacting,"In 2016, Naveh and Tromer introduced PhotoProof, a novel approach to image authentication based on cryptographic proofs. We here show how to simplify PhotoProof to get a protocol closely related to redactable signature schemes. From an authenticated breeder document, we only keep the necessary fields to prove what its owner wants to assert and black out all the others to remove sensitive data from the document. We efficiently instantiate our scheme and give implementation results that show its practicality."
Securing Data Analytics on SGX with Randomization,"Protection of data privacy and prevention of unwarranted information disclosure is an enduring challenge in cloud computing when data analytics is performed on an untrusted third-party resource. Recent advances in trusted processor technology, such as Intel SGX, have rejuvenated the efforts of performing data analytics on a shared platform where data security and trustworthiness of computations are ensured by the hardware. However, a powerful adversary may still be able to infer private information in this setting from side channels such as cache access, CPU usage and other timing channels, thereby threatening data and user privacy. Though studies have proposed techniques to hide such information leaks through carefully designed data-independent access paths, such techniques can be prohibitively slow on models with large number of parameters, especially when employed in a real-time analytics application. In this paper, we introduce a defense strategy that can achieve higher computational efficiency with a small trade-off in privacy protection. In particular, we study a strategy that adds noise to traces of memory access observed by an adversary, with the use of dummy data instances. We quantitatively measure privacy guarantee, and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and limitation of this randomization strategy, using classification and clustering algorithms. Our results show significant reduction in execution time overhead on real-world data sets, when compared to a defense strategy using only data-oblivious mechanisms."
DeltaPhish: Detecting Phishing Webpages in Compromised Websites,"The large-scale deployment of modern phishing attacks relies on the automatic exploitation of vulnerable websites in the wild, to maximize profit while hindering attack traceability, detection and blacklisting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that specifically leverages this adversarial behavior for detection purposes. We show that phishing webpages can be accurately detected by highlighting HTML code and visual differences with respect to other (legitimate) pages hosted within a compromised website. Our system, named DeltaPhish, can be installed as part of a web application firewall, to detect the presence of anomalous content on a website after compromise, and eventually prevent access to it. DeltaPhish is also robust against adversarial attempts in which the HTML code of the phishing page is carefully manipulated to evade detection. We empirically evaluate it on more than 5,500 webpages collected in the wild from compromised websites, showing that it is capable of detecting more than 99% of phishing webpages, while only misclassifying less than 1% of legitimate pages. We further show that the detection rate remains higher than 70% even under very sophisticated attacks carefully designed to evade our system."
Secure Authentication in the Grid: A Formal Analysis of DNP3: SAv5,"Most of the world’s power grids are controlled remotely. Their control messages are sent over potentially insecure channels, driving the need for an authentication mechanism. The main communication mechanism for power grids and other utilities is defined by an IEEE standard, referred to as DNP3; this includes the Secure Authentication v5 (SAv5) protocol, which aims to ensure that messages are authenticated. We provide the first security analysis of the complete DNP3: SAv5 protocol. Previous work has considered the message-passing sub-protocol of SAv5 in isolation, and considered some aspects of the intended security properties. In contrast, we formally model and analyse the complex composition of the protocol’s three sub-protocols. In doing so, we consider the full state machine, and the possibility of cross-protocol attacks. Furthermore, we model fine-grained security properties that closely match the standard’s intended security properties. For our analysis, we leverage the Tamarin prover for the symbolic analysis of security protocols.Our analysis shows that the core DNP3: SAv5 design meets its intended security properties. Notably, we show that a previously reported attack does not apply to the standard. However, our analysis also leads to several concrete recommendations for improving future versions of the standard."
Per-Session Security: Password-Based Cryptography Revisited,"Cryptographic security is usually defined as a guarantee that holds except when a bad event with negligible probability occurs, and nothing is guaranteed in that case. However, in settings where a failure can happen with substantial probability, one needs to provide guarantees even for the bad case. A typical example is where a (possibly weak) password is used instead of a secure cryptographic key to protect a session, the bad event being that the adversary correctly guesses the password. In a situation with multiple such sessions, a per-session guarantee is desired: any session for which the password has not been guessed remains secure, independently of whether other sessions have been compromised.Our contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a new, general technique for stating security guarantees that degrade gracefully and which could not be expressed with existing formalisms. Our method is simple, does not require new security definitions, and can be carried out in any simulation-based security framework (thus providing composability). Second, we apply our approach to revisit the analysis of password-based message authentication and of password-based (symmetric) encryption (PBE), investigating whether they provide strong per-session guarantees.In the case of PBE, one would intuitively expect a weak form of confidentiality, where a transmitted message only leaks to the adversary once the underlying password is guessed. Indeed, we show that PBE does achieve this weak confidentiality if an upper-bound on the number of adversarial password-guessing queries is known in advance for each session. However, such local restrictions appear to be questionable in reality and, quite surprisingly, we show that in a more realistic scenario the desired per-session confidentiality is unachievable."
AVR Processors as a Platform for Language-Based Security,"AVR processors are widely used in embedded devices. Hence, it is crucial for the security of such devices that cryptography on AVR processors is implemented securely. Timing-side-channel vulnerabilities and other possibilities for information leakage pose serious dangers to the security of cryptographic implementations. In this article, we propose a framework for verifying that AVR assembly programs are free from such vulnerabilities. In the construction of our framework, we exploit specifics of the 8-bit AVR architecture to make the static analysis of timing behavior reliable. We prove the soundness of our analysis against a formalization of the official AVR instruction-set specification."
A Better Composition Operator for Quantitative Information Flow Analyses,"Given a description of the quantitative information flow (qif) for components, how can we determine the qif of a system composed from components? We explore this fundamental question mathematically and provide an answer based on a new composition operator. We investigate its properties and prove that it generalises existing composition operators. We illustrate the results with a fresh look on Chaum’s dining cryptographers. We show that the new operator enjoys various convenient algebraic properties and that it is well-behaved under composition refinement."
Analyzing the Capabilities of the CAN Attacker,"The modern car is controlled by a large number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which communicate over a network of bus systems. One of the most widely used bus types is called Controller Area Network (CAN). Recent automotive hacking has shown that attacks with severe safety impact are possible when an attacker manages to gain access to a safety-critical CAN. In this paper, our goal is to obtain a more systematic understanding of the capabilities of the CAN attacker, which can support the development of security concepts for in-vehicle networks."
Automated Analysis of Equivalence Properties for Security Protocols Using Else Branches,"In this paper we present an extension of the AKISS protocol verification tool which allows to verify equivalence properties for protocols with else branches, i.e., disequality tests. While many protocols are represented as linear sequences or inputs, outputs and equality tests, the reality is often more complex. When verifying equivalence properties one needs to model precisely the error messages sent out when equality tests fail. While ignoring these branches may often be safe when studying trace properties this is not the case for equivalence properties, as for instance witnessed by an attack on the European electronic passport. One appealing feature of our approach is that our extension re-uses the saturation procedure which is at the heart of the verification procedure of AKISS as a black box, without need to modify it. As a result we obtain the first tool that is able verify equivalence properties for protocols that may use xor and else branches. We demonstrate the tool’s effectiveness on several case studies, including the AKA protocol deployed in mobile telephony."
Quantifying Web Adblocker Privacy,"Web advertisements, an integral part of today’s web browsing experience, financially support countless websites. Meaningful advertisements, however, require behavioral targeting, user tracking and profile fingerprinting that raise serious privacy concerns. To counter privacy issues and enhance usability, adblockers emerged as a popular way to filter web requests that do not serve the website’s main content. Despite their popularity, little work has focused on quantifying the privacy provisions of adblockers.In this paper, we develop a quantitative framework to compare the privacy provisions of adblockers objectively. For our methodology, we introduce several privacy metrics that capture not only the technical web architecture but also the underlying corporate institutions of the problem across time and geography.Using our framework, we quantify the web privacy implications of 12 ad-blocking software combinations and browser settings on 1000 websites on a daily basis over a timespan of three weeks (a total of 252’000 crawls). Our results highlight a significant difference among adblockers regarding filtering performance, in particular, affected by the applied configurations. Our experimental results confirm that our framework provides consistent results and hence can be used as a quantitative methodology to assess other configurations and adblockers further."
More Efficient Structure-Preserving Signatures - Or: Bypassing the Type-III Lower Bounds,"Structure-Preserving Signatures (SPSs) are an important cryptographic primitive that is useful for the design of modular cryptographic protocols. It has be shown that in the most efficient Type-III bilinear group setting such schemes have a lower bound of 3-element signatures, which must include elements from both base groups, and a verification overhead of at least 2 Pairing-Product Equations (PPEs). In this work we show how to circumvent these lower bounds by constructing more efficient schemes than existing optimal schemes. Towards this end, we first formally define the notion of Unilateral Structure-Preserving Signatures on Diffie-Hellman pairs (USPSDH) as Type-III SPS schemes with messages being Diffie-Hellman pairs and signatures being elements of one of the base groups, i.e. unilateral. We construct a number of new fully randomizable SPS schemes that are existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen-message attacks, and which yield signatures consisting of only 2 elements from the shorter base group, and which require only a single PPE for verification (not counting the cost of verifying the well-formedness of the message). Thus, our signatures are at least half the size of the best existing scheme for unilateral messages. Our first scheme has a feature that permits controlled randomizability which might be of independent interest. We also give various optimal strongly unforgeable one-time schemes with 1-element signatures, including a new scheme for unilateral messages that matches the best existing scheme in every respect. We prove optimality of our constructions by proving different lower bounds and giving some impossibility results. We also show how to extend our schemes to sign a vector of messages. Finally, we highlight how our schemes yield more efficient instantiations of various cryptographic protocols, including variants of attribute-based signatures and direct anonymous attestation, which is a protocol deployed in practice. Our results offer value along two fronts: On the theoretical side, our results serve as a workaround to bypass existing lower bounds. On the practical side, our constructions could lead to more efficient instantiations of various cryptographic protocols."
Adversarial Examples for Malware Detection,"Machine learning models are known to lack robustness against inputs crafted by an adversary. Such adversarial examples can, for instance, be derived from regular inputs by introducing minor—yet carefully selected—perturbations.In this work, we expand on existing adversarial example crafting algorithms to construct a highly-effective attack that uses adversarial examples against malware detection models. To this end, we identify and overcome key challenges that prevent existing algorithms from being applied against malware detection: our approach operates in discrete and often binary input domains, whereas previous work operated only in continuous and differentiable domains. In addition, our technique guarantees the malware functionality of the adversarially manipulated program. In our evaluation, we train a neural network for malware detection on the DREBIN data set and achieve classification performance matching state-of-the-art from the literature. Using the augmented adversarial crafting algorithm we then manage to mislead this classifier for 63% of all malware samples. We also present a detailed evaluation of defensive mechanisms previously introduced in the computer vision contexts, including distillation and adversarial training, which show promising results."
PerfWeb: How to Violate Web Privacy with Hardware Performance Events,"The browser history reveals highly sensitive information about users, such as financial status, health conditions, or political views. Private browsing modes and anonymity networks are consequently important tools to preserve the privacy not only of regular users but in particular of whistleblowers and dissidents. Yet, in this work we show how a malicious application can infer opened websites from Google Chrome in Incognito mode and from Tor Browser by exploiting hardware performance events (HPEs). In particular, we analyze the browsers’ microarchitectural footprint with the help of advanced Machine Learning techniques: k-th Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and in contrast to previous literature also Convolutional Neural Networks. We profile 40 different websites, 30 of the top Alexa sites and 10 whistleblowing portals, on two machines featuring an Intel and an ARM processor. By monitoring retired instructions, cache accesses, and bus cycles for at most 5 s we manage to classify the selected websites with a success rate of up to 86.3%. The results show that hardware performance events can clearly undermine the privacy of web users. We therefore propose mitigation strategies that impede our attacks and still allow legitimate use of HPEs."
Acoustic Data Exfiltration from Speakerless Air-Gapped Computers via Covert Hard-Drive Noise (‘DiskFiltration’),"In the past, it has been shown that malware can exfiltrate data from air-gapped (isolated) networks by transmitting ultrasonic signals via the computer’s speakers. However, such a communication relies on the availability of speakers on a computer. In this paper, we present ‘DiskFiltration’, a method to leak data from speakerless computers via covert acoustic signals emitted from its hard disk drive (HDD) (Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7lQXmSLiP8 or http://cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap). Although it is known that HDDs generate acoustical noise, it has never been studied in the context of a malicious covert-channel. Notably, the magnetic HDDs dominate the storage wars, and most PCs, servers, and laptops todays are installed with HDD drive(s). A malware installed on a compromised machine can generate acoustic emissions at specific audio frequencies by controlling the movements of the HDD’s actuator arm. Binary Information can be modulated over the acoustic signals and then be picked up by a nearby receiver (e.g., microphone, smartphone, laptop, etc.). We examine the HDD anatomy and analyze its acoustical characteristics. We also present signal generation and detection, and data modulation and demodulation algorithms. Based on our proposed method, we developed a transmitter and a receiver for PCs and smartphones, and provide the design and implementation details. We examine the channel capacity and evaluate it on various types of internal and external HDDs in different computer chassis and at various distances. With DiskFiltration we were able to covertly transmit data (e.g., passwords, encryption keys, and keylogging data) between air-gapped computers to a nearby receiver at an effective bit rate of 180 bits/min (10,800 bits/h)."
DOMPurify: Client-Side Protection Against XSS and Markup Injection,"To prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and related attacks, sanitation of untrusted content is usually performed either on the server side, or by client-side filters like XSS Auditor or NoScript. However, modern web applications (including mobile apps) may not be able to rely on these mechanisms any more since untrusted content may pass these filters as ciphertext or may completely be processed within the DOM of the browser/app.To cope with this problem, XSS sanitation within the Document Object Model (DOM) is required. This poses a novel technical challenge: A DOM-based sanitizer must rely on native JavaScript functions. However, in the DOM, any function or property can be overwritten, through a class of attacks called DOM Clobbering.We present a two-part solution: First we show how to embed any server or client side filtering technology securely into the DOM. Second, we give an example instantiation of an XSS filter which is highly efficient when implemented in Javascript. Both parts are combined into a working and battle-tested proof-of-concept implementation called DOMPurify."
Preventing DNS Amplification Attacks Using the History of DNS Queries with SDN,"Domain Name System (DNS) amplification attack is a sophisticated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack by sending a huge volume of DNS name lookup requests to open DNS servers with the source address spoofed as a victim host. However, from the point of view of an individual network resource such as DNS server and switch, it is not easy to mitigate such attacks because a distributed attack could be performed with multiple DNS servers and/or switches. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel security framework using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to store the history of DNS queries as an evidence to distinguish normal DNS responses from attack packets. Our evaluation results demonstrate that the network traffic for DNS amplification attack can completely be blocked under various network conditions without incurring a significant communication overhead."
A Traceability Analysis of Monero’s Blockchain,"Privacy and anonymity are important desiderata in the use of cryptocurrencies. Monero—a privacy centric cryptocurrency has rapidly gained popularity due to its unlinkability and untraceablity guarantees. It has a market capitalization of USD 290M. In this work, we quantify the efficacy of three attacks on Monero’s untraceability guarantee, which promises to make it hard to trace the origin of a received fund, by analyzing its blockchain data. To this end, we develop three attack routines and evaluate them on the Monero blockchain. Our results show that in 88% of cases, the origin of the funds can be easily determined with certainty. Moreover, we have compelling evidence that two of the attack routines also extend to Monero RingCTs—the second generation Monero that even hides the transaction amount. We further observe that over 98% of the results can in fact be obtained by a simple temporal analysis. In light of our findings, we discuss mitigations to strengthen Monero against these attacks. We shared our findings with the Monero development team and the general community. This has resulted into several discussions and proposals for fixes."
Multi-rate Threshold FlipThem,"A standard method to protect data and secrets is to apply threshold cryptography in the form of secret sharing. This is motivated by the acceptance that adversaries will compromise systems at some point; and hence using threshold cryptography provides a defence in depth. The existence of such powerful adversaries has also motivated the introduction of game theoretic techniques into the analysis of systems, e.g. via the FlipIt game of van Dijk et al. This work further analyses the case of FlipIt when used with multiple resources, dubbed FlipThem in prior papers. We examine two key extensions of the FlipThem game to more realistic scenarios; namely separate costs and strategies on each resource, and a learning approach obtained using so-called fictitious play in which players do not know about opponent costs, or assume rationality."
Practical Keystroke Timing Attacks in Sandboxed JavaScript,"Keystrokes trigger interrupts which can be detected through software side channels to reconstruct keystroke timings. Keystroke timing attacks use these side channels to infer typed words, passphrases, or create user fingerprints. While keystroke timing attacks are considered harmful, they typically require native code execution to exploit the side channels and, thus, may not be practical in many scenarios.In this paper, we present the first generic keystroke timing attack in sandboxed JavaScript, targeting arbitrary other tabs, processes and programs. This violates same-origin policy, HTTPS security model, and process isolation. Our attack is based on the interrupt-timing side channel which has previously only been exploited using native code. In contrast to previous attacks, we do not require the victim to run a malicious binary or interact with the malicious website. Instead, our attack runs in a background tab, possibly in a minimized browser window, displaying a malicious online advertisement. We show that we can observe the exact inter-keystroke timings for a user’s PIN or password, infer URLs entered by the user, and distinguish different users time-sharing a computer. Our attack works on personal computers, laptops and smartphones, with different operating systems and browsers. As a solution against all known JavaScript timing attacks, we propose a fine-grained permission model."
On-Demand Time Blurring to Support Side-Channel Defense,"Side-channel attacks are a serious threat to multi-tenant public clouds. Past work showed how secret information in one virtual machine (VM) can be leaked to another, co-resident VM using timing side channels. Recent defenses against timing side channels focus on reducing the degree of resource sharing. However, such defenses necessarily limit the flexibility with which resources are shared. In this paper, we propose a technique that dynamically adjusts the granularity of platform time sources, to interfere with timing side-channel attacks. Our proposed technique supposes an interface by which a VM can request the temporary coarsening of platform time sources as seen by all VMs on the platform, which the hypervisor can effect since it virtualizes accesses to those timers. We show that the VM-Function (VMFUNC) mechanism provides a low-overhead such interface, thereby enabling applications to adjust timer granularity with minimal overhead. We present a proof-of-concept implementation using a Xen hypervisor running Linux-based VMs on a cloud server using commodity Intel processors and supporting adjustment of the timestamp-counter (TSC) granularity. We evaluate our implementation and show that our scheme mitigates timing side-channel attacks, while introducing negligible performance penalties."
VuRLE: Automatic Vulnerability Detection and Repair by Learning from Examples,"Vulnerability becomes a major threat to the security of many systems. Attackers can steal private information and perform harmful actions by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities often remain undetected for a long time as they may not affect typical systems’ functionalities. Furthermore, it is often difficult for a developer to fix a vulnerability correctly if he/she is not a security expert. To assist developers to deal with multiple types of vulnerabilities, we propose a new tool, called VuRLE, for automatic detection and repair of vulnerabilities. VuRLE (1) learns transformative edits and their contexts (i.e., code characterizing edit locations) from examples of vulnerable codes and their corresponding repaired codes; (2) clusters similar transformative edits; (3) extracts edit patterns and context patterns to create several repair templates for each cluster. VuRLE uses the context patterns to detect vulnerabilities, and customizes the corresponding edit patterns to repair them. We evaluate VuRLE on 279 vulnerabilities from 48 real-world applications. Under 10-fold cross validation, we compare VuRLE with another automatic repair tool, LASE. Our experiment shows that VuRLE successfully detects 183 out of 279 vulnerabilities, and repairs 101 of them, while LASE can only detect 58 vulnerabilities and repair 21 of them."
Link-Layer Device Type Classification on Encrypted Wireless Traffic with COTS Radios,"In this work, we design and implement a framework, PrEDeC, which enables an attacker to violate user privacy by using the encrypted link-layer radio traffic to detect device types in a targeted environment. We focus on 802.11 traffic using WPA2 as security protocol. Data is collected by passive eavesdropping using COTS radios. PrEDeC (a) extracts features using temporal properties, size of encrypted payload, type and direction of wireless traffic (b) filters features to improve overall performance (c) builds a classification model to detect different device types. While designing PrEDeC, we experimentally record the traffic of 22 IoT devices and manually classify that data into 10 classes to train three machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, Decision Tree and SVM. We analyze the performance of the classifiers on different block sizes (set of frames) and find that a block size of 30k frames with Random Forest classifier shows above 90% accuracy. Additionally, we observe that a reduced set of 49 features gives similar accuracy but better efficiency as compared to taking an entire set of extracted features. We investigate the significance of these features for classification. We further investigated the number of frames and the amount time required to eavesdrop them in different traffic scenarios."
LeaPS: Learning-Based Proactive Security Auditing for Clouds,"Cloud security auditing assures the transparency and accountability of a cloud provider to its tenants. However, the high operational complexity implied by the multi-tenancy and self-service nature, coupled with the sheer size of a cloud, imply that security auditing in the cloud can become quite expensive and non-scalable. Therefore, a proactive auditing approach, which starts the auditing ahead of critical events, has recently been proposed as a promising solution for delivering practical response time. However, a key limitation of such approaches is their reliance on manual efforts to extract the dependency relationships among events, which greatly restricts their practicality and adoptability. In this paper, we propose a fully automated approach, namely LeaPS, leveraging learning-based techniques to extract dependency models from runtime events in order to facilitate the proactive security auditing of cloud operations. We integrate LeaPS to OpenStack, a popular cloud platform, and perform extensive experiments in both simulated and real cloud environments that show a practical response time (e.g., 6 ms to audit a cloud of 100,000 VMs) and a significant improvement (e.g., about 50% faster) over existing proactive approaches."
Identifying Multiple Authors in a Binary Program,"Knowing the authors of a binary program has significant application to forensics of malicious software (malware), software supply chain risk management, and software plagiarism detection. Existing techniques assume that a binary is written by a single author, which does not hold true in real world because most modern software, including malware, often contains code from multiple authors. In this paper, we make the first step toward identifying multiple authors in a binary. We present new fine-grained techniques to address the tougher problem of determining the author of each basic block. The decision of attributing authors at the basic block level is based on an empirical study of three large open source software, in which we find that a large fraction of basic blocks can be well attributed to a single author. We present new code features that capture programming style at the basic block level, our approach for identifying external template library code, and a new approach to capture correlations between the authors of basic blocks in a binary. Our experiments show strong evidence that programming styles can be recovered at the basic block level and it is practical to identify multiple authors in a binary."
Secure IDS Offloading with Nested Virtualization and Deep VM Introspection,"To securely execute intrusion detection systems (IDSes) for virtual machines (VMs), IDS offloading with VM introspection (VMI) is used. In semi-trusted clouds, however, IDS offloading inside an untrusted virtualized system does not guarantee that offloaded IDSes run correctly. Assuming a trusted hypervisor, secure IDS offloading has been proposed, but there are several drawbacks because the hypervisor is tightly coupled with untrusted management components. In this paper, we propose a system called V-Met, which offloads IDSes outside the virtualized system using nested virtualization. Since V-Met runs an untrusted virtualized system in a VM, the trusted computing base (TCB) is separated more clearly and strictly. V-Met can prevent IDSes from being compromised by untrusted virtualized systems and allows untrusted administrators to manage even the hypervisor. Furthermore, V-Met provides deep VMI for offloaded IDSes to obtain the internal state of target VMs inside the VM for running a virtualized system. We have implemented V-Met in Xen and confirmed that the performance of offloaded legacy IDSes was comparable to that in traditional IDS offloading."
Privacy Implications of Room Climate Data,"Smart heating applications promise to increase energy efficiency and comfort by collecting and processing room climate data. While it has been suspected that the sensed data may leak crucial personal information about the occupants, this belief has up until now not been supported by evidence.In this work, we investigate privacy risks arising from the collection of room climate measurements. We assume that an attacker has access to the most basic measurements only: temperature and relative humidity. We train machine learning classifiers to predict the presence and actions of room occupants. On data that was collected at three different locations, we show that occupancy can be detected with up to 93.5% accuracy. Moreover, the four actions reading, working on a PC, standing, and walking, can be discriminated with up to 56.8% accuracy, which is also far better than guessing (25%). Constraining the set of actions allows to achieve even higher prediction rates. For example, we discriminate standing and walking occupants with 95.1% accuracy. Our results provide evidence that even the leakage of such ‘inconspicuous’ data as temperature and relative humidity can seriously violate privacy."
Network Intrusion Detection Based on Semi-supervised Variational Auto-Encoder,"Network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) based on machine learning have been attracting much attention for its potential ability to detect unknown attacks that are hard for signature-based NIDSs to detect. However, acquisition of a large amount of labeled data that general supervised learning methods need is prohibitively expensive, and this results in making it hard for learning-based NIDS to become widespread in practical use.In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing semi-supervised learning, and propose a novel detection method that is realized by means of classification with the latent variable, which represents the causes underlying the traffic we observe. Our proposed model is based on Variational Auto-Encoder, unsupervised deep neural network, and its strength is a scalability to the amount of training data. We demonstrate that our proposed method can make the detection accuracy of attack dramatically improve by simply increasing the amount of unlabeled data, and, in terms of the false negative rate, it outperforms the previous work based on semi-supervised learning method, Laplacian regularized least squares which has cubic complexity in the number of training data records and is too inefficient to leverage a huge amount of unlabeled data."
No Sugar but All the Taste! Memory Encryption Without Architectural Support,"The protection of in situ data, typically require solutions that involve different kinds of encryption schemes. Even though the majority of these solutions prioritize the protection of cold data stored on secondary devices, it has been shown that sensitive information like passwords, secrets, and private data can be easily exfiltrated from main memory as well, by adversaries with physical access. As such, the protection of hot data that reside on main memory is equally important.In this paper, we aim to investigate whether it is possible to achieve memory encryption without any architectural support at a reasonable performance cost. In particular, we propose the first of its kind software-based memory encryption approach, which ensures that sensitive data will remain encrypted in main memory at all times. Our approach is based on commodity off-the-shelf hardware, and is totally transparent to legacy applications. To accommodate different applications needs, we have built two versions of main memory encryption: Full and Selective Memory Encryption. Additionally, we provide a new memory allocation library that allows programmers to manage granular sensitive memory regions according to the specific requirements of each application. We conduct an extensive quantitative evaluation and characterization of the overheads of our software-based memory encryption, using both micro-benchmarks and real-world application workloads. Our results show that the performance overheads due to memory encryption are tolerable in real-world network scenarios, below 17% for HTTP and 27% for HTTPS."
Inference-Proof Updating of a Weakened View Under the Modification of Input Parameters,"We treat a challenging problem of confidentiality-preserving data publishing: how to repeatedly update a released weakened view under a modification of the input parameter values, while continuously enforcing the confidentiality policy, i.e., without revealing a prohibited piece of information, neither for the updated view nor retrospectively for the previous versions of the view. In our semantically ambitious approach, a weakened view is determined by a two-stage procedure that takes three input parameters: (i) a confidentiality policy consisting of prohibitions in the form of pieces of information that the pertinent receiver of the view should not be able to learn, (ii) the assumed background knowledge of that receiver, and (iii) the actually stored relation instance, or the respective modification requests. Assuming that the receiver is aware of the specification of both the underlying view generation procedure and the proposed updating procedure and additionally of the declared confidentiality policy, the main challenge has been to block all meta-inferences that the receiver could make by relating subsequent views."
Preventing Advanced Persistent Threats in Complex Control Networks,"An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is an emerging attack against Industrial Control and Automation Systems, that is executed over a long period of time and is difficult to detect. In this context, graph theory can be applied to model the interaction among nodes and the complex attacks affecting them, as well as to design recovery techniques that ensure the survivability of the network. Accordingly, we leverage a decision model to study how a set of hierarchically selected nodes can collaborate to detect an APT within the network, concerning the presence of changes in its topology. Moreover, we implement a response service based on redundant links that dynamically uses a secret sharing scheme and applies a flexible routing protocol depending on the severity of the attack. The ultimate goal is twofold: ensuring the reachability between nodes despite the changes and preventing the path followed by messages from being discovered."
Shortfall-Based Optimal Placement of Security Resources for Mobile IoT Scenarios,"We present a method for computing the best provisioning of security resources for Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios characterized by a high degree of mobility. The security infrastructure is specified by a security resource allocation plan computed as the solution of an optimization problem that minimizes the risk of having IoT devices not monitored by any resource. Due the mobile nature of IoT devices, a probabilistic framework for modeling such scenarios is adopted. We adapt the concept of shortfall from economics as a risk measure and show how to compute and evaluate the quality of an allocation plan. The proposed approach fits well with applications such as vehicular networks, mobile ad-hoc networks, smart cities, or any IoT environment characterized by mobile devices that needs a monitoring infrastructure."
Boot Attestation: Secure Remote Reporting with Off-The-Shelf IoT Sensors,"A major challenge in computer security is about establishing the trustworthiness of remote platforms. Remote attestation is the most common approach to this challenge. It allows a remote platform to measure and report its system state in a secure way to a third party. Unfortunately, existing attestation solutions either provide low security, as they rely on unrealistic assumptions, or are not applicable to commodity low-cost and resource-constrained devices, as they require custom secure hardware extensions that are difficult to adopt across IoT vendors. In this work, we propose a novel remote attestation scheme, named Boot Attestation, that is particularly optimized for low-cost and resource-constrained embedded devices. In Boot Attestation, software integrity measurements are immediately committed to during boot, thus relaxing the traditional requirement for secure storage and reporting. Our scheme is very light on cryptographic requirements and storage, allowing efficient implementations, even on the most low-end IoT platforms available today. We also describe extensions for more flexible management of ownership and third party (public-key) attestation that may be desired in fully Internet-enabled devices. Our scheme is supported by many existing off-the-shelf devices. To this end, we review the hardware protection capabilities for a number of popular device types and present implementation results for two such commercially available platforms."
RingCT 2.0: A Compact Accumulator-Based (Linkable Ring Signature) Protocol for Blockchain Cryptocurrency Monero,"In this work, we initially study the necessary properties and security requirements of Ring Confidential Transaction (RingCT) protocol deployed in the popular anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. Firstly, we formalize the syntax of RingCT protocol and present several formal security definitions according to its application in Monero. Based on our observations on the underlying (linkable) ring signature and commitment schemes, we then put forward a new efficient RingCT protocol (RingCT 2.0), which is built upon the well-known Pedersen commitment, accumulator with one-way domain and signature of knowledge (which altogether perform the functions of a linkable ring signature). Besides, we show that it satisfies the security requirements if the underlying building blocks are secure in the random oracle model. In comparison with the original RingCT protocol, our RingCT 2.0 protocol presents a significant space saving, namely, the transaction size is independent of the number of groups of input accounts included in the generalized ring while the original RingCT suffers a linear growth with the number of groups, which would allow each block to process more transactions."
SePCAR: A Secure and Privacy-Enhancing Protocol for Car Access Provision,"We present an efficient secure and privacy-enhancing protocol for car access provision, named SePCAR. The protocol is fully decentralised and allows users to share their cars conveniently without sacrifising their security and privacy. It provides generation, update, revocation, and distribution mechanisms for access tokens to shared cars, as well as procedures to solve disputes and to deal with law enforcement requests, for instance in the case of car incidents. We prove that SePCAR meets its appropriate security and privacy requirements and that it is efficient: our practical efficiency analysis through a proof-of-concept implementation shows that SePCAR takes only 1.55 s for a car access provision."
Privacy-Preserving Decision Trees Evaluation via Linear Functions,"The combination of cloud-based computing paradigm and machine learning algorithms has enabled many complex analytic services, such as face recognition in a crowd or valuation of immovable properties. Companies can charge clients who do not have the expertise or resource to build such complex models for the prediction or classification service. In this work, we focus on machine learning classification with decision tree (or random forests) as the analytic model, which is popular for its effectiveness and simplicity. We propose privacy-preserving decision tree evaluation protocols which hide the sensitive inputs (model and query) from the counterparty. Comparing with the state-of-the-art, we made a significant improvement in efficiency by cleverly exploiting the structure of decision trees, which avoids an exponential number of encryptions in the depth of the decision tree. Our experiment results show that our protocols are especially efficient for deep but sparse decision trees, which are typical for classification models trained from real datasets, ranging from cancer diagnosis to spam classification."
Stringer: Measuring the Importance of Static Data Comparisons to Detect Backdoors and Undocumented Functionality,"Finding undocumented functionality in commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) device firmware is an important and challenging task. This paper proposes a new static analysis method that measures the influence individual pieces of static data (such as strings) have upon the control flow of binaries in firmware. Our method automatically identifies static data comparison functions within binaries, then labels each function’s basic blocks with the set of sequences of static data that must be matched against to reach them. Then using these sets, it assigns a score to each function, which measures the extent to which the function’s branching is influenced by static data. Special keywords triggering backdoor functionality will have a large impact on the program flow. This allows us to identify three authentication backdoors – two of which previously undocumented. Moreover, we show our method is effective in aiding the recovery of both previously known and proprietary text-based protocols. We have developed a tool, Stringer which implements our technique; we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach as well as its applicability to lightweight analysis by running it on a data set of 2,451,532 binaries from 30 different COTS device vendors."
