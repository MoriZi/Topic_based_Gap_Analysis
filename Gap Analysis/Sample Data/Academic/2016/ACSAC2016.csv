Formal security analysis of smart embedded systems,"Smart embedded systems are core components of Internet of Things (IoT). Many vulnerabilities and attacks have been discovered against different classes of IoT devices. Therefore, developing a systematic mechanism to analyze the security of smart embedded systems will help developers discover new attacks, and improve the design and implementation of the system. In this paper, we formally model the functionalitiy of smart meters, as an example of a widely used smart embedded device, using rewriting logic. We also define a formal set of actions for attackers. Our formal model enables us to automatically analyze the system, and using model-checking, find all the sequences of attacker actions that transition the system to any undesirable state. We evaluate the analysis results of our model on a real smart meter, and find that a sizeable set of the attacks found by the model can be applied to the smart meter, using only inexpensive, commodity off-the-shelf hardware."
An ultra-lightweight white-box encryption scheme for securing resource-constrained IoT devices,"Embedded devices with constrained computational resources, such as wireless sensor network nodes, electronic tag readers, roadside units in vehicular networks, and smart watches and wristbands, are widely used in the Internet of Things. Many of such devices are deployed in untrustable environments, and others may be easy to lose, leading to possible capture by adversaries. Accordingly, in the context of security research, these devices are running in the white-box attack context, where the adversary may have total visibility of the implementation of the built-in cryptosystem with full control over its execution. It is undoubtedly a significant challenge to deal with attacks from a powerful adversary in white-box attack contexts. Existing encryption algorithms for white-box attack contexts typically require large memory use, varying from one to dozens of megabytes, and thus are not suitable for resource-constrained devices. As a countermeasure in such circumstances, we propose an ultra-lightweight encryption scheme for protecting the confidentiality of data in white-box attack contexts. The encryption is executed with secret components specialized for resource-constrained devices against white-box attacks, and the encryption algorithm requires a relatively small amount of static data, ranging from 48 to 92 KB. The security and efficiency of the proposed scheme have been theoretically analyzed with positive results, and experimental evaluations have indicated that the scheme satisfies the resource constraints in terms of limited memory use and low computational cost."
A multi-cloud based privacy-preserving data publishing scheme for the internet of things,"With the increased popularity of ubiquitous computing and connectivity, the Internet of Things (IoT) also introduces new vulnerabilities and attack vectors. While secure data collection (i.e. the upward link) has been well studied in the literature, secure data dissemination (i.e. the downward link) remains an open problem. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) and outsourced-ABE has been used for secure message distribution in IoT, however, existing mechanisms suffer from extensive computation and/or privacy issues. In this paper, we explore the problem of privacy-preserving targeted broadcast in IoT. We propose two multi-cloud-based outsourced-ABE schemes, namely the parallel-cloud ABE and the chain-cloud ABE, which enable the receivers to partially outsource the computationally expensive decryption operations to the clouds, while preventing user attributes from being disclosed. In particular, the proposed solution protects three types of privacy (i.e., data, attribute and access policy privacy) by enforcing collaborations among multiple clouds. Our schemes also provide delegation verifiability that allows the receivers to verify whether the clouds have faithfully performed the outsourced operations. We extensively analyze the security guarantees of the proposed mechanisms and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our schemes with simulated resource-constrained IoT devices, which outsource operations to Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure."
ELAR,"Cloud storage has been gaining in popularity as an on-line service for archiving, backup, and even primary storage of files. However, due to the data outsourcing, cloud storage also introduces new security challenges, which require a data audit and data repair service to ensure data availability and data integrity in the cloud. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a network-coding-based Proof Of Retrievability scheme called ELAR, which achieves a lightweight data auditing and data repairing. In particular, we support direct repair mechanism in which the client can be free from the data repair process. Simultaneously, we also support the task of allowing a third party auditor (TPA), on behalf of the client, to verify the availability and integrity of the data stored in the cloud servers without the need of an asymmetric-key setting. The client is thus also free from the data audit process. TPA uses spot-checking which is a very efficient probabilistic method for checking a large amount of data. Extensive security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme is highly efficient and provably secure."
Pileus,"Cloud computing platforms are now constructed as distributed, modular systems of cloud services, which enable cloud users to manage their cloud resources. However, in current cloud platforms, cloud services fully trust each other, so a malicious user may exploit a vulnerability in a cloud service to obtain unauthorized access to another user's data. To date, over 150 vulnerabilities have been reported in cloud services in the OpenStack cloud. Research efforts in cloud security have focused primarily on attacks originating from user VMs or compromised operating systems rather than threats caused by the compromise of distributed cloud services, leaving cloud users open to attacks from these vulnerable cloud services. In this paper, we propose the Pileus cloud service architecture, which isolates each user's cloud operations to prevent vulnerabilities in cloud services from enabling malicious users to gain unauthorized access. Pileus deploys stateless cloud services ""on demand"" to service each user's cloud operations, limiting cloud services to the permissions of individual users. Pileus leverages the decentralized information flow control (DIFC) model for permission management, but the Pileus design addresses special challenges in the cloud environment to: (1) restrict how cloud services may be allowed to make security decisions; (2) select trustworthy nodes for access enforcement in a dynamic, distributed environment; and (3) limit the set of nodes a user must trust to service each operation. We have ported the OpenStack cloud platform to Pileus, finding that we can systematically prevent compromised cloud services from attacking other users' cloud operations with less than 3% additional latency for the operation. Application of the Pileus architecture to Open-Stack shows that confined cloud services can service users' cloud operations effectively for a modest overhead."
Bootstrapping and maintaining trust in the cloud,"Today's infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud environments rely upon full trust in the provider to secure applications and data. Cloud providers do not offer the ability to create hardware-rooted cryptographic identities for IaaS cloud resources or sufficient information to verify the integrity of systems. Trusted computing protocols and hardware like the TPM have long promised a solution to this problem. However, these technologies have not seen broad adoption because of their complexity of implementation, low performance, and lack of compatibility with virtualized environments. In this paper we introduce keylime, a scalable trusted cloud key management system. keylime provides an end-to-end solution for both bootstrapping hardware rooted cryptographic identities for IaaS nodes and for system integrity monitoring of those nodes via periodic attestation. We support these functions in both bare-metal and virtualized IaaS environments using a virtual TPM. keylime provides a clean interface that allows higher level security services like disk encryption or configuration management to leverage trusted computing without being trusted computing aware. We show that our bootstrapping protocol can derive a key in less than two seconds, we can detect system integrity violations in as little as 110ms, and that keylime can scale to thousands of IaaS cloud nodes."
Decomposition of MAC address structure for granular device inference,"Common among the wide variety of ubiquitous networked devices in modern use is wireless 802.11 connectivity. The MAC addresses of these devices are visible to a passive adversary, thereby presenting security and privacy threats - even when link or application-layer encryption is employed. While it is well-known that the most significant three bytes of a MAC address, the OUI, coarsely identify a device's manufacturer, we seek to better understand the ways in which the remaining low-order bytes are allocated in practice. From a collection of more than two billion 802.11 frames observed in the wild, we extract device and model information details for over 285K devices, as leaked by various management frames and discovery protocols. From this rich dataset, we characterize overall device populations and densities, vendor address allocation policies and utilization, OUI sharing among manufacturers, discover unique models occurring in multiple OUIs, and map contiguous address blocks to specific devices. Our mapping thus permits fine-grained device type and model predictions for unknown devices solely on the basis of their MAC address. We validate our inferences on both ground-truth data and a third-party dataset, where we obtain high accuracy. Our results empirically demonstrate the extant structure of the low-order MAC bytes due to manufacturer's sequential allocation policies, and the security and privacy concerns therein."
Timing-based reconnaissance and defense in software-defined networks,"Software-defined Networking (SDN) enables advanced network applications by separating a network into a data plane that forwards packets and a control plane that computes and installs forwarding rules into the data plane. Many SDN applications rely on dynamic rule installation, where the control plane processes the first few packets of each traffic flow and then installs a dynamically computed rule into the data plane to forward the remaining packets. Control plane processing adds delay, as the switch must forward each packet and meta-information to a (often centralized) control server and wait for a response specifying how to handle the packet. The amount of delay the control plane imposes depends on its load, and the applications and protocols it runs. In this work, we develop a non- intrusive timing attack that exploits this property to learn about a SDN network's configuration. The attack analyzes the amount of delay added to timing pings that are specially crafted to invoke the control plane, while transmitting other packets that may invoke the control plane, depending on the network's configuration. We show, in a testbed with physical OpenFlow switches and controllers, that an attacker can probe the network at a low rate for short periods of time to learn a bevy of sensitive information about networks with > 99% accuracy, including host communication patterns, ACL entries, and network monitoring settings. We also implement and test a practical defense: a timeout proxy, which normalizes control plane delay by providing configurable default responses to control plane requests that take too long. The proxy can be deployed on unmodified OpenFlow switches. It reduced the attack accuracy to below 50% in experiments, and can be configured to have minimal impact on non-attack traffic."
RevProbe,"Web service operators set up reverse proxies to interpose the communication between clients and origin servers for load-balancing traffic across servers, caching content, and filtering attacks. Silent reverse proxies, which do not reveal their proxy role to the client, are of particular interest since malicious infrastructures can use them to hide the existence of the origin servers, adding an indirection layer that helps protecting origin servers from identification and take-downs."
Life-experience passwords (LEPs),"Passwords are widely used for user authentication, but they are often difficult for a user to recall, easily cracked by automated programs and heavily reused. Security questions are also used for secondary authentication. They are more memorable than passwords, but are very easily guessed. We propose a new authentication mechanism, called ""life-experience passwords (LEPs),"" which outperforms passwords and security questions, both at recall and at security. Each LEP consists of several facts about a user-chosen past experience, such as a trip, a graduation, a wedding, etc. At LEP creation, the system extracts these facts from the user's input and transforms them into questions and answers. At authentication, the system prompts the user with questions and matches her answers with the stored ones."
Using image saliency and regions of interest to encourage stronger graphical passwords,"A graphical password guiding image serves as a visual prompt to improve password memorability. However, passwords may be easily guessed if the guiding image contains hotspots, or commonly chosen (e.g., 'clickable') points that are predictable via automated means. In this paper, we propose a method to determine graphical password guiding image suitability in terms of potential password strength. Our method uses image saliency to measure image suitability; the higher the saliency, the more suitable the image. Next, we evaluate the regions of interest (e.g., circles, faces, corners, etc.) of suitable images to predict the strength of resultant graphical passwords. We provide support for our method in two ways: first, we analyzed the guiding images and resulting graphical password strength from an existing dataset and secondly, we conducted our own user study to measure the usability and memorability of the same guiding images in terms of registration, login and recall times. We found that the more visually salient the image, the stronger the resulting graphical passwords in terms of entropy with little or no effect on usability and memorability. Furthermore, users tended to select more suitable images even when given the choice of less suitable images. Thus, our approach may be used to improve the strength of graphical passwords before the user chooses a single point or action simply by excluding unsuitable guiding images."
CPAC,"Critical infrastructure such as the power grid has become increasingly complex. The addition of computing elements to traditional physical components increases complexity and hampers insight into how elements in the system interact with each other. The result is an infrastructure where operational mistakes, some of which cannot be distinguished from attacks, are more difficult to prevent and have greater potential impact, such as leaking sensitive information to the operator or attacker. In this paper, we present CPAC, a cyber-physical access control solution to manage complexity and mitigate threats in cyber-physical environments, with a focus on the electrical smart grid. CPAC uses information flow analysis based on mathematical models of the physical grid to generate policies enforced through verifiable logic. At the device side, CPAC combines symbolic execution with lightweight dynamic execution monitoring to allow non-intrusive taint analysis on programmable logic controllers in realtime. These components work together to provide a realtime view of all system elements, and allow for more robust and finer-grained protections than any previous solution to securing the grid. We implement a prototype of CPAC using Bachmann PLCs and evaluate several real-world incidents that demonstrate its scalability and effectiveness. The policy checking for a nation-wide grid is less than 150 ms, faster than existing solutions. We additionally show that CPAC can analyze potential component failures for arbitrary component failures, far beyond the capabilities of currently deployed systems. CPAC thus provides a solution to secure the modern smart grid from operator mistakes or insider attacks, maintain operational privacy, and support N - x contingencies."
Catching predators at watering holes,"Unlike a random, run-of-the-mill website infection, in a strategic web attack, the adversary carefully chooses the target frequently visited by an organization or a group of individuals to compromise, for the purpose of gaining a step closer to the organization or collecting information from the group. This type of attacks, called ""watering hole"", have been increasingly utilized by APT actors to get into the internal networks of big companies and government agencies or monitor politically oriented groups. With its importance, little has been done so far to understand how the attack works, not to mention any concrete step to counter this threat."
The Achilles heel of OAuth,"Websites and mobile applications today increasingly utilize OAuth for authorization and authentication. Major companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter all provide OAuth services. The usage of OAuth for authorization is well documented and has been studied by many researchers. However, little work has been done to specify or analyze the usage of OAuth for authentication. Given that many developers have employed OAuth for authentication on multiple platforms, we believe it is imperative to conduct a study to understand how developers customize OAuth for authentication on different platforms."
Adaptive encrypted traffic fingerprinting with bi-directional dependence,"Recently, network traffic analysis has been increasingly used in various applications including security, targeted advertisements, and network management. However, data encryption performed on network traffic poses a challenge to these analysis techniques. In this paper, we present a novel method to extract characteristics from encrypted traffic by utilizing data dependencies that occur over sequential transmissions of network packets. Furthermore, we explore the temporal nature of encrypted traffic and introduce an adaptive model that considers changes in data content over time. We evaluate our analysis on two packet encrypted applications: website fingerprinting and mobile application (app) fingerprinting. Our evaluation shows how the proposed approach outperforms previous works especially in the open-world scenario and when defense mechanisms are considered."
Code obfuscation against symbolic execution attacks,"Code obfuscation is widely used by software developers to protect intellectual property, and malware writers to hamper program analysis. However, there seems to be little work on systematic evaluations of effectiveness of obfuscation techniques against automated program analysis. The result is that we have no methodical way of knowing what kinds of automated analyses an obfuscation method can withstand."
VulPecker,"Software vulnerabilities are the fundamental cause of many attacks. Even with rapid vulnerability patching, the problem is more complicated than it looks. One reason is that instances of the same vulnerability may exist in multiple software copies that are difficult to track in real life (e.g., different versions of libraries and applications). This calls for tools that can automatically search for vulnerable software with respect to a given vulnerability. In this paper, we move a step forward in this direction by presenting Vulnerability Pecker (VulPecker), a system for automatically detecting whether a piece of software source code contains a given vulnerability or not. The key insight underlying VulPecker is to leverage (i) a set of features that we define to characterize patches, and (ii) code-similarity algorithms that have been proposed for various purposes, while noting that no single code-similarity algorithm is effective for all kinds of vulnerabilities. Experiments show that VulPecker detects 40 vulnerabilities that are not published in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Among these vulnerabilities, 18 are not known for their existence and have yet to be confirmed by vendors at the time of writing (these vulnerabilities are ""anonymized"" in the present paper for ethical reasons), and the other 22 vulnerabilities have been ""silently"" patched by the vendors in the later releases of the vulnerable products."
EvilCoder,"The art of finding software vulnerabilities has been covered extensively in the literature and there is a huge body of work on this topic. In contrast, the intentional insertion of exploitable, security-critical bugs has received little (public) attention yet. Wanting more bugs seems to be counterproductive at first sight, but the comprehensive evaluation of bug-finding techniques suffers from a lack of ground truth and the scarcity of bugs."
On the (in)security of the latest generation implantable cardiac defibrillators and how to secure them,"Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) typically use proprietary protocols with no or limited security to wirelessly communicate with a device programmer. These protocols enable doctors to carry out critical functions, such as changing the IMD's therapy or collecting telemetry data, without having to perform surgery on the patient. In this paper, we fully reverse-engineer the proprietary communication protocol between a device programmer and the latest generation of a widely used Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) which communicate over a long-range RF channel (from two to five meters). For this we follow a black-box reverse-engineering approach and use inexpensive Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment. We demonstrate that reverse-engineering is feasible by a weak adversary who has limited resources and capabilities without physical access to the devices. Our analysis of the proprietary protocol results in the identification of several protocol and implementation weaknesses. Unlike previous studies, which found no security measures, this article discovers the first known attempt to obfuscate the data that is transmitted over the air. Furthermore, we conduct privacy and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and give evidence of other attacks that can compromise the patient's safety. All these attacks can be performed without needing to be in close proximity to the patient. We validate that our findings apply to (at least) 10 types of ICDs that are currently on the market. Finally, we propose several practical short- and long-term countermeasures to mitigate or prevent existing vulnerabilities."
Multi-receiver GPS spoofing detection,"Spoofing is a serious threat to the widespread use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) such as GPS and can be expected to play an important role in the security of many future IoT systems that rely on time, location, or navigation information. In this paper, we focus on the technique of multi-receiver GPS spoofing detection, so far only proposed theoretically. This technique promises to detect malicious spoofing signals by making use of the reported positions of several GPS receivers deployed in a fixed constellation."
Location-enhanced authentication using the IoT,"User location can act as an additional factor of authentication in scenarios where physical presence is required, such as when making in-person purchases or unlocking a vehicle. This paper proposes a novel approach for estimating user location and modeling user movement using the Internet of Things (IoT). Our goal is to utilize its scale and diversity to estimate location more robustly, than solutions based on smartphones alone, and stop adversaries from using compromised user credentials (e.g., stolen keys, passwords, etc.), when sufficient evidence physically locates them elsewhere. To locate users, we leverage the increasing number of IoT devices carried and used by them and the smart environments that observe these devices. We also exploit the ability of many IoT devices to ""sense"" the user. To demonstrate our approach, we build a system, called Icelus. Our experiments with it show that it exhibits a smaller false-rejection rate than smartphone-based location-based authentication (LBA) and it rejects attackers with few errors (i.e., false acceptances)."
Theft-resilient mobile wallets,"The deployment of NFC technology on mobile phones is gaining momentum, enabling many important applications such as NFC payments, access control for building or public transit ticketing. However, (NFC) phones are prone to loss or theft, which allows the attacker with physical access to the phone to fully compromise the functionality provided by the NFC applications. Authenticating a user of an NFC phone using PINs or passwords provides only a weak level of security, and undermines the efficiency and convenience that NFC applications are supposed to provide."
Gametrics,"Authenticating a user based on her unique behavioral bio-metric traits has been extensively researched over the past few years. The most researched behavioral biometrics techniques are based on keystroke and mouse dynamics. These schemes, however, have been shown to be vulnerable to human-based and robotic attacks that attempt to mimic the user's behavioral pattern to impersonate the user."
Device fingerprinting for augmenting web authentication,"Device fingerprinting is commonly used for tracking users. We explore device fingerprinting but in the specific context of use for augmenting authentication, providing a state-of-the-art view and analysis. We summarize and classify 29 available methods and their properties; define attack models relevant to augmenting passwords for user authentication; and qualitatively compare them based on stability, repeatability, resource use, client passiveness, difficulty of spoofing, and distinguishability offered."
Practical and secure dynamic searchable encryption via oblivious access on distributed data structure,"Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) allows a client to perform keyword searches over encrypted files via an encrypted data structure. Despite its merits, DSSE leaks search and update patterns when the client accesses the encrypted data structure. These leakages may create severe privacy problems as already shown, for example, in recent statistical attacks on DSSE. While Oblivious Random Access Memory (ORAM) can hide such access patterns, it incurs significant communication overhead and, therefore, it is not yet fully practical for cloud computing systems. Hence, there is a critical need to develop private access schemes over the encrypted data structure that can seal the leakages of DSSE while achieving practical search/update operations."
CoKey,"Keys for symmetric cryptography are usually stored in RAM and therefore susceptible to various attacks, ranging from simple buffer overflows to leaks via cold boot, DMA or side channels. A common approach to mitigate such attacks is to move the keys to an external cryptographic token. For low-throughput applications like asymmetric signature generation, the performance of these tokens is sufficient. For symmetric, data-intensive use cases, like disk encryption on behalf of the host, the connecting interface to the token often is a serious bottleneck. In order to overcome this problem, we present CoKey, a novel concept for partially moving symmetric cryptography out of the host into a trusted detachable token. CoKey combines keys from both entities and securely encrypts initialization vectors on the token which are then used in the cryptographic operations on the host. This forces host and token to cooperate during the whole encryption and decryption process. Our concept strongly and efficiently binds encrypted data on the host to the specific token used for their encryption, while still allowing for fast operation. We implemented the concept using Linux hosts and the USB armory, a USB thumb drive sized ARM computer, as detachable crypto token. Our detailed performance evaluation shows that our prototype is easily fast enough even for data-intensive and performance-critical use cases like full disk encryption, thus effectively improving security for symmetric cryptography in a usable way."
The cloudier side of cryptographic end-to-end verifiable voting,"Helios is an open-audit internet voting system providing cryptographic protections to voter privacy, and election integrity. As part of these protections, Helios produces a cryptographic audit trail that can be used to verify ballots were correctly counted. Cryptographic end-to-end (E2E) election verification schemes of this kind are a promising step toward developing trustworthy electronic voting systems."
ShieldFS,"Preventive and reactive security measures can only partially mitigate the damage caused by modern ransomware attacks. Indeed, the remarkable amount of illicit profit and the cyber-criminals' increasing interest in ransomware schemes suggest that a fair number of users are actually paying the ransoms."
Cypider,"The popularity of Android OS has dramatically increased malware apps targeting this mobile OS. The daily amount of malware has overwhelmed the detection process. This fact has motivated the need for developing malware detection and family attribution solutions with the least manual intervention. In response, we propose Cypider framework, a set of techniques and tools aiming to perform a systematic detection of mobile malware by building an efficient and scalable similarity network infrastructure of malicious apps. Our detection method is based on a novel concept, namely malicious community, in which we consider, for a given family, the instances that share common features. Under this concept, we assume that multiple similar Android apps with different authors are most likely to be malicious. Cypider leverages this assumption for the detection of variants of known malware families and zero-day malware. It is important to mention that Cypider does not rely on signature-based or learning-based patterns. Alternatively, it applies community detection algorithms on the similarity network, which extracts sub-graphs considered as suspicious and most likely malicious communities. Furthermore, we propose a novel fingerprinting technique, namely community fingerprint, based on a learning model for each malicious community. Cypider shows excellent results by detecting about 50% of the malware dataset in one detection iteration. Besides, the preliminary results of the community fingerprint are promising as we achieved 87% of the detection."
"Intelligent, automated red team emulation","Red teams play a critical part in assessing the security of a network by actively probing it for weakness and vulnerabilities. Unlike penetration testing - which is typically focused on exploiting vulnerabilities - red teams assess the entire state of a network by emulating real adversaries, including their techniques, tactics, procedures, and goals. Unfortunately, deploying red teams is prohibitive: cost, repeatability, and expertise all make it difficult to consistently employ red team tests. We seek to solve this problem by creating a framework for automated red team emulation, focused on what the red team does post-compromise - i.e., after the perimeter has been breached. Here, our program acts as an automated and intelligent red team, actively moving through the target network to test for weaknesses and train defenders. At its core, our framework uses an automated planner designed to accurately reason about future plans in the face of the vast amount of uncertainty in red teaming scenarios. Our solution is custom-developed, built on a logical encoding of the cyber environment and adversary profiles, using techniques from classical planning, Markov decision processes, and Monte Carlo simulations. In this paper, we report on the development of our framework, focusing on our planning system. We have successfully validated our planner against other techniques via a custom simulation. Our tool itself has successfully been deployed to identify vulnerabilities and is currently used to train defending blue teams."
"You can promote, but you can't hide","Instead of improving their apps' quality, some developers hire a group of users (called collusive attackers) to post positive ratings and reviews irrespective of the actual app quality. In this work, we aim to expose the apps whose ratings have been manipulated (or abused) by collusive attackers. Specifically, we model the relations of raters and apps as biclique communities and propose four attack signatures to identify malicious communities, where the raters are collusive attackers and the apps are abused apps. We further design a linear-time search algorithm to enumerate such communities in an app store. Our system was implemented and initially run against Apple App Store of China on July 17, 2013. In 33 hours, our system examined 2, 188 apps, with the information of millions of reviews and reviewers downloaded on the fly. It reported 108 abused apps, among which 104 apps were confirmed to be abused. In a later time, we ran our tool against Apple App Stores of China, United Kingdom, and United States in a much larger scale. The evaluation results show that among the apps examined by our tool, abused apps account for 0.94%, 0.92%, and 0.57% out of all the analyzed apps, respectively in June 2013. In our latest checking on Oct. 15, 2015, these ratios decrease to 0.44%, 0.70%, and 0.42%, respectively. Our algorithm can greatly narrow down the suspect list from all apps (e.g., below 1% as shown in our paper). App store vendors may then use other information to do further verification."
Swords and shields,"The mobile game industry has been growing significantly. Mobile games are increasingly including abilities to purchase in-game objects with real currency, share achievements and updates with friends, and post high scores to global leader boards. Because of these abilities, there are new financial and social incentives for gamers to cheat. Developers and researchers have tried to apply various protection mechanisms in games, but the degrees of effectiveness vary considerably. There has not been a real-world study in this problem space. In this work, we investigate different protections in real-world applications, and we compare these approaches from different aspects such as security and deployment efforts systematically."
Understanding and defending the binder attack surface in Android,"In Android, communications between apps and system services are supported by a transaction-based Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism. Binder, as the cornerstone of this IPC mechanism, separates two communicating parties as client and server. As with any client-server model, the server should not make any assumption on the validity (sanity) of client-side transaction. To our surprise, we find this principle has frequently been overlooked in the implementation of Android system services. In this paper, we try to answer why developers keep making this seemingly simple mistake by studying more than 100 vulnerabilities on this attack surface. We analyzed these vulnerabilities to find that most of them are rooted at a common confusion of where the actual security boundary is among system developers. We thus highlight the deficiency of testing only on client-side public APIs and argue for the necessity of testing and protection on the Binder interface --- the actual security boundary. Specifically, we design and implement BinderCracker, an automatic testing framework that supports context-aware fuzzing and actively manages the dependency between transactions. It does not require the source codes of the component under test, is compatible with services in different layers, and performs much more effectively than simple black-box fuzzing. We also call attention to the attack attribution problem for IPC-based attacks. The lack of OS-level support makes it very difficult to identify the culprit apps even for developers with adb access. We address this issue by providing an informative runtime diagnostic tool that tracks the origin, schema, content, and parsing details of each failed transaction. This brings transparency into the IPC process and provides an essential step for other in-depth analysis or forensics."
Inferring browser activity and status through remote monitoring of storage usage,"Web applications use the local storage of a web browser to temporarily store static resources for caching and persistently store personalized data for stateful services. Since different web applications use the local storage differently in terms of size and time, attackers can infer a user's browser activity and status if they can monitor storage usage: for example, which web site a user is viewing and whether a user has logged in to a certain web site. In this paper, we explore passive and active web attacks that exploit the Quota Management API to extract such information from a web browser, as the API allows us to continuously monitor the size of available storage space. We develop two web attacks: a cross-tab activity inference attack to passively monitor which web site a user is currently visiting and a browser status inference attack to actively identify the browser status such as browser history and login information. Our attacks are successful at stealing private information from Chrome running on various platforms with ∼90% accuracy. We further propose an effective solution against the attacks."
Amplifying side channels through performance degradation,"Interference between processes executing on shared hardware can be used to mount performance-degradation attacks. However, in most cases, such attacks offer little benefit for the adversary. In this paper, we demonstrate that software-based performance-degradation attacks can be used to amplify side-channel leaks, enabling the adversary to increase both the amount and the quality of information captured."
"Efficient, adversarial neighbor discovery using logical channels on Microsoft Azure","We introduce an effective technique that exploits logical channels for malicious co-location and target identification on Microsoft Azure cloud instances. Specifically, we employ-two co-location scenarios: targeted co-location with a specific victim or co-location with subsequent identification of victims of interest. We develop a novel, noise-resistant co-location detection method through the network channel that provides fast, reliable results with no cooperation from the victim. Also, our method does not require access to the victim instance neither as a legitimate user nor a malicious attacker."
VTPin,"VTable hijacking has lately been promoted to the de facto technique for exploiting C++ applications, and in particular web browsers. VTables, however, can be manipulated without necessarily corrupting memory, simply by leveraging use-after-free bugs. In fact, in the recent Pwn2Own competitions all major web browsers were compromised with exploits that employed (among others) use-after-free vulnerabilities and VTable hijacking."
LMP,"Despite a long history and numerous proposed defenses, memory corruption attacks are still viable. A secure and low-overhead defense against return-oriented programming (ROP) continues to elude the security community. Currently proposed solutions still must choose between either not fully protecting critical data and relying instead on information hiding, or using incomplete, coarse-grain checking that can be circumvented by a suitably skilled attacker. In this paper, we present a light-weighted memory protection approach (LMP) that uses Intel's MPX hardware extensions to provide complete, fast ROP protection without having to rely in information hiding. We demonstrate a prototype that defeats ROP attacks while incurring an average runtime overhead of 3.9%."
FASE,"Dynamic information-flow enforcement systems automatically protect applications against confidentiality and integrity threats. Unfortunately, existing solutions cause undesirable side effects, if not crashes, due to unconstrained modification of run-time values (e.g. anonymizing sensitive identifiers even when these are used for authentication)."
Reliably determining data leakage in the presence of strong attackers,"We address the problem of determining what data has been leaked from a system after its recovery from a successful attack. This is a forensic process which is relevant to give a better understanding of the impact of a data breach, but more importantly it is becoming mandatory according to the recent developments of data breach notification laws. Existing work in this domain has discussed methods to create digital evidence that could be used to determine data leakage, however most of them fail to secure the evidence against malicious adversaries or use strong assumptions such as trusted hardware. In some limited cases, data can be processed in the encrypted domain which, although being computationally expensive, can ensure that nothing leaks to an attacker, thereby making the leakage determination trivial. Otherwise, victims are left with the only option of considering all data to be leaked."
Sanitizing data is not enough!,"Conventional overwriting-based and encryption-based secure deletion schemes can only sanitize data. However, the past existence of the deleted data may leave artifacts in the layout at all layers of a computing system. These structural artifacts may be utilized by the adversary to infer sensitive information about the deleted data or even to fully recover them. The conventional secure deletion solutions unfortunately cannot sanitize them."
Auror,"Deep learning in a collaborative setting is emerging as a corner-stone of many upcoming applications, wherein untrusted users collaborate to generate more accurate models. From the security perspective, this opens collaborative deep learning to poisoning attacks, wherein adversarial users deliberately alter their inputs to mis-train the model. These attacks are known for machine learning systems in general, but their impact on new deep learning systems is not well-established."
A security analysis of automated chinese turing tests,"Text-based Captchas have been widely used to deter misuse of services on the Internet. However, many designs have been broken. It is intellectually interesting and practically relevant to look for alternative designs, which are currently a topic of active research. We motivate the study of Chinese Captchas as an interesting alternative design - co-unterintuitively, it is possible to design Chinese Captchas that are universally usable, even to those who have never studied Chinese language. More importantly, we ask a fundamental question: is the segmentation-resistance principle established for Roman-character based Captchas applicable to Chinese based designs? With deep learning techniques, we offer the first evidence that computers do recognize individual Chinese characters well, regardless of distortion levels. This suggests that many real-world Chinese schemes are insecure, in contrast to common beliefs. Our result offers an essential guideline to the design of secure Chinese Captchas, and it is also applicable to Captchas using other large-alphabet languages such as Japanese."
The cross domain desktop compositor,"We have developed the Cross Domain Desktop Compositor, a hardware-based multi-level secure user interface, suitable for deployment in high-assurance environments."
CASTLE,"With the emergence of secure network protocols that rely on public-key certification, such as DNSSEC, BGPSEC, and future Internet architectures, ISPs and domain administrators not specialized in certification have been thrust into certificate-signing roles. These so-called conscripted CAs sign a low volume of certificates, but still face the same challenges that plague modern CAs: private signing key security, administrator authentication, and personnel and key management. We propose CA Signing in a Touch-Less Environment (CASTLE), an air-gapped and completely touchless system to enable low-volume, high-security certificate signing in conscripted CAs. We demonstrate that CASTLE's layered, defense-in-depth approach is technically and practically feasible, and that CASTLE empowers conscripted CAs to overcome challenges that even professional CAs struggle with."
Spicy,"Deep packet inspection systems (DPI) process wire format network data from untrusted sources, collecting semantic information from a variety of protocols and file formats as they work their way upwards through the network stack. However, implementing corresponding dissectors for the potpourri of formats that today's networks carry, remains time-consuming and cumbersome, and also poses fundamental security challenges."
Trace-free memory data structure forensics via past inference and future speculations,"A yet-to-be-solved but very vital problem in forensics analysis is accurate memory dump data type reverse engineering where the target process is not a priori specified and could be any of the running processes within the system. We present ReViver, a lightweight system-wide solution that extracts data type information from the memory dump without its past execution traces. ReViver constructs the dump's accurate data structure layout through collection of statistical information about possible past traces, forensics inspection of the present memory dump, and speculative investigation of potential future executions of the suspended process. First, ReViver analyzes a heavily instrumented set of execution paths of the same executable that end in the same state of the memory dump (the eip and call stack), and collects statistical information the potential data structure instances on the captured dump. Second, ReViver uses the statistical information and performs a word-byword data type forensics inspection of the captured memory dump. Finally, ReViver revives the dump's execution and explores its potential future execution paths symbolically. ReViver traces the executions including library/system calls for their known argument/return data types, and performs backward taint analysis to mark the dump bytes with relevant data type information. ReViver's experimental results on real-world applications are very promising (98.1%), and show that ReViver improves the accuracy of the past trace-free memory forensics solutions significantly while maintaining a negligible runtime performance overhead (1.8%)."
HERCULE,"Advanced cyber attacks consist of multiple stages aimed at being stealthy and elusive. Such attack patterns leave their footprints spatio-temporally dispersed across many different logs in victim machines. However, existing log-mining intrusion analysis systems typically target only a single type of log to discover evidence of an attack and therefore fail to exploit fundamental inter-log connections. The output of such single-log analysis can hardly reveal the complete attack story for complex, multi-stage attacks. Additionally, some existing approaches require heavyweight system instrumentation, which makes them impractical to deploy in real production environments. To address these problems, we present HERCULE, an automated multi-stage log-based intrusion analysis system. Inspired by graph analytics research in social network analysis, we model multi-stage intrusion analysis as a community discovery problem. HERCULE builds multi-dimensional weighted graphs by correlating log entries across multiple lightweight logs that are readily available on commodity systems. From these, HERCULE discovers any ""attack communities"" embedded within the graphs. Our evaluation with 15 well known APT attack families demonstrates that HERCULE can reconstruct attack behaviors from a spectrum of cyber attacks that involve multiple stages with high accuracy and low false positive rates."
