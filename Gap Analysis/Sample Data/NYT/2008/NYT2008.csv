"Thieves Winning Online War, Maybe Even in Your Computer","Internet security is broken, and nobody seems to know quite how to fix it.   Despite the efforts of the computer security industry and a half-decade struggle by Microsoft to protect its Windows operating system, malicious software  is spreading faster than ever. The so-called malware surreptitiously takes over a PC and then uses that computer to spread more malware to other machines exponentially. Computer scientists and security researchers acknowledge they cannot get ahead of the onslaught.    As more  business and social life has moved onto the Web, criminals thriving on an underground economy of credit card thefts, bank fraud and other scams rob computer users of an estimated $100 billion a year, according to a conservative estimate by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. A  Russian company that sells fake antivirus software that actually takes over a computer pays its illicit distributors as much as $5 million a year.   With vast resources from stolen credit card and other financial information, the cyberattackers are handily winning a technology arms race. Â    ''Right now the bad guys are improving more quickly than the good guys,'' said Patrick Lincoln, director of the computer science laboratory at  SRI International, a science and technology research group.    A well-financed computer underground has built an advantage by working in countries that have global Internet connections but authorities with little appetite for prosecuting offenders who are bringing in significant amounts of foreign currency. That was driven home in late October when RSA FraudAction Research Lab, a security consulting group based in Bedford, Mass., discovered a cache of half a million credit card numbers and bank account log-ins that had been stolen by a network of so-called zombie computers remotely controlled by an online gang.    In October, researchers at the Georgia Tech Information Security Center reported that the percentage of online computers worldwide infected by botnets -- networks of programs connected via the Internet that send spam or disrupt Internet-based services   -- is likely to increase to 15 percent by the end of this year, from 10 percent in 2007. That suggests a staggering  number of infected computers, as many as 10 million, being used to distribute spam and malware over the Internet each day, according to research compiled by PandaLabs.   Security researchers concede that their efforts are largely an exercise in a game of whack-a-mole because botnets that distribute  malware like worms, the programs that can move from computer to computer, are still relatively invisible to commercial antivirus software. A research report  last month by Stuart Staniford, chief scientist of FireEye, a Silicon Valley computer security firm, indicated that in tests of 36 commercial antivirus products, fewer than half of the newest malicious software programs were identified.    There have been some recent successes, but they are short-lived. On Nov. 11, the volume of spam, which transports the malware, dropped by half around the globe after an Internet service provider disconnected the Mycolo Corporation, an American firm with Russian ties,  from the Internet.  But the respite is not expected to last long  as  cybercriminals regain control of their spam-generating  computers.    ''Modern worms are stealthier and they are professionally written,'' said Bruce Schneier, chief security technology officer for British Telecom. ''The criminals have gone upmarket, and they're organized and international because there is real money to be made.''   The gangs keep improving their malware, and now programs can be written to hunt for a specific type of information stored on a personal  computer. For example, some malware uses the operating system to look for recent documents created by a user, on the assumption they will be more valuable. Some routinely watch for and then steal log-in and password information, specifically consumer financial information.     The sophistication of the programs has in the last two years begun to give them almost lifelike capabilities. For example, malware programs now infect computers and then routinely use their own antivirus capabilities to not only disable antivirus software but also remove competing malware programs. Recently, Microsoft antimalware researchers disassembled an infecting program and were stunned to discover that it was programmed to turn on the Windows Update feature after it took over the user's computer. The infection was ensuring that it was protected from other criminal attackers.    And there is more of it. Microsoft has monitored a 43 percent jump in malware removed from Windows computers just in the last half year.   The biggest problem may be that people cannot tell if their computers are infected because the malware often masks its presence from antivirus software. For now,  Apple's Macintosh computers are more or less exempt from the attacks, but researchers expect Apple machines to become a larger target as their market share grows.       The severity of the situation was driven home not long ago for Ed Amaroso, AT&T's chief security official. ''I was at home with my mother's computer recently and I showed her it was attacking China,'' he said. '' 'Can you just make it run a little faster?' she asked, and I told her 'Ma, we have to reimage your hard disk.' ''    Beyond the billions of dollars lost in theft of money and data is another, deeper impact. Many Internet executives fear that basic trust in what has become the foundation of 21st century commerce is rapidly eroding. ''There's an increasing trend to depend on the Internet for a wide range of applications, many of them having to deal with financial institutions,'' said Vinton G. Cerf, one of the original designers of the Internet, who is now Google's ''chief Internet evangelist.''    ''The more we depend on these types of systems, the more vulnerable we become,'' he said.    The United States government has begun to recognize the extent of the problem.  In January, President Bush signed National Security Presidential Directive 54, establishing a national cybersecurity initiative. The plan, which may cost more than  $30 billion over seven years, is directed at securing the federal government's own computers as well as the systems that run the nation's critical infrastructure, like oil and gas networks and electric power and water systems.    That will do little, however, to help protect businesses and consumers who use the hundreds of millions of Internet-connected personal computers and cellphones, the criminals' newest target.     Despite new technologies that are holding some attackers at bay, several computer security experts said they were worried that the economic downturn will make computer security the first casualty of corporate spending cuts. Security gets hit because it is hard to measure its effectiveness, said Eugene Spafford, a computer scientist at Purdue University.    He is pessimistic.  ''In many respects, we are probably worse off than we were 20 years ago,'' he said, ''because all of the money has been devoted to patching the current problem rather than investing in the redesign of our infrastructure.''   The cyber-criminals appear to be at least as technically advanced as the most sophisticated software companies. And they are faster and more flexible. As software companies have tightened the security of the basic operating systems like Windows and Macintosh, attackers have moved on to Web browsers and Internet-connected programs like Adobe Flash and Apple QuickTime.   This has led to an era of so-called ''drive-by infections,'' where users are induced to click on Web links that are contained in e-mail messages. Cyber-criminals have raised the ability to fool unsuspecting computer users into clicking on intriguing messages to a high art.    Researchers note that the global cycle of distributing security patches inevitably plays to the advantage of the attacker, who can continually hunt for and exploit new backdoors and weaknesses in systems. This year, computer security firms have begun shifting from traditional anti-virus program designs, which are regularly updated on subscribers' personal computers, to Web-based services, which can be updated even faster.    Security researchers at SRI International are now collecting over 10,000 unique samples of malware daily from around the global. ''To me it feels like job security,'' said Phillip Porras, an SRI program director and the computer security expert who led the design of the company's Bothunter program, available free at www.bothunter.net.   ''This is always an arm race, as long as it gets into your machine faster than the update to detect it, the bad guys win,'' said Mr. Schneier.  "
Beware the Digital Zombies,"In a windowless room on Microsoft's campus here, T. J. Campana, a cybercrime investigator, connects an unprotected computer running an early version of Windows XP to the Internet. In about 30 seconds the computer is ''owned.''    An automated program lurking  on the Internet has remotely taken over the PC and turned it into a ''zombie.''  That computer and other zombie machines are then assembled into systems called ''botnets'' -- home and business PCs that are hooked together into a vast chain of cyber-robots that do the bidding of automated programs to send the majority of e-mail spam, to illegally seek financial information  and to install malicious software on still more PCs.   Botnets remain an Internet scourge. Active zombie networks created by a growing criminal underground peaked last month at more than half a million computers, according to shadowserver.org, an organization that tracks botnets. Even though security experts have diminished the botnets to  about 300,000 computers, that is still twice the number detected a year ago.    The actual numbers may be far larger; Microsoft investigators, who say they are tracking about 1,000 botnets at any given time, say the largest network still controls several million PCs.  Â    ''The mean time to infection is less than five minutes,'' said Richie Lai,  who is part of Microsoft's Internet Safety Enforcement Team, a group of about 20 researchers and investigators. The team is tackling a menace that in the last five years has grown from a computer hacker pastime to a dark  business that is threatening the commercial viability of the Internet.   Any computer connected to the Internet can be vulnerable. Computer security executives recommend that PC owners run a variety of commercial malware detection programs, like Microsoft's Malicious Software Removal Tool, to find infections of their computers. They should also protect the PCs behind a firewall and install security patches for operating systems and applications.    Even these steps are not a sure thing. Last week Secunia, a computer security firm, said it had tested a dozen leading PC security suites and found that the best one detected only 64 out of 300 software vulnerabilities that make it possible to install malware on a computer.   Botnet attacks now come with their own antivirus software, permitting the programs to take over a computer and then effectively remove other malware competitors. Mr. Campana said the Microsoft investigators were amazed recently to find a botnet that turned on the Microsoft Windows Update feature after taking over a computer, to defend its host from an invasion of competing infections.   Botnets have evolved quickly to make detection more difficult. During the last year botnets began using a technique called fast-flux, which involved generating a rapidly changing set of Internet addresses to make the botnet more difficult to locate and disrupt.   Companies have realized that the only way to combat the menace of botnets and modern computer crime is to build a global alliance that crosses  corporate and national boundaries. On Tuesday, Microsoft, the world's largest software company, will convene a gathering of the International Botnet Taskforce in Arlington, Va. At the conference, which is held twice a year, more than 175 members of government and law enforcement agencies, computer security companies and academics will discuss the latest strategies, including legal efforts.   Although the Microsoft team has filed more than 300 civil lawsuits against botnet operators, the company also relies on enforcement agencies like the F.B.I. and Interpol-related organizations for criminal prosecution.   Last month the alliance received support from new federal legislation,  which for the first time specifically criminalized the use of botnets. Many of the bots are based in other countries, however, and Mr. Campana said there were many nations with no similar laws.   ''It's really a sort of cat-and-mouse situation with the underground,'' said David Dittrich, a senior security engineer at the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory and a member of the International Botnet Taskforce. ''Now there's profit motive, and the people doing stuff for profit are doing unique and interesting things.''   Microsoft's botnet hunters, who have kept a low profile until now, are led by Richard Boscovich, who until six months ago served as a federal prosecutor in Miami. Mr. Boscovich, a federal prosecutor for 18 years, said he was optimistic that despite the growing number of botnets, progress was being made against computer crime. Recent successes have led to arrests.   ''Every time we have a story that says bot-herders get locked up, that helps,'' said Mr. Boscovich, who in 2000 helped  convict Jonathan James,  a teenage computer hacker who had gained access to Defense Department  and National Air and Space Administration computers.   To aid in its investigations, the Microsoft team has built elaborate software tools including traps called ''honeypots'' that are used to detect malware and a system called the Botnet Monitoring and Analysis Tool. The software is installed in several refrigerated server rooms on the Microsoft campus that are directly connected to the open Internet, both to mask its location and to make it possible to deploy software sensors around the globe.    The door to the room simply reads ''the lab.'' Inside are racks of hundreds of processors and terabytes of disk drives needed to capture the digital evidence that must be logged as carefully as evidence is maintained by crime scene investigators.   Detecting and disrupting botnets is a particularly delicate challenge that Microsoft will  talk about only in vague terms. Their challenge parallels the traditional one of law enforcement's placing informers inside criminal gangs.    Just as gangs will often force a recruit to commit a crime as a test of loyalty, in cyberspace, bot-herders will test recruits in an effort to weed out spies. Microsoft investigators would not discuss their solution to this problem, but said they avoided doing anything illegal with their software.    One possible approach would be to create sensors that would fool the bot-herders by appearing to do malicious things, but in fact not perform the actions.    In 2003 and 2004 Microsoft was deeply shaken by a succession of malicious software worm programs with names like ''Blaster'' and ''Sasser,'' that raced through the Internet, sowing chaos within corporations and among home computer users. Blaster was a personal affront to the software firm that has long prided itself on its technology prowess. The program contained a hidden message mocking Microsoft's co-founder: ''billy gates why do you make this possible? Stop making money and fix your software!!''   The company maintains that its current software is less vulnerable, but even as it fixed some problems, the threat to the world's computers has become far greater. Mr. Campana said  that there had been ups and downs in the fight against a new kind of criminal who could hide virtually anywhere in the world and strike with devilish cleverness.   ''I come in every morning, and I think we're making progress,'' he said. At the same time, he said, botnets are not going to go away any time soon.   ''There are a lot of very smart people doing very bad things,'' he said. "
The Push to Build an Electronic Health System,"To the Editor:    Re ''Thieves Winning Online War, Maybe Even in Your Computer'' (front page, Dec. 6):Â    There is a real disconnect between the ease of hacking home computers and the federal push to build a national electronic health system.    Health-related information technology systems pose a tremendous new and unrecognized threat to the privacy of personal information.    Cubbyhole databases and encryption are not widely used, authentication and identity-proofing are terrible, and hospitals allow thousands of employees to see hundreds of thousands of patient records.    Health care systems do not use the new ''smart'' security and consent technologies so we can limit access to those directly involved in our care.    Why rush to require that medical records -- including all our sensitive health, prescription, financial, genetic and demographic information -- go into unsafe electronic systems that lack ironclad security?    Unlike identity theft, the theft of our personal health information can't be fixed.    The theft of health data will limit our children's and grandchildren's chances for jobs, credit and opportunities in life.   Deborah C. Peel   Austin, Tex., Dec. 8, 2008   The writer, a medical doctor,  is the founder and chairwoman of Patient Privacy Rights, a nonprofit organization. "
"At Conference On the Risks To Earth, Few Are Optimistic","This ancient hilltop town, rife with Roman, Greek, Norman and other influences, is hosting a very modern gathering: a conference on global risks like cyberterrorism, climate change, nuclear weapons and the world's lagging energy supply.   More than 120 scientists, engineers, analysts and economists from 30 countries were hunkered down here for the 40th annual conference on ''planetary emergencies.'' The term was coined by Dr. Antonino Zichichi, a native son and a theoretical physicist who has made Erice a hub for experts to discuss persistent, and potentially catastrophic, global challenges.   The participants were not particularly optimistic. They presented data showing that the boom in biofuels was depleting Southeast Asian rain forests, that ''bot herders'' -- computer hackers for hire -- were hijacking millions of computers, and that the lack of progress over handling nuclear waste was both hampering the revival of nuclear energy and adding to terrorism risks. Â    The meetings, which end Sunday, were sponsored by the Erice-based Ettore Majorana Foundation and Center for Scientific Culture and by the World Federation of Scientists in Geneva. Both organizations are led by Dr. Zichichi with what the physicist Dr. Richard L. Garwin, a longtime Erice conference participant and expert on nuclear weapons, affectionately called ''imperious'' zeal.    Dr. Zichichi, 78, controls every aspect of the sessions, including the seating in the seminars and the wine selections at the nightly dinners.   His goal is to foster what he calls ''a science without secrets and without borders,'' mixing disciplines and cultures, and to laud veterans and emerging talents in hopes of propelling breakthroughs.    He said past successes included focusing attention on the need to reduce nuclear stockpiles and developing the first detailed analysis of flood risks along the Yellow River in China.   The threat of cyberattacks was also a focus of this year's meeting. In a session on information security, Hamadoun I. Toure, the secretary general of the International Telecommunication Union, warned that pervasive computer use, while offering the prospect of a global ''knowledge society,'' also made billions of individuals into potential superpowers.    ''Every single brain on earth is equal and can trigger an attack,'' he said.    Jody R. Westby, the chief executive of Global Cyber Risk, a Washington-based consulting company, warned that governments were not doing enough to anticipate attacks. She said that the United States, while investing heavily in classified work on communications networks, had only one small program doing advanced research on the vulnerabilities in the private networks that handle the brunt of government communications and information management.    In a workshop on the northward spread of mosquito-borne ailments, participants discussed the growing gap between wealthier and poorer nations in dealing with health risks.    After presentations on recent outbreaks of the tropical chikungunya virus in Italy, Baldwyn Torto of the International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi, Kenya, suggested that too much of the discussion was focused on girding Europe against further outbreaks. A better approach, he said, would be to attack such diseases in the tropical spots where they originate.    At a final gathering on Saturday, Bill Fulkerson of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, said that meetings in the next several years would likely concentrate on the technological and scientific needs of developing countries that are trying to expand their economies without diminishing resources.   The daunting nature of the problems did not seem to blunt the experts' determination to look for answers.    ''What option do I have?'' said Richard Wilson, 82, a Harvard physicist and an expert on nuclear power and environmental risk. ''I could go down to Hilton Head and take a little club and knock a ball around the course, but I don't find that a very attractive thought.'' "
Patch for Web Security Hole Has Some Leaks of Its Own,"Faced with the discovery of a serious flaw in the Internet's workings, computer network administrators around the world have been rushing to fix their systems with a cobbled-together patch. Now it appears that the patch has some gaping holes.   On Friday, a Russian physicist demonstrated that the emergency fix to the basic Internet address system, known as the Domain Name System, is vulnerable and will almost certainly be exploited by criminals. Â    The flaw could allow Internet traffic to be secretly redirected so thieves could, for example, hijack a bank's Web address and collect customer passwords.   In a posting on his blog, the physicist, Evgeniy Polyakov, wrote that he had fooled the software that serves as the Internet's telephone book into returning an incorrect address in just 10 hours, using two standard desktop computers and a high-speed network link. Internet experts who reviewed the posting said the approach appeared to be effective.   The basic vulnerability of the network has become a heated controversy since Dan Kaminsky, a Seattle-based researcher at the security firm IOActive, quietly notified a number of companies that distribute Internet addressing software earlier this year.    On Wednesday, Mr. Kaminsky described the vulnerability to  a packed room at a technical conference in Las Vegas. He said that it could affect not just the Web but also other services like e-mail.    The general risk of such a flaw had been known for some years within the insular Internet technical community. But in the last month security engineers have repeatedly stated that it is only a matter of time before financial organizations and others are attacked by computer criminals seeking to exploit the now-public flaw. One expert says this is happening now.   ''We have already been seeing attacks in the wild for the past two weeks,'' said Bill Woodcock, research director of the Packet Clearing House, a nonprofit technical organization. Some of the initial attacks focused on distributing malicious software, he said, and more recently there has been evidence of so-called phishing attacks aimed at stealing personal information.   It is now almost certain that there will be an escalating number of attacks, Mr. Woodcock said. Before the patch, which has now been distributed to more than three-quarters of the affected servers in the world, it would have taken as little as one second to insert false information into the address database. Now, even with the patch, attacks will be possible in a matter of minutes or hours, he said.   Mr. Polyakov carried out his attack using two fast computers, but the same attack could be carried out more quickly. There is now an intense debate over how to find a more permanent fix for the system's weaknesses.   ''We've bought some time,'' said Paul Mockapetris, the software engineer who devised the original D.N.S. system and is now chairman of Nominum, a firm that makes a version of the D.N.S. software that is not vulnerable to the current flaw. Mr. Mockapetris described the patch that is now being put in place as the equivalent of ''playing Russian roulette with a gun that has 100 bullet chambers instead of six.''    ''The point,'' he said, ''should be to take the gun out of people's hands.''   The root of the problem lies in the fact that the address system, which was invented in 1983, was not meant for services like electronic banking that require strict verification of  identity.   ''They are relying on infrastructure that was not intended to do what people assume it does,'' said Clifford Neuman, director of the Center for Computer Systems Security at the University of Southern California. ''What makes this so frustrating is that no one has been listening to what we have been saying for the past 17 years.''   A number of Internet security engineers point out that if a solution is found for the deeper problem of identity and authentication on the Internet, it will go a long way toward stopping many of the identity-related crimes that are now commonplace.   Some experts are proposing an encryption-based solution known as DNSSEC. It would give Web users high confidence that the Internet address  they are being sent to is correct.    So far several governments, including Sweden and Puerto Rico, have adopted DNSSEC, and the United States government is likely to deploy the system for its .gov domain this year.   ''DNSSEC is not an overnight solution for the Kaminsky problem, but it's the right solution in the long run,'' said Richard Lamb, a technical expert at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the nonprofit organization that oversees Internet security and stability.   Others remain skeptical that the more secure approach is practical for the wider commercial Internet, because it requires more computing power and because it would be hard to get the whole world to adopt it.   One technical expert, Daniel J. Bernstein, a University of Illinois mathematician who has also developed a version of D.N.S. that does not suffer from the current flaw, said DNSSEC ''offers a surprisingly low level of security, while at the same time introducing performance and reliability problems.'' "
Keeping Your Rivals From Minding Your Business,"AS more small businesses rely on e-mail and instant messaging for their communications, they would do well to use a number of inexpensive methods to preserve privacy and ensure that messages are read only by the intended recipient.   Even the smallest of businesses can make use of these security tips and tools, none of which  requires a computer guru for setup or maintenance: Â    HANG ON TO YOUR LAPTOP In a survey by RSA Security, 10 percent of the respondents acknowledged they had lost their laptops or cellphones at some point. An obvious remedy is to keep the computer with you, rather than leaving it in a hotel room or locked car.    ''I had a laptop stolen about six years ago,'' said Chris Angelini, managing editor of Tom's Hardware, a Web site that reviews and recommends computer products. ''Then I bought a smaller laptop just so I could take it everywhere with me.''   Michael Callahan, chief marketing officer of Credant Technologies, a data security company based in Addison, Tex., said: ''The real cost of losing all this data isn't the price of the hardware. It is the cost to replace all your customer information.''   LOCK OUT OTHERS When it's not possible or practical to keep physical possession of the computer, you can take a number of protective measures  to ensure that only its owner has access. One of the simplest is to use the built-in fingerprint reader on your laptop, if it has one.   Another option is to secure a laptop's files with an encryption program like TrueCrypt  (truecrypt.org), which is free, or PGP Endpoint, which sells for $50 (pgp.com). These programs render all the files indecipherable if the laptop falls into the wrong hands.  Some USB flash drives also come with encryption software.    ADD THE 'S' Travelers should take care to type ''https'' at the beginning of all their sensitive Web site addresses (like those of banks), especially when using a computer in a public place. Web browsers normally use the hypertext transfer protocol (http), but many sites (not all) also accept https connections, which provide extra security. Users of Google's Gmail can automatically force secure connections with an options setting in the program.   OUTSOURCE E-MAIL Businesses no longer need to run their own e-mail networks, because  many inexpensive alternatives will rent them as many mailboxes as needed. These providers will manage the entire e-mail process and offer a full collection of features, including the ability to screen and block messages that contain spam and viruses.   Google's Gmail is free, or $50 a mailbox a year for those who require more support. Other services are more specialized, like 123together.com, which offers to host a company's e-mail on its Microsoft Exchange servers for $10 a mailbox a month.    ENCRYPT E-MAIL Individual e-mail messages that contain sensitive information like customer or financial data can be encrypted with security software. Unencrypted e-mail could be easily intercepted and read if sent over the Internet in ordinary text. The simplest way to encrypt e-mail is with a service like PGP Universal (which comes with various options and at a wide range of prices at pgp.com) or Voltage Security Network ($65 a person a year at voltage.com).  Of course, recipients of your messages will need  software that can decrypt what you've sent.    BLOCK OUTSIDERS Ensure secure access to an office network when you're traveling with a virtual private network. This will prevent anyone from monitoring your communications and is particularly important when using a public network or otherwise sharing Internet access with strangers.    The options include LogMeIn Hamachi ($40 a year at logmein.com) or the free software from OpenVPN.net. With one of these on your computer, you can open, copy and save files from your office network without having to worry about a hacker reading over your shoulder.    ''Hamachi allows us to connect to hundreds of our customers and monitor live videos of our security cameras discreetly and without having to worry about being compromised by unauthorized users,'' said Ben Molloy, vice president of Pro-Vigil Inc. in San Antonio, which provides off-hours video security monitoring for  construction sites.   Granted, all these security measures require some work. ''Until you see the light and the need for these products, such as with a stolen laptop or lost data, no one else is going to be able to motivate you to use them,'' says Sean Steele, a data security consultant from InfoLock Technologies in Arlington, Va. ''A single data breach could easily cost several orders of magnitude more than any of these solutions.'' "
Flu Report Raises Privacy Concerns,"When Google released its Flu Trends service last week, the Drudge Report flashed a headline that read: ''Sick Surveillance: Google Reports Flu Searches, Locations to Feds.''Â    Google sought to avoid this kind of reaction by talking about how Google Flu Trends protects the privacy of its users. The service relies ''on anonymized, aggregated counts of how often certain search queries occur each week,'' Google said.   Still, the worries persist. On Wednesday, two advocacy groups, the Electronic Privacy Information Center and Patient Privacy Rights, sent a letter to Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, raising privacy concerns: ''The question is how to ensure that Google Flu Trends and similar techniques will only produce aggregate data and will not open the door to user-specific investigations, which could be compelled, even over Google's objection, by court order or presidential authority.'' There are longstanding and legitimate privacy concerns about the collection and storage of search data by companies like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft.   But Google Flu Trends does not change any of the ways search engine companies collect and hold data in any meaningful way. To create the service that track flu outbreaks, Google did not collect any new data. It did not change its policies on how it handles search data. It did not change the timing on when it anonymizes the data, a process that makes it harder, though perhaps not impossible, to associate multiple queries with the same user or computer.    And Google did not expose the raw data about flu-related queries to the outside world -- it simply allowed anyone to chart the rise and fall in every state. In analyzing aggregate data that Google already has, Flu Trends is no different from  Google Trends or Insights for Search, two related services that let anyone track the ebb and flow of any search term or phrase.    Google visitors  can already see which states are generating more searches for SARS, Viagra or the flu. Indeed, they  can track the relative frequency of searches for ''bomb making,'' which appear to be particularly popular in Pakistan, though New Zealand is a close second. (In the United States, ''bomb making'' queries were a favorite in Ohio, Washington and Michigan, at least as of late last week.)    MIGUEL HELFT  "
Open Secrets,"When he was fired, Scott Sidell was angry enough. Then he found out that his former employer was reading his personal Yahoo e-mail messages, after he had left the company.   In a lawsuit that he filed in May against Structured Settlement Investments, the finance company he used to run,  Mr. Sidell claims that executives at the company went so far as to read e-mail messages that he had sent to his lawyers discussing his strategy for winning an arbitration claim over his lost job.    ''It's kind of like the other side gets your playbook or they're spying on your locker room,'' said Russell Green, a lawyer representing Mr. Sidell. He said that his client was now using a new e-mail address.Â    The lawsuit filed by Mr. Sidell in federal court in Connecticut  involves an unsettled area of the law, where changes in technology create tension between expectations of personal privacy and companies' rights to monitor the equipment they provide to employees.  The case's unusual combination of facts, which are in dispute, paves the way for a decision that could help set a precedent for dealing with personal e-mail at work.   The law governing e-mail communications is still evolving. Generally, courts have found that employers can monitor employees' e-mail communications on company computers. But courts have also recognized greater privacy protection for e-mail messages sent using personal, Web-based e-mail accounts.  For example, this month a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the  Ninth Circuit  in California ruled that personal text messages sent on two-way pagers provided to police officers in Ontario, Calif., were protected from the department.     Mr. Sidell's case gives the courts an opportunity to address other questions, said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center  in Washington. ''This case raises a lot of new issues that reflect the changing place of e-mail in the work place,'' Mr. Rotenberg said. ''We have Web-based e-mail, which is not directly under the control of the employer.''      In addition to concerns about privacy in the workplace, Mr. Sidell's claim involves communications between a lawyer and a client. ''It's a nice set of factors that are all compacted into this,'' said Matt Zimmerman, senior staff attorney in the San Francisco office of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit civil liberties organization that seeks to protect privacy rights online.   An employer's ability to read messages worries office workers everywhere, not least because e-mail messages have figured in criminal cases like the one brought last week against two former Bear Stearns hedge fund managers. People disclose all manner of personal information in e-mail messages, in the expectation -- perhaps unfounded -- that what they type will remain confidential.   Companies often adopt policies explicitly stating that everything an employee does on a computer provided by the employer is subject to monitoring. But even so, and especially in the absence of such a policy, employees may have a reasonable expectation of privacy, Mr. Zimmerman said.   Moreover, he said the expectation of privacy would be even higher if employees used remotely hosted personal e-mail accounts like those provided by Yahoo. John Crossman, a lawyer at Zukerman Gore & Brandeis representing the company, said Structured Settlements had a policy that gave it the right to access its own computers. (Structured Settlement offers lump-sums to people receiving installment payments  --  from personal injury settlements or lottery winnings, for example.)   But  Mr. Sidell was no longer an employee when his mail was supposedly read.  And he said in his complaint that it went well beyond the company's rights to read e-mail messages from the personal  account of a terminated employee to  his lawyer.   ''The plaintiff is alleging, and I think he may have  a very strong argument, that his former employer exceeded their authority,'' Mr. Zimmerman said. ''That is, he is accusing them of accessing his  Yahoo account without authorization, in violation of federal law.''   Another question is how it was possible to read Mr. Sidell's Yahoo e-mail messages. In his complaint, he said that when he returned to his office after he was fired, he may not have signed out of his Yahoo account. A feature of the account could have allowed anyone using his computer to access his e-mail messages for up to two weeks.   Rich Palma, the chief operating officer for Structured Settlement, outlined the company's position in a statement filed with the court. Mr. Palma said that Mr. Sidell had returned to the office after he was fired and had begun  using another employee's computer.    He said that Mr. Sidell had used that computer without authorization and had sent trade secrets and confidential company information to his Yahoo e-mail account. Mr. Palma said the information included lists of customers, their home addresses and phone numbers, terms of deals and  brokers who had sent business to the company and personal information about the company's employees.    Mr. Crossman said the company could see what Mr. Sidell had done because Mr. Sidell's Yahoo e-mail account remained visible on the computer screen. ''He did it in plain sight so that people in the office saw what he had done on the open, operating computer,'' he said.    That twist in the case, if true, may support the  company's   claim against Mr. Sidell for violating terms of his employment contract, which among other things prohibited him from competing against his employer for three years after leaving the company.    Of course, if the company learned of the contractual breach by improperly reading Mr. Sidell's personal e-mail, that could support his claim.   Mr. Crossman was careful in responding to that claim, saying  ''It appears that the effort to assess the damage may have continued for several days, but the details of that are still being investigated.''   The claims and counterclaims present ''a very interesting fact pattern,'' said Mr. Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ''It would make a great exam question.'' "
A Method For Stealing Critical Data,"A group led by a Princeton University computer security researcher has developed a simple method to steal encrypted information stored on computer hard disks.   The technique, which could undermine security software protecting critical data on computers, is as easy as chilling a computer memory chip with a blast of frigid air from a can of dust remover. Encryption software is widely used by companies and government agencies, notably in portable computers that are especially susceptible to theft.   The development, which was described on the group's Web site Thursday, could also have implications for the protection of encrypted personal data from prosecutors. Â    The move, which cannot be carried out  remotely, exploits a little-known vulnerability of the dynamic random access, or DRAM, chip. Those chips temporarily hold data, including the keys to modern data-scrambling algorithms. When the computer's electrical power  is shut off, the data, including the keys, is supposed to disappear.    In a technical paper that was published Thursday on the Web site of Princeton's Center for Information Technology Policy, the group demonstrated that standard memory chips actually retain their data for seconds or even minutes after power is cut off.   When the chips were chilled using an inexpensive can of air, the data was frozen in place, permitting the researchers to easily read the keys --   long strings of ones  and zeros -- out of the chip's memory.   ''Cool the chips in liquid nitrogen (-196 degreesC) and they hold their state for hours at least, without any power,'' Edward W.  Felten, a Princeton computer scientist, wrote in a Web posting. ''Just put the chips back into a machine and you can read out their contents.''   The researchers used special pattern-recognition software of their own to identify security keys among the millions or even billions of pieces of data on the memory chip.   ''We think this is pretty serious to the extent people are relying on file protection,'' Mr. Felten said.   The team, which included five graduate students led by Mr. Felten and three independent technical experts, said they did not know if such an attack capability would compromise government computer information because details of how classified computer data is protected are not publicly available.   Officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which paid for a portion of the research, did not return repeated calls for comment.   The researchers also said they had not explored disk encryption protection systems as now  built into some commercial disk drives.   But they said they had proved that so-called Trusted Computing  hardware, an industry standard approach that has been heralded as significantly  increasing the security of modern personal computers, does not appear to stop the potential attacks.    A number of computer security experts said the research results were an indication that assertions of robust computer security should  be regarded with caution.   ''This is just another example of how things aren't quite what they seem when people tell you things are secure,'' said Peter Neumann, a security researcher at SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif.    The Princeton researchers wrote that they were able to compromise encrypted information stored using special utilities in the Windows, Macintosh and Linux operating systems.    Apple has had a FileVault disk encryption feature as an option in its OS X operating system since 2003. Microsoft added file encryption last year with BitLocker features in its Windows Vista operating system. The programs both use the federal government's certified Advanced Encryption System algorithm to scramble data as it is read from and written to a computer hard disk. But both programs leave the keys in computer memory in an unencrypted form.    ''The software world tends not to think about these issues,'' said Matt Blaze, an associate professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. ''We tend to make assumptions about the hardware. When we find out that those assumptions are wrong, we're in trouble.''   Both of the software publishers said they ship their operating systems with the file encryption turned off. It is then up to the customer to turn on the feature.   Executives of Microsoft said BitLocker has a range of protection options that they referred to as ''good, better and best.''    Austin Wilson, director of Windows product management security  at Microsoft, said the company recommended that BitLocker be used in some cases with additional hardware security. That might include either a special U.S.B. hardware key, or a secure identification card that generates an additional key string.    The Princeton researchers acknowledged that in these advanced modes, BitLocker encrypted data  could not be accessed using the vulnerability they discovered.   An Apple spokeswoman said that the security of the  FileVault system could also be enhanced by using a secure card to add to the strength of the key.   The researchers said they began exploring the utilities for vulnerabilities last fall after seeing a reference to the persistence of data in memory in a technical paper written by computer scientists at Stanford in 2005.    The Princeton group included Seth D. Schoen of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, William Paul of Wind River Systems  and Jacob Appelbaum, an independent computer security researcher.   The issue of protecting information with disk encryption technology became prominent recently in a criminal case involving a Canadian citizen who late in 2006 was stopped by United States customs agents who said they had found child pornography on his computer.    When the agents tried to examine the machine later, they discovered that the data was protected by  encryption. The  suspect has refused to divulge his password. A federal agent testified in court that the only way to determine the password otherwise would be with a password guessing program, which  could take years.   A federal magistrate ruled recently that forcing the suspect to disclose the password would be unconstitutional.  "
"With Wireless Network, City Agencies Have More Eyes in More Places","Rigor mortis had set in by the time Joseph Mauro, a supervisor with the Department of Sanitation, drove by a dead opossum on Park Drive East in the Kew Gardens Hills section of Queens.   Checking a  map on the computer mounted on his dashboard, Mr. Mauro located a garbage truck a block away, and within a few minutes its two-person crew had scooped the opossum into the compactor.    ''Before, it would have taken 10 minutes to find a truck, bring it here and get this cleaned up,'' he said. ''Now, I can look right on the map.''Â    Locating vehicles is one of ways the Department of Sanitation and other city agencies are using the city's new $500 million high-speed wireless secure data network, one of the largest of its kind in the world. The network, known as Nycwin,  was built by Northrop Grumman and by summer's end will include about 400 cellular antennas covering 95 percent of the city.   The idea is for city agencies to use network-connected hand-held devices and tablet computers to increase efficiency and flexibility: Soon, police officers will be able to view photographs of suspects from their cars, fire chiefs will be able to watch live video of fires taken from traffic helicopters above, and housing inspectors will be capable of looking up building plans while on location.    ''This extends the office to the field,'' said Paul J. Cosgrave, the commissioner of the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, which has overseen the construction of the network. ''We traditionally grew in silos, but this network allows us to grow together.''   The need for a shared and secure network has been a priority since at least Sept. 11, 2001, when police and fire officials could not communicate at the World Trade Center because their radios operated on different frequencies.    Though Nycwin does not yet handle voice calls, it sends data about 50 times faster than the networks now used by emergency workers and lets all city departments share information more easily.   Oklahoma City, Tucson and Washington are among a handful of cities that are building similar networks, analysts said, and many others nationwide are considering following suit. The secure networks for municipal workers come after numerous emergencies during which commercial cellular networks operated by wireless phone companies quickly got overloaded.   Over time, Mr. Cosgrave said, the network could also save money, as the city cuts the number of wireless cards and data lines it buys or leases from phone companies. Satellite tracking services like the one the Sanitation Department is using could help supervisors devise more efficient routes, eventually cutting fuel costs.    And city officials and analysts said other benefits, like helping fire chiefs see different angles of the fires they are fighting, are invaluable.   ''It's not just a tangible return, but an intangible one,'' said Craig Settles, a consultant who advises municipalities on how to build wireless networks. ''When you put these networks in place, it changes the way cities do business.''    But labor unions representing municipal workers are worried that the network, which can track movements down to the minute, might be used to benchmark performance in ways that could penalize workers.   Satellite technology ''can be used for very good things to give the public service,'' said Harry Nespoli, president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association Local 831. ''But if they are going to turn around and nickel and dime my work force, I don't think that G.P.S. should be used for that.''   Sanitation Department supervisors in Queens have been the first to experiment with the new system.    Mr. Mauro logged on to the computer in his city car at 6:40 one recent morning before he left the department's truck depot near Kennedy Airport. He immediately saw a blue line, or geo-fence, outlining the Queens district that is roughly bordered by the Long Island Expressway, Grand Central Parkway, Cunningham Park and Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.   Three of the four garbage trucks on duty were heading north on the Van Wyck Expressway and one had already arrived in the district. One had barely left the depot by the 6:30  deadline. As each truck entered the district, Mr. Mauro's screen flashed red with an alert; a similar flash comes to supervisors whenever a truck leaves the district or encounters mechanical problems.   If a truck leaves late, that also generates an alert.   Upon arriving in the district, Mr. Mauro found a mechanical sweeper on Main Street. He honked at cars and trucks that were parked in the sweeper's path -- using the old-fashioned horn. But he used the screen to monitor the four sanitation trucks as they made their rounds, checking how many times the workers had compacted garbage. The new system would be especially helpful for a supervisor from, say, Staten Island, filling in if Mr. Mauro were sick.    ''I know every last pail on this route, but for the supervisor from out of town, it's different,'' Mr. Mauro said.   The Department of Environmental Protection wants to use the technology to eliminate the need for meter-readers to go door-to-door to monitor water usage. The city has installed 800 wireless water meters in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens that send readings every six hours over the network to a central computer. The city paid Con Edison $12.2 million to have its electric meter-readers collect data from the city's 850,000 water meters, too, through 2009.    As more wireless meters, which cost about $90 each, are installed, Con Edison will have fewer to read, and the Department of Environmental Protection can prune its contract.   Perhaps as important, the wireless meters give the city readings four times a day, rather than four times a year with the older meters. That should help resolve billing disputes.    Currently, when a customer complains about a bill, the department often sends an inspector out to see if there are leaks or other problems causing a spike in usage; the new meters will provide a more accurate picture of when consumption rose.   ''Some customers don't know why their rates went up suddenly, but now we have months of data,'' said Michael Roach, a manager in the Department of Environmental Protection's technical services division. ''We can bill precisely.'' "
Privacy Laws Trip Up Google's Expansion in Parts of Europe,"When Google began hiring in Zurich for its new engineering center in 2004, local officials welcomed the company with open arms. Google's arrival is still bearing fruit for Zurich: 450 people, 300 of them engineers, work in Google's seven-story complex in a converted brewery on the outskirts of the placid mountain metropolis.   But almost five years into its expansion into Europe -- where it has a headquarters in Dublin, large offices in Zurich and London, and smaller centers in countries like Denmark, Russia and Poland -- Google is getting caught in a web of privacy laws that threaten its growth and the positive image it has cultivated as a company dedicated to doing good.   In Switzerland, data protection officials are quietly pressing Google to scrap its plans to introduce Street View, a mapping service that provides a vivid, 360-degree, ground-level photographic panorama from any address, which would violate strict Swiss privacy laws that prohibit the unauthorized use of personal images or property.Â    In Germany, where Street View is also not available, simply taking photographs for the service violates privacy laws.   ''The privacy issue will likely become increasingly important for Google as it continues to offer new services in Europe,'' said Dirk Lewandowski, a professor of information sciences at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamburg. ''For the moment, most consumers are not aware their data is being used by Google in some fashion. But I think as people become aware of this, there could be protests that Google will have to address.''   The conflict does not end with Street View, which so far in Europe depicts only major cities in France, Spain and Italy.    Data protection advisers to the European Commission in Brussels are questioning Google over how long the company retains user logs -- the files containing an individual's queries typed into Google search fields. A panel of regulators wants Google, as well as Yahoo and Microsoft, to purge the records after six months.    Google says it needs the data for nine months to hone its search engine to reflect the constant changes in contextual meaning caused by news and events. Before October, Google retained the records in the European Union for 18 months. Yahoo keeps records for 13 months and MSN, Microsoft's search service, for 18 months. European officials are trying to persuade Google and the others to comply, but have not ruled out asking the commission to intervene.   Nelson Mattos, a vice president responsible for Google's 12 engineering centers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said he was confident the company would reach a compromise with the authorities. In an interview in Zurich, Mr. Mattos said Street View would be added in Switzerland and Germany ''at some point.'' But he declined to say when that might be.   ''Google is committed to making sure the data of its users is well protected and not misused,'' he said. ''Europe has a history of innovation. Where it has not always done as good a job in my opinion is in follow-on innovation, in commercializing the innovation. If you restrict too much how a company like Google can innovate, that will restrict the follow-on benefits in Europe.''   To enhance its profile among European decision makers, Google has bolstered its presence in government centers around Europe. The company now has enough employees to fill three floors of an office building in downtown Brussels. In five years, Google has hired about 3,500 people in Europe for its regional headquarters in Dublin, its larger offices in London and Zurich, and at smaller centers in Krakow, Poland; St. Petersburg, Russia; and Aarhus, Denmark.   Many of the company's most recent innovations, like elements of its new Chrome Web browser, an analytic tool called Trends and a mass transportation trip planner called Transit, have been conceived or improved in Europe.   The engineering center in Zurich helped speed up the functioning of Video ID, an automated video search service that allows video and music copyright owners to sweep YouTube, the largest online Web video-sharing site, to detect illegal uploads. Google bought YouTube in October 2006.   Introduced a year ago, Video ID is being used by 300 companies, including Lionsgate Entertainment, Sony Music Entertainment and the Italian broadcaster RAI. In 90 percent of cases, says Patrick Walker, director of partnerships at YouTube in London, companies choose not to block the illegal footage; instead they run advertisements next to the homegrown uploads, splitting the revenue with YouTube.   ''It has basically allowed all types of rights holders for the first time to protect their content on the Web,'' Mr. Walker said, ''and in most cases, has opened up a whole new way for companies to make money off of their inventories.''   Some of Google's technical advances are starting to impress some European policy makers. At a conference in Brussels in October, the European commissioner for Internet issues, Viviane Reding, said Video ID ''ensures that rights owners regain sovereignty over the exploitation of their work.''   In Switzerland, Google has so far agreed to block Street View, said Bruno Baeriswyl, the director of Privatim, the privacy agency for the Canton of Zurich.    The data protection agency Edob is also in talks with Google because a Swiss law that took effect Jan. 1 requires all companies in Switzerland that maintain databases on individuals to disclose to the agency how they manage the information.   ''We have been in contact with Google about different topics,'' said Eliane Schmid, a spokesman for the agency, called the Eidgenossicher Datenschutz und Offentlichkeitsbeauftragter. ''These are initial contacts and as such not of an official nature. Therefore, you will understand that any details remain confidential for the moment.''   In Germany, opposition to Street View is more visible. In Kiel, a town on the Baltic Sea coast, officials are threatening Google with fines and are distributing stickers for homeowners to display advising Google's photographers to take no pictures of their property for Street View.   ''What Google is doing with Street View violates German law,'' said Marit Hansen, deputy director of the Unabhangiges Landeszentrum fur Datenschutz in Schleswig-Holstein, the state in which Kiel is located. ''It's not enough that Google's Street View is not yet available in Germany. The simple photographing is in itself a violation.''   European consumers appear to be less worried than some regulators about the potential loss of privacy. ComScore, a research firm in Reston, Va., found that 8 in 10 Europeans used Google for online search queries.   ''The data protection agencies tend to be extreme,'' said Peter Heinzmann, chief executive of CN Lab, a Swiss company that makes software for Web cameras. ''But most people are voluntarily giving information to Google because they think the benefits outweigh the risks. So why restrict innovation?'' "
Panel Presses to Bolster Security in Cyberspace,"License plates may be coming to cyberspace.   A government and technology industry panel on cyber-security is recommending that the  federal government end its reliance on passwords and enforce what the industry describes as ''strong authentication.''    Such an approach would probably mean that all government computer users would have to hold a device to gain access to a network computer or online service. The commission is  also encouraging all nongovernmental commercial services use such a device.Â    ''We need to move away from passwords,'' said Tom Kellermann, vice president for security awareness at Core Security Technologies and a member of the commission that created the report.   The report, which offers guidance to the Obama administration,  is a strong indictment of government and private industry efforts to secure cyberspace to date. ''The laissez-faire  approach to cyber-security has failed,'' Mr. Kellermann said.   Restricting Internet access is one of a series of recommendations that a group of more than 60 government and business computer security specialists will make in a public presentation, ''Securing Cyberspace in the 44th Presidency,'' on  Monday.    The report  has been prepared during the last 18 months under the auspices of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington  policy group, after a number of break-ins into government computer systems.    ''The damage from cyber attack is real,'' the report states. ''Last year, the Departments of Defense, State, Homeland Security, and Commerce, NASA and the National Defense University all suffered major intrusions by unknown foreign entities.''   The report describes a laundry list of serious break-ins ranging from the hacking of the secretary of Defense's unclassified e-mail to the loss of ''terabytes'' of data at the State Department.   The group recommends the creation of a White House cyber-security czar reporting to the president and the consolidation of the powers that have largely  been held by the Homeland Security Department under the Bush administration. The report argues that cyber-security is one of the most significant national security threats and that it can no longer be relegated to information technology offices and chief information officers.    The commission included the top Democrat and Republican members of the House Homeland Security subcommittee that oversees cyber-security. The chairmen of the commission included Jim Langevin, a Democratic congressman from Rhode Island; and Michael McCaul, a Republican congressman from Texas.    Scott Charney, corporate vice president for trustworthy computing at Microsoft; and Harry D. Raduege Jr., a retired Air Force lieutenant general  who is chairman of the Center for Network Innovation at Deloitte & Touche, were also on the commission.   The report calls for  new laws and regulations governing cyberspace.    ''We believe that cyberspace cannot be secured without regulation,'' the report said. The proposed regulations included new standards for critical infrastructure providers like the finance and energy industries, as well as new federal product acquisition rules to force more secure products.   The report does not entirely reject the work of the Bush administration. It cites the creation of the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, adopted by the government as part of a presidential memorandum issued last January as a good starting point for remaking the nation's cyber-security strategy.    That effort has led to a commitment by the federal  government to spend more than $30 billion in the next seven years to enhance computing security. "
Web Privacy On the Radar In Congress," Here are some things Internet users can discover about Kiyoshi Martinez, a 24-year-old man from Mokena, Ill., from some of his recent posts online. He watched ''The Colbert Report'' on Tuesday night, he likes the musician Lenlow and he received bottles of olive oil and vinegar for his birthday. Mr. Martinez has Facebook and LinkedIn pages, a Twitter account and a Web site that includes his resume. So it is surprising to learn that Mr. Martinez, an aide in the Illinois Senate, is also vigilant about his privacy online. ''I'm pretty aware of the fact that anything you do on the Internet pretty much should just be considered public,'' Mr. Martinez said. While he knows that companies are collecting his data and often tracking his online habits so they can show him more relevant ads, he said, he would like to see more transparency ''about what the company intends to do with your data and your information.''Â  ''Like all privacy matters, it's something that people need to be informed on,'' Mr. Martinez said. Those same questions of data collection and privacy policies are attracting the attention of Congress, too. There is no broad privacy legislation governing advertising on the Internet. And even some in the government admit that they do not have a clear grasp of what companies are able to do with the wealth of data now available to them. ''That is why Congress, at this point, is wanting to gather a lot more information, because no one knows,'' said Steven A. Hetcher, a professor at Vanderbilt University Law School. ''That information is incredibly valuable; it's the new frontier of advertising.'' Beyond the data question, there are issues of how companies should tell browsers that their information is being tracked, which area of law covers this and what -- if anything -- proper regulation would look like. On Aug. 1, four top members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce sent letters ordering 33 cable and Internet companies, including Google, Microsoft, Comcast and Cox Communications, to provide details about their privacy standards. That followed House and Senate hearings last month about privacy and behavioral targeting, in which advertisers show ads to consumers based on their travels around the Web. If an advertiser knows that Mr. Martinez watches ''The Colbert Report,'' for example, it might show him an ad for ''The Daily Show.'' As advertisers become more sophisticated about behavioral targeting, and online privacy standards become increasingly varied, regulators and privacy advocates are becoming concerned. A few companies have taken precautionary measures to try to fend off criticism; in the last few days, for instance, both Yahoo and Google have made it easier for people to opt out of targeted ads on their sites. But that may not be enough. ''Some type of omnibus electronic privacy legislation is needed,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, ''regardless of the particular technologies or companies involved.'' He and the other members of the House expect to receive responses from all of the companies by early this week. With the responses to the House letters, ''we can understand exactly what each sector of the communications industry is technically capable of doing, and how they use the information once they do get access to it.'' One of the controversial new behavioral-targeting technologies is called deep packet inspection, and a company that does it -- NebuAd -- was a focus of the July Congressional hearings. In NebuAd's version of deep packet inspection, a hardware device is put into an Internet service provider's network that can track where users are going online. NebuAd looks for categories that the user will be interested in. If the device notes that a user is browsing or searching for sites about German automobiles, it can deliver an ad about German automobiles later that day, even when the user is on a site about pets. NebuAd's chief executive, Bob Dykes, who testified at the hearings last month, said his company protects privacy. ''We don't have any raw data on the identifiable individual,'' Mr. Dykes said in an interview last month. ''Everything is anonymous.'' He said NebuAd took several steps to ensure that the information could not be traced back to an individual or an Internet protocol address. The company avoids sensitive categories, he said; someone making a search about H.I.V., for example, would not see related ads. And NebuAd cannot gain access to secure sites. Mr. Dykes came under scrutiny at the hearings for NebuAd's technology and for how the company notified consumers. The ways that some Internet service providers told consumers about their tracking were vague or too subtle, some privacy advocates and congressmen said. NebuAd lost several customers this summer amid all the scrutiny, including CenturyTel, Charter Communications, WideOpenWest Holdings and Embarq. ''We will not be using this technology again until such time as all the privacy concerns have been addressed,'' said Charles Fleckenstein, an Embarq spokesman. Mr. Dykes said, ''We are perfectly O.K. for some of our partners to wait until we have a better, more informed education of the public and folks in Washington before they resume their rollout.'' The NebuAd controversy illustrates the difficulty of regulation in online advertising, when new ways of tracking users arise regularly and companies have different ways of handling data. The Federal Trade Commission has made some tentative steps toward standards, including a December proposal on behavioral-advertising practices. The proposal suggested that companies provide a clear notice to consumers that lets them opt out of tracking, notify consumers if the company changes the way it uses the data and use reasonable security measures. It also sought comment on several matters. But Lydia B. Parnes, the director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection, has said she supports industry self-regulation, saying that it isn't yet clear that the consumer is being harmed and that regulations might be too specific to current technologies. Laws have been made on slices of the privacy pie, including data about finances or children. But complying with various pieces of legislation is difficult, companies said. ''Compliance is becoming very complex and not very clear in terms of what applies to a new and emerging business model,'' said Mike Hintze, the associate general counsel at Microsoft. ''From the company's perspective of trying to comply with these laws, we thought a comprehensive federal privacy law made a lot of sense.'' There is some industry support for a comprehensive law, but any wide-ranging law would require some legal wrangling. ''They're raising these bigger-picture questions, and those questions are inherently intertwined not just with privacy laws, but also with contract law, computer-intrusion law, consumer-fraud law,'' said Andrea M. Matwyshyn, an assistant professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ''When legislators are trying to regulate in this area, they're always caught a little bit between a rock and a hard place,'' she said. ''You don't want to adopt a technology-specific standard that's destined to fail as technology advances faster than the law can ever hope to embody. At the same time, you need to allow adequate specificity in the law to allow companies to comply with it and allow consumers to know what their rights are.'' Some advertising industry groups say self-regulation is enough. The most prominent programs are the Online Privacy Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative. Both ask members to follow principles on notifying consumers and avoiding personally identifiable information. Regulation is ''certainly going to have unintended consequences and unintended impact,'' said Mike Zaneis, the vice president for public policy at the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a coalition of online advertisers. Some civil liberties groups disagreed. ''There's a self-regulatory program out there which hasn't been very effective,'' said Alissa Cooper, the chief computer scientist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. She said her organization was concerned about NebuAd's technology. As for general federal privacy legislation, she said, the center supports it but thinks more information is needed about data-handling. The letter from the House committee, she said, was ''a really welcome development in the absence of any kind of regulation.'' ''The companies don't feel the need to explain everything they're doing,'' she said, ''so a little bit of pressure from Congress or the F.T.C. can go a long way.'' As government representatives think about legislation, they are also trying to gauge how aware and concerned consumers are about online privacy. A recent study of about 1,000 Internet users asked them if they agreed with the statement that they were comfortable with advertisers' using their browsing history to decide what ads to show them. Thirty-nine percent strongly disagreed; only 6 percent strongly agreed. The study was conducted by TNS Global, a research firm, and TRUSTe, an online privacy network. Is privacy a concern for younger consumers, who are splashing personal details all over MySpace? The sparse data available suggest that it is. A study last year of 2,274 British adults showed that people ages 18 to 24 considered privacy tied with ''avoiding hate and offense'' as the most important consideration in digital technologies. For older people, privacy was second to ''avoiding hate and offense.'' The study was conducted by YouGov, a British research firm. ''People my age -- in their 20s or in their 30s -- a lot of them are very clued up on protecting privacy on the Internet,'' said Ben Saxon, 23, a student in Cambridge, England. He has started a Facebook group objecting to Phorm, a NebuAd-like company that is working in Britain and is starting to court the United States market. Still, he said, ''I don't think complete privacy on the Internet is actually possible anymore.'' Correction: August 12, 2008, Tuesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about Congressional attention to privacy issues on the Internet misstated a word in a quotation from Andrea M. Matwyshyn, a Wharton School assistant professor who commented on the breadth of the problem. She said the legal questions were intertwined not only with privacy and contract law, but also with ''computer-intrusion law,'' not ''consumer-intrusion law.'' "
"To Aim Ads, Web Is Keeping Closer Eye on What You Click","A famous New Yorker cartoon from 1993 showed two dogs at a computer, with one saying to the other, ''On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog.''    That may no longer be true.   A new analysis of online consumer data shows that large Web companies are learning more about people than ever from what they search for and do on the Internet, gathering clues about the tastes and preferences of a typical user several hundred times a month.   These companies use that information to predict what content and advertisements people most likely want to see. They can charge steep prices for carefully tailored ads because of their high response rates.   The analysis, conducted for The New York Times by the research firm comScore, provides what advertising executives say is the firstbroad estimate of the amount of consumer data that is transmitted to Internet companies.Â    Privacy advocates have previously sounded alarms about the practices of Internet companies and provided vague estimates about the volume of data they collect, but they did not give comprehensive figures.   The Web companies are, in effect, taking the trail of crumbs people leave behind as they move around the Internet, and then analyzing them to anticipate people's next steps. So anybody who searches for information on such disparate topics as iron supplements, airlines, hotels and soft drinks may see ads for those products and services later on.   Consumers have not complained to any great extent about data collection online. But privacy experts say that is because the collection is invisible to them. Unlike Facebook's Beacon program, which stirred controversy last year when it broadcast its members' purchases to their online friends, most companies do not flash a notice on the screen when they collect data about visitors to their sites.    ''When you start to get into the details, it's scarier than you might suspect,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy rights group. ''We're recording preferences, hopes, worries and fears.''   But executives from the largest Web companies say that privacy fears are misplaced, and that they have policies in place to protect consumers' names and other personal information from advertisers. Moreover, they say, the data is a boon to consumers, because it makes the ads they see more relevant.   These companies often connect consumer data to unique codes identifying their computers, rather than their names.   ''What is targeting in the long term?'' said Michael Galgon, Microsoft's chief advertising strategist. ''You're getting content about things and messaging about things that are spot-on to who you are.''   The rich troves of data at the fingertips of the biggest Internet companies are also creating a new kind of digital divide within the industry. Traditional media companies, which collect far less data about visitors to their sites, are increasingly at a disadvantage when they compete for ad dollars.   The major television networks and magazine and newspaper companies ''aren't even in the same league,'' said Linda Abraham, an executive vice president at comScore. ''They can't really play in this sandbox.''   During the Internet's short life, most people have used a yardstick from traditional media to measure success: audience size. Like magazines and newspapers, Web sites are most often ranked based on how many people visit them and how long they are there.   But on the Internet, advertisers are increasingly choosing where to place their ads based on how much sites know about Web surfers. ComScore's analysis is a novel attempt to estimate how many times major Web companies can collect data about their users in a given month.   Web companies once could monitor the actions of consumers only on their own sites. But over the last couple of years, the Internet giants have spread their reach by acting as intermediaries that place ads on thousands of Web sites, and now can follow people's activities on far more sites.   Large Web companies like Microsoft and Yahoo have also acquired a number of companies in the last year that have rich consumer data.   ''So many of the deals are really about data,'' said David Verklin, chief executive of Carat Americas, an ad agency in the Aegis Group that decides where to place ads for clients.   ''Everyone feels that if we can get more data, we could put ads in front of people who are interested in them,'' he said. ''That's the whole idea here: put dog food ads in front of people who have dogs.''   Web companies also can collect more data as people spend more time online. The number of searches that American Web users enter each month has nearly doubled since summer of 2006, to 14.6 billion searches in January, according to comScore.   ComScore analyzed 15 major media companies' potential to collect online data in December. The analysis captured how many searches, display ads, videos and page views occurred on those sites and estimated the number of ads shown in their ad networks.   These actions represented ''data transmission events'' -- times when consumer data was zapped back to the Web companies' servers. Five large Web operations -- Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, AOL and MySpace -- record at least 336 billion transmission events in a month, not counting their ad networks.   The methodology was worked out with comScore and based on the advice of senior online advertising executives at two of the largest Internet companies.    ''I think it's a reasonable way to look at how many touch-points companies have with their consumers,'' Jules Polonetsky, the chief privacy officer for AOL, said of the comScore findings on Friday.    But Mr. Polonetsky cautions that not all of the data at every company is used together. Much of it is stored separately.   The information transmitted might include the person's ZIP code, a search for anything from vacation information to celebrity gossip, or a purchase of prescription drugs or other intimate items. Some types of data, like search queries, tends to be more valuable than others.   Yahoo came out with the most data collection points in a month on its own sites -- about 110 billion collections, or 811 for the average user. In addition, Yahoo has about 1,700 other opportunities to collect data about the average person on partner sites like eBay, where Yahoo sells the ads.   MySpace, which is owned by the News Corporation, and AOL, a unit of Time Warner, were not far behind.   ComScore said it recorded the ad networks using different methods and that the exact ordering of these top companies might vary with a different methodology, but the overall picture would be similar.   Google also has scores of data collection events, but the company says it is unique in that it mostly uses only current information rather than past actions to select ads.   The depth of Yahoo's database goes far in explaining why AOL is talking with Yahoo about a merger and Microsoft is willing to pay more than $41.2 billion to acquire the company.   Traditional media companies come in far behind.   Conde Nast magazine sites, for example, have only 34 data collection events for the average site visitor each month. The numbers for other traditional media companies, as generated by comScore, were 45 for The New York Times Company; 49 for another newspaper company,  the McClatchy Corporation; and 64 for the Walt Disney Company.   Some companies are trying to close the gap. Walt Disney, for example, is studying how to combine data from its divisions like ESPN, Disney and ABC. The News Corporation is exploring ways to use information that MySpace members post on that siteto select ads for those members when they visit other News Corporation sites.   IAC is using data from its LendingTree  site to deliver ads on its other sites to people it knows are looking for mortgages.   Some advertising executives say media companies will  have little choice but to outsource  their ad sales to companies like Microsoft and Yahoo to benefit from their data. The Web companies may prove they can use their algorithms and consumer information to better select which ads for visitors better than media companies can.   ''I think a lot of publishers are going to find they don't have enough data,'' said David W. Kenny, chief executive of Digitas, a digital advertising agency in the Publicis Groupe. ''There's only going to be a handful of big players who can manage the data.''    People who spend more time on the Internet, of course, will have more information transmitted about them. The comScore per-person figures are averages; occasional Web users have far less transmitted about them.   The comScore figures do not include the data that consumers offer voluntarily when registering for sites or e-mail services. When consumers do so, they often give sites permission to link some of their interests or searches to their user name.   The figures also do not account for information people enter on social network pages. MySpace, for example, collects billions of user actions each day in the form of blogs, comments and profile updates, said Peter Levinsohn, president of Fox Interactive Media, which owns MySpace.   Even with all the data Web companies have, they are finding ways to obtain more. The giant Internet portals have been buying ad-delivery companies like DoubleClick and Atlas, which have stockpiles of information. Atlas, for example, delivers 6 billion ads every day. The comScore figures do not capture such data.   Executives from Web companies said they had been working toinformconsumers on their data practices.   These companies  noted their consumer-protection policies. AOL, for example, lets users opt out of some ad targeting, Google lets users edit the search histories that are linked to their user names, Yahoo is working on a  policy to obscure people's computer identification addresses that are connected to search results, and Microsoftsays it does not link any of its visitors' behavior to their user names, even if those people are registered.   A study of California adults last year found that 85 percent thought sites should not be allowed to track their behavior around the Web to show them ads, according to the Samuelson Law, Technology & Public Policy Clinic at the University of California at Berkeley, which conducted the study.

YouTube Agrees to Share Viewer Data,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Defendants and plaintiffs in two copyright infringement lawsuits against YouTube have reached a deal to protect the privacy of millions of YouTube watchers during evidence discovery, a spokesman for Google said late Monday.Â    Earlier in July, a federal judge in Manhattan ordered Google to turn over YouTube user data to Viacom and other plaintiffs to help them to prepare a confidential study of what they argue are vast piracy violations on the video-sharing site.   Google said it had now agreed to provide lawyers for Viacom and a class-action group led by the Football Association of England, a large  viewership database that blanks out YouTube username and Internet address data that could be used to identify individual video watchers.   ''We have reached agreement with Viacom and the class-action group,'' a  Google spokesman, Ricardo Reyes, said. ''They have agreed to let us anonymize YouTube user data.''    Viacom, owner of movie studio Paramount and MTV Networks, requested the information as part of its $1 billion copyright infringement lawsuit against the  online video service YouTube and its parent, Google.   Judge Louis Stanton of  Federa l District Court in Manhattan  ordered Google on July 1 to turn over as evidence a database with usernames of YouTube viewers, what videos they watched when, and users' computer addresses.   Privacy advocates from the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other groups argued in response that the order ''threatens to expose deeply private information'' and violated the 1988 Video Privacy Protection Act.   Viacom said at the time that it needed the data to demonstrate video piracy patterns that are the heart of its case against YouTube. But it sought to diffuse privacy fears, saying it had no interest in identifying individual users.   One outstanding disagreement between the two parties is on how to handle the YouTube viewership data of YouTube and Google employees, which Judge Stanton also had ordered YouTube to turn over.   Mr. Reyes said the agreement covered not just employees of the defendants, but also those of companies tied to the plaintiffs, including Viacom and the Football Association Premiere League.   The sides agreed that the new data privacy agreement did not cover employees and that they would work out how to share this data  in coming weeks.   YouTube faces two separate, but parallel lawsuits, that for purposes of preliminary motions and evidence discovery are being treated as one. Viacom filed the first lawsuit, and a separate class-action was later filed by English Premiere League soccer, several other European sports leagues, along with music publishers and videographers. The cases are unlikely to come to trial before 2009 or 2010.   "
Larger Prey Are Targets Of Phishing,"An  e-mail scam aimed squarely at the nation's top executives is raising new alarms about the ease with which people and companies can be deceived by online criminals.    Thousands of high-ranking executives across the country have been receiving e-mail messages this week that appear to be official subpoenas from the United States District Court in San Diego. Each message includes the executive's name, company and phone number, and commands the recipient to appear before a grand jury in a civil case.    A link embedded in the message purports to offer a copy of the entire subpoena. But a recipient who tries to view the document unwittingly downloads and installs software that secretly records keystrokes and sends the data to a remote computer over the Internet. This lets the criminals capture passwords and other personal or corporate information. Â    Another piece of the software allows the computer to be controlled remotely. According to researchers who have analyzed the downloaded file, less than 40 percent of commercial antivirus programs were able to recognize and intercept the attack.   The tactic of aiming at the rich and powerful with an online scam is referred to by computer security experts as whaling. The term is a play on phishing, an approach that usually involves tricking e-mail users -- in this case the big fish -- into divulging personal information like credit card numbers. Phishing attacks that are directed at a particular person, rather than blasted out to millions, are also known as spear phishing.   The latest campaign has been  widespread enough that two California federal courts and the administrative office of the United States Courts posted warnings about the fake messages on their Web sites. Federal officials said they stopped counting after getting hundreds of phone calls from corporations about the messages. At midday on Tuesday, one antispam company, MX Logic, said in a Web posting that its service was still seeing at least 30 of the messages an hour.   Security researchers at several firms indicated they believed there had been at least several thousand victims of the attack whose computers had been compromised.   ''We have seen about 2,000 victims, more or less,'' said John Bambenek, a security researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a volunteer at the Internet Storm Center, a network security organization.    Researchers were studying a list of the Internet addresses of infected computers that iDefense Labs, a research unit of VeriSign, had assembled by monitoring network traffic.     Personalized scam messages have been on the radar of security researchers and law enforcement officials for several years, but the latest variant is a fresh indication of the threat posed by such digital ruses.   ''I think that it was well done in terms of something people would feel compelled to respond to,'' said Steve Kirsch, the chief executive of Abaca, an antispam company based in San Jose, Calif.    Mr. Kirsch himself received a copy of the message and forwarded it to the company lawyer. ''It had my name, phone number, company and correct e-mail address on it and looked pretty legitimate,'' Mr. Kirsch said. ''Even the U.R.L. to find out more looked legitimate at first glance.''   When the lawyer tried to download a copy of the subpoena and the computer restarted itself, they quickly realized that the file contained malicious software.   Several computer security researchers said that the attack was the work of a group that tried a similar assault in November 2007. In that case, the e-mail message appeared to come from the Justice Department and stated that a complaint had been filed against the recipient's company.   The software used in the latest attack tries to communicate with a computer in Singapore. That system was still functioning on Tuesday evening, but security researchers said many Internet service providers had blocked access to it.    A number of clues, like misspellings, in the fake subpoena led several researchers to believe that the attackers were not familiar with the United States court system and that the group might be based in a place that used a British variant of English, such as Hong Kong.    ''This is probably Chinese-based,'' said Mr. Bambenek. ''If all the key players are in China there is not much the F.B.I. can do.''   Several security researchers said that the real danger of the attack lay in a second level of deception, after the hidden software provided the attackers with digital credentials like passwords and electronic certificates.   ''There are very subtle nuances to their attacks that are well known in the financial industry but are not well publicized,'' said Matt Richard, director of the Rapid Response Team at iDefense.    Mr. Richard said the criminals were going after a particular area of the financial industry, but he would not elaborate. He said that law enforcement officials were investigating the fraudulent documents.   Calls to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for comment were not returned.   Although the software package used to deliver the eavesdropping program is well known, it was hidden in such a way that it avoided detection by commercial programs in many cases, researchers said.   ''This is pretty well-known code,'' said Don Jackson, a researcher at SecureWorks, a computer security firm. ''The issue has to do with repacking it.''   Recipients of the  e-mail messages are directed to a fraudulent Web site with a copy of the graphics from the real federal court site.  They are then asked to download and install what is said to be a piece of software from Adobe that is used to view electronic documents.   ''There are several layers of social engineering involved here,'' said Mike Haro, a spokesman for Sophos, a company that sells software to protect against malicious software and spam. "
"With Security at Risk, a Push to Patch the Web","Since a secret emergency meeting  of computer security experts at Microsoft's headquarters in March, Dan Kaminsky has been urging companies around the world to  fix a potentially dangerous flaw in the basic plumbing of the Internet.    While Internet service providers are racing to fix the problem, which makes it possible for criminals to divert users to fake Web sites where personal and financial information can be stolen, Mr. Kaminsky worries that they have not moved quickly enough.    By his estimate, roughly 41 percent of the Internet is still vulnerable. Now  Mr. Kaminsky, a technical consultant who first discovered the problem, has been ramping up the pressure on companies and organizations to make the necessary software changes before criminal hackers take advantage of the flaw.     Next week, he will take another step by publicly laying  out the details of the flaw at a security conference in Las Vegas. That should force computer network administrators to fix millions of affected systems. Â    But his explanation    of the flaw will also make it easier    for criminals to exploit it, and steal passwords and other personal information.   Mr. Kaminsky walks a fine line between protecting millions of computer users and eroding consumer confidence in Internet banking and shopping.  But he is among those experts who think that full disclosure of security threats can push network administrators to take action. ''We need to have disaster planning, and we need to worry,'' he said.    The flaw that Mr. Kaminsky discovered is in the Domain Name System, a kind of automated phone book that converts human-friendly addresses like google.com into machine-friendly numeric counterparts.   The potential consequences of the flaw are  significant. It could allow a criminal to redirect Web traffic secretly, so that a person typing a bank's actual Web address would be sent to  an impostor   site set up to steal the user's name and password. The user might have no clue about the misdirection, and unconfirmed reports in the Web community indicate that attempted attacks are already under way.    The problem is analogous to the risk of phoning directory assistance at, for example, AT&T, asking for the number for Bank of America and being given an illicit number at which an operator masquerading as a bank employee asks for your account number and password.   The online flaw and the rush to repair it are an urgent reminder that the Internet remains a sometimes anarchic jumble of jurisdictions. No single person or group can step in to protect the online transactions of millions of users. Internet security rests on the shoulders of people like Mr. Kaminsky, a director at IOActive, a computer security firm,  who had to persuade other experts that the problem was real.    ''This drives home the risk people face, and the consumer should get the message,'' said Ken Silva, chief technology officer of VeriSign, which administers Internet addresses ending in .com and .net. ''Don't just take for granted all the things that machines are doing for you.''   When Mr. Kaminsky, 29, announced the flaw on July 8, he said he would wait a month to release details about it, in the hope that he could spur managers of computer systems around the world to fix them with a software patch before attackers could figure out how to exploit it.   Last week, however, accurate details of the flaw were briefly published online by a computer security firm,  apparently by accident. Now security experts are holding their breath to see whether the patching of as many as nine million affected computers around the world will happen fast enough.   ''People are taking this pretty seriously and patching their servers,'' Mr. Silva said.    Major  Internet service providers in the United States this week  indicated that in most cases, the software patch, which makes the flaw much more difficult  to exploit, was already in place or soon would be.    Comcast and Verizon, two of the largest  providers, said they had fixed the problem for their customers. AT&T said it was in the process of doing so.     But the problem is a global one, and the length of time required to fix it could leave many Web users vulnerable for weeks or months. And there are millions of places around the world  where people might find themselves vulnerable to potential attacks, ranging from their workplaces to an airport lounge or an Internet cafe.   Individuals and small companies with some technical skills can protect themselves  by changing the network preferences of their computer settings  so that they use the domain name servers of a Web service called OpenDNS (www.opendns.com).     Some computer systems are immune to the flaw. About 15 percent of domain name servers in the United States and 40 percent in Europe, including those at major Internet providers like America Online and Deutsche Telekom, use software from a Dutch company called PowerDNS, which is not vulnerable.   Still, much of the Internet remains vulnerable.   ''I'm watching people patch, and I realize this is not an easy thing to do,'' Mr. Kaminsky said in an interview.    The flaw, which Mr. Kaminsky stumbled across in February, had been overlooked for more than two decades. The eureka moment came when he was idly contemplating a different security threat.  He suddenly realized that it would be possible to guess crucial information about the protocol that domain name servers  use to convert the numerical Web addresses.    Mr. Kaminsky worried about his discovery for several days and then contacted Paul Vixie, a software engineer who runs the Internet Systems  Consortium and is responsible for maintaining a widely used version of software for domain name servers, known as BIND. Almost immediately, software engineers who looked at the vulnerability realized that Mr. Kaminsky had found  a significant weakness.   In March, Microsoft held the secret meeting at its headquarters in Redmond, Wash. Sixteen representatives from security organizations and companies, including Cisco, talked about ways to combat the potential threat.    But after several delays while vendors fixed their software,   Mr. Kaminsky went public.    For Mr. Kaminsky, the discovery and his subsequent warning to the Internet community were the culmination of an almost decade-long career as a security specialist. He was spotting bugs in software for Cisco and contributing to a book on computer security while still in college.     ''I play this game to protect people,'' he said.   He thinks that it is necessary to publish information about security threats to motivate system operators to protect themselves. Otherwise, ''You don't get to tell the river you need more time until it floods,'' he said.   He said that he had initially hoped to give the Internet community a head start of a full month to fix the problem, but his plan was foiled when technical details were briefly posted online last week.  ''I would have liked more time, but we got 13 days and I'm proud of that,'' he said.   The new flaw has sharpened the debate over how to come up with a long-term solution to the broader problem of the lack of security in the Domain Name System, which was invented in 1983 and was not created with uses like online banking in mind.   While Mr. Kaminsky is being hailed as a latter-day Paul Revere, Internet experts like Bruce Schneier, a member of the insular community that guards online security,  said flaws like this were a routine occurrence and no reason to stay off the Internet.    ''If there is a flaw in your car, it will get fixed eventually,'' said Mr. Schneier, the chief security technology officer for British Telecom. ''Most people keep driving.'' "
U.S. Charges 11 In Global Ring Of ID Theft,"Federal prosecutors have charged 11 people with stealing more than 41 million credit and debit card numbers, cracking what officials said on Tuesday appeared to be the largest hacking and identity theft ring ever exposed. The thieves focused on major national retail chains like OfficeMax, Barnes & Noble, BJ's Wholesale Club, the Sports Authority and T. J. Maxx -- the discount clothes retailer that first suggested the existence of the ring early last year, when it said its systems had been breached by hackers. Underscoring the multinational, collaborative aspect of organized crime today, three of the defendants are United States citizens, one is from Estonia, three are from Ukraine, two are from China and one is from Belarus. The name and whereabouts of the final defendant are unknown.Â  Federal officials said a principal organizer of the ring was Albert Gonzalez, a man from Miami who was indicted on Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Boston on charges of computer fraud, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, conspiracy and other charges. If convicted on all counts, Mr. Gonzalez would face life in prison. Mr. Gonzalez and several in his cohort drove around and scanned the wireless networks of retailers to find security holes -- known as ''war driving,'' according to prosecutors. Once the thieves identified technical weaknesses in the networks, they installed so-called sniffer programs, obtained from collaborators overseas. Those programs tapped into the retailers' networks for processing credit cards and intercepted customers' PINs and debit and credit numbers that were stored there. The thieves then spirited that information away to computers in the United States, Latvia and Ukraine. Officials say the conspirators sold credit card numbers online and imprinted other stolen numbers on the magnetic stripes of blank cards so that they could withdraw thousands of dollars from A.T.M.'s. ''Computer networks and the Internet are an indispensable part of the world economy. But even as they provide extraordinary opportunities for legitimate commerce and communication, they also provide extraordinary opportunities for criminals,'' said Michael B. Mukasey, the United States attorney general, at a news conference in Boston to announce the indictments. Mr. Gonzalez was first arrested by the Secret Service in 2003 on similar charges. He was subsequently placed on supervised pretrial release and became an informant to the agency in its campaign against organizers of ShadowCrew, a bulletin board where hackers traded stolen financial information. But prosecutors said that Mr. Gonzalez continued his criminal activities and tried to warn one of his conspirators, Damon Patrick Toey, to ensure that Mr. Toey would not be identified or arrested in the operation against ShadowCrew. Mr. Toey was among those indicted on Tuesday in Massachusetts. ''As soon as we became aware that Mr. Gonzalez was also working with criminals and getting them information, we immediately took action,'' said Mark Sullivan, director of the Secret Service. A lawyer for Mr. Gonzalez could not be located. To sell card numbers on the black market, the group turned to Maksym Yastremskiy of Ukraine and Aleksandr Suvorov of Estonia, who were also charged, according to prosecutors. Mr. Yastremskiy, thought to be a major figure in the international sale of stolen credit card information, was apprehended in July 2007 on vacation in Turkey and is in prison awaiting trial on charges including credit card theft. The United States has asked Turkey to extradite him. The indictments shed more light on the breach into the stores of TJX, the owner of T. J. Maxx. In 2005, Christopher Scott, another man who was charged, compromised wireless access points at a Marshalls in Miami and used them to download payment information from computers at TJX headquarters in Framingham, Mass., prosecutors said. The following year, prosecutors said, the conspirators established a virtual private network connection into TJX's payment processing server and successfully uploaded a sniffer program. In public financial filings, TJX said it had spent around $130 million on matters related to the break-in, including legal settlements, and it expected to spend an additional $23 million in the 2009 fiscal year. Federal officials did not have an overall tally for the amount of money stolen by the ring, but they offered some glimpses into its profitability. In the indictment against Mr. Gonzalez, federal officials asked that he be forced to forfeit more than $1.6 million, among other assets. ''These guys were obviously sophisticated and organized,'' said Toby Weiss, chief executive of Application Security, a database security firm. ''In this economy, we can't have people afraid to spend.'' "
High-Tech Crime Is an Online Bubble That Hasn't Burst,"There are no storefronts or corporate headquarters in the cybercrime industry, just savvy sellers in a murky, borderless economy who are moving merchandise by shilling credit card numbers -- ''two for the price of one.''   ''Sell fresh CC,'' promised one who offered teaser credit card numbers. ''Visa, MasterCard, Amex. Good Prices. Many countries.''Â    Electronic crime is maturing, according to security experts, and with its evolution, criminals are adopting conventional approaches like supermarket-style pricing and outsourcing to specialists who might act as portfolio managers or computer technicians.   ''It's a remarkable development of a whole alternative business environment that's occurred over the last couple years,'' said Richard Archdeacon, a senior director of global services for Symantec, an Internet security company with 11 research centers around the world. ''What's been so astonishing is the speed with which it's developed.''   In the United States alone, victims reported losses of $239 million to online fraud in 2007, with average losses running about $2,530. The complaints are recorded by a special Web-based hotline operated by the F.B.I. and the National White Collar Crime Center, a nonprofit corporation focusing on electronic crime.   The most common frauds were fake e-mail messages and phony Web pages, and the crimes were organized from the United States, Britain, Nigeria, Canada, Romania and Italy, according to an F.B.I. report issued last month.   Despite the increasing sophistication and elusiveness of online criminals, judges remain reluctant to order much jail time for computer crime, according to some national law enforcement officials and major companies like Microsoft.   A case in point is Owen Thor Walker, an 18-year-old hacker from New Zealand who pleaded guilty last week to criminal charges arising from his development of a vast international network of individual computers, which he had infected with hidden software, or ''malware,'' and remotely controlled.   In the parlance of the trade, he was a ''bot herder'' who offered his ''robot network'' for hire to a company in the Netherlands, which wanted to covertly install its advertising software.   Walker's borderless network first surfaced in an F.B.I. investigation of a computer attack in 2006 that caused the crash of a computer server at the University of Pennsylvania. The F.B.I. singled out a Pennsylvania student in the attack who ultimately led investigators to Mr. Walker.   Mr. Walker's sentencing is scheduled for May, but the judge on the case indicated that he would consider community detention and work release or some home detention for punishment of the teenager, who has Asperger syndrome, a mild form of autism marked by poor social skills and compulsive behavior.   ''Most of the time, it's very difficult for a judge to understand what's going on and what the risks are,'' said Eric Loermans, chief inspector of a Dutch high-tech crime unit.   Mr. Loermans was part of a cybercrime forum in Strasbourg last week that was convened by the Council of Europe to develop guidelines for closer international cooperation between law enforcement and Internet service providers. More than 200 people representing government agencies and private companies from Europe, Africa and the Americas participated in the conference.   Mr. Loermans's plainclothes high-tech unit now numbers about 25 people, but the police are also developing training programs for everyone on the staff down to the officer on the beat, according to Mr. Loermans.   ''Years ago, we saw cybercrime as a speciality,'' he said. ''Now we have added cybercrime in every form of police training, so we are raising the level of the entire Dutch police force. There's no crime anymore where there are no digital components built in.''   David Roberts, chief executive of the Corporate IT Forum, which represents 150 companies in Britain, said his group was pressing for a single confidential channel through which corporate security chiefs could report cybercrimes. "
Not Too Small to Appear On a Big No-Fly Watch List,"E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com A RESPONSE to last week's column about the chronic troubles of air travelers came from Christine Anderson, who says she was with her son Jack both times he was told that he was on the terrorist watch list.   The first time was in 2004, when Jack; his mother; his brothers Joey, then 8, and Joshua, then 5; and their grandmother, Susan, arrived at the airport in Minneapolis for a trip to Disney World.Â    ''The woman at the ticket counter demanded,  'Who is John Anderson?' '' Ms. Anderson recalled. She pointed at the baby stroller and said, ''He's right here.'' The suspect, then 2 years old, blinked his big blue eyes and happily gummed his pacifier.   ''That baby's on the no-fly watch list,'' the agent said.   His brothers became agitated. ''We're not going to Disney World!'' one of them wailed, according to Ms. Anderson.   After about an hour, the airline ascertained that the Jack in the stroller was not the Jack on the terrorist list, and the family made its flight.   Like business travelers I hear from every week, Jack was actually flagged because his name matches, or is similar to, the name of someone on the federal terrorist watch list. Like many travelers, Jack and his mother have been erroneously informed by airline clerks that their names are on the  list.    In fact, their names merely turn up on lists compiled by individual airlines,  which then check them against the federal data.    The Transportation Security Administration said on Monday that it planned to crack down on, and perhaps fine, airlines whose employees erroneously misinform passengers that they are on the terrorist watch list, rather than on an airline list.   ''We are very concerned with airline representatives telling people they're on a list when it's not appropriate,'' said Christopher White, a spokesman for the agency.    The confusion stems from federal procedures that prevent the agency from directly screening passengers in advance because of privacy concerns when  airlines provide passenger information to the government. As a result, the airlines have to compile a database of names and variants of names to check against the federal list. Once an innocent passenger shows up and voluntarily provides identification, airlines can then clear that person, case by case and trip by trip, as not being on the watch list.   Airlines say they are unfairly stuck with the logistical and financial burdens of ensuring that any given passenger is not on the federal list. The federal list contains names and aliases, and usually detailed personal information, about suspects, from information provided by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Airlines can collect only names and variants of names.   A program called Secure Flight, which will allow the T.S.A.  to screen passengers directly, has been stalled by the privacy concerns. But with public discontent growing over the current haphazard administration of the watch list at airports, it is now expected to  take effect next year.   That will be none too soon for the business travelers I hear from every week whose names raise a red flag when they fly. Christine Anderson will be among those welcoming it.   Her concern, she told me, goes beyond a mere hour's delay at the airport while Jack's name is cleared. It's more about the effect such a stigma has on people like Jack, she said.   Jack's brothers, of course, made a big deal about their baby brother being a terrorist suspect -- especially when it happened again two years later on another family trip when Jack, then 4, was taken aside.   ''I understand a delay at the airport is a small price to pay for security,'' Ms. Anderson said, adding: ''But it's more than just a delay. Jack's a sweet, sensitive boy. What will the ramifications be for him, years later? Kids don't rationalize like adults. His take on this is, 'I don't do bad things, but they say I do.' And you can't tell him differently.''   Since the last airport incident, the family has driven on vacations to avoid airport trouble for Jack. "
Facebook Aims to Extend Its Reach Across the Web,"Facebook, the Internet's largest social network, wants to let you take your friends with you as you travel the Web. But having been burned by privacy concerns in the last year, it plans to keep close tabs on those outings.    Facebook Connect, as the company's new feature is called, allows its members to log onto other Web sites using their Facebook identification and see their friends' activities on those sites. Like Beacon, the controversial advertising program that Facebook introduced and then withdrew last year after it raised a hullabaloo over privacy, Connect also gives members the opportunity to broadcast their actions on those sites to their friends on Facebook.   In the next few weeks, a number of prominent Web sites will weave this service into their pages, including those of the Discovery Channel and The San Francisco Chronicle, the social news site Digg, the genealogy network Geni and the online video hub Hulu.    Facebook Connect is representative of some surprising new thinking in Silicon Valley. Instead of trying to hoard information about their users, the Internet giants have all announced plans to share at least some of that data so people do not have to enter the same identifying information again and again on different sites. Â    Supporters of this idea say such programs will help with the emergence of a new ''social Web,'' because chatter among friends will infiltrate even sites that have been entirely unsociable thus far.    For example, a person might alert his Facebook friends to the fact that he is watching a video on CBS.com and invite them to join him there to watch together and discuss the video as it plays.   ''Everyone is looking for ways to make their Web sites more social,'' said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer. ''They can build their own social capabilities, but what will be more useful for them is building on top of a social system that people are already wedded to.''   MySpace, Yahoo and Google have all announced similar programs this year, using common standards that will allow other Web sites to reduce the work needed to embrace each identity system. Facebook, which is using its own data-sharing technology, is slightly ahead of its rivals.    The effort is particularly important for Facebook, which once represented the seemingly boundless promise of the Web 2.0 boom. It desperately wants to make certain the other Web companies do not supplant it and become the most popular hub for online socializing.    Facebook, with 120 million members worldwide, has also been under extra pressure to get its revenue to match its media hype and membership growth. Responding to reports that Facebook was looking for more capital after raising $235 million last year, Ms. Sandberg said she would not rule that out. ''There is a lot of interest in investing in us and we are always open to the right financing at the right price,'' she said.   The most immediate challenge confronting Facebook is to create an enduring stream of advertising revenue.    A survey last week from the research firm IDC suggested that social networks were a miserable place for advertisers: just 57 percent of all users of social networks clicked on an ad in the last year, and only 11 percent of those clicks led to a purchase, IDC said. And it turns out that marketers are not so interested in advertising on pages filled with personal trivia and relationship updates.   ''What in heaven's name made you think you could monetize the real estate in which somebody is breaking up with their girlfriend?'' Ted McConnell, a general manager at Procter & Gamble, asked last month at an industry conference.   This is where Facebook Connect could help. No money changes hands between Facebook and the sites using Connect, and executives are wary of discussing how it could bring in revenue. But there are some obvious possibilities.    Facebook has detailed information about its users: their real identities, what they like and dislike and whom they associate with. With a member's permission, it could use that data to help other Web sites deliver  more personalized ads. Similarly, those sites could tell Facebook what its users are doing elsewhere, helping to make its own ads more targeted.    ''It's becoming very clear that advertisers don't know how to advertise on Facebook,'' said Charlene Li, an independent consultant and social media analyst. ''But if you take a group of Facebook friends and put them on a travel site where they are spending more time and generating more ad dollars in a focused area like travel, that is an opportunity ripe for getting revenues back and sharing it.''   Facebook executives argue that Connect will naturally increase traffic on the site and increase ad revenue as a result. Ms. Sandberg said the company had no plans to explore any other advertising potential with Connect.    That reluctance is partly born of experience. Last year, Facebook was lambasted for its Beacon advertising program, which some thought failed to properly warn users that their actions on other sites were being shared on Facebook. Some users' purchases on e-commerce sites, for example, were broadcast to their friends, in some cases spoiling gift plans.    As a result, Facebook executives have been exceedingly circumspect with Connect, introducing it slowly and pitching it as a privacy tool. They argue that it allows users to set their privacy settings once on Facebook and then apply them on other sites.   Facebook has also taken other precautions. According to staff members at the political advocacy group MoveOn.org, which led the charge against Beacon, Facebook executives gave them an early briefing this summer about Connect.   For now, Facebook is also carefully authorizing each partner in the Connect program and reviewing how it will use data on Facebook members and discuss the feature publicly. It plans to allow Web sites to register themselves for Connect, without having to seek approval, in the next few weeks.   ''They so desperately want to avoid another Beacon,'' said an executive with a company that plans to use Connect but has been waiting for a green light from Facebook for months. This person did not want to be quoted by name criticizing Facebook.   When asked about the potential promises and pitfalls of Connect, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's  chief executive, said: ''We want to make the experience as lightweight and easy to use as possible. But we also have to make sure that people understand what's going on and have control over it.''   Executives at the social network MySpace, which has similar goals, are more outspoken in discussing their identification system.   ''There are so many important issues to get right,'' said Jason Oberfest, a vice president at MySpace. ''Consumers need to understand where their data is going and how it's being used.''   ''Then, if we can get the privacy issues right, if it's totally clear to the user what is happening, there is potential for advertising,'' Mr. Oberfest added. ''But certainly not without a lot of testing and consideration.'' "
Privacy Rights and Diseases,"The advertising trade group that proposed that people with cancer deserve more privacy protections than those with heart disease has adopted a new version of its guidelines for how ad networks use data about Internet users.Â    It is no longer trying to distinguish among different diseases. But it is drawing another line that may appear equally arbitrary: Whether people's Internet browsing indicate they actually have a disease, rather than are doing research about a medical topic.   ''General interest in a condition is not sensitive data,'' said J. Trevor Hughes, executive director of the Network Advertising Initiative.   Mr. Hughes said the new guidelines, which take effect later this month, impose tough protections on information gathered, for example ''on a community page for prostate cancer sufferers'' because anyone visiting such a page could be assumed to have the disease.    No such protections, however, need be accorded to someone reading a Web page that simply describes the symptoms or treatment of prostate cancer.    The reader of such a page might be researching the condition of a friend or relative. And thus it would not be intrusive if that person was shown a series of ads about the same disease, Mr. Hughes said.   Privacy advocates praised some aspects of the proposal, but said it did not go far enough.   ''They ended up with a low common denominator, not the lowest,'' said Ari Schwartz, the deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology. He said that the group needs to add rules for other sorts of advertising and data use, as when it is a particular advertiser, rather than a network, directing the ad.   These networks are of particular concern to privacy advocates because they increasingly are collecting a great deal of data and they are largely hidden from view.    Most Internet users have no way to know the networks exist and what they do. Any Web site can accept ads and thus feed data to an ever-changing array of networks.   Here's a crucial indicator that the trade group has not chosen to impose a particularly new or tough standard on itself: Mr. Hughes said that as far as he knows, none of the current advertising business at any of the group's members need to be curtailed as a result of the plan.

One Friend Facebook Hasn't Made Yet: Privacy Rights,"A co-worker apologized to me recently for being slow on a task. ''It's probably just your insomnia from last night,'' I said. She was confused about how I knew, but I reminded her we were Facebook friends, and that she had posted a ''status update'' about her sleeplessness.    It's a common phenomenon: people ''friending'' work colleagues on Facebook and then discovering that -- as Seinfeld's George Costanza would melodramatically put it -- ''worlds collide.'' I gained all sorts of insights into another young co-worker when her college friends left reminiscence-filled birthday wishes on her Facebook ''wall.''Â    Facebook was in the news this month for its disturbing policy of making it all but impossible for users to quit the site and erase their personal information. The issue was presented as one of privacy, which it is, but it is more precisely a matter of what the sociologist Erving Goffman called ''identity management,'' which takes on whole new levels on the Internet.   Goffman argued that people spend much of their lives managing their identity through ''presentation of self.'' Offline, people use clothing, facial expressions, and the revealing and withholding of personal information to convey to the world who they are, or who they want to be taken to be.   The physicality of the offline world provides built-in protections. When people talk to a group of friends, they can look around to see who is listening. When they buy a book or rent a video, if they pay in cash, no record is made connecting them to the transaction.    It's more complicated online. Social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace create identities for people, and disseminate information about them to large numbers of people. I am Facebook friends with Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, who is an avid ''twitterer.'' He uses the Twitter social network to send his friends frequent bulletins,  which feed into their Facebook pages, about his whereabouts (Hanoi, the other day) and what he is reading (a lot about telecom immunity).   This sort of sharing is unobjectionable because Mr. Omidyar is deciding what information he wants to put out. More problematic is the amount of unintended sharing going on. There have been countless stories of young people losing job offers when prospective employers find their MySpace pages and read tales of alcohol and drug use.    Most troubling of all is the growing inclination of Web sites to spread personal information without users'   consent. Facebook was rightly pilloried last fall when it introduced its Beacon service, which notified users' friends -- without the users' consent -- about online purchases. (Hey, Mary bought a pregnancy test!) Google Reader crossed a similar line when it began automatically sharing the news stories users read with their instant-messaging contacts.    It's no secret why Web sites like to spread information of this sort: they are looking for more ways to make more money. Users' privacy is giving way to Web sites' desire to market to their friends and family. Technology companies are also stockpiling personal information. Google has fought hard for its right to hold on to users' searches in a personally identifiable way.   What Web sites need to do -- and what the government should require them to do -- is give users as much control over their identities online as they have offline. Users should be asked if they want information to be viewable by others, and by whom: Their friends? Everyone in the world? Privacy settings, which allow for this kind of screening, should be prominent, clear  and easily managed. (I'm not sure I was part of the intended audience for my colleague's college-years anecdotes.)   Before Web sites disseminate information the user did not ask to share, like an online purchase, the user should be notified and should have to affirmatively ''opt in.'' It should be easy for users to disappear from a Web site that they have been part of, or simply to delete some information about themselves.   In a visit to the editorial board not long ago, a top Google lawyer made the often-heard claim that in the Internet age, people -- especially young people -- do not care about privacy the way they once did. It is a convenient argument for companies that make money compiling and selling personal data, but it's not true. Protests forced Facebook to modify Beacon and to ease its policies on deleting information. Push-back of this sort is becoming more common.   No one should have personal data stored or shared without their informed, active consent. If they still want to tell the world -- including job interviewers and employers -- about their wild weekends, they're on their own. "
"Google, Privacy And California","Google, Privacy And California   After I wrote about Google's spat with an advertising trade group over the company's refusal to put a link to its privacy policy on the home page of Google.com, I discovered that there is a California law on the subject. It requires the operator of a commercial Web site that collects personal information about users to ''conspicuously post its privacy policy'' on its home page or first ''significant'' page after entering the site.Â    But Google, which wants to keep its home page very simple, puts a link to its privacy policy on a page called ''About Google,'' which itself is one click away from the home page. A Google spokesman, Steve Langdon, said, ''By having a link to our privacy policy one click from our home page, and because the privacy policy is easily found by using the search box on the home page, we comply with this statute.''   Joanne McNabb, the chief of California's Office of Privacy Protection, declined to say whether Google was violating the law but said she intended to discuss the matter with the company.    Does Google's decision to do something different really matter? Google argues that anyone who is curious about its privacy policy can simply search Google to find it. Moreover, privacy policies are more about legal mumbo jumbo than useful information. Also, it is worth noting that Google says it makes far less use of the data it collects about its users than many other big Web companies.   On the other hand, it doesn't seem like it would be that hard for Google to put a single seven-letter word somewhere on its home page. SAUL HANSELL "
Google Told To Turn Over User Data Of YouTube,"A federal judge has ordered Google to turn over to Viacom its records of which users watched which videos on YouTube, the Web's largest video site by far.    The order raised concerns among YouTube users and privacy advocates that the video viewing habits of tens of millions of people could be exposed. But Google and Viacom said they were hoping to come up with a way to protect the anonymity of the site's visitors.    Viacom also said that the information would be safeguarded by a protective order restricting access to the data to outside lawyers, who will use it solely to press Viacom's $1 billion copyright suit against Google. Â    Still, the judge's order, which was made public late Wednesday, renewed concerns among privacy advocates that Internet companies like Google are collecting unprecedented amounts of private information that could be misused or fall unexpectedly into the hands of third parties.    ''These very large databases of transactional information become honey pots for law enforcement or for litigants,'' said Chris Hoofnagle, a senior fellow at the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology.    For every video on YouTube, the judge required Google to turn over to Viacom the login name of every user who had watched it, and the address of their computer, known as an I.P. or Internet protocol address.     Both companies have argued that I.P. addresses alone cannot be used to unmask the identities of individuals with certainty. But in many cases, technology experts and others have been able to link I.P. addresses to individuals using other records of their online activities.    The amount of data covered by the order is staggering, as it includes every video watched on YouTube since its founding in 2005. In April alone, 82 million people in the United States watched 4.1 billion clips there, according to comScore. Some experts say virtually every Internet user has visited YouTube.    Google and Viacom said they had had discussions about ways to further protect users' anonymity, but as of Thursday evening the two companies had yet to agree on how to do that.    ''We are investigating techniques, including anonymization, to enhance the security of information that will be produced,'' said Michael D. Fricklas, Viacom's general counsel.    Mr. Fricklas said Viacom would not have direct access to the data, and that its use would be strictly limited by the court order. Viacom would not, for example, chase down users who had illegally posted clips from ''The Colbert Report.''    ''The information that is produced by Google is going to be limited to outside advisers who can use it solely for the purpose of enforcing our rights against YouTube and Google,'' Mr. Fricklas said.    In a letter sent Thursday, Google's lawyers pressed their counterparts at Viacom to accept a more limited set of data. ''We request that plaintiffs agree that YouTube may redact user names and I.P. addresses from the viewing data in the interests of protecting user privacy,'' wrote David H. Kramer, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.    In a response, a Viacom lawyer wrote that Viacom was ''committed to working with Google'' on the privacy issue.   Interestingly, Google has  rejected demands by privacy groups for more stringent protections for I.P. address records, saying that in most cases the addresses cannot be used to identify users. Yet Google argued that YouTube viewing data should be kept from Viacom, in part, to protect the privacy of its users.   Judge Louis L. Stanton of the Southern District of New York, who is presiding over Viacom's lawsuit against Google and YouTube, referenced Google's past statements on I.P. addresses to conclude that its ''privacy concerns are speculative.''   ''It is an 'I told you so' moment,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington.    Other privacy advocates said they welcomed Viacom's commitment to limit its use of the information, but they remained concerned about user rights.    ''Users should have the right to challenge and contest the production of this deeply private information,''  said Kurt Opsahl, senior staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online civil liberties group.    That right is protected by the federal Video Privacy Protection Act, Mr. Opsahl added.  Congress passed that law in 1988 to protect video rental records, after a newspaper disclosed the rental habits of Robert H. Bork, then a Supreme Court nominee.   Mr. Opsahl also said that even records that did not include a user's login name and I.P. address might be able to be associated with specific people.   In 2006, after AOL released for research purposes the search records of thousands of anonymous users, reporters from The New York Times were able to track down one person by analyzing  her search queries. Mr. Opsahl said anonymous viewing habits may similarly yield clues about the identity of viewers.    Viacom wants the viewing data in part to help it determine the extent to which YouTube's success was built on the popularity of copyrighted clips that were illegally posted to the site. Outside experts say that without the data it would be virtually impossible to pin that down.   Judge Stanton agreed that the information could help Viacom make its case. ''A markedly higher proportion of infringing-video watching may bear on plaintiff's vicarious liability claim, and defendants' substantial noninfringing use defense,'' he wrote. A Web Watchdog Turns Commercial   Is the best way to protect the public good to go private?   That is the view of Truste, a 10-year-old nonprofit organization that certifies that Web sites meet some minimum standards to protect the privacy of their users. The group is converting to profit-making status and selling the bulk of its newly created stock to Accel Partners, the venture capital firm that backed eBay and Facebook.Â    The group hopes to use the money -- around $10 million -- to expand. ''We know that many smaller companies simply cut and paste their privacy policies from other sites,'' said Fran Maier, the chief executive of Truste. ''We have ideas to create a wizard and make it more self-service.''   Truste, she said, will also explore getting involved in some of the newer areas of privacy that it has ignored until now, such as ad networks that aim at users based on their online behavior, the use of cellphone location in marketing and health-related marketing.   In addition, ''we want to reach out more to consumers,'' she said. ''We will explore widgets and toolbars and other ways of being more important to them.''   In many ways, Truste has already been run like a business. Most of its $6 million in annual revenue comes from charging site owners for the right to display the Truste seal. This has long raised questions about whether the organization is appropriately tough on the companies it certifies.   Last year, Truste ejected three of the 1,500 companies in its program, and three more chose not to continue. The organization declined to name them, saying it makes public only cases of ''blatant violations with probable consumer harm.''   It's also not so clear how tough Truste's standards are. It requires companies to disclose how they collect and use information about users in a privacy policy. If the company plans to sell or trade personal information about users to another company, it needs to give users a choice to opt out of such an exchange. But the default can be set to allow the exchange of data about users unless the user takes action.   SAUL HANSELL "
Credit Card Breach Raises Broad Concerns,"When up to 4.2 million account numbers were stolen over three months by thieves who cracked computers at an Eastern supermarket chain, it at first sounded like the latest in a long line of credit card breaches.Â    But the specifics of the crime, revealed last week, included some troubling twists that might expose big holes in the payment industry's security standards.   The supermarket chain, the Hannaford Brothers Company, said the data were exposed when shoppers swiped their cards and the information was transmitted to banks for approval. Thieves have commonly pilfered card data from databases maintained by merchants or card processors, but the Hannaford episode appears to be the first large-scale piracy of data in transit.   ''Catching data on the move is a bit more challenging,'' said Aaron Bills, chief operating officer at 3Delta Systems Inc., a transaction processing firm in Chantilly, Va. Mr. Bills compared it to robbing a truckload of merchandise, noting that it was easier when the vehicle was parked than when it was traveling.   And, even while the theft was under way last month, Hannaford was found to be in compliance with the security standards required by the Payment Card Industry, a coalition founded by credit card companies. The group sets rules on issues like screening of employees and precautions against hackers; industry standards were tightened in recent years after other significant data breaches. Outside assessors audit companies to ensure compliance. The identity of Hannaford's auditor was not disclosed.   Even though Hannaford met those security standards, the attack on its stores in the Northeast and its affiliated Sweetbay stores in Florida revealed 4.2 million card numbers from Dec. 7 to March 10. About 1,800 cards have been used fraudulently. The Secret Service is investigating.   The breach has raised questions about whether other merchants are overconfident about their security.   David Navetta, president of InfoSecCompliance, a Denver law firm that concentrates on computer security and regulatory compliance, said Hannaford and its assessor might have been tripped up by ambiguity in the Payment Card Industry standards about when companies must encrypt payment data to cloak it from outsiders.   In particular, the standards require companies to encrypt data that travels over computer networks ''that are easy and common for a hacker to intercept.'' Whether internal networks are ''easy and common'' to crack is a matter of judgment. Mr. Navetta said Hannaford might have left data unencrypted in a spot that turned out to be vulnerable.   Hannaford would not discuss specifics of its security system, so it was unclear to what extent its stores encrypted payment data in the transmission process.   Wider use of encryption might seem an obvious answer.  But in practice, encryption is unused at certain points in a data-processing chain because the computing power it requires can slow transactions.   ''Would you like to sit at your gas pump for five minutes to get an authorization?'' said Avivah Litan, a security analyst at Gartner Inc.   Ms. Litan said she believed that the industry standards were strong and clear enough, but that Hannaford's assessor had failed to test properly where the network was open to intrusion.   Ms. Litan said the biggest lesson was that the banking industry should make it harder for thieves to put stolen credit card data to use. Requiring personal identification numbers on credit card transactions, she said, ''would remove 75 to 90 percent of the fraud in the system.'' "
Technology Leaders Favor Online ID Card Over Passwords,"Microsoft, Google and PayPal, a unit of eBay, are among the founders of an industry organization that hopes to solve the problem of password overload among computer users.    The Information Card Foundation is an effort to create a single industrywide approach to managing identity online that promises to reduce drastically the use of passwords and create a system that is less vulnerable to fraud. Â    ''There is such a market requirement to solve this problem,'' said Paul Trevithick, chairman of the new group and chief executive of Parity, an identity-protection technology company in Needham, Mass., that is developing what it calls an i-card.  The foundation, which also includes Equifax, Novell, Oracle and nine industry analysts and technology leaders, will try to set open standards for the technology industry.   The idea is to bring the concept of an identity card, like a driver's license, to the online world. Rather than logging on to sites with user IDs and passwords, people will gain access to sites using a secure digital identity that is overseen by a third party. The user controls the information in a secure place and transmits only the data that is necessary to access a Web site.   In addition to simplifying online shopping, such information cards will reduce the number of phishing incidents -- that is, the fraudulent use of someone's identity to gain access to financial records, according to Robert Blakeley, a research director at the Burton Group, a consulting firm that  is participating in the effort. ''You don't have to depend on a password, so there's no phishing opportunity,'' he said.   One of the biggest tasks facing the group is getting the millions of Web sites to support the new system, a process analysts estimate will take a few years.    ''The technology is available today, but what is not available today is a lot of sites that will accept information cards,'' Mr. Blakeley said. ''The mission of the group is to assure everybody that the industry is working together and that it is not going to be a competitive battlefield.''   Michael B. Jones, Microsoft's director of identity partnerships, said the information card system would depend on the support of Web site owners in the same way that early Web browsers like Netscape waited for the support of Web server developers. The technology will first be used on desktop systems but will eventually find its way to mobile phones and other hand-held devices, he said.   Microsoft has been working on the concept of an identity card for some time. The new organization will ensure various approaches adhere to the same standard. "
Outspoken Champion of Identity Protection Tussles With Skeptics,"E-mail: rlieber@nytimes.com It is, without a doubt, one of the great marketing stunts in recent memory.    Two years ago, Todd Davis decided to put his Social Security number in the television commercials and print advertisements for LifeLock, the company he helped found.  For a fee of about $10 a month, LifeLock offers what it calls a ''proven solution'' that prevents its customers  from becoming victims of identity theft and fraud.    By putting those nine digits on public display, Mr. Davis was trying  to show the world how confident he was in LifeLock's service. And it worked. Today, he has just over one million customers. In January, Goldman Sachs led a $25 million round of financing  for the company. Last week, Google's chief financial officer joined its board.    But Mr. Davis's stunt also amounted to a dare, and one man in Texas has already succeeded in getting a payday loan in his name.  Â    Regulators and lawyers have the company in their sights, too. The state of Oklahoma accused LifeLock of selling insurance without proper certification.  New York City has announced its intention to sue the company. Class-action lawyers have filed  federal and state lawsuits, charging deceptive business practices and fraudulent advertising, among other things.    All this raises a couple of basic questions: What are the chances that an identity thief can do you real harm? And if you feel vulnerable, do you need to spend  $100 or more a year to protect yourself?   First, let's  check the odds. The latest Federal Trade Commission statistical survey about identity theft  found that 8.3 million American adults, or 3.7 percent of the adult population, were victims in 2005.    But the majority of those people  ran into problems  as minor as having a thief use their  credit card numbers. This type of fraud is annoying, but it rarely costs any money  as long you notice it and let the card company know.   The scarier situation is something called new account fraud. Thieves steal  your personal information and open credit card and other accounts  in your name. When they don't pay the bills, it is your credit history that is wrecked.    Thankfully, new account fraud is much less common. The Federal Trade Commission  survey showed only 1.8 million people, or 0.8 percent of the adult population, had fallen  victim to that kind of fraud or to other crimes such as  criminals giving an innocent person's name to an arresting officer or using  it to rent an apartment.    As for the trend, the overall number of identity theft crimes appears to be falling. An annual survey by Javelin Strategy and Research shows the number of incidents falling 20.6  percent in the last four years.  The research company does expect the incidence of new account fraud to rise  in the next five years, but it predicts that the annual dollar amounts  will fall.    With the risk fairly low but the pain of falling victim quite high, it is best to think of identity theft and fraud as an illness that you do not want to contract. Early detection is good, but prevention is much better.   That is where LifeLock wants to play. One significant service it offers places a 90-day fraud alert on your credit files with Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, the three biggest companies that track credit histories. You can do this yourself at no charge, though LifeLock renews the alert every 90 days, which is convenient.   If your credit file contains this type of fraud alert, any credit card company, bank or other entity so alerted is supposed to hit the pause button when reviewing most types of credit applications in your name. Then, the company is required to  use ''reasonable'' procedures to make sure the applicant is really you.    And therein lies the hitch. A fraud alert is not a lock for your life at all. ''It's not a red flag, it's a yellow flag,'' says Steve Ely, president of personal information solutions for Equifax. ''Fraud alerts do not prevent new account fraud, and it's a shame that lots of competitors are suggesting that to the public and getting away with it.''   Instead, a fraud alert is more like a burglar alarm. And if the alert repeatedly fires off false alarms, forcing  creditors to  constantly double-check the identities of LifeLock customers who have never  been victims of fraud, it is possible that those credit issuers  will  pay less attention to them. Experian is so worried about this, along with other issues, that it has filed suit against LifeLock.   Mr. Davis of LifeLock says he does not believe his company is contributing to the degradation of fraud alerts. The deterrent effect of so many alerts, he said, will cause thieves to find some other way to make a living. Sure, he said, fraud alerts make the application process  more time-consuming and expensive for creditors. But  it would make no sense for them to start ignoring the warning flags. ''Go figure that costly expense versus the write-off for laptops and plasmas'' that thieves would buy  if the alerts did not stop them, he said.    LifeLock also offers a $1 million service guarantee. This sounds like insurance, but it is really just a warranty. LifeLock  promises that if there is a defect in its own performance  --  say, it fails to initiate or reset a fraud alert  --  it will pay up to $1 million to restore your good name. In practice, Mr. Davis said, the company helps customers who run into trouble even when LifeLock is not at fault. There is no guarantee it will continue to do that, though Mr. Davis says the company's good name depends on it.    But it is unlikely that LifeLock will ever pay anything near $1 million.  It won't, for instance, cover  the difference between the interest rate you will pay if a thief's activities destroy your credit score and the lower rate you should be getting.

I do count myself among the paranoid and prevention-minded, which is why I have a freeze on my credit files. This is one (big) step beyond fraud alerts, since credit freezes lock your files so that no new creditor can get to them. It's the closest thing to a silver bullet against new account fraud that exists  at the moment -- unless you live off the grid.   It is also a mild pain. You usually have to pay a small fee to each credit bureau for the freeze and pay for temporary thaws whenever somebody needs to look at your files. And you have to call the  agencies with passwords in advance when you do want to grant access. You may  need to do this a few times each year.    If you don't want to spend anything, there is  plenty  you can do to drop your risk far below the 0.8 percent that the government figures suggest.    Lock your mailbox. Switch from paper bills. Shred confidential mail and credit card pitches. Secure your paper files. Do not carry paper checks or a Social Security card every day, lest you lose them. Be especially meticulous if a relative or others close to you are having financial or substance abuse problems.

China and Darfur,"Is the Chinese Government orchestrating I.T. assaults on websites that advocate for Darfur?  The Save Darfur Coalition reported that it has been subject to sophisticated Internet attacks - attacks that apparently originated in China. And Eric Reeves, who runs a Darfur-related website, says that his site has been attacked as well, along with that of Dream for Darfur, an organization that focuses on pressuring China in the run-up to the Olympics because of its close associations with the Sudanese government.Â  The Darfur advocacy community has tried to shame China into suspending arms transfers to Sudan and taking other steps to get Sudan to stop slaughtering its citizens. This has enraged the Chinese authorities, and that may explain these web attacks. The Chinese government has put resources into high-tech Internet warfare, and thus the government is suspect, but it's also plausible that the hackers are ordinary Chinese citizens who feel patriotic and are indignant at foreigners besmirching the reputation of the Beijing Olympics. When I wrote recently about 'The Genocide Olympics,"" I had tons of indignant comments from ordinary Chinese. Here's an excerpt from the Save Darfur Coalition press release. The Save Darfur Coalition met this week with special agents from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations to report increasing I.T. attacks on coalition systems - attacks which appear to originate in China and primarily target and probe the coalition's aggressive China advocacy efforts to bring peace and security to Darfur. As the coalition's China advocacy campaign has intensified, officials have noticed increasingly sophisticated and subversive attempts to intercept emails and infect computers with malicious programs. During the meeting with FBI officials, the coalition provided technical information and offered a detailed account of the recent attacks.     ""This year has not been a good one for Beijing,"" said coalition president Jerry Fowler. ""The closer we are to the Olympics, the more scrutiny is applied to China's obstructive role on Darfur and their overactive attempts to deflect pressure. By attacking our computer systems, someone in Beijing is clearly trying to send us a message. But they're mistaken if they think these attacks will end efforts to bring peace and security to Darfur. This is our message to them: stop the violence and suffering in Darfur by ending Khartoum's defiance."" The intrusions were first documented when Save Darfur staff members noticed e-mail messages that appeared to have been read by a third party. Further inspection revealed several other sophisticated attacks, which appeared to originate in China and seemed intent on subversively monitoring, probing and disrupting coalition activities. Officials have conducted a full review of their I.T. networks and have also implemented new security measures. These efforts are intended to maximize the security mechanisms in place and thereby protect the coalition's advocacy campaigns.  "
Computer Security Team to Report Hacking Into Defibrillator-Pacemaker,"To the long list of objects vulnerable to attack by computer hackers, add the human heart.   The threat  seems largely theoretical. But a team of computer security researchers plans  to report Wednesday that it was able to gain wireless access to a combination heart defibrillator and pacemaker.   They were able to reprogram it to shut down and  to deliver  jolts of electricity that would  potentially be fatal  if the device had been in a person. In this case, the researchers were hacking into a device in a lab.   Â    The researchers said they had also been able to glean personal patient data by eavesdropping on signals from the tiny wireless radio that Medtronic, the device's maker,  had embedded in the implant as a way to let doctors monitor and adjust it without surgery.   The report, to be published at www.secure-medicine.org, makes clear that the hundreds of thousands of people in this country with  implanted defibrillators or pacemakers to regulate their damaged hearts -- they include Vice President Dick Cheney -- have no need yet to fear hackers.   The experiment required more than $30,000 worth of lab equipment and a sustained effort by a team of specialists from the University of Washington and the University of Massachusetts to interpret the data gathered from the implant's signals. And the device the researchers tested, a combination defibrillator and pacemaker called the Maximo,  was placed within two inches of the test gear.   Defibrillators shock hearts that are beating chaotically and dangerously  back into normal rhythms. Pacemakers use gentle stimulation to slow or speed  the heart. Federal regulators said no security breaches of such medical implants had ever been reported to them.   The researchers said they chose Medtronic's  Maximo because they considered the device typical of many implants with wireless communications features. Radios have been used in implants for decades to enable doctors to test them during office visits.  But  device makers have begun designing them to connect to the Internet, which allows doctors to monitor patients from remote locations.   The researchers said the test results suggested that too little attention was being paid to security in the rising number of medical implants equipped with communications abilities.    ''The risks to patients now are very low, but I worry that they could increase in the future,'' said Tadayoshi Kohno, a lead researcher on the project at the University of Washington, who has studied vulnerability to hacking of networked computers and voting machines.    The paper summarizing the research is called ''Pacemakers and Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators: Software Radio Attacks and Zero-Power Defenses.''  The last part refers to defensive possibilities the researchers outlined that they  say would enhance security without draining an implant's battery.    But Mr. Kohno and Kevin Fu, who led the University of Massachusetts arm of the project, said they had not tried to test the defenses in an actual implant or to learn if anyone trying to use them might run afoul of existing patent claims.   Another participant in the project, Dr. William H. Maisel, a cardiologist who is director of the Medical Device Safety Institute at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said the results had been shared last month with the F.D.A., but not with Medtronic.    The F.D.A. had already begun stepping up scrutiny of radio devices in implants. But the agency's  focus has been primarily on whether unintentional interference from other equipment might compromise the safety or reliability of the radio-equipped medical implants. In a document published in January, the agency included security in a list of concerns about wireless technology that device makers needed to address.    Medtronic, the industry leader in cardiac-regulating implants, said Tuesday that it welcomed the chance to look at security issues with doctors, regulators and researchers, adding that it had never encountered illegal or unauthorized hacking of its devices that had telemetry, or wireless control, abilities.     ''To our knowledge there has not been a single reported incident of such an event in more than 30 years of device telemetry use, which includes millions of implants worldwide,'' a Medtronic spokesman, Robert Clark, said. Mr. Clark added that newer implants with longer transmission ranges than Maximo also had enhanced security.    Dr. Maisel urged that patients not be alarmed by the discussion of security flaws. ''Patients who have the devices are far better off having these devices than not having them,'' he  said. ''If I needed a defibrillator, I'd ask for one with wireless technology.'' "
A Global Trail That Revealed A Cyber-Ring,"As an international ring of thieves plundered the credit card numbers of millions of Americans, investigators struggled to figure out who was orchestrating the crimes in the United States.   When prosecutors unveiled indictments last week, they made a stunning admission: the culprit was, they said, their very own informant.   Albert Gonzalez, 27, appeared to be a reformed hacker. To avoid prison time after being arrested in 2003, he had been helping federal agents identify his former cohorts in the online underworld where credit and debit card numbers are stolen, bought and sold.   But on the sly, federal officials now say, Mr. Gonzalez was connecting with those same cohorts and continuing to ply his trade, using online pseudonyms -- including ''soupnazi'' -- that would be his undoing. As they tell it, Mr. Gonzalez had a central role in a loosely organized online crime syndicate that obtained tens of millions of credit and debit card numbers from nine of the biggest retailers in the United States.Â    The indictments last week of 11 people involved in the group give a remarkably comprehensive picture of how the Internet is enabling new kinds of financial crimes on a vast international scale.   In interviews over the last few days, investigators detailed how they had tracked Mr. Gonzalez and other members of a ring that extended from Ukraine, where a key figure bought and sold stolen numbers over the Internet, to Estonia, where a hacker infiltrated the servers of a Dallas-based restaurant chain.    The criminals stored much of their data on computer servers in Latvia and Ukraine, and purchased blank debit and credit cards from confederates in China, which they imprinted with some of the stolen numbers for use in cash machines, investigators say.   ''This was the largest hacking and theft of credit and debit card information ever successfully investigated and prosecuted within the United States,'' said Craig Magaw, special agent in charge of the Secret Service's criminal investigative division. ''This case shows that there are no more boundaries.''   Mr. Gonzalez's Miami lawyer, Rene Palomino Jr., disputes the charges and says his client is merely a ''kid'' who lived with church-going parents before starting work as a government informant. Mr. Palomino said the indictment ''represents serious and substantial legal and factual challenges for the government to prove at trial.''   The story begins five years ago in Miami, along the stretch of Route 1 called the South Dixie Highway. Starting in 2003, national retailers with outlets there, including BJ's Wholesale Club, the Sports Authority, OfficeMax, DSW and Barnes & Noble, began falling victim to ''war-drivers'' -- drive-by hackers who searched for holes in the security of wireless networks.   According to last week's indictments, those hackers were Mr. Gonzalez and two Miami accomplices, Christopher Scott, 25, and Damon Patrick Toey, 23.   Investigators say the conspirators began their largest theft in July 2005, when they identified a vulnerable network at a Marshall's department store in Miami and used it to place a so-called sniffer program on the computers of the chain's parent company, TJX, in Framingham, Mass. The program pulled out data like credit card numbers from the network traffic.   Fifteen months later, the company, which also owns TJ Maxx stores, admitted that up to 45 million credit and debit card numbers had been  exposed in the prolonged attack. It has already cost TJX more than $130 million in settlement claims with banks and afflicted customers.   The Secret Service -- which is charged with combating financial fraud in addition to protecting public officials -- had until that point focused its attention on the resellers of stolen card numbers.     In October 2004, the agency concluded Operation Firewall, an 18-month investigation into members of the Shadowcrew Web site, where blocks of purloined card numbers, known as dumps, were bought and sold. Twenty-eight people were arrested, and a hub of the shady underworld of ''carders'' -- typically unemployed, technically sophisticated and highly arrogant young men -- was shut down.   Assisting with that investigation was Albert Gonzalez, a Cuban-American from Miami who had been arrested in 2003  on credit card fraud charges in New Jersey and agreed to cooperate with authorities to avoid jail time. According to the Secret Service, Mr. Gonzalez helped agents surreptitiously access the Shadowcrew site and pose as interested buyers of stolen information.   ''In order to infiltrate those organizations you have to be established,'' Mr. Magaw said. ''You cannot just get on criminal boards and start dealing with high-level players. He provided us with that ability to do that on Shadowcrew.''   In the wake of Operation Firewall -- and the expanding wave of credit card theft emanating from south Florida -- the Secret Service began to focus on how the members of Shadowcrew and other carders were obtaining stolen credit card data.   They focused on a ring of people, most of whom had never met in person, who were working together in cyberspace and breaking into corporate computer systems nationwide.    Secret Service agents from the San Diego field office homed in on Maksym Yastremskiy or ''maksik,'' 25, from the Ukrainian industrial city of Kharkiv. Agents believed that he was among the largest distributors of stolen debit and credit card numbers in the world. Mr. Yastremskiy, an indictment unveiled last week in San Diego alleges, earned over $11 million plying his trade in 2004-6 alone.   In July 2007, the Secret Service learned that Mr. Yastremskiy was traveling on vacation to Turkey and the agency coordinated his arrest by the Turkish police outside a nightclub in Kemer. The Turkish police provided a copy of the hard drive from Mr. Yastremskiy's laptop to Secret Service agents, yielding significant breakthroughs in the case.    In addition to millions of stolen credit and debit card numbers, investigators found a sniffer program similar to the one used  that year to capture credit card transactions at 11 restaurants in the Dave & Buster's chain. That attack, unlike earlier ones, was not conducted through war-driving. Instead, Aleksandr Suvorov, 24, an Estonian hacker, remotely accessed the chain's computers by exploiting errors in the way it set up passwords, investigators say.   Agents brought the sniffer program to the Computer Emergency Response Center at Carnegie Mellon University, where experts compared it with  another program found during the investigation of the earlier breach at TJX and found they were two versions of the same underlying code. Agents now knew conclusively that the same gang was responsible for both crimes.   They now had to figure out who Mr. Yastremskiy was working with in the United States. A forensic analysis of his computer yielded records of conversations over the ICQ chat network between Mr. Yastremskiy and a cohort represented only by the user number 201679996.    In short, jargon-punctuated messages, this person took credit for supplying the software used in the Dave & Buster's attack and expressed alarm when the gang's exploits and collaborators were being exposed by investigators.   In the end, it was a reference to a ''Seinfeld'' character that helped Secret Service agents untangle the mystery. Agents connected the ICQ user name to an e-mail address at a Russian-based Internet provider, soupnazi@efnet.ru, a reference to a cantankerous soup maker in the program.    Records from Mr. Gonzalez's 2003 arrests showed he had once used that e-mail address, and confidential sources told Secret Service agents that Mr. Gonzalez still used the ''soupnazi'' nickname, along with another, ''segvec.'' Tying the bow even tighter, the mysterious ICQ chatter had referred to himself  as segvec.   The agency says it immediately stopped using Mr. Gonzalez as an informant and began investigating him, in part by tracing his financial assets through online accounts. In their indictment last week, the authorities said that Mr. Gonzalez and his two Miami-based conspirators were storing millions of credit and debit card numbers on servers in Latvia and Ukraine, and imprinting some of those numbers on blank A.T.M. cards supplied by collaborators in China. They used those cards to withdraw hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.    Government lawyers also said that Mr. Gonzalez had used his position as a Secret Service informant to warn fellow conspirators about ongoing investigations. They say he appeared to have been involved in most aspects of the ring's operations.    Secret Service agents arrested Mr. Gonzalez on May 7 at the luxurious National Hotel in Miami Beach, where he was staying with his girlfriend and, investigators say,  trying to hack into the wireless networks of nearby businesses. According to the indictment, the authorities found in the hotel room two laptops, more than $20,000 in cash and a Glock 27 firearm with ammunition, although the arrest was peaceful.    They found another computer, a hard drive and a currency counter in a one-bedroom condominium Mr. Gonzalez owned in a working-class Miami neighborhood.   Neither Mr. Gonzalez nor his parents were available for comment, though Mr. Palomino, his lawyer, said the family was shaken. ''Here is the attorney general of the United States announcing the charges against your son and telling the whole world that he is looking at life in prison,'' he said. ''It's shellshock.''   Mr. Gonzalez is now in jail in New York, on charges related to the Dave & Buster's theft. His two Miami conspirators are expected to turn themselves in to the authorities in Boston soon, the Secret Service says.    Meanwhile, the Justice Department  is negotiating for the extradition of Mr. Yastremskiy from Turkey, where he is imprisoned. The Secret Service coordinated the arrest of Mr. Suvorov, the Estonian, at an airport in  Frankfurt  last March. He is now in a German jail.   Members of the financial services industry are applauding.    ''We were always trying to get law enforcement to go after these guys for us,'' said a payments industry executive who would speak only  anonymously. ''Over the last two or three years, the Secret Service has devoted lots of time to it.  This at least sends a message to the criminal side that there are folks coming after you, even if you are operating outside the United States.'' "
Guilty Verdict in Cyberbullying Case Provokes Many Questions Over Online Identity,"Is lying about one's identity on the Internet now a crime?   The verdict Wednesday in the MySpace cyberbullying case raised a variety of questions about the terms that users agree to when they log on to Web sites.    The defendant in the case, a Missouri woman, was convicted by a federal jury in Los Angeles on three misdemeanor counts of computer fraud for having misrepresented herself on the popular social network MySpace. The woman, Lori Drew, posed as a teenage boy in using the account to send first friendly and then menacing messages to Megan Meier, 13, who killed herself shortly after receiving a message in October 2006 that said in part, ''The world would be a better place without you.''Â    MySpace's terms of service require users to submit ''truthful and accurate'' registration information. Ms. Drew's creation of a phony profile amounted to ''unauthorized access'' to the site, prosecutors said, a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, which until now has been used almost exclusively to prosecute hacker crimes.   While the Internet's anonymity was used in this case as a cloak to bully Megan, other users say they have perfectly good reasons to construct false identities online, if only to help protect against the theft of personal information, for example.   ''It will be interesting to see if issues of safety and security will eventually trump the hallmark ideology of free, largely anonymous or pseudonymous participation in cyberspace,'' said Sameer Hinduja, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida Atlantic University.   Andrew M. Grossman, senior legal policy analyst for the Heritage Foundation, said the possibility of being prosecuted for online misrepresentation, while remote, should worry users nonetheless.   ''If this verdict stands,'' Mr. Grossman said, ''it means that every site on the Internet gets to define the criminal law. That's a radical change. What used to be small-stakes contracts become high-stakes criminal prohibitions.''   The judge in the Los Angeles case, George H. Wu, is to hear motions next month for its dismissal. Ms. Drew's defense asserts among other things, as it did at trial, that she never read MySpace's terms of service in detail.   ''The reality, recognized by almost everyone, is that the vast majority of Internet users do not read Web site terms of service carefully or at all,'' said Phil Malone, director of the Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard Law School.    Representatives of MySpace declined to make any executives available for interviews about the case. In a statement, the site said that it did not tolerate cyberbullying and would continue to work with industry experts to raise awareness of the ''harm it can potentially cause.''   Mr. Hinduja, who writes for the research site CyberBullying.us, said there had been a handful of cases involving teenagers who were ''driven to suicide in part because of cyberbullying by peers.''   What drew the greatest attention to Megan's death, he  said, was that it involved the actions of an adult, Ms. Drew, now 49, whose daughter's friendship with Megan had soured.    It remains easy to create a fraudulent account on social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook, though  a witness at Ms. Drew's trial, Jae Sung, a MySpace vice president for customer care,  said ''impostor profiles'' were deleted when they were flagged by users or discovered by the Web site's employees.    A number of corporations are competing to develop age verification software for Web sites. But relying on technology to confirm a user's identity is not without drawbacks. There are legitimate reasons to hide one's name and other information online, be it concern about identity theft or a need for comfort when asking for advice or help.   ''We've been telling our kids to lie about ID information for a long time now,'' said Danah Boyd, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, at Harvard.   Ms. Boyd said forms of digital street outreach were needed.   ''There are lots of kids hurting badly online,'' she said. ''And guess what? They're hurting badly offline, too. Because it's more visible online, people are blaming technology rather than trying to solve the underlying problems of the kids that are hurting.'' "
Q & A,"Limiting Power On a Shared PC   Q.What's the difference between sharing a PC on an Administrator user account and  a Limited user account? Is there any advantage to using one over the other?   A. Windows XP lets each person sharing the same computer have his or her own user account with its own password and certain personalized settings. There are two main types of accounts you can set up: Administrator and Limited. Windows Vista can also handle multiple accounts, but calls the two types Administrator and Standard.   The Administrator account is the default type on a new computer, and it is the most powerful kind. When you are logged on as an Administrator, you can add new software and install hardware, set up the system preferences and run utility programs to repair or maintain Windows itself.Â    A person logged on with a Limited account can't install new software or hardware, or make changes to the operating system that would affect other users.    Setting up and using a Limited account does have its advantages. Without the power to install software, Limited accounts are typically safer from malicious software like viruses and spyware that try to infiltrate the PC.  Limited accounts can also be helpful when you are sharing a computer with small children or novice users who may inadvertently change system settings.   Administrator accounts are not restricted. You do need to be logged into one to install  programs, security software and  hardware peripherals. You may be more at a risk of malicious software, though, which can install itself through an Administrator account.   To add new accounts to your computer when logged on as an Administrator, go to the Start menu to Control Panel and click on the User Account option. Mac OS X also supports multiple users with Admin and Standard accounts, which you can create and manage in the System Preferences area.   Moving Outlook    Mail to a Mac   Q.I am thinking of buying a MacBook to replace my Windows laptop. Is there a way to move the Microsoft Outlook file (e-mails, contacts and calendars) between a PC and a Mac?   A. Picking up your life in Outlook and moving it over to a Mac is certainly possible, and you can do it in a number of ways. One easy option is to use an inexpensive program like Outlook2Mac ($10 at www.littlemachines.com) to do the heavy lifting between Outlook and mail programs on the Mac.   While there is no version of Outlook for the Macintosh, Microsoft does make a similar mail and personal-information management program for Mac OS X called Entourage (www.microsoft.com/mac/products/entourage2008) that is part of the Office 2008 for Mac suite that also includes Word, Excel and PowerPoint.   You can find tips for converting and moving Outlook files at www.entourage.mvps.org/cross--platform/win--mac.html. It will also explain how to export your Outlook mail into the Mac OS X Mail program that comes with new Macs -- as well as how to pull in your contacts and calendars.

"Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks","Weeks before bombs started falling on Georgia, a security researcher in suburban Massachusetts was watching an attack against the country in cyberspace.   Jose Nazario of Arbor Networks in Lexington noticed a stream of data directed at Georgian government sites containing the message: ''win+love+in+Rusia.''   Other Internet experts in the United States said the attacks against Georgia's Internet infrastructure began as early as July 20, with coordinated barrages of millions of requests -- known as distributed denial of service, or D.D.O.S., attacks -- that overloaded and effectively shut down Georgian servers.Â    Researchers at Shadowserver, a volunteer group that tracks malicious network activity, reported that the Web site of the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, had been rendered inoperable for 24 hours by multiple D.D.O.S. attacks. They said the command and control server that directed the attack was based in the United States and had come online several weeks before it began the assault.    As it turns out, the July attack may have been a dress rehearsal for an all-out cyberwar once the shooting started between Georgia and Russia. According to Internet technical experts, it was the first time a known cyberattack had coincided with a shooting war.    But it will likely not be the last, said Bill Woodcock, the research director of the Packet Clearing House, a nonprofit organization that tracks Internet traffic. He said cyberattacks are so inexpensive and easy to mount, with few fingerprints, they will almost certainly remain a feature of modern warfare.    ''It costs about 4 cents per machine,'' Mr. Woodcock said. ''You could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread, so you would be foolish not to.''   Exactly who was behind the cyberattack is not known. The Georgian government blamed Russia for the attacks, but the Russian government said it was not involved. In the end, Georgia, with a population of just 4.6 million and a relative latecomer to the Internet, saw little effect beyond inaccessibility to many of its government Web sites, which limited the government's ability to spread its message online and to connect with sympathizers around the world during the fighting with Russia.   It ranks 74th out of 234 nations in terms of Internet addresses, behind Nigeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia and El Salvador. Cyberattacks have far less impact on such a country than they might on a more Internet-dependent nation, like Israel, Estonia or the United States, where vital services like transportation, power and banking are tied to the Internet.   In Georgia, media, communications and transportation companies were also attacked, according to security researchers. Shadowserver saw the attack against Georgia spread to computers throughout the government after Russian troops entered the Georgian province of South Ossetia. The National Bank of Georgia's Web site was defaced at one point. Images of 20th-century dictators as well as an image of Georgia's president, Mr. Saakashvili, were placed on the site.  ''Could this somehow be indirect Russian action? Yes, but considering Russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs, they could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure kinetically,'' said Gadi Evron, an Israeli network security expert. ''The nature of what's going on isn't clear,'' he said.   The phrase ''a wilderness of mirrors'' usually describes the murky world surrounding opposing intelligence agencies. It also neatly summarizes the array of conflicting facts and accusations encompassing the cyberwar now taking place in tandem with the Russian fighting in Georgia.   In addition to D.D.O.S. attacks that crippled Georgia's limited Internet infrastructure, researchers said there was evidence of redirection of Internet traffic through Russian telecommunications firms beginning last weekend. The attacks continued on Tuesday, controlled by software programs that were located in hosting centers controlled by a Russian telecommunications firms. A Russian-language Web site, stopgeorgia.ru, also continued to operate and offer software for download used for D.D.O.S. attacks.    Over the weekend a number of American computer security researchers tracking malicious programs known as botnets, which were blasting streams of useless data at Georgian computers, said they saw clear evidence of a shadowy St. Petersburg-based criminal gang known as the Russian Business Network, or R.B.N.     ''The attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the R.B.N. and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control,'' said Don Jackson, director of threat intelligence for SecureWorks, a computer security firm based in Atlanta.   He noted that in the run-up to the start of the war over the weekend, computer researchers had watched as botnets were ''staged'' in preparation for the attack, and then activated shortly before Russian air strikes began on Saturday.   The evidence on R.B.N. and whether it is controlled by, or coordinating with the Russian government remains unclear. The group has been linked to  online criminal activities including child pornography, malware, identity theft, phishing and spam. Other computer researchers said that R.B.N.'s role is ambiguous at best. ''We are simply seeing the attacks coming from known hosting services,'' said Paul Ferguson, an advanced threat researcher at Trend Micro, an Internet security company based in Cupertino, Calif. A Russian government spokesman said that it was possible that individuals in Russia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start the attacks.   ''I cannot exclude this possibility,'' Yevgeniy Khorishko, a spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington, said. ''There are people who don't agree with something and they try to express themselves. You have people like this in your country.''   ''Jumping to conclusions is premature,'' said Mr. Evron, who founded the Israeli Computer Emergency Response Team.   "
Woman Pleads Not Guilty in Internet Suicide,"A Missouri woman accused of posing as a teenage boy on the Internet and harassing a 13-year-old girl who later committed suicide, pleaded not guilty in a federal court here Monday morning to charges of Internet fraud and conspiracy to inflict emotional distress.Â    In May, a grand jury indicted the woman, Lori Drew, 49, under the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,  used in cases in which  hackers gain access to information stored on protected computers. It is the first time that statute will be used in a social networking case, according to the United States attorney for Los Angeles, Thomas P. O'Brien.   Ms. Drew is accused of setting up a false account on MySpace, the social networking site, which is based in Beverly Hills, calling herself Josh Evans and, along with other people, sending cruel messages to the 13-year-old, Megan Meier. Megan was a neighbor in a St. Louis suburb,   O'Fallon, who had at one time been friends with Ms. Drew's daughter.    The last message from ''Josh,'' in October 2006, told Megan that ''the world would be a better place'' without her. Megan hanged herself in her bedroom closet later that day.    Ms. Drew sat quietly in the courtroom Monday before entering her plea in front of   Magistrate Judge Paul L. Abrams. Her lawyer, H. Dean Steward, told reporters she would have no comment.    Magistrate Abrams set bail for Ms. Drew at $20,000 bail. She was allowed to return to Missouri until trial, which was scheduled for June 29, said Mark Krause, the assistant United States attorney.

Applications And Identity Theft,"CO-OP boards, condo boards and even landlords routinely ask applicants for personal data like Social Security numbers, exactly the kind of information that is used in identity theft.Â    According to lawyers and managing agents for co-ops, condos and rental buildings, applicants are becoming skittish about providing sensitive information. More than 14 million Americans reported being victims of identity theft in the 12 months before August 2007, according to Avivah Litan, a security analyst for the research firm Gartner.    While there is no indication that widespread theft of information has resulted from co-op and condo filings, Habitat magazine, a New York publication covering co-ops and condos, has published two articles in the last year or so dealing with identity theft.    The magazine interviewed two prospective apartment purchasers who believed that carelessness by board members led to the release of sensitive information that was used by thieves to open accounts in their names. One building worker acknowledged that he found 10 years of application packages in a board member's trash.   What safeguards are in place to protect data once it has been disclosed on an application?   Ben Kirschenbaum, general counsel for Cooper Square Realty in Manhattan, said that in many cases, co-op and condominium applicants are asked to provide multiple copies of an application, one for each board member.     ''The first thing we do is ensure internal security,'' Mr. Kirschenbaum said, explaining that an application package is stored in a secure location in the management office. Unlike some other management companies, he said, Cooper Square requires applicants to submit only the original package. ''After we've reviewed the application, we scan the documents into a computer, print out a copy for each board member, enclose it in shrink-wrap, and then deliver the packages to the members.''    Once the members have examined the information and made their decision, Mr. Kirschenbaum said, they are instructed to destroy the documents by shredding them. ''The only copy that is retained is an electronic copy of the scanned material.''   Gerard J. Picaso, the owner of a Manhattan management company that bears his name, said his company allows applicants buying co-ops or condos to black out confidential information like bank account and investment account numbers. ''The only information we require is the Social Security number, which we need for the credit check,'' he said.   Eva Talel, a Manhattan co-op and condo lawyer, said her firm advises clients that one copy of applications made by residents should be retained permanently while all copies of applications that were not approved should be retained for three years. (That is because a rejected applicant has two years, plus some additional time, to file a discrimination suit.)    Ms. Talel said a New York State law that took effect on Jan. 1 prohibits corporations and associations (including co-ops and condos) from intentionally making available to the general public an individual's Social Security number. Penalties of up to $250,000 can be imposed for multiple violations.    Sherwin Belkin, a Manhattan lawyer who represents landlords, said even owners of small buildings must exercise caution when dealing with personal information. ''In the event such materials get into the wrong hands, the owner must be able to show that he acted in a prudent, reasonable and non-negligent manner,'' Mr. Belkin said. "
Germany Puts Pressure On Neighbor Over Taxes,"Having turned a spotlight on what it calls Liechtenstein's brisk business in abetting tax evasion, Germany has raised the prospect of retaliation in other areas unless the principality cooperates more on tax policy.    Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told her visiting counterpart from Liechtenstein, Prime Minister Otmar Hasler, on Wednesday that he needed to move quickly to negotiate a new antifraud agreement with the European Union.    Ms. Merkel noted that Liechtenstein was scheduled to sign an agreement next Thursday that would allow it to dismantle its border controls with Austria. But that deal is still subject to approval by other European Parliaments, including the one in Berlin. Â    Nailing down an antifraud deal with Liechtenstein, she hinted, would head off any potential calls to delay ratification of the border agreement.    ''I hope that we don't get in a situation where we're dealing with ultimatums, rather that we do our work quickly,'' Ms. Merkel said in a joint news conference with Mr. Hasler.    Liechtenstein has sharply criticized Germany's conduct in its tax-evasion investigation, which unfolded after German intelligence agents paid for stolen data from one of the principality's banks. Police officers have since conducted raids across Germany in a broad effort to uncover tax cheats.   The government of Liechtenstein detailed plans on Wednesday to strengthen privacy guarantees for the investment vehicles that are at the center of the investigation.    The proposal is aimed at clarifying the regulations governing Liechtenstein-based foundations, which are similar to trusts in the English-speaking world. Foundations established for charitable purposes would be separated from those set up by families as a way to preserve inherited fortunes, the government said.    But Liechtenstein refused to budge on the one feature that, according to Germany, enables wealthy Germans to use Liechtenstein foundations to avoid paying taxes:   a refusal to share information with other governments on who owns and benefits from these foundations.    On Wednesday, officials on both sides of the tax dispute sought to smooth the sudden ripples in their relationship.    Mr. Hasler, making the first official visit of a Liechtenstein head of government to Germany in 16 years, said his country was interested in staying on friendly terms with Germany.    ''We have good relations with one another and are interested in keeping it that way,'' he said.    The tax-evasion investigation, which included a raid last week on the home of the head of Deutsche Post, took an odd turn on Wednesday when an official responsible for ensuring the privacy of personal data left his job suddenly.    The official, Karl-Michael Betzl, who functions as the top consumer advocate for data protection in the southern state of Bavaria, stepped down temporarily after the police searched his home and office on Tuesday. According to German press reports, Mr. Betzl's wife works for BND, the intelligence service that delivered the incriminating bank data to prosecutors.    The German government now believes that a mixture of domestic and international conditions has made the time right for a broader offensive against tax havens, a German official said.    The official, who requested anonymity because the effort was just getting under way, said it would include initial discussions among European finance ministers at a meeting early next month and at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the lead international organization for tax policy.    Germany is also hoping to interest the next American administration in further steps to combat tax havens, the official said.    Germany appears to be relying on negative publicity to pressure Liechtenstein to curb its role in tax evasion, several tax policy analysts said.    The principality has passed tough legislation on money laundering, to fight terrorist financing, and on recovering defrauded assets from Liechtenstein banks, said Mark Pieth, a professor of criminology at the University of Basel. But because the principle of secrecy underpins much of its financial sector, the country has deflected demands for greater openness.    A confidential German finance ministry briefing paper supplied to The New York Times by a ministry official outlines several unilateral measures that it says would be ''worth considering'' against Liechtenstein. Those include eliminating tax deductions for business expenses incurred in Liechtenstein and imposing fees on money transfers to the principality, according to the paper.    Several experts said Germany could also impose a new legal requirement, known as reversing the burden of proof, on its own citizens who do business with Liechtenstein. Under that approach, Germans who send money there would have to supply a clear reason, like payment for a house.    ''If you can't prove some sort of real-economy reason why you have put money into Liechtenstein, it is treated as tax evasion upfront,'' said Lorenz Jarass, a professor of business administration at the University of Applied Sciences at Wiesbaden.    Liechtenstein has been negotiating the antifraud agreement with the European Union since last year, but it has resisted efforts to tie that to joining the open border system, called the Schengen Pact.    Liechtenstein, which already has open borders with Switzerland, hopes to dismantle controls with the only other country it borders, Austria. Neither Liechtenstein nor Switzerland is a member of the European Union, but Austria is.  "
Antiviral 'Scareware' Just One More Intruder,"How much money can criminals  make scaring naive computer users? Try $5 million a year.    That is how much a marketing associate of one Russian operation appears to be earning from its sales of fake antivirus software through an elaborate  scheme that relies on e-mail spam and indirectly controlling thousands of  unprotected PCs, according to internal company files posted online by a Russian hacker.    The company is Bakasoftware, a clandestine effort based somewhere in Russia that markets what it claims is an antivirus program strictly to English-speaking computer users. Â    The program, whose name has recently been updated from Antivirus XP 2008 to Antivirus XP 2009, lodges itself on a victim's computer and then begins generating a series of pop-up messages warning that the user's computer is infected. If the user responds to the warnings, he is urged to buy  a $49.95 program for disinfecting the machine.    Although tens of millions of Windows PC users have seen these irritating  programs that purport to warn against malware infections, there are few details about the  operators who develop and distribute the software, known  as scareware.    Financial details of the operation came to light recently after information posted by a computer hacker identifying himself as NeoN was discovered on a Russian electronic bulletin board  by an American computer security researcher.    The researcher, Joe Stewart, who is director of malware research at SecureWorks of Atlanta,  has tried to understand  the nature of the fake antivirus software and  the way it is sold through a second tier of ''bot-herders,'' people who redistribute the program through illegal ''botnets'' or networks of Internet-connected PCs.    The scheme was partially revealed, Mr. Stewart said,  after NeoN broke into one of the computers used by Bakasoftware for  accounting. Mr. Stewart believes the hacker posted the results of just one week's operations.    Mr. Stewart also discovered that when the Bakasoftware program starts, it checks the language of the  computer user based on information contained in the Windows operating system. If it finds the personal computer of a Russian language speaker, the program terminates.   Bakasoftware, which may be based in Moscow according to Internet domain name records, did not respond to telephone and e-mail requests for comment.   This type of online scheme had recently become the target of a concerted law enforcement effort by the Washington State attorney general's office with the assistance of Microsoft's computer security investigators. Last month the attorney general, Rob McKenna, said that his office was using recently passed state legislation aimed at companies that use scareware tactics to file seven lawsuits seeking to  halt the practice.   The attorney general's office has  received complaints about the Antivirus XP program, a spokeswoman said, but she declined to provide information on its investigations.    ''The big problem with scareware is that you have voluntarily provided personal information to a Web site that you would not ordinarily want to have your name, address, credit card and date of birth,''  Richard Boscovich, a Microsoft lawyer who leads a group of security investigators at the company, said.   Mr. Stewart said he found that Bakasoftware's program has some limited antivirus capabilities, but that it was ''a far cry from what a real antivirus program does.''    NeoN posted a detailed expose of  Bakasoftware's sales scheme, which relies on a network of affiliates,  on Sept. 22. Mr. Stewart describes the affiliate program as  a sophisticated, automated and highly profitable system intended to efficiently infect millions of computers.   Once an affiliate is invited to participate it is given access to a control panel allowing it  to distribute  different types of mechanisms for infecting Internet-connected computers.    ''Affiliates can earn anywhere from 58 to 90 percent commission on sales of the software, depending on the volume of sales,'' Mr. Stewart writes. The extraordinarily high commission explains why the rogue anti-malware products are so popular among hackers and spammers.    NeoN published a list of the ten top earners during a one-week period, with  revenue ranging from $58,000 to $158,000.    Mr. Stewart estimated that one affiliate alone was able to install 154,825 versions of the software in just 10 days and that 2,772 copies of the program were later purchased from those infected users. Based on that  conversion rate, Mr. Stewart estimated that an affiliate could expect to earn over $5 million annually by maintaining a botnet large enough to force between 10,000 and 20,000 installations on a daily basis.   It appears that the operation involves credit card fraud and money laundering, Mr. Stewart said. One of the affiliates sold software to 75 percent of the computers contacted.   A sales rate of 1 percent or 2 percent is more typical of the affiliates, he said, a sign   that stolen credit cards were being used.   Despite recent  success in convicting some scareware distributors, computer security industry executives are skeptical about ending online fraud.   ''Once the consumer is made aware of the threat and they're educated, most consumers will take the right course of conduct,'' said Mr. Boscovich. ''The problem is the scams are always changing. The minute they're educated about scareware something new will come up.'' "
F.B.I. Looks Into a Threat To Reveal Patient Data,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating an extortion letter threatening to expose millions of patient records stolen from Express Scripts, a medical benefits management company.   The company said Thursday  that it had been investigating the threat since early October, when it received a letter that contained  personal information on about 75 of its members including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and, in some cases, prescription information.Â    The company said that it had immediately notified the F.B.I. and that it had retained outside experts in data security and computer forensics to aid in the company's internal investigation.   ''We have been conducting a thorough investigation since we received this threat and we are taking it very seriously,'' said George Paz, chairman and chief executive, in a statement. ''We are cooperating with the F.B.I. and are committed to doing what we can to protect our members' personal information and to track down the person or persons responsible for this criminal act.''   The company also announced that it had created a Web site for members to obtain information about the incident and learn how to protect themselves from identity theft. The Web site is www.esisupports.com.   Express Scripts, based in St. Louis, is one of the largest pharmacy benefits management companies in the United States. It handles prescription benefits for approximately 50 million people through clients like health insurers, employers and union-sponsored medical plans.   A spokesman for the company said that Express Scripts was still trying to ascertain the exact nature of the theft.   ''All we know about the nature of the data taken is that the letter enabled us to tell where in our system it was taken from,'' said the spokesman, Steve Littlejohn. ''We're not ruling anything out.''   He said that because of the investigation, the company was not willing to give details about the nature of the threat letter, such as whether it was sent as an e-mail message or through the United States postal system. He also said that the extortion threat was for money, but would not disclose the amount.   Mr. Littlejohn said the company was still not certain how much data had actually been stolen. He also said the company had not ruled out the possibility of an insider theft. "
"On Security, Microsoft Reports Progress and Alarm","Microsoft plans to report on Monday that the security of its Windows operating system has significantly improved, while at the same time the threat of computer viruses, frauds and other online scourges has become much more serious. The company blames organized crime, naive users and its competitors for the deteriorating situation. In the latest edition of its twice-a-year ''Security Intelligence Report,'' Microsoft said that the amount of malicious or potentially harmful software removed from Windows computers grew by 43 percent during the first half of 2008.Â  The company said improvements in security for its Windows Vista operating system and security updates to the previous Windows XP system had made such software a less attractive target for attackers. Instead they have shifted their attention to security holes in individual programs. During the first half of the year, 90 percent of newly reported vulnerabilities involved applications, and only 10 percent affected operating systems, according to the report. Microsoft executives said they were pleased with the progress made since the company was shaken by a series of destructive programs that spread rapidly around the world over the Internet beginning in 2003. But they said that unless software development practices change throughout the industry, any improvements in the security of Windows would be meaningless. ''This story is real,'' said George Stathakopoulos, general manager for Microsoft's Security Engineering and Communications group, referring to the improvement in the company's engineering practices. ''Now we have a third-party problem and it's something we have to go solve.'' Security researchers said they were sympathetic to Microsoft's plight. ''The only thing that Microsoft can patch is their own software,'' said Patrik Runald, chief security adviser for F-Secure, a computer security firm in Finland. ''That's not what the bad guys are using to get into computers these days. It's certainly a challenge.'' Microsoft and the computer industry have also been unable to solve the so-called dancing pony problem. That refers to the propensity of many computer users to click on enticing links in their e-mail or to visit seductive but malicious Web sites, leaving them vulnerable to Trojan horse downloads and other infections. Over the last three years the computer security industry has been fighting a losing battle, as the ability of computer criminals to profit from identity theft and a variety of other scams has led to the development of a robust underground industry generating viruses and other so-called malware. Microsoft has tried to combat the problem by building a variety of safeguards into its operating systems and its Internet Explorer browser, with mixed success. The User Account Control feature of Windows Vista, which popped up an endless stream of warnings that irritated users, proved to be one of the key factors in the poor reception for Vista. Last week in Los Angeles, the company said it had entirely reworked the user interface of its new Windows 7 operating system to minimize user frustration. In comparing Web browser vulnerabilities in Windows XP and Windows Vista in the first half of the year, the new report found that while Microsoft could be blamed for half of the top 10 vulnerabilities in Windows XP, the top 10 browser vulnerabilities under Vista all came from third-party add-on software from companies like Apple and RealNetworks. A companion report published by Jeffrey R. Jones, a Microsoft security director, claims that Microsoft is fixing security-related bugs about three times as fast as three of its rivals: Apple, Ubuntu and Red Hat. An Apple spokesman, Bill Evans, said Microsoft had previously issued similar reports and declined to comment beyond saying that the data was not supported by users' experience of infections. Microsoft has a unique vantage point from which to monitor the world of malware and other threats because it receives automated data both from free software it has given to users, like the Malicious Software Removal Tool, and from specialized Internet reporting systems that monitor threats. It also receives data about crashes on more than a half-billion personal computers. The current report indicates that malware infection rates are generally higher in developing countries and regions than in developed ones. Infection rates range from 1.8 for every 1,000 computers in Japan to above 76.4 for every 1,000 in Afghanistan. The United States had an infection rate of 11.2 infected computers for every 1,000 scanned, an increase of 25.5 percent in the last six months. "
THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 11-23-08: Internet Man of Mystery,"Girls hang on Virgil Griffith. This is no exaggeration. At parties, they cling to the arms of the 25-year-old hacker whose reason for being, he says, is to ''make the Internet a better and more interesting place.'' The founder of a data-mining tool called WikiScanner, Griffith is also a visiting researcher at the mysterious Santa Fe Institute, where ''complex systems'' are studied. He was once charged, wide-eyed rumor has it, with sedition. No wonder girls whisper secrets in his ear and laugh merrily at his arcane jokes.    WikiScanner, which Griffith created last year, makes it possible to figure out which organization made which edits to a Wikipedia entry by cross-referencing IP addresses with a database of IP address owners. You can imagine how much fun this tool is to deploy -- to see how someone with a senate.gov address tinkers with the Jeremiah Wright entry, or how Diebold apparently protects its reputation by deleting criticism of its voting machines and political connections. The promise of WikiScanner is to help free Wikipedia from both propaganda and sabotage. But Griffith says he also aspires ''to create minor public-relations disasters for companies and organizations I dislike.'' Â    He's a troublemaker, then. A twerp. And a magnet for tech-world groupies. At the WebbyConnect conference in Southern California last month, I saw it with my own eyes: Griffith, enjoying a White Russian that I first mistook for chocolate milk, reveled in the attention of his female fans. He smiled broadly. He seemed like a young Henry Kissinger, but sweet, or Arthur Fonzarelli, but not a dropout.    Born to doctor parents in 1983, Griffith, who agreed to tell me about himself by e-mail after the conference, grew up in what he calls a ''mostly conservative'' family in Tuscaloosa, Ala. Problems with extrafamilial authority emerged early on, and he spent several school days in detention. In his public school, he worried about gangs; his mother pulled him out and briefly homeschooled him. Eventually, he graduated from the Alabama School of Math and Science, even though he once threatened to sue the school -- for a proposed policy of mandatory drug testing -- and skipped his final exams to travel in Greece.    Cheating at video games was a hobby early on. ''I remember in particular there was a 'Star Wars' game, X-Wing, where you shoot down Imperial spaceships,'' he recalled in an e-mail message. ''Only one of my computer-controlled wingmen was any good. My very first hack at age 9 was noticing there was a file for each pilot, and I simply copied the pilot file for the good wingman 20 times, giving me a plentiful supply of the best wingmen from then on.''   Beating X-Wing must have been supernaturally gratifying because, then and there, Griffith seemed to have devoted himself to finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems of all kinds. As he wrote to me: ''I love the ingenuity that goes into trying to think of the most perverse things you can do within the game that the designers would have never intended or foreseen someone trying. You step back and look at the entire interacting, breathing system and pick out the counterintuitive, unbalanced, seldom-explored parts and look for a way for these parts to interact such that they play off each other, synergistically amplifying their power to influence everything else, potentially spiraling out of control.''   This cast of mind, Griffith wrote, ''gave me a knack for computer security.'' During his freshman year in college, at the University of Alabama, he read an article in 2600: The Hacker Quarterly that revealed potential flaws in the Blackboard Transaction System, which administers the multipurpose campus ID card used at many American colleges and universities. Griffith approached Billy Hoffman, the author of the article and a student at Georgia Tech, about collaborating on the problem. The pair worked for months on a demonstration of the weaknesses of Blackboard technology. In April 2003, they were hours away from presenting their findings at a security conference in Atlanta when Blackboard hit them with a restraining order. The company then sued Griffith and Hoffman for something considerably less than trying to overthrow the government (so much for the rumors). In fact, they were charged with violating the Consumer Fraud and Abuse Act, among other things. The parties settled out of court later that year. (The terms of the settlement are sealed.)   Griffith says he likes to think of himself as a superhero of online anarchy: a ''disruptive technologist.'' But there's another side to the mischief maker from Tuscaloosa -- a more contemplative side. In 2002, Griffith, like many other scientifically inclined young people, fell under the spell of Douglas R. Hofstadter's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1979 best seller, ''Godel, Escher, Bach.'' It was a revelation. In downtime from his life as an Internet poltergeist, Griffith started to explore quieter, more ethically defensible intellectual pleasures.    ''I wrestled with materialism,'' he explained, referring to the vexing fact that the miracle of consciousness somehow inheres in three pounds of quivery human flesh. Why couldn't a smart guy like himself make a computational device with the self-awareness of a human mind?   This question has stayed with Griffith. ''I am immensely interested in the Singularity,'' a hypothetical event Griffith calls ''a school of thought which cites, among other things, trends in technological growth that predict that around 2040 for a mere $1,000 we will be able to buy a computer with the processing power'' -- and even self-awareness, he added -- ''of the human brain.''   Griffith is quick to note that he knows how wacko this sounds. ''There is an aura of 'rapture of the nerds' around these ideas,'' he admitted. But he remains enthusiastic about them.   After the Blackboard lawsuit, Griffith decided to transfer to Indiana University, in hopes of studying with Hofstadter, who teaches there. Griffith banked on getting a cognitive-science fellowship, but the program was canceled that year -- though not before he had quit Alabama and signed a lease in Bloomington. Griffith felt stuck. But rather than enroll as an undergraduate, he found a position as a research associate at the university's School of Informatics.    A pretty good trick: if you want to go to college somewhere, start by working with the faculty. Eventually, Griffith took some classes at Indiana, though he avoided various required courses. Nevertheless, he was able to persuade the University of Alabama that his ''life experiences to date and his published papers constituted the remaining required courses to graduate,'' and in 2007 he received his bachelor's degree.   Last year Griffith entered a graduate program to study theories of consciousness at the California Institute of Technology. At the same time, he conducts research at the Santa Fe Institute, which is a kind of RAND Corporation for the post-cold-war world, a home for the study of self-organizing systems. From his education to his professional career to his social life, Griffith sometimes seems to have hacked everything. But what makes him more than a garden-variety Internet troublemaker?    Perhaps that's all he is. But Griffith is not 14 now; he's 25, and technofoolery may not satisfy him forever. The allure of real science is powerful, even as the hacker high life -- girls, notoriety, White Russians -- can be hard to resist. ''Hackerdom rewards spontaneity, curiosity and ingenuity,'' Griffith told me. ''Science rewards rigor and forging solid bedrock to stand on -- which means a lot of carefully dotting i's and crossing t's. Although scientific questions are harder, more abstract and tend to have less immediate influence in the world, the questions are deeper and the answers so uplifting and transcendently beautiful that contact with them is a genuine spiritual experience.''

What This Gadget Can Do Is Up to You,"E-mail: novelties@nytimes.com ''HACKERS, welcome! Here are detailed circuit diagrams of our products -- modify them as you wish.''   That's not an announcement you'll find on the Web sites of most consumer electronics manufacturers, who tend to keep information on the innards of their machines as private as possible.   But Neuros Technology International, creator of a new video recorder, has decided to go in a different direction. The company, based in Chicago, is providing full documentation of the hardware platform for its recorder, the Neuros OSD (for open source device), so that skilled users can customize or ''hack'' the device -- and then pass along the improvements to others.Â    The OSD is a versatile recorder. Using a memory card or a U.S.B. storage device, it saves copies of DVDs, VHS tapes and television programs from satellite receivers, cable boxes, TVs and any other device with standard video output.    Because the OSD saves the recordings in the popular compressed video format MPEG-4 (pronounced EM-peg), the programs can be watched on a host of devices, including iPods and smartphones. The OSD is for sale at Fry's, Micro Center, J&R Electronics  and other locations for about $230.   The OSD's capabilities will grow to suit changing times, said Joe Born, founder and chief executive of the company. ''Digital video is a fast-moving space,'' he said, and  many consumers don't want to buy a new piece of hardware every time a media company comes out with a new way to watch its shows. ''The best way to address this problem was to make the product open source, allowing our smartest developers and users to modify it.''   The OSD has not only open hardware, but also open software: it is based on the Linux operating system. Neuros Technology encourages hacking of the device; it has contests with cash rewards for new applications for the OSD. One winner, for instance, designed a program that lets people use it to watch YouTube on their televisions.    Using the OSD for daily video recording demands no special technical background, and no PC is required. Setup is easy: Plug a U.S.B. hard drive or other memory device into one side of this lightweight unit, and plug the TV and, for example, the DVD player into the other side.    I recorded a show from a DVD this way and, to my delight, I was soon watching it on my iPod. Thank you, hackers!   The OSD does not have a display screen. Its menu is viewed on the television  screen and navigated by using the remote control that comes with it. The device can also be connected to a computer or to a home network of computers.   People who are tired of stacks of DVDs and VHS tapes in the living room may find the Neuros an inexpensive way to tidy up: an entire library can be archived on a U.S.B. hard drive. Then you can stroll through your own personal video shop from the living room couch or, when traveling, plug the drive into a laptop to watch programs recorded from satellite or cable service at home.    But these are just the daily functions, designed for duffers like me. Gamers at their consoles can record their online contests, edit the videos and share them with friends. Brett Manners, a mechanical engineer and wind-surfing instructor in Perth, Australia, had another innovative use for the device. He rigged up a combination of the OSD and a video camera and used it to record his wind-surfing adventures  directly to MPEG-4 format. (To watch some excerpts, see ''Windsurfing With the Neuros OSD''  on YouTube.)    Products like the OSD are a good example of a small but growing trend toward openness, said Jimmy Guterman, editor of Release 2.0, a technology and business newsletter published by O'Reilly Media of Sebastopol, Calif.    ''The open source hardware movement parallels the earlier open source software movement that started off as a renegade thing 15 years ago,'' he said. ''Now it's the center of I.T. at many major Web sites like Google.''   He hopes for the same openness in hardware, although he said that the issue was more complicated. ''Companies may keep some aspects of their hardware closed, while opening others,'' he said.   Paul Saffo, a Silicon Valley forecaster,  said openness was likely to apply to new products like the OSD, rather than to existing proprietary products. ''It's a lot easier to design future products with openness built into them,'' he said, ''than to open a closed product.''  "
Internet Attacks Are Growing More Potent and Complex,"Attackers bent on shutting down large Web sites  -- even the operators that run the backbone of the Internet -- are arming themselves with what are effectively vast digital fire hoses capable of overwhelming the world's largest networks, according to a new report on online security.   In these attacks, computer networks are hijacked to form so-called botnets that spray random packets of data in huge streams over the Internet. The deluge of data is meant to bring down Web sites and entire corporate networks. Known as distributed denial of service, or D.D.O.S., attacks, such cyberweapons are now routinely used during political and military conflicts, as in Estonia in 2007 during a political fight with Russia, and in the Georgian-Russian war last summer. Such attacks are also being used in blackmail schemes and political conflicts, as well as for general malicious mischief. Â    A survey of 70 of the largest Internet operators in North America, South America, Europe and Asia found that malicious attacks were rising sharply and that the individual attacks were growing more powerful and sophisticated, according to the Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report. This report is produced annually by Arbor Networks, a company in Lexington, Mass., that provides tools for monitoring the performance of networks.   The report, which will be released Tuesday, shows that the largest attacks have grown steadily in size to over 40 gigabits, from less than half a megabit, over the last seven years. The largest network connections generally available today carry 10 gigabits of data, meaning that they can be overwhelmed by the most powerful attackers.   The Arbor Networks researchers said a 40-gigabit attack took place this year when two rival criminal cybergangs began quarreling over control of an online Ponzi scheme. ''This was, initially, criminal-on-criminal crime though obviously the greatest damage was inflicted on the infrastructure used by the criminals,'' the network operator wrote in a note on the attack.    The attack employed a method called reflective amplification, which allowed a relatively small number of attack computers to generate a huge stream of data toward a victim. The technique  has been in use since 2006.   ''We're definitely seeing more targeted attacks toward e-commerce sites,'' said Danny McPherson, chief security officer for Arbor Networks. ''Most enterprises are connected to the Internet with a one-gigabit connection or less. Even a two-gigabit D.D.O.S. attack will take them offline.''    Large network operators that run the backbone of the Internet have tried to avoid the problem by building excess capacity into their networks, said Edward G. Amoroso, the chief security officer of AT&T. He likened the approach to a large shock absorber, but said he still worried about the growing scale of the attacks.   ''We have a big shock absorber,'' he said. ''It works, but it's not going to work if there's some Pearl Harbor event.''   Over all, the operators reported they were growing more able to respond to D.D.O.S. attacks because of improved collaboration among service providers.   According to the Arbor Networks report, the network operators said the largest botnets -- which in some cases encompass millions of ''zombie'' computers -- continue to ''outpace containment efforts and infrastructure investment.''     Despite a drastic increase in the number of attacks, the percentage referred to law enforcement authorities declined. The report said 58 percent of the Internet service providers had referred no instances to law enforcement in the last 12 months. When asked why there were so few referrals, 29 percent said law enforcement had limited capabilities, 26 percent said they expected their customers to report illegal activities and 17 percent said there was ''little or no utility'' in reporting attacks.

British Inmates' Private Data Is Lost in Latest Government Security Breach,"In the latest of a string of government security breaches involving citizens' personal information, a private consulting company working for Britain's Home Office has lost a memory stick containing details on all of the 84,000 prisoners serving time in England and Wales.   The episode has caused fresh embarrassment to the beleaguered government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown, which is slumping deeply in national opinion polls. The breach follows one last fall in which two computer disks related to the child benefits program and containing personal details of more than a third of the population went astray in the mail. Opposition parties have seized on the episodes as emblematic of wider government incompetence.Â    The loss of the memory stick with the prisoners' details was first reported to the government this week by PA Consulting Group, a London-based consulting company with a contract to track the movement of offenders through the criminal justice system. Home Office officials said Friday that the prisoners' information had been transferred to the consultants in encrypted form, but that the consultants had then put it in unencrypted form onto the memory stick. The officials said that appeared to be a breach of government rules.   The government said the data included the names, addresses and expected release dates of all the prisoners in England and Wales, whose cases are handled directly by the Home Office (as distinct from prisoners held in the separate jurisdictions of Northern Ireland and Scotland). The 84,000 prisoners are the most ever held in the Home Office system, which has been struggling for years with severely overcrowded jails.   Also on the memory stick, the government said, was other  information taken from the national computer system run by Britain's network of police forces, including the names, addresses and birth dates of 30,000 people with six or more criminal convictions in the past year.   The stick -- also known as a flash drive -- also held personal details on 10,000 prisoners regarded as ''prolific'' offenders, and some limited details, involving initials only, of prisoners in drug treatment programs, the Home Office said.   The loss was especially awkward for the government in the light of two broad  reviews of data security systems it conducted after the previous data losses. The worst breach, in numbers of people affected, was the loss last November of the disks from the child benefits system, which carried bank account details of many of the 25 million people involved. That raised fears of widespread bank fraud and led to the resignation of the head of the government's revenue and customs agency, one of the institutions involved in the data loss.   But the pattern of losses has been far wider. In one instance, an American company under contract to Britain's driver licensing agency lost information on three million drivers with  learner permits; in another, personal information on thousands of patients of the National Health Service was lost; and in two episodes this summer, secret documents from Britain's security services were left on commuter trains. One set of documents, found by another passenger and given to a British newspaper, involved assessments of the state of Iraq's security forces and the threat posed to Britain by Al Qaeda.   Jacqui Smith, who as home secretary is one of the top ministers in Mr. Brown's government, told the BBC on Friday that the loss of the prisoners' data was ''completely unsatisfactory,'' and said the government would carry out a fresh ''risk assessment'' that would focus on the government's transfer of personal data to private contractors. A government inquiry into the earlier losses concluded in June that government agencies should generally eliminate the transfer of large amounts of such data onto portable storage devices like computer disks and memory sticks, and step up encryption.   But opposition spokesmen described the latest incident as redolent of a data security system, public and private, that needed a wholesale overhaul.    David Davies, a prominent Conservative Party lawmaker who has made a crusade out of his opposition to the amassing of large amounts of personal data on Britain's 60 million citizens on government computers, said the latest loss of data raised the risk of costly demands for compensation by prisoners. ''Who is going to meet the legal liabilities, and the costs, of this?'' he said. "
Study of Data Mining for Terrorists Is Urged,"A federal panel of policy makers and scientific experts urged a government-wide evaluation Tuesday of programs that sift through databases looking for clues on terrorism, to determine whether the programs are effective and legal.Â    The federal government has made aggressive use of so-called data-mining tools since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as counterterrorism officials in many intelligence agencies have sought to analyze records on travel habits, calling patterns, e-mail use, financial transactions and other data to pinpoint possible terrorist activity.   The National Security Agency's program for wiretapping terror suspects without warrants, the screening of suspicious airline passengers and the Pentagon's ill-fated Total Information Awareness program, shut down by Congress in 2003 because of privacy concerns, have all relied on aspects of data mining.   But in a 352-page government study released on Tuesday, a committee of the National Research Council warned that successfully using these tools to deter terrorism ''will be extremely difficult to achieve'' because of legal, technological and logistical problems. It said a haphazard approach to using such tools threatened  both Americans' privacy rights and the country's legitimate national security needs.   Mining through data patterns has been shown to work in commercial settings to predict what kind of toothpaste people  may  buy and what kind of movie they are likely to rent, or to detect  casino card-counters or those engaged in credit card fraud.   But there is little evidence to confirm that the techniques work to actually find terrorists, despite the growing use in the last seven years, committee members said. Part of the problem, they said, is that the sample of known terrorists and actual attacks is so small that it is difficult to establish  patterns of suspicious behavior.   The push to accumulate enormous amounts of information has also produced the risk of ''a huge number of false leads'' that could implicate people with no actual connections to terrorism, the committee said.    ''More data does not mean better data,'' said William J. Perry, the former defense  secretary who was co-chairman of the panel, with Charles M. Vest, president of the National Academy of Engineering.    The National Research Council, a government-chartered nonprofit group, set up the panel in 2005 to study data mining at the request of the Department of Homeland Security and the National Science Foundation.    Matt Blaze, a University of Pennsylvania computer science professor who has studied data mining but was not involved in the study, said one of the most important points made in the report -- little understood by the public -- was to underscore the ''fundamental problems'' in adapting commercial data-mining to the hunt for terrorists. The committee, Mr. Blaze said, ''has performed a real public service.''    Timothy Edgar, the deputy for civil liberties in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence at the White House, said his office had  begun reviewing data-mining programs ''on an ad hoc basis,'' partly at the direction of Congress. But he said the committee's recommendations laying out a framework for legal and operational concerns in a data-mining program could help to guide that effort.    ''This is something the government could do in a more systematic way,'' Mr. Edgar said. "
Army Buried Study Faulting Iraq Planning,"The Army is accustomed to protecting classified information. But when it comes to the planning for the Iraq war, even an unclassified assessment can acquire the status of a state secret.    That is what happened to a detailed study of the planning for postwar Iraq prepared for the Army by the RAND Corporation, a federally financed center that conducts research for the military.    After 18 months of research, RAND submitted a report in the summer of 2005 called ''Rebuilding Iraq.'' RAND researchers provided an unclassified version of the report along with a secret one, hoping that its publication would contribute to the public debate on how to prepare for future conflicts.    But the study's wide-ranging critique of the White House, the Defense Department and other government agencies was a concern for Army generals, and the Army has sought to keep the report under lock and key. Â    A review of the lengthy report -- a draft of which was obtained by The New York Times -- shows that it identified problems with nearly every organization that had a role in planning the war. That assessment parallels the verdicts of numerous former officials and independent analysts.    The study chided President Bush -- and by implication Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who served as national security adviser when the war was planned -- as having failed to resolve differences among rival  agencies. ''Throughout the planning process, tensions between the Defense Department and the State Department were never mediated by the president or his staff,'' it said.    The Defense Department led by Donald H. Rumsfeld was given the lead in overseeing the postwar period in Iraq despite its ''lack of capacity for civilian reconstruction planning and execution.''    The State Department led by Colin L. Powell produced a voluminous study on the future of Iraq that identified important issues but was of ''uneven quality'' and ''did not constitute an actionable plan.''    Gen. Tommy R. Franks, whose Central Command oversaw the military operation in Iraq, had a ''fundamental misunderstanding'' of what the military needed to do to secure postwar Iraq, the study said.    The regulations that govern the Army's relations with the Arroyo Center, the division of RAND that does research for the Army, stipulate that Army officials are to review reports in a timely fashion to ensure that classified information is not released. But the rules also note that the officials are not to ''censor'' analysis or prevent the dissemination of material critical of the Army.    The report on rebuilding Iraq was part of a seven-volume series by RAND on the lessons learned from the war. Asked why the report has not been published, Timothy Muchmore, a civilian Army official, said it had ventured too far from issues that directly involve the Army.    ''After carefully reviewing the findings and recommendations of the thorough RAND assessment, the Army determined that the analysts had in some cases taken a broader perspective on the early planning and operational phases of Operation Iraqi Freedom than desired or chartered by the Army,'' Mr. Muchmore said in a statement. ''Some of the RAND findings and recommendations were determined to be outside the purview of the Army and therefore of limited value in informing Army policies, programs and priorities.''   Warren Robak, a RAND spokesman, declined to talk about the contents of the study but said the organization favored publication as a matter of general policy.    ''RAND always endeavors to publish as much of our research as possible, in either unclassified form or in classified form for those with the proper security clearances,'' Mr. Robak said in a statement. ''The multivolume series on lessons learned from Operation Iraqi Freedom is no exception. We also, however, have a longstanding practice of not discussing work that has not yet been published.''   When RAND researchers began their work, nobody expected it to become a bone of contention with the Army. The idea was to review the lessons learned from the war, as RAND had done with previous conflicts.    The research was formally sponsored by Lt. Gen. James  Lovelace, who was then the chief operations officer for the Army and now oversees Army forces in the Middle East, and Lt. Gen. David Melcher, who had responsibility for the Army's development and works now on budget issues.    A team of RAND researchers led by Nora Bensahel interviewed more than 50 civilian and military officials. As it became clear that decisions made by civilian officials had contributed to the Army's difficulties in Iraq, researchers delved into those policies as well.     The report was submitted at a time when the Bush administration was trying to rebut building criticism of the war in Iraq by stressing the progress Mr. Bush said was being made. The approach culminated in his announcement in November 2005 of his ''National Strategy for Victory in Iraq.''   One serious problem the study described was the Bush administration's assumption that the reconstruction requirements would be minimal. There was also little incentive to challenge that assumption, the report said.    ''Building public support for any pre-emptive or preventative war is inherently challenging, since by definition, action is being taken before the threat has fully manifested itself,'' it said. ''Any serious discussion of the costs and challenges of reconstruction might undermine efforts to build that support.''   Another problem described was a general lack of coordination. ''There was never an attempt to develop a single national plan that integrated humanitarian assistance, reconstruction, governance, infrastructure development and postwar security,'' the study said.    One result was that ''the U.S. government did not provide strategic policy guidance for postwar Iraq until shortly before major combat operations commenced.'' The study said that problem was compounded by General Franks, saying he took a narrow view of the military's responsibilities after Saddam Hussein was ousted and assumed that American civilian agencies would do much to rebuild the country.    General Franks's command, the study asserted, also assumed that Iraq's police and civil bureaucracy would stay on the job and had no fallback option in case that expectation proved wrong. When Baghdad fell, the study said, American forces there  ''were largely mechanized or armored forces, well suited to waging major battles but not to restoring civil order. That task would have been better carried out, ideally, by military police or, acceptably, by light infantry trained in urban combat.''   A ''shortfall'' in American troops was exacerbated when General Franks and Mr. Rumsfeld decided to stop the deployment of the Army's First Cavalry Division when other American forces entered Baghdad, the study said, a move that reflected their assessment that the war had been won. Problems persisted during the occupation. In the months that followed, the report said, there were ''significant tensions, most commonly between the civilian and military arms of the occupation.''    The poor planning had ''the inadvertent effort of strengthening the insurgency,'' as Iraqis experienced a lack of security and essential services and focused on ''negative effects of the U.S. security presence.'' The American military's inability to seal Iraq's borders, a task the 2005 report warned was still not a priority, enabled foreign support for the insurgents to flow into Iraq.    In its recommendations, the study advocated an ''inverted planning process'' in which military planners would begin by deciding what resources were needed to maintain security after an adversary was defeated on the battlefield instead of treating the postwar phase as virtually an afterthought. More broadly, it suggested that there was a need to change the military's mind-set, which has long treated preparations to fight a major war as the top priority. The Army has recently moved to address this by drafting a new operations manual which casts the mission of stabilizing war-torn nations as equal in importance to winning a conventional war.    As the RAND study went through drafts, a chapter was written to emphasize the implications for the Army. An unclassified version was produced with numerous references to newspaper articles and books, an approach that was intended to facilitate publication.   Senior Army officials were not happy with the results, and questioned whether all of the information in the study was truly unclassified and its use of newspaper reports. RAND researchers sent a rebuttal. That failed to persuade the Army to allow publication of the unclassified report, and the classified version was not widely disseminated throughout the Pentagon.    Neither General Lovelace nor General Melcher agreed to be interviewed for this article, but General Lovelace provided a statement through a spokesman at his headquarters in Kuwait.    ''The RAND study simply did not deliver a product that could have assisted the Army in paving a clear way ahead; it lacked the perspective needed for future planning by the U.S. Army,'' he said.    A Pentagon official who is familiar with the episode offered a different interpretation: Army officials were concerned that the report would strain relations with a powerful defense secretary and become caught up in the political debate over the war. ''The Army leaders who were involved did not want to take the chance of increasing the friction with Secretary Rumsfeld,'' said the official, who asked not to be identified because he did not want to alienate senior military officials.    The Army has asked that the entire RAND series be resubmitted and has said it will decide on its status thereafter. "
Facebook Agrees to Devise Tools to Protect Young Users,"The social network Facebook has reached an agreement with 49 state attorneys general to institute a broad set of principles intended to  protect young users from online predators and inappropriate material. Â    The company will require users under 18 to confirm they have read Facebook's safety tips when they sign up; the site will also display a prominent ''report abuse'' icon devised by the New Jersey attorney general.    Facebook will also no longer let people significantly change their ages without review and has agreed to take down within 24 hours any material flagged as inappropriate.   To obtain proof that people are as old as they say they are on the service, the company is developing behavioral technology to weed out fibbers, said Chris Kelly, who work on privacy matters for Facebook. Such technology could, for example, identify when someone is friends with people of a significantly different age -- an indication that perhaps an older person is trying to contact young people.   MySpace  announced a similar settlement with state officials in January and joined a new Internet safety technical task force to develop age and identity verification tools for social networking sites. Facebook will now join that task force as well.   The North Carolina attorney general, Roy Cooper, and the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, led discussions over the last year. Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview that there were a smaller number of problems with privacy on  Facebook than with the more open and widely used MySpace but that Facebook might have more work to do.   ''We envision this as an ongoing process. We purposely built into this agreement the opportunity to raise and address new issues,'' Mr. Blumenthal said. ''If we see a problem they'll hear from us.''

A Souped-Up Model T May Have Been the First Mash-Up,"Thousands of people gathered last week in Richmond, Ind., for the centennial celebration of the Ford Model T, the machine that made the automobile a Main Street technology, with 15 million produced from 1908 to 1927.    As a product, the Model T has long been seen as a classic example of no-frills, mass-produced standardization. It had no gas gauge. Even a windshield was an extra-cost option originally.   Yet the gathering in Indiana showed another facet of the Model T's history -- how much owners tinkered with and modified the car. Among the 800 vintage automobiles brought by collectors were ones that had been converted to snowmobiles, racing coups and tow trucks. That was only a glimmer of the many innovative changes made by Model T owners, for uses Henry Ford never had in mind. They transformed the cars into tractors, pickup trucks, paddy wagons, mobile lumber mills and power plants for milling grain. An itinerant preacher converted his into a four-wheeled chapel.Â    The early Model T hackers were really pioneers in a realm of creative activity that academics call ''user innovation.'' It has become subject of systematic study only in the last few years as researchers examine how this kind of individual endeavor works and try to assess its economic impact.    The approach is a break with the tradition of looking at companies, either large ones or start-up ventures, as the main engines of innovation in the economy.    ''Users, not producers, have the best information and their incentive is to build something better for their own use,'' said Eric von Hippel, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. ''They don't need to focus on large markets like companies do. The result is that users invent a lot of what is really novel.''   Inventive users are hardly new, as the Model T experience demonstrates. History abounds with proof. In the case of industrial products like scientific instruments, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, chemical processing equipment, research studies have found that more than half of the significant innovations have come not from manufacturers but from users, usually professionals.   Enthusiasts have spurred progress in sports equipment used in mountain biking, rodeo kayaking, windsurfing and snowboarding. Skateboarding is a textbook case. From the earliest idea of clamping old steel skates to a piece of wood to the kicktail, the raised backend of a board needed for kick turns, the ideas came first from skateboarders themselves. Companies later commercialized the innovations.   Computers have long been sandboxes for user innovation. The term ''hacking'' in the positive sense of users modifying a product or technology, either with permission or without, dates back to a group of playful students at M.I.T. in the late 1950s. In his 1984 book ''Hackers,'' Steven Levy described their notion of a hack as a feat ''imbued with innovation, style and technical virtuosity.''    The recent attention given to user innovation is being fueled by the Internet. A global computing network makes it easier for users to share information and the Web is a medium of software -- a building material without material constraints, which lowers the barriers to innovation for users. Open-source software like the Linux operating system is built and maintained by interested users from around the world, linked by the Internet. Linus Torvalds wrote the kernel of the Linux operating system in 1991 as student at the University of Helsinki. The World Wide Web grew out of a program Tim Berners-Lee wrote for himself for storing personal information, which he called Enquire.   New Web tools are making it far easier for people who are not skilled programmers to snap data sources with Web pages, like Lego blocks, to make ''mash-ups'' to, say, display available apartment rentals on maps or supply personalized local information to travelers. Some of the most popular Web sites, like Facebook, are vast social networks with personal description, pictures and video all supplied by the users -- ''user-generated content,'' as it is called.   Researchers see a common thread from the Model T to mash-ups. ''This kind of user innovation has been widespread historically, but it is gaining speed and momentum because of the Internet,'' said Sonali Shah, an assistant professor at the University of Washington business school.   The most successful incubators of user innovation, researchers say, combine fairly large numbers of users and a technology that has a modular or open design. Those design characteristics create a common workbench, or technology platform, for user innovators to tinker with and build on, whether Web software or an ''accidental platform'' like the Model T, noted Marco Iansiti, a professor at the Harvard Business School.   The Model T, with its simple modular design, proved a malleable machine indeed. ''You could loosen a few bolts, take the body of the car off and turn it into just about anything you wanted,'' said Robert Casey, curator of transportation at the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Mich. ''For a lot of people, it became a platform for messing around, coming up with useful things and working out their creativity.''  "
My Very Own Cyberstalker,"Amy Klein, who lives in Los Angeles, writes the illustrated dating column, ''True Confessions of an Online Dating Addict.'' WHEN I met the blogger Luke Ford at a media party six years ago, I had no idea who he was. I certainly had no idea he would become my cyberstalker. He was just some guy -- tallish and thin-ish, with a ruddy face and a disarming Australian accent -- who started talking to me. He wore a skullcap atop his brown hair, which was just beginning to thin.    Since moving to Los Angeles to be the managing editor of The Jewish Journal, I had met many of the single religious guys in town, especially those in the small world of Jewish news media. How had I not met him? ''Maybe he would be good for my reporter friend Gaby,'' I thought. ''Maybe I can set them up. He's kind of cute.''    I didn't remember what he and I had talked about that night, but I was soon reminded. The next day at work, I told Gaby about him. She rolled her eyes and said, ''Look him up online.'' Â    I typed in his name and there it was: the entire text of our conversation the previous night, including my maligning of the newspaper's top advertiser.    ''Who is this guy?'' I called out to Gaby.   ''He used to cover the porn industry,'' she said. ''Be careful to go to lukeford dot-net, not dot-com, or you'll get a million porn pop-ups.'' After he converted to Judaism, she explained, he began covering the Jewish community, in particular Jewish media. ''Don't pay any attention to him,'' she said.   But it was hard not to. When you're a journalist, cataloging the words and actions of others, you believe you are granted a writer's type of diplomatic immunity -- inured to being written about, reported on and critiqued yourself. Well, that's how it used to be, before the Internet.   Luke Ford started writing about me on his blog, with some strange descriptions -- including that I always wore skirts, which was flatly untrue.    I wasn't familiar with the ethics of blogging (or lack thereof) in terms of what someone can write about you -- without fact-checking or sourcing or the other protections that journalists have in place. It was exasperating to have these random claims and judgments about me out there for anyone to read. But complaining about it, as I discovered, only gave him more material:    ''About 10 p.m., I was wandering around when I saw the young female managing editor of The Jewish Journal, Amy Klein, dressed as a black cat. I waved at her and she waved a reproving finger back: 'Don't write about me on your blog!' she reprimanded. Rabbi Wolpe then walked by. Amy said to him, while pointing at me, 'This man is dangerous. He has this blog where he writes about people.' ''    My life was like that Seinfeld episode when the comedian Kathy Griffin starts using Jerry in her act, and all his complaints -- an answering machine message, a lawsuit -- appear in her act ''Jerry Seinfeld Is the Devil.''   At least Ford wasn't devoting his entire blog to me, or writing anything scary about me. Until, one day, he did: ''I'd like to bonk Amy on the head with a Talmud and drag her back to my Aborigine-style hovel and make her mine.''    A week later, he followed up with:   ''I have this weird stalkerish fixation with writing about her on my Web site (never unkindly). Why was I not invited to her birthday party Saturday?''   I called my newspaper's lawyer and showed him the posts. What if Ford didn't stop writing about me? What if he came to my house? Was there anything I could do?    My lawyer said we could send him a threatening letter, but questioned whether it would help. Ford hadn't written anything libelous about me (that I was ''shy''?), and a letter might just provoke him. Could I talk to anyone else Ford wrote about?   I scoured his site and found that the radio host Dennis Prager's name kept popping up.    ''Oh, he gets obsessed with people but he eventually finds someone else,'' Prager told me with a hint of relief, perhaps at the fact that he was no longer Ford's target.   Prager was right -- and wrong. Ford didn't exactly lose interest in me. Rather, he soured on me, calling my work ''shoddy,'' saying I was ''a fanatic who radiates hostility,'' and judging me to be too ''substantial'' to be knocked out by a mere slim book -- doing so would require ''nothing less than a Talmudic tractate.''    Over the next couple of years, Ford and I settled into an uneasy relationship: He wrote nasty and stalkerish things about me, and I ignored him.    But it wasn't easy. His blog's popularity ensured that when a potential suitor or editor searched for information about me online, Ford's posts were the first to appear. Ford called my writing ''indifferent'' and said I was ''compelling'' in my ''delusions.''    Time and again I heard friends say with alarm: ''Hey, Amy! Did you know there's this guy on the Internet who writes all these things about you?''    ''Yes, I know, he's my cyberstalker,'' I would say with resignation.   Although in truth it was oddly flattering to have someone obsessed with me, even someone like Luke Ford. We humans are egotistical creatures: We look through other people's wedding albums searching for pictures of ourselves, so of course we can't help but feel flattered by someone who follows our every movement, and even writes poetry about us. Under the title, ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to Amy Klein,'' Ford wrote (quoting the Four Seasons):   Oh, I used to love to make you cry.    It made me feel like a man inside.    If I had been a man in reality,    You'd be here baby, loving me,    Now my nights are long and lonely.    And I ain't too proud, babe.   My friends, suitors and editors were worried, but at this point he had been writing about me for years and never approached my residence or called or even sent me an e-mail message. ''Don't worry,'' I told them using my favorite ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' reference. ''He's mostly harmless.''    Except that professionally he was causing me problems. He was always hounding our newspaper to cover scandals in the Jewish community. As a blogger he had ''relaxed'' standards as to sources, so people with axes to grind came to him and -- voila! -- he would give them a forum, and then I had to write a news story about it.   ''Why don't we write a story about Luke Ford?'' my editor in chief suggested.    But I didn't want to. I didn't want to give him the satisfaction. I didn't want to meet with him. And I especially didn't want to give him the opportunity to engage in a meta-interview (my reporting, then his blogging about my reporting).    So the Luke Ford article was shelved until another writer came along and wrote it, a development that displeased Ford.    ''I always thought this article would come at the hands of Amy Klein,'' he wrote. ''I pictured us over lunch and how I would whip out my tape recorder when she started the on-the-record part of our conversation and all the brilliant justifications I'd give her for my abominable behavior. ... But then my time came at the hand of 25-year-old Brad Greenberg. Brad's a good reporter, but he's no Amy Klein. ... The whole thing didn't run anything like my fantasies.''   Brad was one of the young new additions to the newspaper. Another was Danielle Berrin, a tall, blond Floridian with a passion for this business that reminded me of ... me, circa 1995. The minute I laid eyes on her, I knew she would one day replace me.    And my cyberstalker confirmed it. Under the headline, ''The Jewish Journal Adds Sex Appeal,'' he wrote, ''I've had my share of fantasies about religion writer Amy Klein (who hasn't?). ... But the times are a changing. The Jewish Journal now boasts Calendar Girls -- a pair of hotties (Dikla Kadosh and Danielle Berrin).''   When you are young and pretty, nothing outrages you more than unwanted, persistent attention. You want to be taken seriously. But as you get older, and people start to ignore your looks and actually do begin to take you seriously as a professional, you feel like yesterday's news.    I suppose, according to Ford, I was still the gold standard to which all young reporters would be held up. But I was like Sophia Loren: classic, yet a thing of the past.    AND so, when I finally left The Jewish Journal after seven years, I didn't think much about my cyberstalker. I was busy with my career, building a Web site, and cataloging my hundreds of articles, which involved a lot of looking myself up online, which soon landed me back on Ford's blog.    I scrolled to the more-recent material, searching for the inevitable post about my departure, maybe a copy of the e-mail message I'd sent out to all of my contacts (except him). But there was nothing. I kept returning, day after day, and there was never any mention of my leaving -- nothing, in fact, about me at all.    It's not as if I had taken this whole cyberstalker relationship seriously. What had been disturbing and vaguely threatening early on became background noise as the years passed, just a part of my working life I mostly ignored.    After all, Ford's posts weren't really about me, the real Amy Klein, but a version of me he'd conjured up from my writing and public appearances. And I had hoped from the start that I would be a passing fad (albeit, as it turned out, a six-year fad).   Still, why had he dumped me? If someone is going to document and critique your life, shouldn't he stick it out to the end? Write the final act? Did I not matter anymore?    And then, finally: ''Amy Klein, Why Didn't You Tell Me?''    On he went:    ''She left two weeks ago. Normally I have a satellite circling Amy from about 100 miles overhead, but I've been distracted of late. ... Amy e-mailed everybody in her life, about 100 or so persons, but that list did not include your humble correspondent, oh my brothers.''

A Group Describing Itself as Sunni Defaces the Web Site of Iraq's Foremost Shiite Cleric,"The official Web site of the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most influential and revered Shiite religious leader, was defaced and then blocked in what appeared to be a sectarian-motivated cyber attack on Shiite-related sites.   A statement signed ''Group XP'' was posted on the home page of the Ayatollah's Web site,  contending that the attack was on behalf of Sunni Muslims. The group said it had carried out similar attacks on other Shiite sites in the Persian Gulf and Iraq. It was not clear whether the attack began Thursday or early Friday, but by late Friday Ayatollah Sistani's Web site was offline.Â    At least one other site related to one of Ayatollah Sistani's religious organizations, www.al-shia.com, was affected. But an alternative address, www.sistani.com, was still operational.   The Iranian news agency Fars reported that Group XP had blocked access to almost 300 Shiite-related sites on Thursday and Friday. Neither this claim nor an Iranian assertion that Group XP was based in the United Arab Emirates could be verified independently. Several Iranian news sites said late Friday that many of the Shiite and Iran-related Web sites that had been attacked were running normally again.    ''Today we erase your site as we have done with other Rafidha sites,'' said the statement posted on Ayatollah Sistani's site in the attack. Rafidha, which means rejecters, is an insult often used by Sunni extremists to describe Shiites. The statement also accused Ayatollah Sistani, who was born in Iran, of promoting sexual deviance and an Iranian agenda in Iraq.   It added that any Web site with material that was contrary to hard-line Sunni teachings would be ''punished.''    In defacing Ayatollah Sistani's site, the cyber attackers added to it a YouTube video clip of the American comedian Bill Maher ridiculing a religious opinion, known as a fatwa, by Ayatollah Sistani on whether certain positions of sexual intercourse were permitted for married couples.   The ayatollah's office in the holy Shiite city of Najaf declined to comment on the cyber attack. Hamed al-Khaffaf, one of the cleric's closest aides, who is based in Beirut, also declined to comment.    Fars also reported that a counterattack of sorts had been carried out against ''two major Wahhabi Web sites,'' referring to the puritanical strain of Sunni Islam that is dominant in Saudi Arabia.   Several experts said the defacement and blocking of the Shiite sites seemed fairly standard, the kind often committed by rival computer gamers. They said the attacks were smaller and less sophisticated than a cyber attack that accompanied five days of fighting between Russian and Georgian troops last month or a cyber attack that struck Estonian Web sites in 2007 after the authorities moved a bronze statue of a Soviet-era soldier from a park in Tallinn.   ''The Web site defacements, this is pretty standard stuff now for state-on-state or any sort of politically motivated attacks,'' said Bill Woodcock, the research director of the Packet Clearing House, a nonprofit organization that monitors Internet traffic. He also said that tracing the origins of any online attack could be difficult.    But in a region where the rift between Sunnis and Shiites has grown deeper since the start of the Iraq war five years ago, even a cyber clash is likely to fuel tensions and mistrust.   Ali al-Najafi, the son of Grand Ayatollah Bashir al-Najafi, another Shiite cleric based in Najaf, condemned the attacks on the Shiite sites.    ''We regret these actions by people who are trying to hide the truth and want only their voices to be heard,'' Sheik Najafi, who is also a cleric, said in a telephone interview.   Web sites of several Shiite clerics in Najaf, including Ayatollah Sistani's, have been attacked before. Ayatollah Najafi's Web site was briefly blocked six months ago, according to Sheik Najafi, his son.   Ayatollah Sistani, 78 and reclusive, held a rare meeting in August with a group of Iraqi reporters at his home in Najaf to dispel rumors that he was seriously ill.   During Saddam Hussein's rule, the ayatollah did not get involved in politics. But after the United States' invasion in 2003, he has emerged as one of the country's most powerful figures.  "
Woman Found Guilty in Web Fraud Tied to Suicide,"A federal jury here issued what legal experts said was the country's first cyberbullying verdict Wednesday, convicting a Missouri woman of three misdemeanor charges of computer fraud for her involvement in creating a phony account on MySpace to trick a teenager, who later committed suicide.   The jury deadlocked on a fourth count of conspiracy against the woman, Lori Drew, 49, and the judge, George H. Wu of Federal District Court, declared a mistrial on that charge. Â    Although it was unclear how severely Ms. Drew would  be punished -- the jury reduced the charges to misdemeanors from felonies, and no sentencing date was set -- the conviction was highly significant, computer fraud experts said, because it was the first time that a federal statute designed to combat computer crimes was used to prosecute what were essentially abuses of a user agreement on a social networking site.    Under federal sentencing guidelines, Ms. Drew could face up to three years in prison and $300,000 in fines, though she has no previous criminal record. Her lawyer has asked for a new trial.    In a highly unusual move, Thomas P. O'Brien, the United States attorney in Los Angeles, prosecuted the case himself with two subordinates after law enforcement officials in Missouri determined Ms. Drew had broken no local laws.    Mr. O'Brien, who asserted jurisdiction on the ground  that  MySpace is based in Los Angeles, where its servers are housed, said the verdict sent an ''overwhelming message'' to users of the Internet.    ''If you are going to attempt to annoy or go after a little girl and you're going to use the Internet to do so,'' he said, ''this office and others across the country will hold you responsible.''   During the five-day trial, prosecutors portrayed Ms. Drew as working in concert with her daughter, Sarah, who was then 13, and Ashley Grills, a family friend and employee of Ms. Drew's magazine coupon business in Dardenne Prairie, Mo.    Testimony showed that they created a teenage boy, ''Josh Evans,'' as an identity on MySpace to communicate with Sarah's nemesis, Megan Meier, who was 13 and had a history of depression and suicidal impulses.    After weeks of online courtship with ''Josh,'' Megan was distressed one afternoon in October 2006, according to testimony at the trial, when she received an e-mail message from him that said, ''The world would be a better place without you.''    Ms. Grills, who is now 20, testified under an immunity agreement that shortly after that message was sent, Megan wrote back, ''You're the kind of boy a girl would kill herself over.'' Megan hanged herself that same afternoon in her bedroom.   Although the jury appeared to reject the government's contention that Ms. Drew had intended to harm Megan -- a notion underlying the felony charges -- the convictions signaled the 12 members' belief that she had  nonetheless violated federal laws that prohibit gaining access to  a computer without authorization.    Specifically, the jury found Ms. Drew guilty of accessing a computer without authorization on three occasions, a reference to the fraudulent postings on MySpace in the name of Josh Evans.   Legal and computer fraud experts said the application of the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, passed in 1986 and amended several times, appeared  to be expanding with technology and the growth of social networking on the Internet. More typically, prosecutions under the act have involved people who hack into computer systems.   ''Keep in mind that social networking sites like MySpace did not exist until recently,'' said Nick Akerman, a New York lawyer who has written and lectured extensively on the act. ''This case will be simply another important step in the expanded use of this statute to protect the public from computer crime.''   Other computer fraud experts said they found the verdict chilling.   ''As a result of the prosecutor's highly aggressive, if not unlawful, legal theory,'' said Matthew L. Levine, a former federal prosecutor who is a defense lawyer in New York, ''it is now a crime to 'obtain information' from a Web site in violation of its terms of service. This cannot be what Congress meant when it enacted the law, but now you have it.''   Ms. Drew, who showed little emotion during the trial, sat stone-faced as the clerk read the jury's verdict and left the courtroom quickly, her face red and twisted with rage.   Her lawyer, H. Dean Steward, said outside the courthouse that he believed the trial was grandstanding by Mr. O'Brien in an effort to keep his job, with the coming change in the White House.    ''I don't have any satisfaction at all,'' Mr. Steward said of the verdict.    Judge Wu scheduled a hearing on the  request for a new trial for late December.   Since the story surrounding the suicide became public last year, Mr. O'Brien has discussed with his staff how his feelings as a parent motivated him to bring the charges against Ms. Drew. He alluded to those feelings on Wednesday at a news conference.   ''This was obviously a case that means a lot to me,'' he said.   The case has been a collection of anomalies. Judge Wu appeared ambivalent regarding some key issues at the trial, like whether any testimony about Megan's suicide would be allowed (he did allow it) and how to rule on a defense motion to throw out the charges (he had not ruled as of Wednesday).    Judge Wu was appointed to the federal bench less than two years ago, and it is difficult to establish his sentencing record. But Mr. Akerman, the computer fraud expert, said jail time was common even for first-time offenders in computer fraud cases.    ''If I were her,'' he said of Ms. Drew, ''I would not be celebrating over the Thanksgiving weekend.''   Tina Meier, Megan's mother, said in a news conference after the verdict that she hoped Ms. Drew would serve jail time, and that she felt satisfied.   ''This day is not any harder than the day when I found Megan,'' Ms. Meier said. ''This has never been about vengeance. This is about justice. For me it's absolutely worth it every single day sitting in that court hoping there was justice.'' "
Revenge of the Nerds,"A ROBOTIC roller skate propels itself across the fifth floor of an old sewing factory at 397 Bridge Street in Downtown Brooklyn. The softly lighted room is permeated by an acrid odor emanating from soldering irons and recently extinguished birthday candles.Â  Over the thump of electronic rock, two dozen men and women chat, type at laptops and pull on tangles of wire. ''Firing the laser!'' someone shouts. An electronic sign attached to the wall blinks: ''Welcome -- to -- the -- 21st -- Century.'' The 800-square-foot space belongs to a hacker collective called NYC Resistor, which opened in the summer of 2007, and already has inspired a clone. The collective has turned away those who are interested in fraudulent computer hacking, preferring a membership of tinkers and inventors -- mostly self-professed nerds -- each of whom pays $75 a month for access to the space and equipment. ''People think hacker means a criminal,'' said Devon Jones, a 33-year-old member of the collective who was slumped on a ratty couch drinking a beer. ''Well, we want our word back.'' The collective has proved so successful that another one is planned in the city, called Htink, reflecting a growing trend of hacker spaces nationwide. ''Some people go to the gym,'' said Mr. Jones, a designer for an educational software firm in the West Village. ''Some people go to nightclubs. We tried to build a creative community for nerds.'' The result is a kind of frat house for modern-day mad scientists. Outside the collective's home is the bustling Fulton Street Mall, where vendors hawk sneakers and bundles of incense. Inside the converted laboratory, circuit boards, gadgets and spare parts overflow from every shelf. A minifridge near the entrance is stocked with beer. Members eager to quench their thirst can also consult Bar Bot, a silvery drink-dispensing robot that resembles the Jetsons' maid, Rosie. Diana Eng is one of seven women in the collective. A former contestant on the television series ''Project Runway,'' she created a sweatshirt with a digital camera embedded in the hood that takes a picture when the wearer's heart rate is elevated, creating snapshots of the day's excitements. ''My designs were too nerdy for 'Project Runway,' '' Ms. Eng said with a giggle. ''But here they fit right in.'' To help pay the rent, the collective offers classes for $25 each on topics from basic electronics to the art of laser-cutting Christmas decorations. The group's success has not gone unnoticed. ''Resistor blew the doors off the scene here,'' said Eric Moore, a hacker from Bushwick who is forming his own group. ''They're the next generation of American hacking. The rest of us are just trying to catch up.'' "
Online Piracy Menaces Pro Sports,"An important National Football League game on a recent Saturday night was dark on millions of television screens, but it lit up an untold number of laptops.   The game between the Baltimore Ravens and Dallas Cowboys was pivotal in determining playoff teams, and it was the last home game ever for the Cowboys before they move to a new stadium. But because of a long-lasting feud between the NFL Network and many cable companies, many millions of fans could not watch the game on television. Yet they could watch any number of illicit live streams on the Internet.   After years of focusing on the pirating of highlight clips and photos on the Web, the major professional sports leagues are finding that pirated feeds of live games are now common and becoming a menace to their businesses, especially at a time when leagues are trying to build their own businesses offering live games on the Internet for a subscription fee.   ''We never felt that the jewel in our crown, the live games, would be vulnerable,'' said Ayala Deutsch, senior vice president and chief intellectual property counsel at the National Basketball Association.Â    The tangible effect on the leagues' business today is small but the stakes are large: each sells the rights to its live games to broadcasters for billions of dollars. More important, each is trying to expand its revenue base by selling rights for games on mobile phones and the Web.   Major League Baseball has perhaps the most advanced online business of the major sports, and offers a season of games streamed online for $79.95, a price that league executives say will come down slightly in 2009. Robert A. Bowman, the chief executive of M.L.B.com said that piracy hurt business, but that ''it's embryonic, it's not widespread, and we have a distinct advantage in that we have a better product.''   Ms. Deutsch, the lawyer at the N.B.A., hosted a gathering recently of executives from other sports leagues -- not just in the United States but around the world -- at the N.B.A.'s offices in New York City to discuss ways of combating live-game piracy.   ''We view it as an international issue,'' she said.   That is not just because sports leagues abroad face the same issue, but also because the pirates themselves, the hubs of the peer-to-peer networks that facilitate the illicit streaming of live games, are mostly outside the United States. Often they are in China, where some of the most popular services started as student projects, say league executives who have tracked the digital trail of their pirated games.    While the biggest services are located in China, it takes a fan, often in the United States, to upload the actual stream for distribution to the wider Internet. This is done by using a PC-tuner card, a $50 device that connects a television to a computer, or by uploading the stream from a legitimate online video subscription to a peer-to-peer network.   As technology advances, the problem is likely to become worse as the quality of the picture becomes better. ''This can only become a more enjoyable experience,'' said Christopher Stokes, the chief executive of  NetResult, a company in Britain that consults with the leagues and acts as a sort of Web detective in locating digital pirates.   A recent unpublished report for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, the first major study of the issue, concluded, ''This poses a major issue for the leagues and organizations who own and control sports as the sale of broadcast rights represents a major source of revenue, enabling the sports leagues to thrive and continue, from grassroots level to professional league.'' The organization helps developed nations tackle mutual economic problems.   David Price, the head of piracy intelligence at Envisional, a consultant that helped prepare the O.E.C.D. report, said: ''I think it's different than looking at movies or music. You might not go to the cinema, but you'll buy the DVD. With sports, they very much have this one shot to get you to watch the game. If suddenly there is a way to get that live transmission for free, then there is a real threat to their business.''   When leagues try to shut down the pirates, executives can find themselves immersed in an endeavor rife with international intrigue: investigators for the Premier League, England's top soccer league, chased an offender to Cyprus to serve him court papers, according to Oliver Weingarten, a lawyer for the league.    On a recent morning at the Manhattan offices of Major League Baseball Advanced Media, M.L.B.'s digital unit, an executive started a laptop and went to a live feed of a soccer game on ESPN Hong Kong that was carried by TVants.com. M.L.B. officials say TVants.com, based in China, is one of the biggest providers of live game feeds.   M.L.B., which employs three people full time to monitor the Web for piracy, first noticed one of its games being illicitly streamed live on the Internet during a 2006 division series game between the New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers. In 2007, M.L.B. documented 3,000 incidents of its live games being stolen; last season that number grew to 5,000. (There are 2,430 regular season games a season).   ''Even if you take a modest number of viewers per transmission, the number gets very large, very quickly,'' said Michael J. Mellis, general counsel for M.L.B.com. ''We do think it impacts our business, or we wouldn't be so worried about it.''   The N.B.A.'s popularity in China, thanks in large part to the star power of Yao Ming, the Chinese star on the Houston Rockets, has made its games some of the most popular for pirates and viewers. A single game last year between the Rockets and the Dallas Mavericks drew 1.1 million viewers, mostly in China, over the China-based service Sopcast.   As a result, the N.B.A. has gone so far as to form a partnership with two peer-to-peer streaming services in China to offer legitimate streaming of live games.   Gary Gertzog, the general counsel at the N.F.L., says enforcement is difficult. This season alone the league has disabled several hundred sites, but each Sunday its games are available on a number of Web sites. ''Live games online is clearly something that has proliferated over the last two years,'' he said.   In combating piracy, one method of enforcement is off limits, executives say. They will not, like the music industry did, sue individual fans who are uploading games to peer-to-peer platforms.   ''I'd like to think we've learned some cautionary lessons from the music industry,'' said Mr. Mellis of M.L.B. ''What is the utility in suing individuals who are part of a larger chain of events?''   So a steady flow of cease-and-desist letters flow out of  the offices of each league's law firms. Moral suasion is used on foreign governments -- M.L.B., for example, has been in discussions with the Chinese government about shutting sites there.  Sometimes it works: Sopcast, a service that was begun as a project at Fudan University in Shanghai, now blocks M.L.B. games. (Virtually every other sport's games can still be seen over the service.)   ''If this is a baseball game, it's still the top of the first, or the bottom of the first,'' Mr. Mellis said. ''This is going to take years.'' "
A Form of Internet Piracy That Involves Actual (Virtual) Pirates,"What do Henry Morgan and Blackbeard have in common with Luke Skywalker and Merlin? They have all captured the imagination of millions through tales of their daring deeds, and now they have all inspired online role-playing games.   Of course there is a big difference between the pirates on the one hand and the starpilot and wizard on the other: Sir Henry and Blackbeard (a k a Edward Teach) were real.   That it is based in a semblance of reality is one of the most refreshing aspects of Pirates of the Burning Sea, the captivating new online game from Flying Lab Software that opened last week after six years in development. After all, there are dozens of games out there for aspiring sorcerers, dwarfs and elves. There are another handful for would-be space jockeys. But until now there have been almost no major online games set in an approximation of the real world.Â    That's not hard to explain. The very reason people play any sort of role-playing game -- Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft, Doctor and Patient  -- is to explore a fantasy. An online game set in, say, an apartment building would fail to deliver the same fantasy quotient as a game with drooling mutants or twirling pixies. Even western-themed  games have routinely failed; dusty cow towns, it seems, are insufficiently exotic.   But the golden age of piracy three centuries ago remains so fascinating because it hovers just on the cusp between myth and historical fact. Roaming bands of lawless men amok on the high seas, the Caribbean pirates were in some ways a final paroxysm of the premodern world before colonial governments took full control of the Western Hemisphere. It is no coincidence that the seminal romanticization of piracy, Robert Louis Stevenson's ''Treasure Island,'' did not appear until 1883, after the real thing had largely disappeared.    Pirates of the Burning Sea is set in 1720, the peak of Caribbean piracy, just after the War of the Spanish Succession. The game models the entire region, from the eastern coasts of Mexico and Florida down to the northern coast of South America as far as Guyana. Users play as members of the English, French or Spanish empires or as a pirate associated with the infamous Brethren of the Coast.   Within their vast virtual basin, thousands of players can simultaneously explore dozens of towns and anchorages or freely sail one of dozens of meticulously rendered historical ships. The economy is almost entirely player-driven, meaning that rather than ships magically appearing for sale, players cooperate to harvest raw materials like wood and iron and then process and sell them as more advanced wares for a profit.   Tycooning and trading are all well and good, but Pirates also allows the various player factions to battle for control of ports and regions over the course of weeks. More valuable resources are available only in certain ports, and so, as in real life, economics, politics and combat are each but various tools of war.    ''If you look at the reality of the Caribbean in 1720, the economy drove the combat, and the combat was part of the economy, and that's because it was all about the European powers trying to exploit the rich natural resources of the area,'' said Russell Williams, the former Microsoft executive who is now chief executive of Flying Lab in Seattle. ''We really wanted to build that kind of interdependence into the game to bring together different sorts of players, like those who enjoy crafting and those who just want to fight. That's how you build a community.''   Pirates went into development in 2002, one year before Johnny Depp and Walt Disney's ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Black Pearl'' rekindled pirates in the popular imagination. (Disney has also leveraged its ''Pirates'' franchise into video games.)    Usually if a game spends six years in development that means something is seriously wrong, and the game emerges a hodgepodge of contradictory impulses cobbled together over too many brainstorming sessions.   Pirates does not have that problem. It is not as polished a gem as World of Warcraft, but all of the major game systems seem to work well, and the star of the game, the finely tuned ship-to-ship combat, is downright addictive.   The sailing model is accurate enough to feel right without being realistically punishing. Mr. Williams said the game's long development time reflected the team's willingness to admit when features it had spent months working on simply were not feeling like fun, and then start over.   ''We first built this very realistic sailing system where if you turned into the wind and didn't take down your sails, you would slow down and stop and actually go backwards,'' he said. ''Real-life sailors thought it was pretty cool, but most people hated it.''   Slavery and disease are also not part of the game, though both were a major part of life in the Caribbean in 1720. And there is no raping to go along with the requisite pillaging.    ''Pirates didn't really bury treasure, but this is a pirate game, so there has to be buried treasure,'' Mr. Williams said. ''The life of a pirate was brutal and short. Their careers were measured in months, and they usually died floating away at sea and drowning or being hung by the government. The image of the pirate and the real historical life of a pirate are two completely different things.''   But at least there really were pirates in the Caribbean, unlike goblins, wizards and aliens. And that is why Pirates can evoke a sense of wonder unlike fantasy or science-fiction games. Sailing my Bermuda-class sloop by Tortuga the other day, I passed a Spanish spice convoy, a French pirate hunter and a Mississippi Company trading ship plying the sparkling waters. On the horizon I spied three pirate ships ambushing a Spanish fleet.   Standing on the dock that evening admiring the crescent moon over the sea's shimmering herringbone ripples, I almost wanted to grab an eye patch. Instead I just curled my lip and growled, ''Yarrr!'' "
Judge Says Use of MySpace May Violate a Court Order,"In one of the first rulings of its kind, a Staten Island judge has said that a teenage girl could be charged with violating a restraining order by using MySpace.com to reach out to people she was told not to contact.    The girl, Melisa Fernino, 16, of West Brighton, Staten Island, was charged with three counts of criminal contempt in September after she was accused of sending a MySpace ''friend request'' to Sandra Delgrosso and her two daughters on Aug. 23. The order was put in place after Ms. Fernino made several violent threats against Ms. Delgrosso, who had dated her father, and against her two daughters, said a Staten Island official who insisted on anonymity because the case originated in Family Court, where proceedings are private.Â    On Wednesday, Judge Matthew A. Sciarrino Jr. of Staten Island Criminal Court turned down Ms. Fernino's request to dismiss the contempt charges, ruling that MySpace was a form of contact just like speaking in person or by telephone and that the order of restraint had barred any sort of contact with the Delgrossos. The judge's decision was reported on Thursday in The Staten Island Advance.    ''The defendant should not be exculpated because she, instead of contacting her victims directly, used MySpace,'' Judge Sciarrino wrote.   According to the Staten Island district attorney's office and other prosecutors who specialize in cyber crimes, it was one of the first cases in which a judge in the United States had ruled that a restraining order had been violated by contact made through MySpace, a social networking Web site. According to the News Corporation, which bought the site in 2005, MySpace has more than 70 million members, who can initiate contact with one another by sending ''friend requests.'' The Delgrossos had MySpace accounts.   Joseph DeMarco, an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School and the former chief of the computer crimes unit at the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, said that as technology advances, judges will have to determine whether various forms of online contact violate restraining orders.   Mr. DeMarco said that a spectrum could emerge with, say, direct e-mail messages from one person to another being prohibited, but a post to a bulletin board or blog that both people frequent causing less concern.   He added that a MySpace ''friend request'' seemed to him more like direct contact by e-mail.   ''This does not seem to me to be pushing the court's jurisdiction or twisting settled points of law out of shape,'' he said.   Ms. Fernino faces up to a year in prison if convicted on the contempt charges. Her lawyer did not return calls on Thursday seeking comment.   Judge Sciarrino's order, which managed to quote both Wikipedia and ''Hamlet,'' meanwhile served as something of a primer for the technologically challenged.    ''Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,'' the judge wrote, adding: ''But not when an order of protection prohibits someone from communicating with another.''    ''While it is true,'' he also wrote, ''that the person who receives the 'friend request' could simply deny the request to become 'friends,' that request was still a contact and 'no contact' was allowed by the order of the protection.''

"In Europe, a Push to Take Away Piracy Suspects' Internet Access","Prodded by the music industry and government, some Internet service providers are reluctantly exploring the adoption of a shunning ritual as 21st century punishment: banishing errant online users.Â    But even as service providers  test ''three strikes'' warning systems that can result in the disconnection of Internet users who are thought to have illegally downloaded copyrighted music or movies, resistance is building.   Lawmakers in the European Parliament, in a symbolic vote Thursday, expressed their opposition to the approach, which has been championed by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and explored by governments of other countries. Consumer groups are also fighting such proposals.   ''It's a breach of our civil liberties,'' said Christofer Fjellner, a Swedish legislator in the Parliament who sponsored the vote.    The notion of turning service providers into copyright cops has been gathering momentum since November, when Mr. Sarkozy announced the French plan, which was negotiated with the record industry and Internet providers. If the plan is approved in Parliament, service providers would cooperate with a new independent authority to identify and warn pirates, who could eventually be cut off from the Web.   The proposed law is expected to be introduced into the French Parliament in May.   Consumer groups say that the approach has been crossing national borders largely because of lobbying by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents the recording industry in 73 countries.   Some bleak trends, from the music industry's perspective, are driving the industry group's muscular style. Digital music sales are not replacing lost compact disc revenues, and the industry faults file-sharing, at least in part.    Consumer groups fear that when the French assume the European Union presidency later this year, Mr. Sarkozy could press for the same standards across Europe. ''We believe it's a threat, particularly to public liberties,'' said Christophe Espern, co-founder of a French group, Squaring the Net, formed to challenge proposed Internet restrictions. He noted that the new administrative authority would be outside the legal system.   ''The complexity of what's being discussed is being vastly underestimated by most of the parties,'' said Joe McNamee, a spokesman for EuroISPA, a Web providers trade group. ''There is a right to a fair trial in the European convention on human rights. So what's permissible?''  "
"Off New York Streets, Film Piracy Is Online","When Shari C. Hyman tried to buy some pirated DVDs of first-run movies last February, she and her friends went to Canal Street, New York City's knockoff marketplace. What surprised them was not the racks of phony brand-name handbags, the briefcases of counterfeit watches and  other bootlegged merchandise, but rather that illegal DVDs were virtually nowhere to be found.   In a neighborhood full of blankets and sidewalk ''offices''  with everything a shopper might find in a boutique uptown, Ms. Hyman was coming up empty-handed. ''We tried to buy DVDs,'' she said, ''but we could only get one woman to come out into the street, and she had them stuffed into her jacket.''Â    And that was a good thing, because as director of the mayor's office of special enforcement, it is Ms. Hyman's job to eliminate the rampant market in pirated DVDs of first-run movies.    Since December 2003, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg started an initiative to stem the trade in bootlegged and counterfeit goods,   Ms. Hyman has ''seen a huge decrease in illegal DVDs being sold in buildings.'' In a  February sweep, the organization checked out three buildings and 32 storefronts for bootlegged DVDs, and  found none.   But  New York  may not be the best barometer of piracy.   Worldwide and on the Internet, video piracy remains rampant. The movie industry has devised new ways to fight piracy,   and has  pushed for antipiracy laws and  run  ads to discourage pirates.   Besides pirated DVD copies of first-run films, copies  are also available online  for illegal downloading, mainly through peer-to-peer file-sharing networks.  High-definition camcorders, some not much bigger than a cellphone, can copy films  from a movie screen with little loss of detail.    No one can measure piracy accurately, given the nature of the business, but a study by the Motion Picture Association of America found that in 2005,  $18.2 billion was lost through piracy by producers, distributors, theaters, video stores and pay-per-view operators around the world.   ''Retailers do not believe piracy is at a maintenance level,'' said Bo Andersen, president of the Entertainment Merchants Association, a home entertainment trade group.   No one expects to eliminate piracy. But given that a film's opening weekend often accounts for 60 to 70 percent of the theatrical earnings, a few days' delay in the availability of pirated copies can make a big financial difference.   ''In three years, the date that pirated copies of major motion pictures became available has gone from, at times, weeks before a theatrical release, to days after,'' said Darcy Antonellis, Warner Brothers Entertainment's head of  technical operations.   Surprisingly in this digital age, piracy in large part remains an amateurish operation. According to Michael Robinson, vice president and director of North American antipiracy operations for the M.P.A.A., 90 percent of new movie releases that are pirated are recorded with a camcorder. The industry employs monitors who use night-vision equipment to see pirates in action, and theater owners pay employees up to $500 for catching a surreptitious recorder in the act.    Putting aside the fear of discovery and a federal conviction, an individual typically sits in a movie theater with a miniature tripod wedged into the cup holder and simply tapes the projected film. To improve the sound, a pirate might plug the camera into the theater's audio system intended for the hearing-impaired.   And as high-definition camcorders get cheaper, pirated copies get better. Today, high-definition camcorders from companies like Aiptek can be bought for as little as $130. Copies are then hawked on DVD or uploaded to file-sharing Web sites. Web distribution reduces the criminal's capital outlay to near zero.   Yet for those who do not share  videos freely, one  recording of a movie can sell for hundreds of dollars, even thousands, if it is a good copy of a popular movie that just opened in theaters.    Various technologies to prevent such recording  have been developed, but  none have succeeded. In 2003, Cinea, a digital content security company in Reston, Va., received a federal grant to work on one such approach,  but the company has  abandoned its efforts, concerned that its approach could be foiled by determined pirates.     But technology is helping those who wish to stop movie-sharing. Various technologies, which the industry prefers not to discuss, allow law enforcement  to pinpoint which theaters have been used to create a pirated copy. As more theaters use digital projection, even the  screen  used can often be identified.   A number of companies have developed technologies to  identify pirated files, as well as the Internet protocol addresses of individuals who  download those files.   BayTSP, based in Los Gatos, Calif., and MediaSentry in Morristown, N.J., use proprietary technology to get the digital addresses of those who download illegal files.   That information  is given to the Internet service provider, which can  ask the customer to stop.  When flagged users try to download again, BayTSP identifies them as recidivists.   ''We have captured 12 to 18 million unique copyright violations and sent millions of cease-and-desist letters,'' said Mark M. Ishikawa, BayTSP's chief executive.   Legal action has closed  some sites that connect users with pirated movies. The M.P.A.A. won its battle with TorrentSpy, a peer-to-peer site  that is now closed. But The Pirate Bay, a similar service based in Sweden, is still running.  The Pirate Bay says it is merely a platform and is neither uploading nor downloading proprietary content.   Troma Entertainment is fighting back with humor. Its new  movie, ''Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead,'' is not due out  till May, but  apparently pirated copies are already online.    The company hopes to flood download sites with fakes. Says Troma's president, Lloyd Kaufman: ''We'll combine five minutes of the film with an old Tarzan movie and we'll see what happens.''  "
European Officials Agree on Framework for Outlawing Online Terror Recruiting,"European Union justice ministers agreed Friday to toughen laws across their 27-nation bloc to punish those who promote violence and recruit people for terrorist attacks.    Reflecting mounting anxiety that the Internet has become a crucial tool for would-be terrorists, the agreement will make it a crime to disseminate terrorist propaganda through the Internet for recruiting, training and bomb-making purposes.   European Union officials described the agreement as a framework that member countries would have to incorporate into their own laws. Â    Countries that already have strong antiterrorism laws, like Spain and Britain, which have suffered terrorist attacks and give sweeping powers to the police and investigators in terrorism cases, will not need to make significant changes. But countries with more lenient rules, like Sweden and Denmark, may need to adopt new, tougher legislation.    The new rules, aimed at codifying terrorist crimes among countries with very different histories and experiences with terrorism, underscore a growing consensus that in the campaign against terrorism, the mere transmission of information and ideas could be considered a criminal act.   The agreement is intended to help the police find and arrest suspects in cross-border investigations, but also to prevent radicalization.   ''The Internet is used to inspire and mobilize local terrorist networks and individuals in Europe,'' thus ''functioning as a 'virtual training camp,' '' the ministers said in their agreement. In a separate move, the ministers agreed on a plan for tighter controls on the sale of explosives and other bomb-making materials.    In an interview in Brussels on Tuesday, Gilles de Kerchove, the European Union's counterterrorism coordinator, acknowledged that the Internet was becoming an even more dangerous tool for radicalization, and that member states had to develop a  revolutionary joint strategy to counter its message.    He said that preventing radicalization was one of the major challenges facing member states, and one of the toughest subjects on which to forge agreement.    ''It's a real challenge because most of the policies are in the hands of the member states,'' Mr. de Kerchove said.    While the European Union as a whole has improved cooperation among its members in investigations and border control, he called prevention of radicalization an area ''where we may do better.''    The new initiative ''important because the Internet plays a huge role -- in incitement, in communication, in providing information on how to mount an attack,'' he said.    The agreement updates antiterrorism laws passed by the European Union after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The laws were aimed at preventing potential terrorists from exploiting loopholes in various legal systems across the continent.   It could make it easier for authorities to shut down Web sites disseminating terrorist propaganda and bomb-making instructions, and to identify and pursue proselytizers and recruiters. It could also help courts and administrative authorities demand that Internet service providers remove information considered dangerous.   Friso Roscam Abbing, European Commission spokesman on justice and interior issues, said it was not known how many nations would have to change their laws. It was now up to member nations to analyze whether  their legislation matches the goals laid down, he said.   Each member country will decide the severity of prison sentences.    The agreement is likely to face opposition in countries where the preservation of civil liberties and freedom of expression can outweigh  security concerns.    The ministers defended their initiative as a balanced approach to a widening problem.   ''We have been able to strike a very sensitive balance between two important goals,'' said Lovro Sturm, justice minister of Slovenia, after the meeting on Friday. ''We have to make sure that we respect the human rights and fundamental freedom of the citizens. On the other hand this enables us to lead a more effective fight against terrorism. This improves the capability of the E.U. to prevent terrorist offenses.''    In a separate initiative, the ministers agreed to create a European database to give member governments permanent access to information on incidents and attacks involving explosive devices. The database, which will be run by Europol, the European police agency, will monitor the sale of bomb-making materials and include an early warning system on stolen explosives and other equipment.    Earlier this month, Europol said that the number of arrests connected to terrorism doubled in the European Union in 2007 compared with the year before. Most of the attacks carried out within the bloc, it said, were linked to separatist movements, rather than militant Islam.  "
McCain Pushes Priorities That Resonate on the Right,"Senator John McCain appealed to religious conservatives on Wednesday with pledges to prosecute sex traffickers, fight Internet child pornography and make religious freedom a priority in American diplomacy.   In a speech followed by tough questions from the audience about the war in Iraq and his temper, Mr. McCain said that those issues, particularly the fight against sex trafficking, would be important in his White House.   ''Most of the victims of human trafficking in the United States and in most other places in the world are the most vulnerable among us, destitute women and children who are sold into bondage as sex slaves,'' Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, told a crowd at Oakland University here. Later he added, ''We must view this evil form of 21st-century slavery every bit as important as drug trafficking.''Â    Human trafficking, the transport of victims under false pretenses from one nation to another for forced labor or prostitution, has become an important issue to the Christian right. The Central Intelligence Agency estimates that as many as 800,000 people around the world, including 200,000 in the United States, are enslaved each year.   In part because of the concerns of the right, President Bush has devoted more money and attention to the issue than his predecessors did. Conservatives, who are distrustful of Mr. McCain on a number of fronts, are pushing him to follow Mr. Bush's lead.   One of those conservatives is the Rev. Richard Land, an official with the Southern Baptist Convention, who wrote last month to Mr. McCain and to the Democratic candidates, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, urging them to speak out about human trafficking. Mr. Land has also spoken to Mr. McCain about promoting religious freedom overseas and cracking down on child pornography on the Internet, which Mr. McCain has focused on in the Senate.   On Wednesday, Mr. Land pronounced himself ''delighted'' with Mr. McCain's speech. ''He was ringing all the Southern Baptist bells,'' Mr. Land said in a telephone interview. ''This shows that Senator McCain is making it clear it will be a priority commitment, and that's very important to my constituency.''   After his speech, Mr. McCain was hit with a fusillade of tough questions, including a query about whether his temper -- he acknowledged he gets angry -- would pose a problem in the White House.   ''The next question is about this issue that has become something of a concern to some of your colleagues in the Senate, and is concerning many Republicans as well, and that is the question of your temper,'' a member of the audience began.   ''How dare you ask that question!'' Mr. McCain shot back in a mock rage, generating laughter.   ''I wouldn't ask it if I wasn't concerned, sir,'' the man continued. ''I have a quote from a colleague of yours, Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, somebody you may be familiar with, and with regards to you, he said, and I quote------ ''   ''I'm familiar with the quote,'' Mr. McCain interjected, a little wearily.   But the man plunged forward, sharing Mr. Cochran's often-repeated words about Mr. McCain -- ''the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine'' -- and continuing so long into Mr. Cochran's discourse that the generally friendly audience began booing the man.   ''Look, I will confess to you, my friend, that I get angry,'' Mr. McCain finally replied, listing things he said made him irate: the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, pork-barrel spending projects, corruption.   Mr. McCain then ticked off a list of Democrats he likes to work with. ''And if I had some problem as such as has been described, my friends, I would not be able to work with Joe Lieberman and Russ Feingold and Ted Kennedy,'' he concluded.   Earlier, another participant, Susan Alderman, a Democrat from Fort Gratiot, Mich., asked if the war with Iraq had started over oil, as Mr. McCain seemed to suggest last week.   ''No, ma'am,'' he replied, adding that he had always said the reason was ''the issue of weapons of mass destruction, primarily.'' "
Missouri Woman Accused of Driving Girl to Suicide Is Indicted in California,"In a highly unusual use of a federal law generally employed in computer fraud cases, a federal grand jury here on Thursday indicted a Missouri woman accused of using a phony online identity to trick and taunt a 13-year-old girl, who committed suicide in response to the cyberbaiting.   The woman, Lori Drew, was charged with one count of conspiracy and three counts of accessing a computer without authorization and via interstate commerce to obtain information to inflict emotional distress. Each count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.Â    Ms. Drew lives in O'Fallon, Mo., where, according to the indictment, she created a MySpace account under the name Josh Evans in 2006. Prosecutors said she used the social networking account to contact a young girl named in the indictment as M.T.M. with sexually charged messages from ''Josh.'' The girl, who has been identified by her mother as Megan Meier, was a former friend of Ms. Drew's daughter.    After a few weeks of chatting, ''Josh Evans'' began to send Megan nasty messages, via the MySpace account, ending with one that suggested ''the world would be a better place'' without her. Megan, believing she had been rejected by ''Josh,'' committed suicide in her home.    Missouri law enforcement officials said they had not found enough evidence to bring charges in the case, and Ms. Drew, who was 48 when Megan died, has repeatedly denied creating the account.    But because MySpace, a unit of Fox Interactive Media, is based in Beverly Hills, Calif., and its server is here, federal prosecutors decided to wield a federal statute that is generally used to prosecute fraud that occurs across state lines.    The statute applies in the case, the indictment says, because by violating the user agreement of MySpace, which prohibits phony accounts, Ms. Drew was seeking information ''to further a tortuous act, namely, intentional infliction of emotional distress.''   ''To my knowledge it is the first case of its kind in the nation,'' said Thomas P. O'Brien a United States attorney in California. ''But when an adult violates terms on a MySpace account to gain information that creates this type of reaction, it caused this office to take a really hard look.''    Calls to Megan's parents, Tina and Ron Meier, were not returned Thursday. Mr. Meier told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch: ''It's a good day. It's an awesome feeling.''   Ms. Drew's lawyer, H. Dean Steward, said: ''I am deeply disappointed. We thought when the St. Louis prosecutors took a look at the case and decided not to bring charges that was the end of it. I don't think the statute they used fits the facts in the indictments.''    Ms. Drew is scheduled to be arraigned in Los Angeles in June.   Experts were skeptical that the charges would withstand close legal scrutiny.   ''It is an extremely aggressive indictment,'' said Rebecca Lonergan, a law professor at the University of Southern California and a former federal prosecutor. ''I have never in 18 years as a prosecutor seen the statute used that way. Cybercrimes is a relatively new area, but I am not sure this statute technically covers the essence of the harm.''   Officials at MySpace said in a written statement, ''MySpace does not tolerate cyberbullying and is cooperating fully with the U.S. attorney in this matter.''    Various state and local governments have passed or introduced laws that prohibit cyberbullying, often through requirements that school districts have cyberbullying policies.   ''I have concerns about the term 'cyberbullying' being applied to this situation,'' said Nancy Willard, executive director of the Center for Safe and Responsible Internet Use. ''Cyberbullying usually occurs between peers. It is not this kind of action.''   Ms. Willard, who is also a former lawyer, said she also had doubts about the prosecutor's tactics. ''I, like everyone else, would like to see Lori Drew see her comeuppance,'' she said, ''but I have some concerns. I don't think the statute was written to apply to this case.'' "
Frustrating the Pirates,"DISPENSING with the bluster that normally surrounds the issue of pirated movies and music, Anders Bylund of Ars Technica tries to appeal to business sense in arguing that media companies should stop suing their potential customers and instead try to serve them (arstechnica.com).   Media piracy will always be with us. But the pirates, Mr. Bylund writes, ''can be beaten -- it happens all the time -- but not primarily by means of legal threats and lawsuits.'' Rather, he says: ''You subjugate these rebels with the tools of free enterprise. Piracy is just another business model, and the pirates will lose and go away when you come up with a better model.''Â    Consumers make buying decisions based on three factors, according to Mr. Bylund:  ''price, convenience and quality.'' Pirates will always win on price (free), but media companies can and do beat them on the other factors. Among the examples he cites is the cable channel Comedy Central, owned by  Viacom (comedycentral.com). The Web site offers the complete archives of ''The Daily Show'' and makes them searchable. Hulu, owned by NBC and Fox, offers many television shows and some movies with limited (and short) advertisements (hulu.com). All are offered in high-quality video.   But it should not stop there, Mr. Bylund says. ''Figure out an ad-supported model if you can, or charge less than a dollar per episode. Let people burn it to DVD or play the file on iPhones for a buck.'' Eventually, ''piracy will force all the big-time content producers to move in this kind of direction,'' Mr. Bylund says. ''Capitalism, properly applied, will beat the rebels every time.''   A GREAT TIME WASTER Slate does not mean to insult anyone when it says that this week's package on procrastination ''will appeal to every single person reading the magazine.'' Even if you are not a procrastinator, maybe you long to be. Or, failing that, you surely know someone who procrastinates. And if you are a can-do, industrious type, Daniel Gross's ''Lazy Money'' guide to investing in companies that appeal to procrastination -- purveyors of tobacco, coffee, Web sites, online video and even this newspaper  -- might be for you (slate.com).   Other articles in the package include ''Procrastinators Without Borders: Do the Japanese Waste More Time Than We Do?'' by Heather Smith; ''Like There's No Tomorrow: How Economists Think About Procrastination,'' by Ray Fisman; and a manifesto, ''Procrasti-Nation: Workers of the World, Slack Off!''   THOSE DARNED KIDS ''Web 2.0'' has forgotten about the Internet, according to Allan Leinwand, a venture capitalist writing at GigaOM. All the social networks, big blog sites, video hosts and wikis out there may yawn when ''router-hugging relics of the past century'' tell them they need to pay attention to basics,  Mr. Leinwand says. But when things break down, they will wish they knew as much about  the Internet's underlying technology as they do about Python, Ajax and all the other software that is used to create Web 2.0 sites. Those error messages that routinely show up on MySpace and AllMusic could well be thanks to a young programmer's lack of adequate Web 1.0 knowledge (gigaom.com).   HAPPENS ALL THE TIME A frequently asked question that was posted until recently on the child labor section of the Georgia Department of Labor's Web site read: ''I am a 17-year-old teacher with a Ph.D. in physics.

"Court Upholds Child Pornography Law, Despite Free Speech Concerns","The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the latest Congressional effort to curb the spread of child pornography on the Internet, a 2003 law that makes it a crime to offer or solicit sexually explicit images of children.   The law, known as the Protect Act, applies regardless of whether the material turns out to consist solely of computer-generated images, or digitally altered photographs of adults, or even if the offer is fraudulent and the material does not exist at all.   ''Offers to provide or requests to obtain child pornography are categorically excluded from the First Amendment,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the 7-to-2 majority. Â    The law at issue was a response to a Supreme Court ruling in 2002, a decision that found unconstitutional an earlier law that prohibited simple possession of purported child pornography even if the material turned out not to depict real children. The First Amendment was violated by a law that ''prohibits the visual depiction of an idea,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said in the 2002 decision.   Justice Scalia said on Monday that by limiting the crime to the ''pandering'' of child pornography, the new law represented ''a carefully crafted attempt to eliminate the First Amendment problems we identified'' in the earlier decision.   The new law and the earlier one, the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, were legislative efforts to deal with the challenge that technology poses to prosecutors if they must prove that material that looks like child pornography was actually produced using real children.   Under the court's interpretation of the 2003 statute, a person offering material as child pornography can be convicted on either of two grounds: for believing that the material depicts real children, or for intending to convince a would-be recipient that it does.   The statute itself (''Protect'' is an acronym for Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today) is open to a considerably broader interpretation, which led the federal appeals court in Atlanta to invalidate it in 2006, the decision that the justices overturned on Monday.    The law applies to ''any person who knowingly advertises, promotes, presents, distributes, or solicits'' the prohibited material, raising concerns about whether mainstream movies or innocent photographs of babies in the bath might invite prosecution.    Justice Scalia dismissed these concerns as ''fanciful hypotheticals,'' saying that such situations would either not give rise to prosecutions or, if they did, would be protected by the courts. In a concurring opinion, Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen G. Breyer said they, too, were satisfied that the court's narrow construction of the statute had allayed ''any constitutional concerns that might arise.''   In effect, the court accepted the invitation of Solicitor General Paul D. Clement who, when he argued in defense of the statute last Oct. 30, urged the justices to impose ''a more restrictive view'' of the law's scope if they thought it reached too far.   The two dissenting justices, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said their concerns had not been answered. In an opinion by Justice Souter, which Justice Ginsburg signed, they said they did not object to making it a crime to mislead others by offering material that did not in fact exist. That was simply fraud, Justice Souter said.   However, he added, possession of pornographic images that do not depict real children is constitutionally protected, and offering them should not be a crime. ''If the act can effectively eliminate the real-child requirement when a proposal relates to extant material, a class of protected speech will disappear,'' Justice Souter said.   Joan E. Bertin, executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship, which filed a brief arguing that the law was unconstitutional, said the decision failed to offer protection against ''over-zealous prosecutors.'' In an interview, she said it appeared that ''the court was not willing to send the case back to Congress again,'' and so ''narrowed the statute in order to save it.''   The case, United States v. Williams, No. 06-694, began in 2004 as the prosecution of a Florida man, Michael Williams, who was caught in a federal sting operation offering child pornography in an Internet chat room. He claimed to have ''good pics'' of his 4-year-old daughter. In fact, he did not have such pictures, but when federal agents executed a search warrant, they found 22 sexually explicit images of real children on his computer hard drives.   His conviction for possessing the images, and his five-year sentence for that crime, were not at issue in the case. He challenged his conviction under the new law for pandering and won a reversal in the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which found the law both overbroad and unconstitutionally vague.   In another decision on Monday, the court voted 8 to 1 to reinstate the conviction on a charge of carrying explosives of the Algerian man who attempted to enter the United States from Canada in December 1999 and who is often referred to as the millennium bomber.   The man, Ahmed Ressam, who was recruited by Al Qaeda and intended to detonate the explosives at Los Angeles International Airport, was convicted on nine separate counts and sentenced to 22 years in prison. Conviction on eight of the counts was affirmed by the federal appeals court in San Francisco. The case, United States v. Ressam, No. 07-455, concerned only the ninth count, carrying explosives ''during the commission of'' a felony.   The felony in question was lying to the customs officer who questioned Mr. Ressam at his point of entry at Port Angeles, Wash. The question for the court was whether that law should be understood to require that the explosive be carried ''in relation'' to the underlying felony, or whether it was sufficient that it occurred at the same time.   The appeals court required a relationship, but the justices, in an opinion by Justice Stevens, disagreed. Justice Breyer was the lone dissenter.   Appeal Rejected in Nazi Case   WASHINGTON (AP)  --  The Justice Department said Monday that a man accused of being a former Nazi death camp guard had exhausted all legal avenues for staying in the United States and that the government was committed to deporting him.    The department commented after the Supreme Court refused to hear the case of the man, John Demjanjuk, 88, who lives in Seven Hills, a suburb of Cleveland.    A judge ruled in 2002 that documents from World War II proved that Mr. Demjanjuk had been a Nazi guard at various  camps.   A 2005 deportation order would send Mr. Demjanjuk to Germany, Poland or his native Ukraine. "
Fight Terror With YouTube,"Daniel Kimmage is a senior analyst at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.   AL QAEDA made its name in blood and pixels, with deadly attacks and an avalanche of electronic news media.  Recent news articles depict an online terrorist juggernaut that has defied the best efforts by the United States government to counter it. While these articles are themselves a testimony to Al Qaeda's media savvy, they don't tell the whole story.   When it comes to user-generated content and interactivity, Al Qaeda is now behind the curve. And the United States can help to keep it there by encouraging the growth of freer, more empowered online communities, especially in the Arab-Islamic world.Â    The genius of Al Qaeda was to combine real-world mayhem with virtual marketing. The group's guerrilla media network supports a family of brands, from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (in Algeria and Morocco) to the Islamic State of Iraq, through a daily stream of online media products that would make any corporation jealous.   A recent report I wrote for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty details this flow. In July 2007, for example, Al Qaeda released more than 450 statements, books, articles, magazines, audio recordings, short videos of attacks and longer films. These products reach the world through a network of quasi-official online production and distribution entities, like Al Sahab, which releases statements by Osama bin Laden.    But the Qaeda media nexus, as advanced as it is, is old hat. If Web 1.0 was about creating the snazziest official Web resources and Web 2.0 is about letting users run wild with self-created content and interactivity, Al Qaeda and its affiliates are stuck in 1.0.   In late 2006, with YouTube and Facebook growing rapidly, a position paper by a Qaeda-affiliated institute discouraged media jihadists from overly ''exuberant'' efforts on behalf of the group for fear of diluting its message.   This is probably sound advice, considering how Al Qaeda fares on YouTube. A recent list of the most viewed YouTube videos in Arabic about Al Qaeda included a rehash of an Islamic State of Iraq clip with sardonic commentary added and satirical verses about Al Qaeda by an Iraqi poet.    Statements by Mr. bin Laden and his chief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, that are posted to YouTube do draw comments aplenty. But the reactions, which range from praise to blanket condemnation, are a far cry from the invariably positive feedback Al Qaeda gets on moderated jihadist forums. And even Al Qaeda's biggest YouTube hits attract at most a small fraction of the millions of views that clips of Arab pop stars rack up routinely.   Other Qaeda ventures into interactivity are equally unimpressive. Mr. Zawahri solicited online questions last December, but his answers didn't appear until early April. That's eons in Web time.   Even if security concerns dictated the delay, as Mr. Zawahri claimed, this is further evidence of the online obstacles facing the world's most-wanted fugitives. Try to imagine Osama bin Laden managing his   Facebook account, and you can see why full-scale social networking might not be Al Qaeda's next frontier.    It's also an indication of how a more interactive, empowered online community, particularly in the Arab-Islamic world, may prove to be Al Qaeda's Achilles' heel. Anonymity and accessibility, the hallmarks of Web 1.0, provided an ideal platform for Al Qaeda's radical demagoguery. Social networking, the emerging hallmark of Web 2.0, can unite a fragmented silent majority and help it to find its voice in the face of thuggish opponents, whether they are repressive rulers or extremist Islamic movements.    Unfortunately, the authoritarian governments of the Middle East are doing their best to hobble Web 2.0. By blocking the Internet, they are leaving the field open to Al Qaeda and its recruiters. The American military's statistics and jihadists' own online postings show that among the most common countries of origin for foreign fighters in Iraq are Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen.  It's no coincidence that Reporters Without Borders lists Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria as ''Internet enemies,'' and Libya and Yemen as countries where the Web is ''under surveillance.'' There is a simple lesson here: unfettered access to a free Internet is not merely a goal to which we should aspire on principle, but also a very practical means of countering Al Qaeda. As users increasingly make themselves heard, the ensuing chaos will not be to everyone's liking, but it may shake the online edifice of Al Qaeda's totalitarian ideology.   It would be premature to declare Al Qaeda's marketing strategy hopelessly anachronistic. The group has shown remarkable resilience and will find ways to adapt to new trends.    But Al Qaeda's online media network is also vulnerable to disruption. Technology-literate intelligence services that understand how the Qaeda media nexus works will do some of the job. The most damaging disruptions to the nexus, however, will come from millions of ordinary users in the communities that Al Qaeda aims for with its propaganda. We should do everything we can to empower  them. "
Hackers Tag Lithuanian Web Sites With Soviet Symbols,"Hackers attacked about 300 Web sites in Lithuania over the weekend, defacing them with Soviet symbols and anti-Lithuanian slogans, officials said Monday.   The  Web sites were vandalized two weeks after Lithuania, a former Soviet republic, outlawed the display of Soviet symbols, a ban that touched off new tensions with Russia. Lithuanian officials did not directly accuse Russian hackers of initiating the attacks, but said they had come from foreign computers and were most likely related to the ban.Â    Last year, Web sites in Estonia, another Baltic nation and former Soviet republic that has rocky relations with Russia, were bombarded with attacks  after Estonian officials removed a statue of a Red Army soldier from the center of the capital, Tallinn, provoking violent disturbances.    Russia and the Baltic nations have had frequent rifts stemming from different interpretations of events in World War II. While Russia says the Soviet Union liberated Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from Nazi rule, the Baltic nations view Moscow as an invader and occupier. Some Estonian officials contend that Russia was behind last year's Internet  attacks, but the Kremlin has said it had no role in them.   Over the weekend in Lithuania, Web sites of government agencies, political parties and businesses were defaced with the hammer-and-sickle symbol and five-pointed stars, as well as derisive and profane anti-Lithuanian slogans, said Rytis Rainys, a Lithuanian official.   He said Lithuanian governmental agencies had received intelligence warnings of impending attacks, and were able to combat them on Saturday. The private sector was not so lucky, he said, and investigators are still collecting estimates of their financial losses. The intelligence linked the Web site attacks to the ban on Soviet symbols, he said.   Most of the Web sites were restored by Monday.   Relations between Russia and Estonia also seemed  to worsen over the weekend. On Sunday, Estonia's president, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, walked out of a conference in Russia after a member of the Russian Parliament harshly criticized him.   The Russian official, Konstantin Kosachyov, accused Mr. Ilves of stirring up pro-independence sentiment among Russia's Finno-Ugric minority and condemned Estonia's treatment of its sizable Russian minority.    The conference was focused on Finno-Ugric culture. Last year, Mr. Ilves was barred from attending the conference in Russia, though Estonia is one of only three countries (along with Finland and Hungary) that have a majority Finno-Ugric population.   After walking out of the conference on Sunday, Mr. Ilves told The Associated Press that Mr. Kosachyov's charges were absurd.   Besides the tensions over   the Soviet role at the end of World War II, there are other issues with the Baltic countries as well. In the Soviet era, hundreds of thousands of Russian speakers were relocated to the Baltics, leaving each country with a sizable Russian-speaking minority after the collapse of the Soviet Union.   Russia now contends that Latvia and Estonia discriminate against Russian speakers, and says all three Baltic nations fail to recognize the heroism of Soviet soldiers. "
"Goodbye, Passwords. You Aren't a Good Defense.","Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University.

Passwords won't keep us safe from identity theft, no matter how clever we are in choosing them.   That would be the case even if we had done a better job of listening to instructions. Surveys show that we've remained stubbornly fond of perennial favorites like ''password,'' ''123456'' and ''LetMeIn.'' The underlying problem, however, isn't their simplicity. It's the log-on procedure itself, in which we land on a Web page, which may or may not be what it says it is, and type in a string of characters to authenticate our identity (or have our password manager insert the expected string on our behalf).    This procedure -- which now seems perfectly natural because we've been trained to repeat it so much -- is a bad idea, one that no security expert whom I reached would defend.   Password-based log-ons are susceptible to being compromised in any number of  ways. Consider a single threat, that posed by phishers who trick us into clicking to a site designed to mimic a legitimate one in order to harvest our log-on information. Once we've been suckered at one site and our password purloined, it can be tried at other sites.    The solution urged by the experts is to abandon passwords  -- and to  move to a fundamentally different model, one in which humans play little or no part in logging on. Instead, machines have a cryptographically encoded conversation to establish both parties' authenticity, using digital keys that we, as  users, have no need to see.   In short, we need a log-on system that relies on cryptography, not mnemonics.   As users, we would replace passwords with so-called information cards, icons on our screen that we select with a click to log on to a Web site. The click starts a handshake between machines that relies on hard-to-crack cryptographic code. The necessary software for creating information cards is on only about 20 percent of PCs, though that's up from 10 percent a year ago. Windows Vista machines are equipped by default, but Windows XP, Mac and Linux machines require downloads.   And that's only half the battle: Web site hosts must also be persuaded to adopt information-card technology for sign-ons.    We won't make much progress on information cards in the near future, however, because of wasted energy and attention devoted to a large distraction, the OpenID initiative. OpenID promotes ''Single Sign-On'': with it, logging on to one OpenID Web site with one password will grant entrance during that session to all Web sites that accept   OpenID credentials.   OpenID offers, at best, a little convenience, and ignores the security vulnerability inherent in the process of typing a password into someone else's Web site. Nevertheless, every few months another brand-name company announces that it has become the newest OpenID signatory. Representatives of Google, I.B.M., Microsoft and Yahoo are on   OpenID's guiding board of corporations. Last month, when MySpace announced that it would support the standard, the nonprofit foundation   OpenID.net boasted that the number of ''OpenID enabled users'' had passed 500 million and that ''it's clear the momentum is only just starting to pick up.''   Support for OpenID is conspicuously limited, however. Each of the big powers supposedly  backing OpenID is glad to create an OpenID identity for visitors, which can be used at its site, but it isn't willing to rely upon the OpenID credentials issued by others. You can't use Microsoft-issued OpenID at Yahoo, nor Yahoo's at Microsoft.   Why not? Because the companies see the many ways that the password-based log-on process, handled elsewhere, could be compromised. They do not want to take on the liability for  mischief originating at someone else's site.   When I asked Scott Kveton, chairman of the OpenID Foundation's community board, about criticism of OpenID, he said candidly, ''Passwords, we know, are totally broken.'' He said new security options, such as software that works with OpenID that installs within the browser, are being offered. When it comes to security, he said, ''there is no silver bullet, and there never will be.''   Kim Cameron, Microsoft's chief architect of identity, is an enthusiastic advocate of information cards, which are not only vastly more secure than a password-based security system, but are also customizable, permitting users to limit what information is released to particular sites.  ''I don't like Single Sign-On,'' Mr. Cameron said. ''I don't believe in Single Sign-On.''    Microsoft and Google are among the six founding companies of the  Information Card Foundation, formed to promote adoption of the card technology. The presence of PayPal, which is owned by eBay,  in the group is the most significant: PayPal, with its direct access to our checking accounts, will naturally  be inclined to be conservative. If it becomes convinced that these cards are more secure than passwords, we should listen.   BUT perhaps information cards in certain situations are convenient to a fault, permitting anyone who happens by a PC that is  momentarily unattended in an office setting  to click quickly through a sign-on at a Web site holding sensitive information. This need not pose a problem, however.   ''Users on shared systems can easily set up a simple PIN code to protect any card from use by other users,'' Mr. Cameron said.    The PIN doesn't return us to the Web password mess: it never leaves our machine and can't be seen by phishers.   Unlearning the habit of typing a  password into a box on a Web page will take a long while, but it's needed for our own protection. Logging on to a site should entail a cryptographic conversation between machines, saving us from inadvertently giving away the keys.   No more relying on our old companion ''LetMeIn.''  "
Russian Gang Hijacking PC Networks in Vast Scheme to Steal Information,"A criminal gang is using software tools normally reserved for computer network administrators to infect thousands of PCs in corporate and government networks with programs that steal passwords and other information, a security researcher has found.   The new form of attack indicates that little progress has been made in defusing the threat of botnets, networks of infected computers that criminals use to send spam, steal passwords and do other forms of damage, according to computer security investigators.    Several security experts say that although attacks against network administrators are not new, the systematic use of administrative software to spread malicious software has not been widely seen until now.Â    The gang was identified publicly in May by Joe Stewart, director of malware research at SecureWorks, a computer security firm in Atlanta. Mr. Stewart, who has determined that the gang is based in Russia, was able to locate a central program controlling as many as 100,000 infected computers across the Internet. The program was running at a commercial Internet hosting computer center in Wisconsin.    Mr. Stewart alerted a federal law enforcement agency that he declined to identify, and he said that it was investigating the matter. Although the original command program was shut down, the gang immediately reconstituted the system, he said, moving the control program to another computer in the Ukraine, beyond the reach of  law enforcement in the United States.   The system infects PCs with a program known as Coreflood that records keystrokes and steals other information. The network of infected computers collected as much as 500 gigabytes of data in a little more than a year and sent it back to the Wisconsin computer center, Mr. Stewart said.    One of the unique aspects of the malicious software is that it captures screen information in addition to passwords, according to Mark Seiden, a veteran computer security engineer. That makes it possible for gang members to see information like bank balances without having to log in to stolen accounts.   Mr. Stewart's discoveries are evidence that while the botnet problem is now well understood, botnets are still a widespread threat.   ''The rate of infection is still high, but concern among corporations is low,'' said Rick Wesson, a botnet investigator at Support Intelligence, a security consulting firm in San Francisco. ''Many corporations seem to think it's O.K. to be infected several times a month.''    Mr. Stewart and other computer security investigators have previously described the activities of the gang that uses the Coreflood program. But Mr. Stewart plans to offer new details about the gang, which has operated with impunity for several years, at the Black Hat Briefings computer security conference that begins Thursday in Las Vegas.   As part of his investigation, Mr. Stewart charted the rate of computer infections at a state police agency and a large hotel chain. Both were victims of an outbreak that began after the gang obtained the password and login information of their network administrators. In both cases hundreds or thousands of computers were infected within minutes or hours.   Mr. Stewart would not name the organizations because of the continuing law enforcement investigation.   In these examples as well as a range of others, the gang infected a machine belonging to an administrator and then used Microsoft administrative tools to infect all the computers for which that person had responsibility, Mr. Stewart said.   The new attack is a byproduct of the way modern computer networks are administered, where authority is centralized and software updates for thousands of machines are automated.   ''The great thing about this system is that from one computer it is possible to push out updates to all machines in a corporate network at once,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''This is a useful tool that Microsoft has provided. However, the bad guys said, 'We'll just use it to roll out our Trojan to every machine in the network.' ''   A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on the attacks.   Mr. Stewart said that the gang behind the Coreflood program was responsible for 378,000 infections over 16 months. In each case the infected computer would capture and transmit personal information to a centralized database that kept track of the ''spies'' in the network.   In his Black Hat presentation, Mr. Stewart plans to say that he believes the Russian gang was behind a successful theft of money from the bank account of a Miami businessman, Joe Lopez.    In April 2004, someone made an unauthorized wire transfer of $90,348 from Mr. Lopez's account with Bank of America to Parex Bank in Riga, Latvia. Of that amount, $20,000 was successfully withdrawn by a person using a false identity. The Coreflood program was found on Mr. Lopez's computer.   After discovering the control program in Wisconsin, Mr. Stewart tracked the online activities of some gang members in a Russian city that he declined to identify because of the investigation.    He said translations of some entries on the blogging site LiveJournal had led him to believe that one member of the gang had died, but that others remained active. He said that he had provided investigators with a wealth of information about the group from members' online discussions and other material he had collected.   ''If the Russians are sincerely interested in tracking these guys down, I think it's possible,'' he said. "
Payback,"My neighbor left a nasty note on my windshield regarding how close I had parked to   her car: ''Learn how to park! I couldn't get out! Next time I'm slamming your front   bumper [expletive]!'' It was written on an envelope containing $40. Should I return the money or keep it as payment for her harsh words? NAME WITHHELD, COLORADO   The temptation to respond in kind is powerful but should be resisted. It would be perverse to reshape the Golden Rule into: do unto others as they do unto you. You are not exempt from the duty to return something that does not belong to you, even if it belongs to a lout, even a lout who is profligate with exclamation points. I suppose you could persuade yourself that your foulmouthed neighbor wants you to have the $40, perhaps to pay for a refresher course in parking, but that seems unlikely.Â    What you can do: slip a courteous note under her door, offering to return her $40 if she would stop by to pick it up and civilly discuss the parking situation. If she doesn't reply, keep the cash.   The company I work for protects customer privacy by requiring passwords to access its network and encouraging employees to ''lock'' their computers when they leave their desks. But the company makes each employee's own salary, Social Security number and other sensitive information easily available via that employee's computer. With a few clicks, any passer-by could access this information. A high-ranking executive said this was done to motivate employees to secure their computers. Ethical? NAME WITHHELD   The company's desire for computer security is reasonable; its methods are not. It would be similarly off-base to encourage driver safety by packing the company cars full of nitroglycerin: the wish not to be blown to bits can be a powerful incentive. But to deliberately subject employees to avoidable risk is not ethical. The company must protect the privacy of both its customers and its employees, and this can be done without creating artificial peril. It would be acceptable for the company to penalize or even fire employees who show flagrant and persistent disregard for computer security, but the penalty may not include displaying an employee's Social Security number on a billboard in front of the office.   When my 23-year-old son learned I was considering Botox injections, he said, ''Oh, great, now I can get a tattoo.'' I disapprove of tattoos because they disturb our natural bodies. He replied that the same could be said about Botox. I argued that Botox is an improvement. Thoughts? M.B., STAMFORD, CONN.   Botox improves the look of a face in the sense that vinyl siding improves the look of a house. But while it is ultimately a matter of taste (my own notwithstanding) as to whether one admires a face frozen into immobility (the fun of rigor mortis without the inconvenience of death), it is tough to argue that Botox is ''natural.''   Please understand: I am in favor of disturbing our natural bodies. Even a cursory glance around you will demonstrate that ''natural'' is not a synonym for ''beautiful.'' (Hence clothing. And gyms.) But neither is ''tattooed.'' And while you can debate the relative allure of Botox and tattooing, your opinion of one is not contingent on your view of the other. Each should be evaluated independently. (When sober.) If you and your son both go forward, I suspect that years from now you will have a contest neither of ethics nor of aesthetics but of remorse. "
Brakes on a Foreign Deal,"Does  the ''America for Sale'' sign require a warning label?   That would seem to be the case in light of the apparent collapse on Wednesday of a Chinese company's effort to purchase a stake in 3Com, an American maker of Internet router and networking equipment, in the face of Bush administration questions about the deal's national security risks.   The proposed $2.2 billion deal had called for Bain Capital, a private equity firm based in Boston, to join with a Chinese company, Huawei Technologies, to acquire 3Com. The snag was that 3Com makes antihacking computer software for the military, among other things, and Huawei Technologies has ties to the Chinese military.   A special federal panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, had been examining the national security risks of the deal. A person briefed on the talks said that at one point, 3Com offered to divest itself of the antihacking software unit, known as TippingPoint, but that the Bush administration was unswayed.Â    The concern in Washington was that the Chinese company would be able to alter the electronic equipment and computer software sold to the military in a way that made it less than 100 percent effective. ''It is easier to hide than it is to find,'' a United States official said about problems in software.   Despite the collapse of the 3Com deal,  American officials and specialists in the field said it would be premature to conclude that the United States had decided it needed to crack down on foreign investments, even in delicate technology areas.   Last year, for example, there were nearly 2,000 mergers and acquisitions of foreign and American companies in transactions involving more than $400 billion, according to Thomson Financial.    Yet Cfius examined only 147 of the transactions for possible security violations. In nine cases, the companies  withdrew from the process once concerns were raised, as 3Com did on Wednesday, though it hinted that it might still try to win approval down the road.    The person with knowledge of the 3Com talks, who was not authorized to comment, said that given the concerns of the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security, it was doubtful that 3Com could arrive at what is called a ''mitigation agreement'' to let the deal go through. Such accords usually involve safeguards, pledges and internal separation walls.   ''We are very disappointed that we were unable to reach a mitigation agreement with Cfius for this transaction,'' said Edgar Masri, 3Com's chief executive, in a statement. He added that 3Com would seek ''alternatives that would address Cfius's concerns'' and continue to try to build its global networking business.   The troubles of the 3Com deal cast new light on the committee, which consists of representative of 12  agencies and is led by the Treasury Department. The panel's mandate to block foreign investments was bolstered  last year after criticism of its handling of the 2006 purchase of a company that operates American ports by a company in Dubai.   The withdrawal of the bid by Dubai Ports World occurred not because the foreign investment committee rejected it but because of a torrent of criticism from Capitol Hill, around the same time that  similar criticism of a deal by the Chinese state energy company to buy Unocal also led China to withdraw.   The activities of the little-known committee  have multiplied since 2006, in part because there are more foreign acquisitions and mergers involving American properties and companies and also  because the buyers and sellers are increasingly alert to the fallout and choose voluntarily to submit their deals to the review process.   ''There's no question that Dubai Ports World led to an increase in filings of transactions with Cfius,'' Clay Lowery, assistant secretary of Treasury for international affairs, said in an interview last week before the 3Com withdrawal.   ''Cfius is a voluntary process,'' Mr. Lowery added. ''Any of the agencies that sit on the committee can request a filing, but most companies recognize that it's in their interest to file if the transaction might raise national security questions.''   The Treasury Department would not comment on the 3Com situation.   Meanwhile, the problems of the 3Com deal are sure to aggravate tensions with China.    This month, federal officials charged a Defense Department official with passing classified documents to China. In a separate case, the Justice Department arrested a former Boeing engineer in California on charges of economic espionage for the Chinese.   Members of Congress have also asked the Bush administration to defend its decision last year to allow certain Chinese companies to import crucial  military technologies without licenses, after a report by the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, an independent research group, charging that the companies have ties to the military.   The 3Com deal had  already drawn criticism in Congress from Republicans and Democrats, who cited a study by the RAND Corporation a few years ago outlining the ties between Huawei Technologies and the Chinese military.   The RAND study said that  the Chinese company had been founded by the man who is now its  chief, Ren Zhengfei, a former senior figure in the People's Liberation Army.     American officials said his identity had led to particular concerns at  homeland security, which began  a cyber-security initiative recently.   The questions being raised  in Congress over the deal  --  led by Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida and Senator John Kyl of Arizona, both Republicans, as well as many prominent Democrats  --  made some people wary of  another firestorm like the Dubai Ports deal of two years ago.   ''It's hard to conceive that, at some senior levels in the administration, there wasn't an appreciation that if this were concluded favorably, there might be an adverse political reaction,'' said a Republican aide, who was authorized to speak as long as he remained anonymous.  ''There are growing concerns about cyber-security, and it's a presidential election year.''   China's increasing involvement in the United States economy,  including the recent purchase by  a Chinese government investment fund of  stakes in the private equity firm Blackstone and in the investment banker Morgan Stanley,  has aggravated concerns in Congress. But the Bush administration does not view these as threats to national security.   In addition, foreign investors have been careful to make sure their investments are below the 10 percent threshold that would lead to questions of whether a foreign government would control the American-owned entity. The 3Com deal involved a stake of more than 16 percent by the Chinese company.   Some lawmakers like Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of  New York, have suggested that the federal law should be expanded to allow the United States government to block foreign acquisition of companies in economically strategic areas, especially when the investors are foreign governments.   But the Treasury Department adamantly opposes extending the curbs on foreign investments into areas  that affect economic security as opposed to national security, though it says it will monitor growing foreign investments in whole sectors of the economy, even in the financial sector.    The major deals of the last several months in which sovereign wealth funds owned by foreign governments  have bought sizable stakes in Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Blackstone, the Carlyle Group and others are thus not likely to be blocked by Cfius, accordingto most experts.

What's Running On Your Intranet?,"In the Internet age, the corporate firewall is a  sieve.   That is the sobering conclusion, spelled out in technical detail, in a new report on what is happening on corporate computer networks.Â    The research was done by Palo Alto Networks, a start-up company in Silicon Valley. Some of the findings were presented by Nir Zuk, the company's chief technology officer, at a panel this month at the RSA computer security conference in San Francisco.   It should be noted that Palo Alto Networks is marketing what it calls next-generation firewalls to address the problems described in the report. But the research itself looks quite solid. It is based not on surveys of people but on a study of network traffic at 20 large companies and government agencies over the last six months. Using its software, Palo Alto Networks monitored the computer behavior of more than 350,000 users.    Many companies try to block access to peer-to-peer file-sharing services, but programs used to access these services were found at 90 percent of the companies studied. The most popular were eMule and BitTorrent, which are used to share music, movies and software.   Unauthorized proxies, or software agents that disguise applications, were found on 80 percent of the corporate networks. These can be used for corporate espionage or pilfering trade secrets.   Google applications like Google Docs and Google Desktop were used in 60 percent of the corporations studied. And, no surprise, Internet video services like YouTube were consuming large portions of network bandwidth at all the companies.   But the answer, it seems, is not a draconian crackdown on all Internet applications, but a more fine-grained monitoring and sorting of what applications can play in corporate networks and under what ground rules. After all, many Internet applications are seen as vital tools of productivity, collaboration and innovation -- the stuff of the Enterprise 2.0 model that many companies are embracing. STEVE LOHR "
Security Flaw Is Revealed In T-Mobile's Google Phone,"Just days after the T-Mobile G1 smartphone went on the market, a group of security researchers have found what they call a serious flaw in the Android software from Google that runs it.Â    One of the researchers, Charles A. Miller, notified Google of the flaw this week and said he was publicizing it now because he believed that cellphone users were not generally aware that increasingly sophisticated smartphones faced the same threats that plague Internet-connected personal computers.   Mr. Miller, a former National Security Agency computer security specialist, said the flaw could be exploited by an attacker who might trick a G1 user into visiting a booby-trapped Web site.   The G1 -- the so-called Google phone -- went on sale at T-Mobile stores on Wednesday.   Google executives acknowledged the issue but said that the security features of the phone would limit the extent of damage that could be done by an intruder, compared with today's PCs and other cellphones.    Unlike modern personal computers and other advanced smartphones like the iPhone, the Google phone creates a series of software compartments that limit the access of  an intruder to a single application.   ''We wanted to sandbox every single application because you can't trust any of them,'' said Rich Cannings, a Google security engineer. He said that the company had already fixed an open-source version of the software and was working with its partners, T-Mobile and HTC, to offer fixes for its current customers.   Typically, today's computer operating systems try to limit access by creating a partition between a single user's control of the machine and complete access to programs and data, which is referred to as superuser, root or administrative access.    The risk in the Google design, according to Mr. Miller, who is a principal security analyst at Independent Security Evaluators in Baltimore, lies in the danger from within the Web browser partition in the phone. It would be possible, for example, for an intruder to install software that would capture keystrokes entered by the user when surfing to other Web sites. That would make it possible to steal identity information or passwords.   Mr. Miller has previously gained attention for finding other vulnerabilities. In March, he received $10,000 and a Macintosh Air laptop in a contest at the CanSecWest security conference by reading the contents of a file stored on a Mac laptop by directing the machine to a Web site that was able to exploit a vulnerability in Apple's Safari browser.   Google executives said they believed that Mr. Miller had violated an unwritten code between companies and researchers that is intended to give companies time to fix problems before they are publicized.    Mr. Miller said he was withholding technical details, but said he felt that consumers had a right to know that products had shortcomings. "
Craigslist's Countersuit Criticizes eBay's Tactics,"Craigslist, the online classified ad company, filed a countersuit Tuesday against its minority owner eBay, accusing it of unfair competition, false advertising, trademark infringement and diluting the value of the Craigslist trademark.Â    Craigslist's lawsuit, filed in California Superior Court in San Francisco, is the company's first substantive response to a lawsuit eBay filed against Craigslist last month in the Delaware Court of Chancery accusing the smaller company of unfairly and secretly trying to dilute the value of eBay's investment in the company by more than 10 percent and deprive it of a board seat.   The countersuit exposes how the tension between the companies has been growing since shortly after eBay's 2004 purchase of a 28.4 percent interest in Craigslist. Craigslist's suit says eBay has continually tried to exert control over Craigslist, a privately held company in San Francisco that is widely known for its anticorporate philosophy.    It revealed that eBay acquired the shares by buying an option to acquire the shares of a minority shareholder of Craigslist, whom the company did not identify. The suit said that because eBay's option prevented Craigslist from finding another buyer, Craigslist then repurchased the shares and issued new shares to eBay.   The suit does not state the purchase price or give a value for the shares owned by Craig Newmark, Craigslist's founder, or Jim Buckmaster, its chief executive.   In its suit, Craigslist asks the court to restore eBay's holdings to Craigslist.     The company has also accused eBay of ''business interference, false advertising, phishing attacks, free-riding'' and other misdeeds.   Kimberly Rubey, an eBay spokeswoman, called Craigslist's claims ''unfounded and unsubstantiated'' and described them as ploy to distract attention from eBay's claims in its suit. ''EBay has, and will continue to be, a minority shareholder who believes in Craigslist, shares its values and acts with openness, honesty and integrity in its dealings with Craigslist's board and the online community,'' Ms. Rubey said. ''We strongly refute any suggestion to the contrary.''    Craigslist said that while the two companies agreed that eBay's interest in Craigslist would not preclude the two companies from competing, eBay misused its role as minority  owner of Craigslist to gain access to company information and then use it to compete unfairly.   Craigslist contends that eBay used its shareholder status to plant on Craigslist's board company officials who had responsibility for a competing site, Kijiji.com.    Craigslist added, ''Under the guise of shareholder requests for information, eBay has hounded Craigslist with improper demands for confidential Craigslist information, which could be used for anticompetitive purposes.''    Craigslist also accused eBay of diluting the value of the Craigslist trademark by diverting customers looking for Craigslist to the Kijiji site. Craigslist's suit says that eBay placed misleading advertising on Google.com intended to direct users to Kijiji. Inside eBay, the suit contends, Kijiji is known as the ''Craigslist killer.''   On several occasions, Meg Whitman, eBay's former chief executive and a member of the board, has expressed an interest in acquiring the remainder of Craigslist, the suit contended. The suit also says that after buying a Dutch classified ad site for $290 million, an eBay official asked Craigslist executives, ''What do you think we would pay for the largest classified ad site in the United States?''

"This Round, Accusations Of Spying And Thievery","E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com Yuan Cao spent a weekend in late September 2006 in front of a computer at Institutional Credit Partners, a private investment bank where he had worked for five weeks. That Sunday, he moved computer files onto two flash drives -- standard backups, he would later maintain -- signed off, and left the office. Two days later, he quit by e-mail message.   His bosses said he had to come back for an exit interview, so Mr. Cao returned on Oct. 2. He had worked on complex financial instruments known as credit derivatives. At the end of his meeting, two police officers appeared in the conference room and arrested him on charges of stealing information worth millions of dollars. He was handcuffed and taken to the Midtown North station house.Â    Later that day, a detective questioned Mr. Cao, and they went to his new job to retrieve the flash drives, which were in a backpack on his desk. He was indicted on felony charges that carry prison sentences up to 25 years.   Now, Mr. Cao, 25, and his lawyer say that he is not a thief who stole valuable information, but rather a hapless computer geek who was mistaken for a corporate spy in hand-to-hand legal combat between Mr. Cao's former employer, Institutional Credit, and a Canadian insurance company, Fairfax Financial Holdings. The innocent act of backing up data, they say, took on a sinister cast because of brutal civil litigation that Mr. Cao has nothing to do with.   That civil fight involves claims that dirty tricks were used to drive down Fairfax's stock price -- and a countercharge by Institutional Credit that covert operatives sent by Fairfax have been following its executives to their homes, stealing garbage and surveilling family members.   And even though Mr. Cao is not involved with that dispute, one detail emerged from it recently that startled senior officials in the Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mr. Cao.    A few weeks after his arrest, the president of Institutional Credit, Thomas J. Priore, made a $5,000 contribution to a boxing charity on Long Island. Mr. Priore said he learned about the group and its need for support from Bernard Hardy, the New York City police detective who investigated Institutional Credit's complaint against Mr. Cao. The detective's son boxed with the group. Mr. Priore said it was unfair to suggest there was a connection between the arrest of Mr. Cao and the money it gave to the boxing club weeks later.    ''Are we appreciative of Detective Hardy's work?'' Mr. Priore said. ''Yeah. The guy did a great job of catching a criminal. We're appreciative of people who make the financial and business world a place where we can operate without thieves.''   The company asked the detective how to contribute to the boxing charity, according to Carlos Mendez, an executive with Institutional Credit. Later that fall, a company check for $5,000 was brought to an exhibition boxing match in Long Island, a fund-raiser sponsored by the Westbury Boxing Club. Most of the donations ranged from $50 to $200, according to Michael DerGarabedian, a lawyer who administered the funds but was not involved in collecting them. ''With that $5,000, we had maybe $8,000 in the account,'' Mr. DerGarabedian said.   Mr. Cao's lawyer, Michael Bachner, told a judge in Manhattan that he learned about the check from lawyers with the firm of Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman, which represents the Canadian insurer in its lawsuit against Institutional Credit.   ''We're concerned that payment may have had an impact on the way Mr. Cao was treated,'' Mr. Bachner said Friday. The most serious charges have been dismissed, but Mr. Cao is still accused of unlawfully copying computer information worth more than $2,500. A spokeswoman for the district attorney's office would not comment on the check yesterday, citing a continuing investigation. Mr. Priore said that his company had been the victim of a crime, and that it made the donation to support a worthy program. Detective Hardy, who could not be reached by phone for comment, was asked by Mr. Bachner about the check during a pretrial hearing last month, and said there was no connection between it and the arrest.    Mr. Cao, who came  from China to attend M.I.T. for graduate school, is now unemployed, his lawyer said.   As for the Westbury Boxing Club, it certainly needed the money, said Pete Brodsky, who founded the club in 1979. ''The club was going under,'' he said. ''We have kids who are from indigent families -- they can't afford gloves, wraps for the hands. We give them a place to go.''   He was not running the group at the time of the 2006 fund-raiser, he said, but has taken the reins again. The program survived, but faces new financial troubles, he said. Would he consider going back to the group's biggest donor? ''I think I'll try some other people,'' Mr. Brodsky said. "
Tax Inquiry? Principality Is Offended,"It's not exactly the ''mouse that roared,'' though maybe the mouse that resisted.    After weathering days of criticism from Germany over a spectacular tax evasion case, Liechtenstein -- sometimes seen as the inspiration for the satirical novel from the 1950s about a tiny Alpine principality that declared war on the United States -- is digging in for what may be a prolonged battle to defend its lucrative tradition of banking secrecy against what it views as attacks from a giant neighbor.   In a defiant news conference on Tuesday, Liechtenstein's crown prince, Alois, said his country would take legal steps to protect banking clients from German investigators, who have begun a campaign to expose wealthy Germans suspected of hiding money here to avoid paying taxes.    Wealth management has been a lucrative business for Liechtenstein, turning it from a rural backwater into a financial center. Its 35,000 citizens have a per-capita income listed as the fourth highest by the World Bank, which does not provide a figure and says the ranking is approximate.Â    ''We are a small country dependent on friendly neighborly relations,'' Crown Prince Alois said in Vaduz, the sleepy capital. ''But we are also a sovereign state and, we hope, do not live in an era when might makes right  rather than international law and international agreements.''   Branded as an uncooperative tax haven by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a 30-nation group that includes most of the richest countries, Liechtenstein tried to seize the moral high ground by focusing on the disclosure that Germany's intelligence service had paid an unnamed informant for stolen banking data.   ''Such actions would be legally unthinkable in Liechtenstein and many other nations,'' Crown Prince Alois said. ''Here, fiscal interests cannot be placed ahead of the rule of law.''    The criticism of the Berlin government's methods was echoed by lawyers in Germany, with some predicting that the courts would not admit data from a stolen computer disk as trial evidence. ''Of course, we know that secret services pay for information,'' said Eberhard Kempf, a leading defense lawyer.  ''But in this case, to pay for stolen data to be used in a legal case is unthinkable.''   Liechtenstein's royal family spoke out as the government and the financial industry here tried to contain the fallout from the German investigation. Prosecutors in Germany widened their net, with raids on the Munich offices of Dresdner Bank and UBS.   They also issued an arrest warrant for a brother of Klaus Zumwinkel, the former chief executive of the German postal system, according to German news reports. Mr. Zumwinkel resigned his post last Friday, after becoming the first prominent target of the crackdown.    Bankers in Liechtenstein say they have been calling clients to reassure them about the security of their accounts, even as it emerged that the information being used by the German investigators probably stemmed from a data theft six years ago at the LGT Group, a bank owned by the royal family.   Prosecutors in Liechtenstein said they thought that the data had been  stolen by a former employee, who worked at the bank in 2001 and 2002. They did not say whether he passed the information to Germany. People close to the bank identified him as Heinrich Kieber.    On Tuesday, Standard & Poor's said it had revised its outlook for LGT to negative from stable because of ''risks to the bank's reputation from an investigation by German fiscal authorities.''   In Vaduz, residents seemed nonplused by the German, Swiss and Austrian television news crews swarming their tidy streets, and were concerned over the threat to their little country's privileged position.   The capital, a mixture of farmhouses and marble-and-glass bank blocks, may seem like an unlikely trove of wealth. BMWs are sometimes followed down the main street by tractors pulling loads of manure.    As other tax havens have been shut down or persuaded to adopt global standards, Liechtenstein has thrived. Assets at banks based in the country, which uses the Swiss franc as its currency, have risen to about 200 billion Swiss francs ($182.8 billion)  from about 67 billion in 1996, according to the banking association.   And that does not include assets held in foundations like those at the center of the German investigations.   German officials said they expect these matters to be raised in a meeting Wednesday in Berlin between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Liechtenstein's prime minister, Otmar Hasler.   Liechtenstein argues that it is moving toward a more cooperative stance. Its representative at the European Union, Prince Nikolaus,  said the principality was negotiating an agreement with the authorities in Brussels that would help stem cross-border financial fraud.   Prince Nikolaus, who is the uncle of Crown Prince Alois, said Liechtenstein is in the process of adopting a new law to make it harder to disguise the owners of foundations. Many foreigners set up foundations in Liechtenstein to shield their money from tax collectors.   ''We are moving, but of course we don't like to be bullied,'' Prince Nikolaus said in a telephone interview.   Liechtenstein said it had cooperated with the German authorities in several criminal investigations.    ''It's not true that we don't do anything about taxes,'' said Michael Lauber, chief executive of the Liechtenstein Bankers Association.    But while bankers and public officials say they are willing to be flexible, they are standing firm on their commitment to secrecy in all but the most unusual cases.   And while Crown Prince Alois used strong language in responding to  the Germans, it is not clear which country is the underdog in the battle over banking secrecy.   Because Liechtenstein is not a member of the European Union, the leverage that its neighbors can bring to bear is limited. Unlike Switzerland, it has few international companies whose dealings could be penalized by governments seeking to bring it into line on tax matters.   Bankers here say that may explain why Germany is mounting so public a campaign: It may be trying to frighten its own citizens into pulling their money back into taxable accounts at home.   LGT has been moving to diversify its business, attracting more onshore business in Germany and Asia to reduce its reliance on money hidden from prying tax authorities.   An executive close to LGT said that offshore funds from German clients represented less than 10 percent of the bank's roughly 100 billion Swiss francs ($91.4 billion) in Liechtenstein-based assets under management.   Crown Prince Alois said the German ''media campaign'' against Liechtenstein could backfire because it could cause people here to dig in their heels.   ''Apparently the German administration,'' he said, ''still does not understand how to deal with countries that understand direct democracy.'' "
"Patients' Data Stolen, Hospital Says","An employee of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan stole information from the records of as many as 40,000 patients, a hospital spokeswoman said on Friday.Â    The theft -- which occurred over the past several years and included patients' names, phone numbers and Social Security numbers -- was discovered during a federal investigation, and the hospital was notified in January, the spokeswoman, Myrna Manners, said. An internal audit by the hospital confirmed the theft, she said.    The hospital does not believe that any medical information was stolen, Ms. Manners said, adding that there is no evidence that the stolen information has been used.   She declined to identify the employee who the hospital believes stole the data.   ''We obviously deeply regret that this has happened,'' she said, adding that the hospital, at East 68th Street and York Avenue, was trying to contact all patients involved.   Investigators were looking into the possibility that the theft could be part of a larger criminal scheme, Ms. Manners said.    The United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York was investigating the theft, a spokeswoman said, along with the United States  Postal Inspection Service and the United States Secret Service. She declined to give details of the investigation. "
The Undercover Parent,"Harlan Coben is the author of the forthcoming novel ''Hold Tight.''   NOT long ago, friends of mine confessed over dinner that they had put spyware on their 15-year-old son's computer so they could monitor all he did online. At first I was repelled at this invasion of privacy. Now, after doing a fair amount of research, I get it.    Make no mistake: If you put spyware on your computer, you have the ability to log every keystroke your child makes and thus a good portion of his or her private world. That's what spyware is  -- at least the parental monitoring kind. You don't have to be an expert to put it on your computer. You just download the software from a vendor and you will receive reports -- weekly, daily, whatever -- showing you everything your child is doing on the machine.Â    Scary. But a good idea. Most parents won't even consider it.    Maybe it's the word: spyware. It brings up associations of Dick Cheney sitting in a dark room, rubbing his hands together and reading your most private thoughts. But this isn't the government we are talking about -- this is your family. It's a mistake to confuse the two. Loving parents are doing the surveillance here, not faceless bureaucrats. And most parents already monitor their children, watching over their home environment, their school.   Today's overprotective parents fight their kids' battles on the playground, berate coaches about playing time and fill out college applications -- yet when it comes to chatting with pedophiles or watching beheadings or gambling away their entire life savings, then...then their children deserve independence?    Some will say that you should simply trust your child, that if he is old enough to go on the Internet he is old enough to know the dangers. Trust is one thing, but surrendering parental responsibility to a machine that allows the entire world access to your home borders on negligence.    Some will say that it's better just to use parental blocks that deny access to risky sites. I have found that they don't work. Children know how to get around them. But more than that -- and this is where it gets tough -- I want to know what's being said in e-mail and instant messages and in chat rooms.    There are two reasons for this. First, we've all read about the young boy unknowingly conversing with a pedophile or the girl who was cyberbullied to the point where she committed suicide. Would a watchful eye have helped? We rely in the real world on teachers and parents to guard against bullies -- do we just dismiss bullying on the Internet and all it entails because we are entering difficult ethical ground?    Second, everything your child types can already be seen by the world -- teachers, potential employers, friends, neighbors, future dates. Shouldn't he learn now that the Internet is not a haven of privacy?    One of the most popular arguments against spyware is the claim that you are reading your teenager's every thought, that in today's world, a computer is the little key-locked diary of the past. But posting thoughts on the Internet isn't the same thing as hiding them under your mattress. Maybe you should buy your children one of those little key-locked diaries so that they too can understand the difference.    Am I suggesting eavesdropping on every conversation? No. With new technology comes new responsibility. That works both ways. There is a fine line between being responsibly protective and irresponsibly nosy. You shouldn't monitor to find out if your daughter's friend has a crush on Kevin next door or that Mrs. Peterson gives too much homework or what schoolmate snubbed your son. You are there to start conversations and to be a safety net. To borrow from the national intelligence lexicon -- and yes, that's uncomfortable -- you're listening for dangerous chatter.    Will your teenagers find other ways of communicating to their friends when they realize you may be watching? Yes. But text messages and cellphones don't offer the anonymity and danger of the Internet. They are usually one-on-one with someone you know. It is far easier for a predator to troll chat rooms and MySpace and Facebook.    There will be tough calls. If your 16-year-old son, for example, is visiting hardcore pornography sites, what do you do? When I was 16, we looked at Playboy centerfolds and read Penthouse Forum. You may argue that's not the same thing, that Internet pornography makes that stuff seem about as harmful as ''SpongeBob.''    And you're probably right. But in my day, that's all you could get. If something more graphic had been out there, we probably would have gone for it. Interest in those, um, topics is natural. So start a dialogue based on that knowledge. You should have that talk anyway, but now you can have it with some kind of context.   Parenting has never been for the faint of heart. One friend of mine, using spyware to monitor his college-bound, straight-A daughter, found out that not only was she using drugs but she was sleeping with her dealer. He wisely took a deep breath before confronting her. Then he decided to come clean, to let her know how he had found out, to speak with her about the dangers inherent in her behavior. He'd had these conversations before, of course, but this time he had context. She listened. There was no anger. Things seem better now.    Our knee-jerk reaction as freedom-loving Americans is to be suspicious of anything that hints at invasion of privacy. That's a good and noble thing. But it's not an absolute, particularly in the face of the new and evolving challenges presented by the Internet. And particularly when it comes to our children.   Do you tell your children that the spyware is on the computer? I side with yes, but it might be enough to show them this article, have a discussion about your concerns and let them know the possibility is there. "
Authorities Shut Down Spam Ring,"The Federal Trade Commission won a preliminary legal victory against what it called one of the largest spam gangs on the Internet, persuading a federal court in Chicago on Tuesday to freeze the group's assets and order the spam network to shut down.   The group, which used several names but was known among spam-fighting organizations as HerbalKing, sent billions of unsolicited messages to Internet users over the last 20 months, promoting replica watches and a variety of pharmaceuticals, including weight-loss drugs and herbal pills that supposedly enhanced the male anatomy, according to the commission.Â    ''This is pretty major. At one point these guys delivered up to one-third of all spam,'' said Richard Cox, chief information officer at SpamHaus, a nonprofit antispam research group.   The investigation provides a clear window into the business of modern spam, which by some estimates accounts for 90 percent of all e-mail sent over the Internet.    To pepper Internet users with its solicitations, the HerbalKing group used a botnet, a global network of computers infected with malicious software, often without the knowledge of their owners.   The security firm Marshal Software, which assisted the F.T.C. with the investigation, estimated in court documents that the group's Mega-D botnet -- named after one of its pill products -- was made up of 35,000 computers and could send 10 billion e-mail messages a day. In January, the botnet was the leading source of spam on the Internet, the firm estimated.   F.T.C. investigators also said they monitored the group's finances closely and that it cleared $400,000 in Visa charges in one month alone.    The commission has brought more than 100 cases against spammers and spyware vendors over the past decade. But officials and investigators said this spam operation was perhaps the most extensive they had ever encountered, with ties to Australia, New Zealand, India, China and the United States.   ''They were sending extraordinary amounts of spam,'' said Jon Leibowitz, an F.T.C. commissioner. ''We are hoping at some level that this will help make a small dent in the amount of spam coming into consumers' in-boxes.''    The commission asked the federal district court in Chicago to freeze the gang's finances, arguing that its members were using unfair and deceptive advertising practices and violating the Can-Spam Act of 2003. That federal law provides civil and criminal penalties for spammers who falsify information in e-mail messages and fail to offer ways for consumers to refuse further messages.    The government is also pursuing criminal charges against the group. F.B.I. investigators in Chicago and St. Louis have executed search warrants against members of the spam gang, the commission said.   Jody Michael Smith, 29, of McKinney, Tex., was involved in the group's finances, according to the F.T.C. Reached at his home, Mr. Smith said: ''I don't even know who these people are who I have been tied to,'' and referred all inquiries to his Dallas lawyer, John R. Teakell. Mr. Teakell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   United States officials are also working with New Zealand authorities in the case against Lance Thomas Atkinson, 26, a native of New Zealand who now resides in Australia. Mr. Atkinson has a history in the spam business. In 2005, the F.T.C. obtained a $2.2 million judgment against him and a business partner for running a similar operation selling herbal pills online.    In conjunction with the investigation in the United States, the Department of Internal Affairs in New Zealand asked a court on Tuesday to impose a fine of 200,000 New Zealand dollars, or $121,000, on Mr. Atkinson, his brother Shane Atkinson and a business partner for violating the country's own spam laws.   The activities of the HerbalKing group, like those of other criminal groups online, were remarkably international in scope. The group was shipping drugs like Propecia, Lipitor, Celebrex and Zoloft out of India. The F.T.C. also said the group based its Web sites in China,  processed credit cards from the former Soviet republic of Georgia and Cyprus, and transferred funds among members using ePassporte, an electronic money network.   As part of its investigation, the commission  purchased the ''herbal'' pills from the group and asked the Food and Drug Administration to test them. That agency found that the pills contained sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, which can be risky for some people with heart conditions.    Antispam researchers lauded the crackdown and said it would send a strong message to other spammers. But they were not confident that spam volumes would decrease.   ''This will send some real shock waves through the spamming industry, but even if these guys were running a substantial botnet of compromised computers, there are always spammers looking to take their place,'' said Graham Cluley, a senior technology consultant at Sophos, a spam-fighting   security firm. ''It wouldn't be a surprise if people don't notice any difference in their in-box tomorrow morning.'' "
Data Transmission Problem Disrupted MetroCard Sales,"A faulty encryption device caused the widespread breakdowns of vending machines on Monday and Tuesday that left thousands of subway and bus riders unable to use credit and debit cards to buy MetroCards during peak hours, New York City Transit officials said.    Transit officials said on Thursday that an encryption device -- which encodes transmitted data for customer and bank security and is housed at a data center on Staten Island -- was not working. The system normally uses at least two and sometimes three of the devices. The one functioning encryption device could not handle the load during peak hours, Paul J. Fleuranges, a spokesman for New York City Transit, the arm of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that runs the subways and buses, said in an e-mail message.Â    The overload led to communication delays between the agency's computers and the banks that authorize credit and debit transactions. Those delays, in turn, caused the MetroCard vending machines, which are programmed to time out  if an authorization takes too long, to cancel thousands of transactions, Mr. Fleuranges said.    The disruptions affected all or nearly all of the system's 2,245 vending machines and caused more than 122,000 failed transactions over the two days, officials said.     Additionally, in 20,000 cases the vending machines charged the customer but did not issue a card. All of those transactions have been refunded, officials said.    The problems hit at a particularly bad time for the transportation authority. The agency released new data last week showing a sharp rise in subway delays and mechanical failures, just as it was proposing a series of fare increases to deal with mounting budget problems.    The source of this latest problem was discovered after the Tuesday morning rush, officials said. Agency officials said they were slow to detect the problem because a monitor showed that two encryption devices were active when in fact only one was.    Officials said that they still did not know what caused one of the devices to fail, but that processing returned to normal after an additional device was brought into service.    Officials said they were looking at adding a feature that will send out a warning signal when an encryption device stops working.    ''This will allow N.Y.C.T. to take immediate action to prevent possible future outages,'' Mr. Fleuranges said.    In the past two weeks, data problems with London's Oyster card  system required thousands of London bus and train passengers to get replacement cards and crippled last Friday's morning commute. Last week, about 400 Chicago Transit Authority customers were overcharged because of problems with its fare card vending machines. The Long Island Rail Road has also had  ticket sale problems dating to last September.    The problems do not appear to be related, but they underscore the increasing dependence on cashless systems in daily commutes, and the problems that can emerge with even small technical glitches. Credit and debit cards are used in about 30 percent of MetroCard transactions and account for about 62 percent of vending machine revenue, according to the agency.   The MetroCard was introduced in 1994 and gradually replaced the token, which was phased out in 2003.    Transit officials credit the cards, particularly discounted 7- and 30-day unlimited passes, for helping to draw 2.3 billion riders last year, the largest number of riders in a year since 1969.    Transit rider advocates say the vending machines have had sporadic problems over the years, but never to the extent of this week's.    ''They got good reviews from us and other groups when they came out in the first place,'' said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign. ''I can't say we get a lot of complaints about it.''   Mr. Russianoff said the most common complaint his group hears is about a machine failing to accept dollar bills or to dispense change.    ''When this whole thing with debit and credit cards happened, it was a little bit like a bolt out of the blue,'' he said. "
Britain to Issue Identity Cards For Foreigners In November,"Britain's home secretary said Thursday that the government would begin in months to carry out its plan for national identity cards.Â    Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said that the government would start distributing cards to foreigners in November.    The nation's 200,000 airport workers, who are expected to receive cards next year, will be the first British citizens required to have them, because of the high level of security needed for their jobs, Ms. Smith said.   Beginning in 2010, students will be encouraged to apply voluntarily for identity cards, which will store the holder's fingerprint on a chip.   ''It will make it easier to enroll on a course, apply for a student loan, open a bank account or prove your age,'' Ms. Smith said at a meeting with a research agency in London.   By 2011, the government will begin widespread distribution of the cards and passports containing electronically stored fingerprints.   The cards will not initially be compulsory for British citizens -- although airport employees will not be permitted to work without them. But they will be required for foreigners from outside the European Union staying in Britain on visas.   The government is phasing in the policy until most of the population is covered before deciding whether to pass laws to make the cards compulsory.   Ms. Smith said the cards would prevent identity theft, help reduce illegal immigration, fight terrorism and make it easier for people to obtain public services. But civil rights groups and the opposition parties, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, say the cards are unnecessary, expensive and intrusive.    The two opposition parties say they will end the plan if they are able to form a government.  "
Psst! Follow Me and I'll Show You the Exhibition,"NOT far from I-95 in Maryland, halfway between Washington and Baltimore, lives an old, one-story motel that is home to the National Cryptologic Museum, an institution devoted to two contradictory human impulses: keeping secrets and telling stories.   Most museums are built from the urge to broadcast the past loud and clear, but most museums do not receive money from the National Security Agency, the arm of the intelligence network devoted to codemaking and codebreaking. The employees at the N.S.A. still joke that the initials stand for ''No Such Agency'' or ''Never Say Anything.'' Â    The museum opened in 1993 without notifying the news media or otherwise drawing much attention to itself. It was just as well -- the motel, which is adjacent to the N.S.A.'s headquarters and had been bought by the agency several years before, was still ringed by a barbed-wire fence, and some insiders were apparently worried that someone might take pictures of the spies attending the openings. All those years of never saying anything made it hard to open up.   That atmosphere has changed. The barbed wire is gone and highway signs point the way to the museum -- although along the way a visitor passes more ominous signs concerning the N.S.A. itself and skirts checkpoints where cars slalom through concrete barriers at one of the agency's entrances. The exhibitions that were once confined to a small hall are now larger, flashier and more ambitious. Basic display cases are still there, but more immersive exhibitions, like a reconstruction of a jungle listening post from the Vietnam era, have been created.    The attitude toward the secrecy is changing as aspects of the N.S.A.'s work become better known. When details of the agency's electronic eavesdropping programs become public, or when President Bush and his cabinet speak of terrorists' ''chatter'' that is being picked up, the agency can no longer act as if it doesn't exist.   ''It's no small secret that billions of dollars are spent on this place,'' said Patrick D. Weadon, a longtime agency employee.   The museum is part of the public face, and as its curator, Mr. Weadon leads the effort to give taxpayers an idea of what those billions of dollars buy. But the effort goes only so far, since the agency's current activities, and those from the more recent past, are off limits. ''Using historical examples is one of the few ways we can educate about the mission,'' Mr. Weadon said.    His favorite exhibition shows how the United States broke the Japanese naval codes before the Battle of Midway in World War II. It's an example of how abstract mathematics can make a difference in a very real war. ''We understood the Japanese intentions,'' he said. ''We were able to sink four of the top-line aircraft carriers. We attacked and they were all burning within a half hour. That is a wonderful way of illustrating how intelligence can be a force multiplier.''   This story of how judicious use of information can save American lives is repeated throughout. While the N. S. A. is officially some 55 years old, the museum encompasses the country's extended experience in making and breaking codes.    One display, for example, is filled with a set of wooden wheels, an encoding-decoding device that dates from the era of Thomas Jefferson and echoes a design that Jefferson described in his papers.    The World War II era is the focus of some of the largest displays. The 11 examples of the German Enigma machine, the legendary encryption device, include two for visitors to punch the buttons and feel the rotors turn. Next to them is a version of the hulking electromechanical machines the Allies used to crack the Enigma codes.   While the happiest visitors may be the ones that come looking for answers about history and math, the museum can be enjoyed in other ways, for example as a historical exploration of industrial design and electronic fabrication. The bulky refrigerator-size boxes that scrambled the phone discussions of Roosevelt and Churchill are just steps from the hefty cryptophones of the 1970s and more modern versions.    The museum also presents monuments to the agency's civilian employees and military members who died pursuing enemy signals. Seventeen were killed when a C-130 aircraft was shot down over Armenia in 1958. Thirty-four died on the U. S. S. Liberty, a surveillance ship that was attacked by Israel -- inadvertently, the Israelis say -- in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Even acknowledging these missions must give old members of the N.S.A. a chill.   As time passes, however, the urge to keep secrets fades and a need for storytelling dominates. Herbert O. Yardley, the famous cryptographer who ran MI-8, the  forerunner of the N.S.A. during the 1920s, is included in the museum's Hall of Fame even though he wrote a tell-all book, ''The American Black Chamber.''   The museum recently received  a copy of the manuscript of Mr. Yardley's book from David Kahn, the author of a history of secret communication, ''The Codebreakers.'' The publication of Mr. Kahn's book in 1967 was so worrying to the defense establishment that the Department of Defense, which includes the N.S.A., issued a statement saying it deplored the book. That feeling has faded, and Mr. Kahn's papers are now on display.    Mr. Kahn is now closer to retirement -- a step he says he'll never take -- and is planning to send other things to the museum. Despite the past acrimony, he said, he asked himself, In your heart of hearts, where do you want this to go? The old motel and its collection of stories was his answer. "
Bits,"The efforts of some Internet service providers to keep track of what their customers do online pose an interesting question for the makers of antispyware software: Should they find a way to help users block these systems?Â    I.S.P.'s that monitor their users' site visits do so to help advertisers decide which ads to show them.   Advertising companies work hard to make sure their efforts aren't blocked by software, sometimes resorting to lawsuits. The Anti-Spyware Coalition was formed, in part, to give the software vendors a neutral forum to define standards and help protect themselves from these lawsuits.   It is concerned about the kind of disclosures made to users, the kind of data collected and how intrusive the resulting ads are.   It is not clear, however, how much software companies could block the monitoring. After all, these monitoring systems watch people from within the network; they don't rely on software downloads or ephemeral cookies.   Still, the monitoring programs use tracking cookies for various reasons. So while antispyware software might not be able to stop these systems from watching users, it could at least cause trouble for them by removing their cookies.  SAUL HANSELL "
