Safe Travels for You and Your Data,"You're a smart traveler. You pack sunscreen and Pepto, locks for your luggage and a pouch to hide cash under your clothes. But what digital precautions do you take?     It's hard enough to make sure the data you send and receive is safe when you're at home or at work. But traveling brings a whole new set of hazards: from publicly accessible computers to unprotected wireless networks to crowded and pickpocket-plagued airports.   Luckily, preventing a digital wipeout while you're on the road is reasonably easy and inexpensive. Here are some of the main things you can do to keep your data out of harm's way while you wander the world.    PUBLIC COMPUTERS Computers in cybercafes and hotels are notorious for having malware on them, including ''keylogger'' programs that record users' keystrokes and capture screenshots to collect log-in information. Many PCs do not have important software fixes or  security programs with current updates. They could even have physical keylogging devices fitted onto the back.     Before using public computers, ask what security measures are in use. Better hotels and cybercafes  maintain their computers properly and  reset them after each user so unauthorized programs are removed.     If you get a blank look from the attendant, check for a security program icon at the bottom of the screen and click on it to see if it is up to date. If you do not see evidence the computer you are about to use is safe, try to find another place to go online.    If you cannot wait for a more secure machine, avoid any banking business and entering of your credit card number.   As for using e-mail: ''If you absolutely have to, then do it. Then when you get home, change your password,'' said Maxim Weinstein, executive director of StopBadware, a consumer-focused nonprofit.    PUBLIC WI-FI It is safer to use your own computer and go  online using airport, hotel or other public Internet connections. But beware that there is still some risk, especially using public Wi-Fi.    By ''sniffing'' the airwaves, a snoop in the vicinity can read data you send across the network. It's easy -- free software for capturing, viewing and analyzing Wi-Fi traffic is widely available -- though it is unclear how prevalent this kind of activity actually is. A hacker could also infiltrate your PC by making his computer appear to be a legitimate Wi-Fi hot spot.    To protect yourself, use a firewall -- they are included free in recent versions of the Windows and Mac operating systems -- and make sure important information you send is encrypted. Look for ''https'' in Web addresses, and check if a Wi-Fi network uses encryption by reading privacy policy on its Web site.    If you have access to a VPN (virtual private network), from your employer  for example, use it. You could also get online via a cellular card or ''tethering'' with your mobile device over encrypted cellular connections, though that may increase your data fees.    On a low-tech note, if you work with confidential information in public places on a regular basis, consider using a removable privacy screen for your display to make it harder for neighbors to sneak a look ($20 to $60 for laptops, $5 to $15 for iPhones and BlackBerrys).    YOUR LAPTOP Besides the laptop's data, there's the machine itself. In addition to keeping out malware by using current security software, you need to protect and back up your data in case your computer does take a walk, especially if you store confidential personal or business documents.    Laptop loss and theft at airports are rampant. A 2008 study of 106 airports in the United States conducted by Ponemon Institute, a research firm that focuses on data security and privacy, found travelers lose more than 12,000 laptops a week -- and that's just the ones airport personnel find.    ''People don't really think about the security of their laptop as much as they need to,'' said Marian Merritt, the Internet safety advocate for the security software maker Symantec. ''I see a lot of bad behavior on the road.'' Do not entrust your laptop to a complete stranger; it's better to take it into the bathroom stall with you, she said. Do not put electronics in checked luggage. And consider buying a laptop lock ($20 to $50) to use if you leave the computer in your hotel room.    Using a password to lock your computer provides little protection; someone with know-how can bypass it in minutes. And if you let your Web browser store your passwords, hackers could be in your accounts in no time. It is more effective to use a password manager to store and encrypt your passwords. If you do lose your laptop, a service like LoJack for Laptops (starting  at $40) can help you track it down or remotely delete your data.    An even better idea is to use full-disk encryption. You can get quality software free (BitLocker in Windows Vista and 7 and the open-source tool TruCrypt for Windows, Mac and Linux), and using it is easier than deciding which individual documents or folders to encrypt, said Bruce Schneier, a security book author  and chief security officer at BT Group. ''If you lose your computer, you suddenly don't care about the data at all,'' he said. ''You'll only think: Do I have a good backup, and will my insurance cover it?''    YOUR SMARTPHONE A good alternative to public computers and personal laptops is, increasingly, your mobile phone. Smartphones are essentially minicomputers and usually pull down data using encrypted cell networks. But when connected to Wi-Fi hot spots, the security issues are the same, so find out whether Web sites and mobile apps you use to move confidential  information use encryption. Also, intruders can use Bluetooth to read  contacts, text messages and other data stored in your phone, so turn it off if you don't use it.    If you are, say, a supporter of the Dalai Lama and visit China, you may want to be careful what data is on your phone in the first place, since the government there could easily copy it. Or you could slide decoy SIM and memory cards into your phone before you go through customs and put the real ones back in later, said Greg Hoglund, chief executive of the security firm HBGary.    You may have recourse if your phone is lost or stolen. For instance, iPhone users who buy the MobileMe service can use the ''Find My iPhone'' feature to locate their device on a map, set a password lock remotely, display a message on the screen, make the phone  ring even if the ringer is off and erase all content remotely. People with Windows Mobile phones can do the same, at $5 for each function.  "
"Malicious Software Said to Have Struck 2,500 Corporations","A malicious software program has infected the computers of more than 2,500 corporations around the world, according to NetWitness, a computer network security firm.   The malicious program, or botnet, can commandeer the operating systems of both residential and corporate computing systems via the Internet. Such botnets are used by computer criminals for a range of illicit activities, including sending e-mail spam and stealing digital documents and passwords from infected computers. In many cases they install so-called keystroke loggers to capture personal information.    The current infection is modest compared with some of the largest known botnets. For example, a system known as Conficker, created in late 2008, infected as many as 15 million computers at its peak and continues to contaminate more than seven million systems globally.    Botnet attacks are not unusual. Currently Shadowserver, an organization that tracks botnet activity, is monitoring 5,900 separate botnets.   Several computer security specialists also disputed the company's assertion that the botnet was a novel discovery. This type of infection is well known to the computer security research community and is routinely tracked by a monitoring system that has identified more than 1,300 botnets of this design.   NetWitness said in a release that it had discovered the program last month while the company was installing monitoring systems. The company named it the Kneber botnet based on a username that linked the infected systems.    The purpose appears to be to gather login credentials to online financial systems, social networking sites and e-mail systems, and then to transmit that information to the system's controllers, the company said.   The company's investigation determined that the botnet had been able to compromise both commercial and government systems, including 68,000 corporate login credentials. It has also  gained access to e-mail systems, online banking accounts, Facebook, Yahoo, Hotmail and other social network credentials, along with more than 2,000 digital security certificates and a significant cache of personal identity information.   ''These large-scale compromises of enterprise networks have reached epidemic levels,''  said Amit Yoran, chief executive of NetWitness and former director of the National Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security.   ''Cyber criminal elements, like the Kneber crew,  quietly and diligently target and compromise thousands of government and commercial organizations across the globe.''   The company, which is based in Herndon, Va., noted that the new botnet made sophisticated use of a well-known Trojan Horse  --  a backdoor entryway to attack  --  that the computer security community had previously identified as ZeuS.   ''Many security analysts tend to classify ZeuS solely as a Trojan that steals banking information,'' said Alex Cox, the principal analyst at NetWitness responsible for uncovering the Kneber botnet.    ''But that viewpoint is naive. When we began to detect the correlation among both the methodology used by the Kneber crew to attack victim machines and the wide variety of data sets harvested, it became clear that security teams must rethink their entire perspective on advanced threats such as ZeuS.''   Half of the machines infected with the Kneber botnet were also infected by an earlier botnet known as Waledec, the company noted.   The existence of the botnet was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, shortly before the company issued its news release.   "
"If Your Password's Still 123456, It Might as Well Be HackMe","Back at the dawn of the Web, the most popular account password was ''12345.''    Today, it's one digit longer but hardly safer: ''123456.''   Despite all the reports of Internet security breaches over the years, including the recent attacks on Google's e-mail service, many people have reacted to the break-ins with a shrug.    According to a new analysis, one out of five Web users still decides to leave the digital equivalent of a  key under the doormat: they choose a simple, easily guessed password like ''abc123,'' ''iloveyou'' or even ''password'' to protect their data.    ''I guess it's just a genetic flaw in humans,'' said Amichai Shulman, the chief technology officer at Imperva, which makes software for blocking hackers. ''We've been following the same patterns since the 1990s.''    Mr. Shulman and his company examined a list of 32 million passwords that an unknown hacker stole last month from RockYou, a company that makes software for users of social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace. The list was briefly posted on the Web, and hackers and security researchers downloaded it. (RockYou, which had already been widely criticized for lax privacy practices, has advised its customers to change their passwords, as the hacker gained information about their e-mail accounts as well.)   The trove provided an unusually detailed window into computer users' password habits. Typically, only government agencies like the F.B.I. or the National Security Agency have had access to such a large password list.   ''This was the mother lode,'' said Matt Weir, a doctoral candidate in the e-crimes and investigation technology lab at Florida State University, where researchers are also examining the data.   Imperva found that nearly 1 percent of the 32 million people it studied had used ''123456'' as a password. The second-most-popular password was ''12345.'' Others in the top 20 included ''qwerty,'' ''abc123'' and ''princess.''   More disturbing, said Mr. Shulman, was that about 20 percent of people on the RockYou list picked from the same, relatively small pool of 5,000 passwords.    That suggests that hackers could easily break into many accounts just by trying the most common passwords. Because of the prevalence of fast computers and speedy networks, hackers can fire off thousands of password guesses per minute.    ''We tend to think of password guessing as a very time-consuming attack in which I take each account and try a large number of name-and-password combinations,'' Mr. Shulman said. ''The reality is that you can be very effective by choosing a small number of common passwords.''   Some Web sites try to thwart the attackers by freezing an account for a certain period of time if too many incorrect passwords are typed. But experts say that the hackers simply learn to trick the system, by making guesses at an acceptable rate, for instance.    To improve security, some Web sites are forcing users to mix letters, numbers and even symbols in their passwords. Others, like Twitter, prevent people from picking common passwords.    Still, researchers say, social networking and entertainment Web sites often try to make life simpler for their users and are reluctant to put too many controls in place.    Even commercial sites like eBay must weigh the consequences of freezing accounts, since a hacker could, say, try to win an auction by freezing the accounts of other bidders.   Overusing simple passwords is not a new phenomenon. A similar survey examined computer passwords used in the mid-1990s and found that the most popular ones at that time were ''12345,'' ''abc123'' and ''password.''   Why do so many people continue to choose easy-to-guess passwords, despite so many warnings about the risks?    Security experts suggest that we are simply overwhelmed by the sheer number of things we have to remember in this digital age.   ''Nowadays, we have to keep probably 10 times as many passwords in our head as we did 10 years ago,'' said Jeff Moss, who founded a popular hacking conference and is now on the Homeland Security Advisory Council. ''Voice mail passwords, A.T.M. PINs and Internet passwords -- it's so hard to keep track of.''   In the idealized world championed by security specialists, people would have different passwords for every Web site they visit and store them in their head or, if absolutely necessary, on a piece of paper.   But bowing to the reality of our overcrowded brains, the experts suggest that everyone choose at least two different passwords -- a complex one for Web sites were security is vital, such as banks and e-mail, and a simpler one for places where the stakes are lower, such as social networking and entertainment sites.    Mr. Moss relies on passwords at least 12 characters long, figuring that those make him a more difficult target than the millions of people who choose five- and six-character passwords.    ''It's like the joke where the hikers run into a bear in the forest, and the hiker that survives is the one who outruns his buddy,'' Mr. Moss said. ''You just want to run that bit faster.''  "
Privacy vs. National Security,"NEW DELHI -- In the United States, law enforcement and security agencies have raised privacy concerns with a new proposal for electronic eavesdropping powers to track terrorists and criminals and unscramble their encrypted messages. But here in India, government authorities are well beyond the proposal stage. Prompted by fears of digital-era plotters, officials are already demanding that network operators give them the ability to monitor and decrypt digital messages, whenever the Home Ministry deems the eavesdropping to be vital to national security. Critics, though, say India's campaign to monitor data transmission within its borders will hurt other important national goals: attracting global businesses and becoming a hub for technology innovation. The most inflammatory part of the effort has been India's threat to block encrypted BlackBerry services, widely used by corporations, unless phone companies provide access to the data in a readable format. But Indian officials have also said they will seek greater access to encrypted data sent over popular Internet services like Gmail, Skype and virtual private networks that enable users to bypass traditional telephone links or log in remotely to corporate computer systems.  Critics say such a threat could make foreigners think twice about doing business here. Especially vulnerable could be outsourcing for Western clients, like processing medical records or handling confidential research projects, information that is typically transmitted as encrypted data. ''If there is any risk to that data, those companies will look elsewhere,'' said Peter Sutherland, a former Canadian ambassador to India who is now a consultant to North American companies doing business there. S. Ramadorai, vice chairman of India's largest outsourcing company, Tata Consultancy Services, echoed that sentiment in a newspaper column on Wednesday. ''Bans and calls for bans aren't a solution,'' he wrote. ''They'll disconnect India from the rest of the world.'' Few doubt that India has valid security concerns. In recent years, attacks against India have included the use of sophisticated communications technology -- as when the terrorists who stormed Mumbai two years ago communicated with their Pakistani handlers by satellite phone and the Internet. Or when Chinese hackers infiltrated India's military computer networks this year. But critics say that India's security efforts, which they describe as clumsy, may do little to protect the country, even as they intrude on the privacy of companies and citizens alike. ''They will do damage by blocking highly visible systems like BlackBerry or Skype,'' said Ajay Shah, a Mumbai-based economist who writes extensively about technology. ''This will shift users to less visible and known platforms. Terrorists will make merry doing crypto anyway. A zillion tools for this are freely available.'' Senior Indian officials, though, argue that they have no choice but to demand the data that could help thwart and investigate terrorist attacks. ''All communications which is done by Indians or coming to and fro into India -- and where we have a concern about national security -- we should have access to it,'' said Gopal Krishna Pillai, the secretary of India's Home Ministry, which oversees domestic security. During the Mumbai attacks, he said, officials could not gain access to some of the communications between the terrorists and their handlers. Some legal experts indicate that Indian law -- which has few explicit protections for personal privacy -- is on the government's side. But they also say India is trying to enforce the law in unnerving ways. ''The concern of corporate users and general users of BlackBerry is that if this is allowed, the government will become the single biggest repository of information,'' said Pavan Duggal, a technology lawyer who practices before India's Supreme Court. ''And we have no idea how this information will be used and misused in the future.'' The Indian government has also clamped down on the importation of foreign telecommunications equipment, saying it wants to ensure that the technology does not contain malicious software or secret trap doors that could be used by foreign spies. The technology and security debates playing out here are not new or unique to India. During the 1990s, for instance, American security officials tried unsuccessfully to restrict the use of encryption because of worries that law enforcement would not be able to monitor communications. Now, in legislation the Obama administration plans to introduce next year, officials want Congress to require all services that enable communications -- including encrypted e-mail systems like BlackBerry, social networking Web sites like Facebook and software that allows direct ''peer to peer'' messaging like Skype -- to be technically able to comply if served with a wiretap order. Currently, other countries including the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia are trying to impose various measures similar to India's. The debate here, though, is complicated by the fact that despite private industry's technology prowess in this country, in technologies like cryptography Indian law enforcement agencies still lag significantly behind their counterparts in the United States and other advanced countries. The Indian government says it is intent on improving its code-cracking skills. But ''in the interim, it has this very blunt instrument,'' said Rajan S. Mathews, the director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India, a trade group. ''It comes to the operators and says: 'I'm going to make you responsible for giving me access,' '' he said. Mr. Pillai, the Home Ministry secretary, said the government was not opposed to the use of encryption to protect the privacy of legitimate electronic communications. But he said that as government-licensed entities, network operators were obliged to give law enforcement officials a way to decode messages when required or to block communications that they cannot decipher. But network providers say they may not always have the technical ability to do that. In much of the world -- including for business users in India -- companies and individuals now often use encryption systems that generate new code keys for each message and lack a convenient master key that could unlock everything for government viewing. Google, for its part, has enhanced the encryption for its Gmail service, making it harder for hackers and the Indian government to read messages. Mr. Pillai said his ministry had begun conversations with Google and Skype, the Internet phone company, which also uses strong encryption, to provide access to decoded data. Representatives for Google and Skype said that they could not comment because they had not yet received formal demands from the Indian government. Meanwhile, government officials have demanded that the maker of BlackBerry, Research In Motion of Canada, set up a server computer in India from which law enforcement agencies can gain access to unencrypted versions of messages when they need to. The government has given R.I.M. until the end of October to comply. The company has said that it is willing to meet ''the lawful access needs of law enforcement agencies.'' But the company says it cannot provide unencrypted copies of messages of corporate users because of how the BlackBerry system is designed, noting that even R.I.M. cannot decode them. ''Strong encryption has become a mandatory requirement for all enterprise-class wireless e-mail services today,'' R.I.M. said in a statement in late August, ''and is also a fundamental commercial requirement for any country to attract and maintain international business.''

"A Campaign About Computer Security, Couched in Plain English","IN recent weeks, drivers on Route 7 near Minneapolis may have noticed something unusual: once a week, a painting crew has been hoisted up to repaint a section on the left side of a billboard, from green one week to red the next and finally to blue. ''Paint Drying,'' says text on the billboard. ''Admittedly more interesting than explaining malware prevention.''  The new advertising campaign, for Webroot, which makes antivirus software, also includes one billboard with a large swath of artificial turf attached meant to look like grass (''Grass growing. Admittedly more interesting than explaining spam filtration''), and another with a section of floorboards (''Laminate flooring. Admittedly more interesting than explaining spyware detection''). The campaign, by TDA Advertising and Design in Boulder, Colo., is a departure for the computer security category, where marketers tend to either arouse fear, by promoting their products as a line of defense against identity theft or other mischief, or use jargon like phishing, keylogging and malware to strike a chord with those knowledgeable about computers. While the ads may seem merely like self-deprecation, they spring from an unexpected insight about consumers. Chris Benham, chief marketing officer at Webroot, founded 13 years ago and also based in Boulder, recently commissioned an online poll that asked more than 2,400 security software users in the United States and Britain to rate how strongly they agreed or disagreed with 18 statements about antiviral software. Included in the survey was what Mr. Benham called a throwaway question about which the company expected a tepid response: ''I wish security software brands would just explain things in plain English so I could really understand what I'm protected against.'' To Mr. Benham's surprise, that statement ranked the third-most agreed upon by respondents, surpassed only by statements about protecting children from online predators and about computer users' generally underestimating the problem of online security. ''When the research came back to us, it shook us to the core,'' Mr. Benham said. ''What we had to learn quickly is that these guys are less interested in the technical attributes of the products and much more interested in the technical benefits of the products.'' Much of Webroot's national campaign includes technical language even as it mocks it. Print ads appearing in magazines either as full-page ads or two-page spreads, for example, feature headlines like ''Under no circumstance should you use this information at a cocktail party,'' and ''It is against international law to force prisoners of war to read this entire ad.'' A long block of text that follows includes this typical sentence: ''The Communication Shield checks all DNS lookups against a list of Web sites known to host malware or domain names used for command-and-control of botnets, and then blackholes any site even before a browser can load the page, or before a running piece of malware can retrieve its payloads.'' At the bottom of the ads is the campaign tag line, ''You don't care about how it works, as long as it does.'' While Webroot has traditionally advertised only in technical publications like PC World, the new campaign will also appear in business publications like Fortune and Fast Company and in lifestyle magazines like Us Weekly. Interactive online ads are a variation on the theme. Viewers can watch video by clicking on either a photo of Webroot's chief technology officer, Mike Kronenberg, at a podium wearing a suit or one of another person, for example, a female bodybuilder flexing her biceps. In that case, the copy asks, ''Would you rather see our chief technology officer explain data synchronization -- or -- arm-wrestle a very strong woman?'' Other online ads offer the choice between seeing Mr. Kronenberg explaining idle-time scanning or riding a mechanical bull, and explaining keylogging or getting into a bar fight. Webroot makes security software products that cost $30 to $80, and the company faces the challenge not just of getting consumers to buy their products over competitors', but also getting them to pay for it at all, since free antivirus software also is widely available. Only 38 percent of computer users are willing to pay for antivirus protection, according to a 2009 survey by the market research firm Mintel. Symantec, the market leader, has also taken a humorous approach in current television commercials for its Norton Internet Security software, which feature celebrities like the actors David Hasselhoff and Dolph Lundgren and the 1980s metal band Dokken. Different ''allow'' and ''deny'' versions of each commercial are televised, a play on the common computer dialogue box terms, resulting in either the protection or the destruction of items beside the celebrities. In versions of the ad with Mr. Hasselhoff, an ''allow'' version depicts an oscillating fan's sparking and exploding when he splashes water on it, while in the ''deny'' version, the fan appears to Mr. Hasselhoff to be a pretzel, but when he reaches for it, it again assumes the form of a fan and slices off his fingers. The ads were created by Leo Burnett USA and Arc Worldwide, both part of the Publicis Groupe. Symantec spent $27 million on advertising in 2009, compared with $1.3 million by Webroot, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP. But Webroot is upping the ante considerably this year and will spend $4.5 million on the new campaign alone, for a total of about $6 million, Mr. Benham of Webroot said. ''Incremental advertising will only get us incremental growth -- that's the phrase I used when I spoke to our board of directors,'' Mr. Benham said. ''Dramatic growth demands dramatic investment.''  "
German Law Would Limit the Use of Facebook in Hiring,"As part of the draft of a law governing workplace privacy, the German government on Wednesday proposed placing restrictions on employers who want to use Facebook profiles when recruiting. The bill would allow managers to search for publicly accessible information about prospective employees on the Web and to view their pages on job networking sites, like LinkedIn or Xing. But it would draw the line at purely social networking sites like Facebook, said Philipp Spauschus, a spokesman for the Interior Minister, Thomas de Maiziere.  Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet on Wednesday gave its backing to the proposed law. The bill will now go to Parliament for discussion, and could be passed as early as this year, Mr. Spauschus said. The law also would prohibit companies from secretly videotaping employees, though they could still videotape in certain areas as long as they disclosed the fact. It would also allow employers to hold secret investigations when they suspected a crime had been committed. Germany's Nazi-era history has made the country extremely cautious on matters of individual privacy. Concerns have been heightened in recent years by scandals involving companies' secret videotaping of employees, as well as intercepting their e-mail and bank data. The explosion of Web-based information tools has added to the unease. The German authorities are investigating Google for having collected private Internet information while doing research for its Street View mapping service, and they have asked Apple to explain its data-collection policies for the iPhone. Facebook, which says it has more than 500 million users worldwide, with about 10 million in Germany, has come under fire for what some consider privacy shortcomings, as when the site changed its default settings to reveal more of individuals' personal data. The German proposal, however, is aimed squarely at employers. Peter Schaar, the German commissioner for data protection and freedom of information, told The Associated Press that the proposal was ''a substantial improvement on the status quo in dealing with employees' data.'' There are currently no rules governing how companies use Facebook data, Mr. Spauschus said. The proposal is meant to create guidelines for the courts in handling the cases that will inevitably arise as social networking penetrates further into everyday life, he said, and companies would also benefit from clear rules. Sarah Roy, a spokeswoman in Paris for Facebook, said the company generally did not comment on legislation as a matter of policy. But she said that the Web site's privacy settings allowed users to share information as broadly or as narrowly as they liked, either with entire networks or with a limited number of participants.  "
Wanted: 'Cyber Ninjas',"FOR a regional competition last spring, eight students from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, spent six months of Saturdays practicing how to defend a typical business computer network from attacks. Then, over two grueling days, they outscored teams from five other schools at blocking worms and other efforts to disrupt their e-mail and Internet systems.    For the six seniors in the group, all in computer information systems, the victory was even sweeter. Boeing, the giant aerospace and military company, offered them jobs.   Boeing's decision to snap up all the graduates on the team shows how urgent the demand for computer-security experts has become, and helps explain why colleges are scrambling to add courses and specialized degrees in the once-exotic field.   In fact, as attacks on vital computer systems proliferate, surveys show a serious shortage of talent to combat them. Banks, military contractors and software companies, along with federal agencies, are looking for ''cyber ninjas'' to fend off a sophisticated array of hackers, from criminals stealing credit card numbers to potential military adversaries.   ''There is a huge demand, and a lot more schools have created programs,'' says Nasir Memon, a professor at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University in Brooklyn. ''But to be honest, we're still not producing enough students.''    Mr. Memon's school created a master's degree in cybersecurity last fall. So did Indiana University, whose security degree is in ''informatics,'' an academic field in which students find new uses for information technology. Starting in the fall, Georgia Tech will offer a master's degree in information security online; the program is aimed at computer professionals who want to learn to deal with computer threats. N.Y.U. Poly, whose master's program is also online, prefers students with bachelor's degrees in computers, math, science or engineering. But it will consider career changers who will take basic computer classes. Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh; Purdue in West Lafayette, Ind.; and George Mason in Fairfax, Va., are among other universities with master's programs in cybersecurity.    Jeffrey M. Henbest, one of the Cal Poly students hired by Boeing, says cybersecurity is seen at his school ''as the most technically demanding field, kind of like the fighter pilot of the information technology industry.''   While perhaps just a few thousand jobs are available now, government officials involved in cybersecurity expect the number to grow rapidly. (Professor Memon says pay starts at $50,000 with a bachelor's, $60,000 to $80,000 with a master's.)    One concern, says Dale W. Meyerrose, the vice president for cyberprograms at the Harris Corporation, a military contractor, is the shortage of young Americans interested in pursuing careers involving math and science.    But Barbara G. Fast, Boeing's vice president for cybersolutions, says that young people's familiarity with posting and chatting, and the fascination with virtual gaming, could make cybersecurity seem like fun. In puzzling out security problems, she says, it can be hard to imagine how far a computer network extends and who the intruders might be.    ''It's a real, three-dimensional, visualization challenge that we have.''   "
China Announces 3 Arrests in a Crackdown on Hacking,"The police in central China have arrested three people and seized money and equipment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in a crackdown on the country's biggest commercial operation to train computer hackers, state media reported Sunday and Monday.    But Western specialists in cybersecurity were skeptical that the arrests signified any broad commitment by China to halt the assaults on computer security that Google and other Western companies have endured in recent months.   China has not shut down the well-known servers that have been used in these attacks or arrested their operators, so the detention of the three people is unlikely to make much of a difference, said Ronald J. Deibert, a cybersecurity expert at the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto.   ''Their crackdown on this apparent hacker group needs to be placed in a broader context,'' Mr. Deibert said. ''I would characterize it as window dressing.''   Public security officers in Hubei Province also shut down a Web site said to be used to raise more than $1 million in membership fees from 12,000 paying clients, according to The Wuhan Evening Post in Wuhan, the provincial capital. The members received software tools for penetrating computer security systems and online accounts.   The Web site, Black Hawk Safety Net, was started in 2005 and had another 170,000 clients with free memberships, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported on Monday.   The Wuhan Evening Post reported on Sunday that the police arrested the three people, who were associated with Black Hawk Safety Net, last November. The publication gave no indication why the arrests were being disclosed only now, when the Chinese government is trying to assure the world that it is tough on cybersecurity violations.   Xinhua did not mention in its report on Monday that the arrests had taken place in November, giving the impression that they were very recent.   Computer hacking is popular in China as a way to gain access to online game accounts, which may have points, virtual weapons or other virtual assets that may be transferred or spent. But Internet security experts say that hackers in China are also behind a global increase in criminal activities like the stealing of credit card numbers and even corporate espionage.   China amended its criminal code last year to make it a crime to make computer hacking tools available to others.   The National Computer Network Emergency Response Coordination Center of China has calculated that hackers caused losses of $1.11 billion last year.   The Chinese government has sought to portray hacking as an activity by criminals beyond its control. But Western governments and corporations have become increasingly concerned about the possibility of government backing for the penetration of computer security in the West.   Google announced last month that hackers from China had made sophisticated efforts to break into the computer systems of 34 companies and entities, mainly in Silicon Valley, and had sought entry to the private Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. The Chinese government has dismissed as groundless all suggestions that it might have been involved.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
"For Data, Tug Grows Over Privacy Vs. Security","The threat by the United Arab Emirates to shut down mobile services on BlackBerrys like e-mail and text messaging underscores a growing tension between communications companies and governments over how to balance privacy with national security. While communications companies want to be able to ensure that their customers' messages are shielded from prying eyes, governments increasingly insist on gaining access to electronic messages to track down criminals or uncover terrorist plots.  On Monday, Research In Motion, or R.I.M., the Canadian company that makes the BlackBerry line of smartphones, sought to reassure its customers that its services remained secure a day after the U.A.E. said it would ban many BlackBerry services because of national security concerns. Internet security experts say the demands by the United Arab Emirates for certain access to communications flowing across the BlackBerry network echo requests of other governments around the world. Many countries have laws and regulations requiring telecommunications providers to grant government agencies access to their systems for court-sanctioned intercepts. The demands also come as other governments, including India, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain, are reportedly considering new requirements on services like BlackBerry to ensure they can monitor electronic messages. ''These requirements for access to communications exist on a significant scale worldwide,'' said Anthony M. Rutkowski, chief executive of Netmagic Associates, a consulting company specializing in technical and regulatory issues related to online security. At the same time, electronic communications providers are increasingly offering security measures like encryption. For instance, after a cyberattack that originated in China and that targeted Google's servers and Gmail, the company began encrypting by default all e-mail messages while in transit. As a growing volume of communications content is encrypted, governments are demanding other information like whom customers communicate with and when, said Mr. Rutkowski. Such information can be useful to help gather intelligence. Security experts say that BlackBerry's service, which uses its own network to transmit e-mail and instant messages, may make access to such data more difficult, especially for countries in which the company has no servers controlling that network. The experts also say that is why Research In Motion has had frequent confrontations with governments. Other services, like Skype, have also raised concerns in some countries. Research In Motion issued a statement on Monday that did not directly address the company's conflict with the United Arab Emirates or its relationship with other countries, citing the ''confidential nature'' of its discussions with certain governments. The company said it balanced competing demands. ''R.I.M. respects both the regulatory requirements of government and the security and privacy needs of corporations and consumers,'' the company said in statement. In an open letter to customers, Research In Motion, which operates in more than 175 countries, also said that its security system was designed to ensure that no one, not even the company, could gain unauthorized access to customers' data. Security experts said that it was not clear what kind of access requirements the United Arab Emirates had requested from Research In Motion and whether those requirements were more onerous than those mandated by other governments. ''There is a lot going on that we are not seeing,'' said Bruce Schneier, chief security technology officer for BT, the giant telecommunications provider based in Britain. ''We don't know what R.I.M. does for other countries.'' Experts also say that the United Arab Emirates, a major business center in the Middle East, may be focusing on BlackBerry's service, rather than Gmail or other encrypted services, because it is being offered by local telecommunications carriers and has grown increasingly popular there. The BlackBerry service is a frequent target because of ''its convenience, its widespread use and the fact that it runs on its own network,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy advocacy group based in Washington. ''The United Arab Emirates is not in much of a position to tell Google not to encrypt e-mail.'' Many analysts agreed that the Emirati government appeared more interested in getting some concessions from Research In Motion than in actually shutting off access to BlackBerry data services. The government said the telephone service would not be affected. ''Saying that the restrictions will not kick in until October is a form of saber-rattling,'' said Jonathan Zittrain, a professor at the Harvard Law School and co-founder of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. ''The government is saying that as a way to get negotiations going with R.I.M., not to ease the pain of executives who fear they may have their service cut off.'' Still, some businesspeople in Dubai seemed to be digesting the news, and waiting to see whether an agreement could be worked out between R.I.M. and the Emirati government before the October deadline. ''People are taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' said Blair Look, the managing director of asset management at al Mal Capital in Dubai.  "
"In Europe, Google Is Facing New Inquiries on Privacy","BERLIN -- Officials in Spain, France and the Czech Republic announced plans on Thursday to investigate Google's collection of data from wireless networks in their countries, raising the likelihood that the  company could face sanctions in Europe.   Five days after Google said it had inadvertently collected 600 gigabytes of data described as snippets of Web sites and e-mail messages from unsecured Wi-Fi networks around the world, privacy lawyers said Google was likely to face fines and suffer damage to its reputation.    ''I think at the end of the day, this will likely amount to fines, which Google can certainly manage,'' said Ulrich Borger, a privacy lawyer with the firm Latham & Watkins in Hamburg, where Google Germany is based.   Data protection officials in Spain, the Czech Republic, France and Germany have started administrative inquiries into the company's practices, which they said violated local privacy laws.   Investigators at France's National Commission on Informatics and Liberties said they had inspected Google's Paris office on Wednesday as they began to gather evidence. In the United States, two members of Congress asked the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday to begin a review of what Google had collected.   In Hamburg, prosecutors opened their criminal investigation this week after receiving a complaint from Jens Ferner, a law student completing an apprenticeship at his father's law firm in Alsdorf, Germany. During an interview, Mr. Ferner said German courts had taken a strict line with those convicted of using Wi-Fi networks without an owner's knowledge.   In Britain and Ireland, by contrast, regulators said they were not initiating investigations but had asked Google to destroy the data collected in their countries.   The British Information Commissioner's Office called Google's collection of Wi-Fi data ''unnecessary and excessive.'' But given that Google's recording equipment had changed frequency channels every five seconds, the British regulator said, it was unlikely that extensive information on individuals had been collected.   ''In such circumstances there does not seem to be any reason to keep the data concerned for evidential purposes,'' the  commissioner's office said. ''Therefore, in line with the data protection requirement that personal data should be held for no longer than necessary, we have asked Google to ensure that these data are deleted as soon as reasonably possible.''   Sergey Brin, a Google co-founder, said at a news conference in San Francisco on Wednesday that the company had been wrong to collect and store information from Wi-Fi networks while gathering data for the Street View layer of images in Google Maps, Bloomberg News reported. The company is imposing more internal controls after it mistakenly captured the data, Mr. Brin added.   The practice in Germany, Mr. Ferner said, is called ''stealth surfing,'' where computer users intentionally seek out and use unsecured wireless networks.   ''Even in cases where Wi-Fi networks had not been encrypted by their owners, German courts have been pretty consistent in saying that it was still illegal to access another's network without their permission,'' Mr. Ferner said. In a few recent cases, he said, Germans convicted of stealth surfing have been fined up to 1,000 euros, or $1,250.   Google, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., said last weekend that it had destroyed data collected in Ireland, at the request of the local regulator. Gary Davis, Ireland's deputy data protection commissioner, said his agency was satisfied that the data had been destroyed, and would work with Google to ensure that similar infractions were not repeated.   ''I think we are focused now on the future, not the past,'' Mr. Davis said. Google has its European headquarters in Dublin, where it employs about 2,000 workers.   Richard Cumbley, a privacy lawyer at Linklaters in London, said Google could face prosecution on local privacy laws and illegal wire-tapping laws. ''But I think that while their relations with national regulators will suffer as a result of this,'' he said, ''I would be surprised if this led to serious criminal convictions.''  "
"At Internet Conference, Signs of Agreement Appear Between U.S. and Russia","GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, Germany -- For the 140 computer network specialists, law enforcement agents and diplomats from eight countries who met in this German ski resort this week for a Russian-sponsored conference on Internet security, the biggest challenge was finding a common ground to discuss their differences.   The barrier was not the variety of native languages but deep differences in how governments view cyberspace, according to many of the specialists there.     That challenge was underscored by a sharp rift between the United States and Russia. Americans speak about computer security and cyberwarfare; the Russians have a different emphasis, describing cyberspace in a broader framework they refer to as information security.   ''The Russians have a dramatically different definition of information security than we do; it's a broader notion, and they really mean state security,'' said George Sadowsky, a United States representative to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, the closest thing to a governing body for the global network.   What has changed, however, is the Obama administration's decision this year to begin actively discussing these differences with the Russians. While last year only a single American academic computer security specialist attended the conference, this year more than a dozen Americans attended, including Christopher Painter, the second-ranking White House official on cybersecurity, and Judith Strotz, the director of the State Department's Office of Cyber Affairs.   The two nations, according to Russian officials, have agreed to renew bilateral discussions that began last November in Washington.   ''An international dialogue on cybergovernance, crime and security is really long overdue,'' said Charles L. Barry, a research fellow at the National Defense University. ''There's really only one network out there. We're all on it, and we need to make it safe.''   Mr. Painter, speaking on Tuesday, said there had been significant improvement in international law enforcement cooperation in recent years. To respond to challenges in cyberspace, he said, strong laws, trained crime investigators and efficient international cooperation are needed.    The United States has succeeded in creating a global 24-hour, seven-day network of law enforcement agencies in 50 nations, which have agreed to collect and share data in response to computer attacks and intrusions. While officials from both nations said that law enforcement cooperation had improved, the Russians have refused to sign the European cybercrime treaty, which the United States strongly backs.   At the same time, for the past 13 years, the Russians have been trying to interest the United States in a treaty in which nations would agree not to develop offensive cyberweapons or to conduct attacks on computer networks. The United States has repeatedly declined to enter into negotiations, arguing instead that improved law enforcement cooperation among countries is all that is necessary to combat cybercrime and cyberterrorism.   On Monday, Gen. Vladislav P. Sherstyuk, under secretary of the Russian Security Council, criticized the treaty, saying that a provision effectively violated Russia's sovereignty by permitting foreign law enforcement direct access to the Russian Internet.   The general also restated Russian concerns about the absence of an international treaty limiting military uses of the Internet. ''Cyberattacks are left out of international military law,'' he said. ''Information technology can be used as a tool to undermine national peace and security.''   The Americans have accused the Russians of turning a blind eye to cybercriminals who have operated with relative impunity from Russia. In turn, the Russians have criticized what they see as American ''hegemony'' over the Internet and privately express concerns that the United States has retained a ''red button'' -- the power to shut off the Internet for specific countries.   Yet despite these differences, in Garmisch this year there were also signs of agreement between Russians and Americans.   The conference, sponsored by Lomonosov Moscow State University, Icann and several Russian companies, is the brainchild of General Sherstyuk. Several of the conference attendees said the gathering, which is in its fourth year, was an effort by General Sherstyuk to build international support for his work. He has been the principal force behind Russian efforts to create a treaty limiting cyberwarfare development.   Academic and government officials from other countries, including India and China, attended this year. However, recent episodes like Google's claims in January that it had suffered the theft of its software and intrusions on human rights advocates from China, and a recent Canadian report about a Chinese computer spying system focused on India, were not discussed.   During a panel discussion on computer crime, Col. Gen. Boris N. Miroshnikov, an official with the Russian Interior Ministry, and Stewart A. Baker, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, and the former chief counsel for the National Security Council, agreed that the most important step in combating Internet crime would be to do away with the anonymity that has long been a central tenet of Internet culture.   ''Anonymity is an invitation to criminals,'' General Miroshnikov said.    Mr. Baker agreed, saying, ''Anonymity is the fundamental problem we face in cyberspace.''   This week, the Russians were optimistic that progress was being made in bridging more of the cultural divide that has hindered international cooperation.   According to one Russian business executive who has attended all four Garmisch events, the tenor of this meeting was markedly different from that of earlier meetings  dominated by the Russians. ''In the past, the largest group was from the F.S.B.,'' he said, referring to the Russian intelligence agency, ''who were here for an annual vacation.''  "
"Security for Companies, Not for the Consumer","OTTAWA -- In both form and function, a BlackBerry bought by a consumer for personal use and one handed to an employee by a corporation as a work tool appear to be pretty much the same thing.  But the level of security afforded by the two smartphones could not be further apart. Data traveling to and from corporate phones is protected with a high level of encryption that the United States government also licenses from a subsidiary of Research In Motion, BlackBerry's maker, to protect a wide range of its confidential communications. By contrast, the consumer BlackBerrys offer no extra encryption, making them no more, or less, secure than other smartphones. But encrypted or not, several Internet privacy advocates warn that the high level of data security provided by some BlackBerrys does not necessarily bring users a corresponding level of privacy. Indeed, a variety of software tools that R.I.M. provides to corporations to monitor and record nearly everything employees do with their BlackBerrys -- including where they carry them -- potentially makes the devices powerful tools for surveillance by companies and governments. ''Users need to know that the security is not for them,'' said Seth D. Schoen, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. For governments interested in monitoring their citizens' mobile communications, BlackBerrys are tantalizing devices. Uniquely, BlackBerrys consolidate all their digital dealings -- Web browsing, e-mail and instant messaging -- and then ship them to R.I.M.'s computers through a network operated by the company. This effectively creates a complete record of a user's mobile digital activity, which can be copied to servers that R.I.M. provides to corporations and that also act as links to companies' e-mail systems. The frustration for some governments, however, is R.I.M.'s encryption system. While neither R.I.M. nor the countries it is battling, like the United Arab Emirates, has offered much detail about their dispute, it appears that the countries want R.I.M. to turn over that data as well as a way to decrypt it. But because individual BlackBerrys, not R.I.M.'s servers, contain the digital key needed to unlock the encryption, most experts agree that R.I.M. would be technically unable to fulfill this demand. The company itself has no way to examine the data flowing through its servers and networks. ''I haven't had a strong feeling that the U.A.E. knows what it's talking about,'' said Danny O'Brien, the Internet advocacy coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. ''R.I.M. can't give them what they want.'' Nations intent on snooping might have more immediate success with BlackBerry Messenger, R.I.M.'s instant messaging system that works only between BlackBerrys. While those instant messages are also encrypted, an analysis by the Communications Security Establishment Canada, that country's equivalent of the National Security Agency, concluded that the system had a significant flaw; any BlackBerry on earth can decrypt any Messenger message sent by any other BlackBerry. ''Unfriendly third parties who know the key could potentially use it to decrypt messages captured over the air,'' said the report, which recommended that the Canadian government shut down the feature on its BlackBerrys.  "
Keeping Online Criminals at Bay,"THE Web is a fount of information, a busy marketplace, a thriving social scene -- and a den of criminal activity.    Criminals have found abundant opportunities to undertake stealthy attacks on ordinary Web users that can be hard to stop, experts say. Hackers are lacing Web sites -- often legitimate ones -- with so-called malware, which can silently infiltrate visiting PCs to steal sensitive personal information and then turn the computers into ''zombies'' that can be used to spew spam and more malware onto the Internet.    At one time, virus attacks were obvious to users, said Alan Paller, director of research at the SANS Institute, a training organization for computer security professionals. He explained that now, the attacks were more silent. ''Now it's much, much easier infecting trusted Web sites,'' he said, ''and getting your zombies that way.''    And there are myriad lures aimed at conning people into installing nefarious programs, buying fake antivirus software or turning over personal information that can be used in identity fraud.     ''The Web opened up a lot more opportunities for attacking'' computer users and making money, said Maxim Weinstein, executive director of StopBadware, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group that receives funding from Google, PayPal, Mozilla and others.    Google says its automated scans of the Internet recently turned up malware on roughly 300,000 Web sites, double the number it recorded two years ago. Each site can contain many infected pages. Meanwhile, Malware doubled last year, to 240 million unique attacks, according to Symantec, a maker of security software. And that does not count the scourge of fake antivirus software and other scams.   So it is more important than ever to protect yourself. Here are some basic tips for thwarting them.   Protect the Browser   The most direct line of attack is the browser, said Vincent Weafer, vice president of Symantec Security Response. Online criminals can use programming flaws in browsers to get malware onto PCs in ''drive-by'' downloads without users ever noticing.   Internet Explorer and Firefox are the most targeted browsers because they are the most popular. If you use current versions, and download security updates as they become available, you can surf safely. But  there can still be exposure between when a vulnerability is discovered and an update becomes available,  so you will need up-to-date security software as well to try to block any attacks that may emerge, especially if you have a Windows PC.    It can help to use a more obscure browser like Chrome from Google, which also happens to be the newest browser on the market and, as such, includes some security advances that make attacks more difficult.   Get Adobe Updates   Most consumers are familiar with Adobe Reader, for PDF files, and Adobe's Flash Player. In the last year, a virtual epidemic of attacks has exploited their flaws; almost half of all attacks now come hidden in PDF files, Mr. Weafer said. ''No matter what browser you're using,'' he said, ''you're using the PDF Reader, you're using the Adobe Flash Player.''   Part of the problem is that many computers run old, vulnerable versions. But as of April, it has become easier to get automatic updates from Adobe, if you follow certain steps.   To update Reader, open the application and then select ''Help'' and ''Check for Updates'' from the menu bar. Since April, Windows users have been able to choose to get future updates automatically without additional prompts by clicking ''Edit'' and ''Preferences,'' then choosing ''Updater'' from the list and selecting ''Automatically install updates.'' Mac users can arrange updates using a similar procedure, though Apple requires that they enter their password each time an update is installed.    Adobe said it did not make silent automatic updates available previously because many users, especially at companies, were averse to them. To get the latest version of Flash Player, visit Abobe's Web site.    Any software can be vulnerable. Windows PC users can identify vulnerable or out-of-date software using Secunia PSI, a free tool that scans machines and alerts users to potential problems.    Beware Malicious Ads   An increasingly popular way to get attacks onto Web sites people trust is to slip them into advertisements, usually by duping small-time ad networks. Malvertising, as this practice is known, can exploit software vulnerabilities or dispatch deceptive pop-up messages.   A particularly popular swindle involves an alert that a virus was found on the computer, followed by urgent messages to buy software to remove it. Of course, there is no virus and the security software, known as scareware, is fake. It is a ploy to get credit card numbers and $40 or $50. Scareware accounts for half of all malware delivered in ads, up fivefold from a year ago, Google said.    Closing the pop-up or killing the browser will usually end the episode. But if you encounter this scam,  check your PC with trusted security software or Microsoft's free Malicious Software Removal Tool. If you have picked up something nasty, you are in good company; Microsoft cleaned scareware from 7.8 million PCs in the second half of 2009, up 47 percent from the 5.3 million in the first half, the company said.   Another tool that can defend against malvertising, among other Web threats, is K9 Web Protection, free from Blue Coat Systems. Though it is marketed as parental-control software, K9 can be configured to look only for security threats like malware, spyware and phishing attacks -- and to bark each time it stops one.    Poisoned Search Results   Online criminals are also trying to manipulate search engines into placing malicious sites toward the top of results pages for popular keywords. According to a recent Google study, 60 percent of malicious sites that embed hot keywords try to distribute scareware to the computers of visitors.    Google and search engines like Microsoft's Bing are working to detect malicious sites and remove them from their indexes. Free tools like McAfee's SiteAdvisor and the Firefox add-on Web of Trust can also help  -- warning about potentially dangerous links.    Antisocial Media   Attackers also use e-mail, instant messaging, blog comments and social networks like Facebook and Twitter to induce people to visit their sites.    It's best to accept ''friend'' requests only from people you know, and to guard your passwords. Phishers are trying to filch login information so they can infiltrate accounts, impersonate you to try to scam others out of money and gather personal information about you and your friends.    Also beware the Koobface worm, variants of which have been taking aim at users of Facebook and other social sites for more than a year. It typically promises a video of some kind and asks you to download a fake multimedia-player codec to view the video. If you do so, your PC is infected with malware that turns it into a zombie (making it part of a botnet, or group of computers, that can spew spam and malware across the Internet).    But most important, you need to keep your wits about you. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated ploys, and your best defense on the Web may be a healthy level of suspicion.   "
Wider European Scrutiny of Google on Privacy,"BERLIN -- In a sign that Europe is taking an increasingly unified line on Internet privacy, six European countries have joined Germany in asking Google to preserve data it improperly collected from unsecured wireless networks as part of Street View, its photo-mapping service, the company said Friday.   The growing number of requests by the European countries, and Hong Kong, raised the possibility that Google might be required to disclose for the first time exactly what its employees collected in 33 countries while compiling Street View. And that in turn increased the likelihood that Google, the world's largest search engine company, could face fines or other penalties.    The company said Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland had asked it to retain the data collected from their citizens. Google has described the data as fragments of Web pages and e-mail messages recorded by its roving fleet of specially equipped vehicles.   In a statement, Google said that it had received the multiple requests to retain the Wi-Fi data and that privacy officials in Denmark and Austria, by contrast, had joined Ireland, in asking the search engine to destroy data collected in their countries.    Google did not say in its statement whether it was prepared go a step further and turn over the data it had collected to individual regulators.    Peter Church, a privacy lawyer at Linklaters in London, said it was likely that the countries asking Google to refrain from destroying their data would eventually seek to inspect the data themselves.   ''I would imagine that they would want to have a look at this information,'' Mr. Church said. ''Was Google just looking at the headers of the Wi-Fi information or were they looking at the content? I would imagine that the authorities in these jurisdictions will now look at the information. They will want to know whether or not it was tiny snippets of information, as Google has said, or something more.''   Hana Stepankova, a spokeswoman for the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection, confirmed that her office was investigating. She said it was too early to say whether regulators would ask to see the Czech data.   ''In a country like the Czech Republic, which has had a history of secret surveillance before 1989, people are still very sensitive about anyone trying to listen in to their private business,'' Ms. Stepankova said.   Google attributed its decision to withhold the data as a concession to ''uncertainty'' among privacy regulators, one of which, Google said, initially asked it to delete, and then retain, its data. Google did not identify the country.    ''Following requests from the Irish, Danish and Austrian data protection authorities, we can confirm that we have deleted payload data identified as coming from those countries,'' Google said Friday. ''We can also confirm that, as requested, we are keeping data from Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. Given that there is some uncertainty about deletion generally, for example one data protection authority changed its instruction from delete to retain in the last 24 hours, we think it makes sense to keep the remaining country data while we work through these issues.''    Pressure from the German data supervisor in Hamburg, where Google Germany is based, prompted Google on May 14 to disclose that it had collected 600 gigabytes of data from unsecured Wi-FI networks in 33 countries and Hong Kong for Street View.   So far, only the data protection supervisor in Hamburg, Johannes Caspar, and the privacy commissioner in Hong Kong, Roderick B. Woo, have asked for copies of the data collected in their countries.   Google has said that it collected the data inadvertently through a programming error.   But fallout from the disclosure continued to reverberate. In the United States on Thursday, the chairman Federal Trade Commission said it would conduct an informal review of Google's collection efforts. Regulators in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa are also questioning the company.    In Portland, Ore., two computer users filed a class-action suit in United States District Court against Google on behalf of residents in Oregon and Washington.  "
Protecting Online Privacy,"The Federal Trade Commission has come up with timely recommendations to protect privacy online. For years, data trackers have collected information about people's activities as they surf the Web, packaging it into profiles to sell to advertisers. The practice itself is not what is at issue, but rather the way it is done. Many trackers don't disclose it. Others put complex, pro forma disclosures in obscure places on Web sites. Few consumers read them. Most don't understand how much information they are sharing about their online lives.  Internet companies and advertisers insist that industry self-regulation is enough to protect consumers. But companies' many lapses -- one site that allowed parents to monitor their children online, for example, sold information about the kids' activities to marketers -- suggest it is time for regulators to set minimum standards that every company must follow. The F.T.C. sets three recommendations to improve the protection of consumer privacy, starting with more transparency, including standard, simple and clear privacy disclosures to let people know who is doing what with the data about their online activities. It recommends that companies include privacy protection in their operational goals. And most important, the F.T.C. insists that consumers be given a clear, simple option to opt out of online data tracking altogether -- along the lines of the do-not-call registry -- perhaps through a ''do not track'' button on Web browsers. Advertisers argue that allowing surfers to opt out of tracking en masse would hobble the ad revenues that support most Web sites. This argument is overblown. Giving Americans the choice to opt out of data tracking does not mean everybody will. Moreover, even if regulation limits advertisers' ability to precisely target their ads according to consumers' tastes, they will still need to advertise. They will just do it differently. Advertising spending in the United States amounted to 1.8 percent of G.D.P. last year. In 1990, before Yahoo even existed, it amounted to 2.2 percent of G.D.P. It has remained within that range over nearly two decades. The F.T.C.'s report, which it calls preliminary, is only a first step toward better privacy protection. It is calling for public comment over the next two months, after which it will issue definitive recommendations. Yet while the commission has said it will police privacy abuses more aggressively, its proposal for a ''do not track'' button will probably require an act of Congress. Fortunately, privacy protection has bipartisan support. So this is a great opportunity for Congress to prove that it can pass some meaningful legislation.  "
Updating Internet Privacy,"To the Editor:   Re ''Dial-Up Law in a Broadband World'' (editorial, April 9):    There is no question that the United States needs to update the law for electronic privacy. But the big changes that have taken place over the last 25 years are only partly about new technology. Equally important are the dramatic changes in business practices. Companies now gather and use personal information in ways that the Congress that drafted the 1986 law could not have imagined.   For example, online advertising increasingly relies on detailed profiles of Internet users. These digital dossiers are kept hidden from users, but secretly shape their online experiences. Internet companies also plan to track consumers in their homes with new smart-grid technologies. And the ''Internet of things'' means that many more devices will be linked to the network.   Congress should ensure that users have meaningful control over their personal information. Companies must be far more transparent about the collection and use of personal data. Privacy policies are not enough. Users should have the right to examine what companies actually know about them and how it affects them.   Of course, users should be free to disclose personal information as they choose. And social networks and new business models should flourish. But that does not end the discussion over privacy; that is where it begins.   Marc Rotenberg Washington, April 9, 2010   The writer is president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.  "
Malicious Software Program Attacks Industry,"The technology industry is being rattled by a quiet and sophisticated malicious software program that has infiltrated factory computers. The malware, known as Stuxnet, was discovered in mid July, at least several months after its creation, by VirusBlokAda, a Belarussian computer security company that was alerted by a customer.  Security experts say Stuxnet attacked the software in specialized industrial control equipment made by Siemens by exploiting a previously unknown hole in the Windows operating system. The malware marks the first attack on critical industrial infrastructure that sits at the foundation of modern economies. It also displays an array of novel tactics like an ability to steal design documents or even sabotage equipment in a factory that suggest its creators are much more sophisticated than hackers whose work has been seen before. The malware casts a spotlight on several security weaknesses. Eric Chien, the technical director of Symantec Security Response, a security software maker that has studied Stuxnet, said it appears that the malware was created to attack an Iranian industrial facility. Security experts say that it was likely staged by a government or government-backed group, in light of the significant expertise and resources required to create it. The specific facility that was in Stuxnet's crosshairs is not known, though speculation has centered on gas and nuclear installations. Since it was unleashed, Stuxnet has spread to plants around the world. Siemens said it has received 15 reports from affected customers, five of which were located in Germany. All of these sites successfully removed the malicious program, which can be detected and removed by commercial antivirus programs. ''Up to now there have been no instances where production operations have been influenced,'' the company said in an e-mailed statement. Security researchers initially believed Stuxnet's primary purpose was espionage because of its ability to steal design documents for industrial control systems. But more in-depth study of the program, which is extremely large and highly complex by malware standards, has revealed that it can also make changes to those systems. Exactly what Stuxnet might command industrial equipment to do still isn't known. But malware experts say it could have been designed to trigger such Hollywood-style bedlam as overloaded turbines, exploding pipelines and nuclear centrifuges spinning so fast that they break. ''The true end goal of Stuxnet is cyber sabotage. It's a cyber weapon basically,'' said Roel Schouwenberg, a senior antivirus researcher at Kaspersky, a security software maker. ''But how it exactly manifests in real life, I can't say.'' Stuxnet's remarkable sophistication has surprised many security professionals. Its authors had detailed knowledge of Siemens' software and where its security weaknesses are. They discovered and used four unknown security flaws in Microsoft's Windows operating system. And they masked their attack with the aid of sensitive intellectual property stolen from two hardware companies, Realtek and JMicron, which are located in the same office park in Taiwan. ''It's impossible this was created by some teenager in his basement,'' Mr. Chien said. ''The amount of resources and man hours to put this together,'' he said, show ''it has to be something that was state originated.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Inquiry Puts China's Elite In New Light,"With its sterling reputation and its scientific bent, Shanghai Jiaotong University has the feel of an Ivy League institution.   The university has alliances with elite American ones like Duke and the University of Michigan. And it is so rich in science and engineering talent that Microsoft and Intel have moved into a research park directly adjacent to the school.   But Jiaotong, whose sprawling campus here has more than 33,000 students, is facing an unpleasant question: is it a base for sophisticated computer hackers?    Investigators looking into Web attacks on Google and dozens of other American companies last year have traced the intrusions to computers at Jiaotong as well as an obscure vocational school in eastern China, according to people briefed on the case.   Security experts caution that it is hard to trace online attacks and that the digital footprints may be a ''false flag,'' a kind of decoy intended to throw investigators off track.    But those with knowledge of the investigation say there are reliable clues that suggest the highly sophisticated attacks may have originated at Jiaotong and the more obscure campus, Lanxiang Vocational School in Shandong Province, an institution with ties to the Chinese military.   Last weekend, the two schools strongly denied any knowledge of the attacks, which singled out corporate files and the e-mail accounts of human rights activists.   A spokesman for Jiaotong told local news outlets that school officials were ''shocked and indignant'' to learn of the allegations. And a Lanxiang spokesman called the reports preposterous.    But analysts say Jiaotong and Lanxiang are certain to come under close scrutiny.   Jiaotong is one of China's top universities, and one charged with helping transform this country into a science and technology powerhouse.   The school has exchange programs with some of the world's leading universities. Early this year, Duke said that with the help of Jiaotong, it would build its own campus near Shanghai.   Michael J. Schoenfeld, a spokesman for Duke, said on Friday that the university was troubled by the allegations.   ''We're going to have to explore that with Shanghai Jiaotong and understand the situation,'' he said. ''It's a very complex situation.''   One of Jiaotong's strongest departments is computer science, which has garnered support from some of America's biggest technology companies, including Cisco Systems. Microsoft has collaborated with Jiaotong on a laboratory for intelligent computing and intelligent systems at the university.   Two weeks ago, Jiaotong students won an international computer programming competition sponsored by I.B.M., known as the Battle of the Brains, beating out Stanford and other elite institutions. It was the third time in the last decade that Jiaotong students had taken the top prize.   Jiaotong is also home to the School of Information Security Engineering, which specializes in Internet security. The school's dean and chief professor have both worked on technology matters for the People's Liberation Army, according to the school's Web site.   The school, which has received financing from a high-level government science and technology project, code-named 863, has also regularly invited world-famous hackers and Web security experts to lecture there.   The latest clues do not  answer the question of who was behind the attacks. But it is likely to put added pressure on Beijing to investigate a case that has prompted Google to threaten to pull out of China.   Beijing has not announced an investigation, but Web security experts emphasize that the Chinese government would need to be involved to find the ultimate perpetrators of the attacks.   ''The U.S. would not be able to trace this'' back to the source, said O. Sami Saydjari, the founder of the Cyber Defense Agency, a private Web security firm based in Wisconsin. ''We cannot trace it beyond borders. We'd need the cooperation of the Chinese.''   Xiao Qiang, an expert on Chinese Internet censorship and control, says Jiaotong is studying not just Web security but also how to filter content that the government may deem unhealthy.   ''Computer security may sound neutral, but in China, it also includes content, including content the government doesn't like and wants to get rid of,'' he says.   Scott J. Henderson, the author of ''The Dark Visitor: Inside the World of Chinese Hackers,'' said that in 2007, a prominent Chinese hacker with ties to China's Ministry of Security also lectured at Jiaotong.   ''He gave a lecture called 'Hacking in a Nutshell,' '' said Mr. Henderson, whose research was partly financed by the American  military.   In a statement on Sunday, Microsoft said it could not comment on reports that some hacking had been traced to Jiaotong.   But the statement also said: ''We condemn cyberattacks and industrial espionage no matter who is ultimately responsible. We hope officials will conduct a full investigation and cooperate fully with international authorities to get to the bottom of this situation.''   Google and other companies that were victims of the attacks have declined to comment.    Investigators are also looking into whether some of the intrusions originated at Lanxiang Vocational School, in the city of Jinan.   Lanxiang, which has 30,000 students studying trades like cosmetology and welding, was founded in 1984 by a former military officer on land donated by the military, according to Jinan's propaganda department.   On its Web site, the school records visits to the campus by military officers and boasts of sending ''a large batch of graduates to the army'' and says ''those graduates become the backbone of the army.''   Graduates of the school's computer science department are recruited by the local military garrison each year, according to the school's dean, Mr. Shao, who would give only his last name.   School officials also insist that Lanxiang students are not capable of sophisticated hacking.   ''It's impossible for our students to hack Google and other U.S. companies,''  Mr. Shao said in a telephone interview. ''They are just high school graduates and not at an advanced level.''   Little information  is publicly available about the school's computer science department. But the school says its computer laboratory is so enormous that it was once listed in the Guinness World Records book.  "
Online Security Guard for the U.S.,"Vivek Kundra is the chief information officer of the United States. His job is to help shape the use of technology in government and build tools to help the public navigate the incredible amount of data and information available. Mr. Kundra started his career in government in 2001 as the information technology director for Arlington County, Va., and then went on to work for Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia. Later, he worked for Mayor Adrian Fenty of the District of Columbia before President Obama appointed him to the White House post in 2009. The following is an edited interview with Mr. Kundra: What does it mean to be the chief information officer for the United States? I have four priorities. First is to make sure we effectively manage the $80 billion in information technology funding for the government. Second, we want to optimize where that money is spent, driving efficiency and effectiveness across the entire government. Third is to create an open, transparent and participatory government, creating Web sites like data.gov. Lastly we are focused on cybersecurity, creating a new real-time security posture.  Can you talk a little about cybersecurity? We've been pushing really aggressively to change the culture in the government when it comes to cybersecurity. In the old model, the government employees would write reports, which doesn't make sense anymore for the real-time threats we see today. What do you do differently to attack new threats? Now we've been moving towards creating red teams and blue teams that can respond to a threat in real time. So we're shifting our focus away from writing reports to actually fix the problems. What are red teams and blue teams?The red teams work for the Department of Homeland Security, and they are essentially hackers going after our own systems, trying to find vulnerabilities. Then they hand over the threats they find to the blue team. The blue team then goes in and fixes the problem. So you have hackers working in the government?Yes. We have hackers that are on our side to help protect us from hackers and countries that want to cause harm. You've put some public sites in the cloud, haven't you? I'm thinking of Recovery.gov, which provides data about government spending on the economic recovery.I've been pushing cloud computing so we can close the technology gap in government. Recovery.gov is a perfect example; we recently moved it to the Amazon cloud. We did the same thing with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the grants portion of the government. Why do you want to move public Web sites, like Recovery.gov, to cloud computing?Taking advantage of the cloud for consumer services allows us to abstract away from infrastructure investments, where we don't have to buy, build and manage server farms. To help with this consolidation effort, we're moving some of our services into the cloud. But are there risks to putting government sites in the cloud?There's a huge difference between a government infrastructure in the cloud and putting a Web site like Recovery.gov, a consumer-facing site, in the cloud. By moving Recovery.gov to the Amazon cloud, we saved $750,000 annually. By moving GSA.gov, which is also a consumer site, we saved $1.2 million a year. What are you doing with data.gov?Well, when we started the site in May of 2009, we had 47 data sets available to the public. Today we have 274,000 data sets available. We're promoting transparency across all facets of government, and making data available is the first step. We're adding hundreds of interesting data points from agencies and on every aspect of government -- from health care to education to product safety and defense. And what are people doing with these data sets?We've seen some amazing apps from these data sets. One person, for example, created an iPhone app, CPSC Recalls, which stands for the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This app compiles all the product recalls in the United States, and then a citizen can use the camera on their mobile phone to scan a product in a store and see if it's had any recalls or alerts. It seems that government and citizens are working together with these data sets?Absolutely. We've moved to a model of co-innovation, where the American people can help create value in a way that we've never been able to do before. The recalls app was originally created by a random developer and then we, the government, created a newer version of the app and released it for the Android platform. Have you had push-back with the amount of data available online?Well, it's been very successful so far. There's a few different lenses to this. There's using data for accountability to make sure money is being distributed appropriately. Then there's the data that can be used to help Americans make the right choices whether it's around health care or transportation. And the third is to create a platform for innovation, in the context of the economy, like creating new economic opportunities. How do you ensure that the data is secure?Before each data set is added to data.gov, the respective agencies go through it to make sure there isn't any personal information. After a thorough scrub, it's put through de-identification software to make sure there isn't any private information or information that affects national security. That sounds like an episode of C.S.I.The data.gov platform is huge and very important. We have to ensure that we protect people's privacy, and I've worked very closely with the privacy folks, including the A.C.L.U., to ensure this. Do you use social networks within government?In the White House, we've been using the social tools available today. For example, we rolled out the 2011 budget through Facebook. That helped us leverage an existing network of millions of people without having to build our own infrastructure. We don't have to spend billions of dollars developing these systems, which would take years; instead we can just put it on Facebook. Are you the White House geek?I think there are a lot of geeks in the White House. I'm definitely not the most geeky. Are there days that working in government can be draining?Most days I get into the White House at around 4:30 a.m., and I don't leave until 10 p.m. It's intense, and it's also a lot of fun because we have the ability to deliver real change to Americans' lives. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
HACKS INTO HACKERS,"Last spring, Nick Bilton, an adjunct professor at New York University (and a New York Times blogger), and his technology class stashed sensors all over their floor at the Tisch School of the Arts: on elevators, in hallways, outside bathrooms, in the lounge and in classrooms. They let the sensors collect data for about 36 hours and then rounded them back up.  Bilton says the students discovered a lot about the work habits of their classmates: ''People used the left elevator more than the right one, and people barely take the stairs. People show up around 9 p.m. and leave around 4 a.m. In the morning, there's not much activity.'' Bilton admits that foot-traffic patterns in one of N.Y.U.'s buildings are not ''a big news story,'' but the story was important to a particular audience -- his students. The exercise was his way of demonstrating a belief that is central to the way he, a former programmer at The Times, conducts his journalism: reporters need to know how to manipulate computers in order to tell the stories that matter most to their audiences. As a reporter, Bilton uses code to track hires at companies like Apple and Amazon. He has written programs to test Facebook's privacy policies. He says hacks should be hackers, and he isn't alone. In San Francisco, the Forbes reporter Taylor Buley, despite saying he is ''not a great programmer,'' writes code scripts to help him ''do the same work, just quicker.'' And now, the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism is starting a dual-degree master's program in journalism and computer science. Many j-schools teach how to edit videos and write HTML, the Internet's simplest code. One goal of the Columbia program, according to Bill Grueskin, the dean of academic affairs, is to produce journalists who will ''take it several steps beyond -- to where they're creating a lot of their own new tools.'' That means learning enough computer science and software engineering to be able to design tools for information gathering, synthesis, analysis and circulation -- or enough, at least, to see what technology can do for journalism. Henning Schulzrinne, a computer-science professor at Columbia, says he hopes students will also leave the program with ''tools to assist in gathering, processing and presenting news.'' But what's in it for the engineers, who might have more lucrative things to do than save journalism? Grueskin argues that ''one of the things engineers want to do is find practical, intractable problems society is facing and help come up with ways to solve those problems.'' The unhealthy state of journalism, he says, is definitely one of those intractable problems. Julia Hirschberg, a professor of computer science who has helped plan the new program, told me in an e-mail, ''We don't expect everyone who graduates to work for traditional news companies.'' She said, however, that the skills students will walk away with will leave them ''in a great position'' to contribute to all kinds of companies -- and she mentioned technology firms like Yahoo and Google.

"In Google's Rebuke of China, Focus Falls on Cybersecurity","Even before Google threatened to pull out of China in response to an attack on its computer systems, the company was notifying activists whose e-mail accounts might have been compromised by hackers.    In a world where vast amounts of personal information stored online can quickly reveal a network of friends and associates, Google's move to protect individuals from government surveillance required quick action. In early January, Tenzin Seldon, a 20-year-old Stanford student and Tibetan activist, was told by university officials to contact  Google because her Gmail account had been hacked.   Ms. Seldon, the Indian-born daughter of Tibetan refugees, said she immediately contacted David Drummond,  Google's chief legal officer.   ''David informed me that my account was hacked by someone in China,'' Ms. Seldon said in a telephone interview. ''They were concerned and asked whether they could see my laptop.''    Ms. Seldon immediately changed her password and became more careful of what she wrote. She also allowed Google to examine her personal computer at the company's request. Google returned it this week, saying that while no viruses or malware had been detected, her account had indeed been entered  surreptitiously.    Google confirmed Ms. Seldon's account of events, but declined to say whether it had notified other activists who might have been victims of hacking.   Mr. Drummond said that an attack originating in China was aimed at its corporate infrastructure.    While the full scope of the attacks on Google and several dozen other companies remains unclear, the events set off immediate alarms in Washington, where the  Obama administration has previously expressed concern about international computer security and attacks on Western companies.    Neither the sequence of events leading to Google's decision nor the company's ultimate goal in rebuking China is  fully understood.  But this was not the first time that the company had considered withdrawing from  China, according to a former company executive. It had clashed repeatedly with Chinese officials over censorship demands, the executive said.    Google said on Tuesday  that that in its investigation of the attacks on corporations, it found that the Gmail accounts of Chinese and Tibetan activists, like Ms. Seldon, had been compromised in separate attacks involving phishing and spyware.    Independent security researchers said that at least 34 corporations had been  targets of the attacks originating in China.    Adobe, a software maker,  said it had been the  victim of an attack, but said that it did not know if it was linked to the  hacking of Google. Some reports suggested that Yahoo had been a victim, but a person with knowledge said that Yahoo did not think that it been subject to the same attack as Google.     The decision by Google to draw a line and threaten to end its business operations in China brought attention to reports of Chinese high-technology espionage stretching back at least a decade. But despite Google's suggestion that the hacking came from within China, it remained unclear who was responsible. Nevertheless, it presented  the Obama administration with a  problem of how to respond.    Google's description of the attacks closely matches a vast surveillance system called Ghostnet that was reported in March by a group of Canadian researchers based at the Munk  Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto. They found that an automated espionage system based in China was using targeted e-mail messages to compromise thousands of computers in hundreds of governmental organizations. In each case, after the computers were controlled by the attackers, they were able to scan for documents that were then stolen and transferred to a digital storage facility in China.   The researchers stopped short of directly accusing the Chinese government of masterminding the attacks. However, for years there have been reports of  attacks planned by so-called patriotic hackers in China, and many American security specialists argue that these are simply irregular elements of the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, hackers frequently use  so-called false flag espionage or denial of service attacks to route their activities through the computers of a third country  and hide their identity.   One of the Canadian researchers said that fellow computer security researchers suspected that the attack on Google and other recent intrusions relied on hackers sending  booby-trapped  documents that were stored in Adobe's Acrobat Reader format, which then infect victims' computers. This method was seen in a recent wave of attacks on the Dalai Lama's computers. ''We've seen a huge upsurge in attacks using Adobe Acrobat,'' said Greg Walton, an editor at Information Warfare Monitor, a publication of the Canadian research group.   A spokeswoman for Adobe said the company was investigating the reports, but could not  confirm that the Adobe software was linked to the most recent attacks.   For Google, the attacks appeared to have been the final straw in a series of confrontations with Chinese authorities.    Top Google executives, including the chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, and the co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, were ambivalent about the decision to go into China in 2006, which involved agreeing to censor some search results on the company's local search engine, according to a former executive with knowledge of the discussions. The resistance was  strong from Mr. Brin, who had grown up in the Soviet Union.    But after discussions  and internal lobbying from Chinese and Chinese-American employees inside Google, as well as some of the company's sales executives, Google's top executives came around. They were particularly swayed by the argument that even a censored version of Google's search engine would provide Chinese people more access to information and help promote free expression in that country.    Once the decision was made, however, Google began expanding its operation in China, which it expected would grow to be one of the largest Internet markets. During Mr. Schmidt's  2006 visit to China, shortly after Google introduced the company's China-based search engine, Google.cn,  he told reporters that it would be ''arrogant'' to try to change China's censorship laws.    But repeated clashes with Chinese authorities caused Google  to reconsider its decision on many occasions, the former executives said. Things almost collapsed in 2008, when Chinese government officials asked Google to censor results not only on Google.cn but also on Google.com. the company's English-language search engine. Google refused, and after the 2008 Olympics, Chinese officials dropped the issue.    Google now says it thinks that its attempt to help bring openness to China has failed.    ''We were looking at an environment that is more difficult than it was when we started,'' Mr.  Drummond  said in an interview on Tuesday. ''Far from our presence helping to open things up, it seems that things are getting tighter for open expression and freedom.''   Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday that the White House had been briefed by Google on the company's decision.  However, he declined to describe what actions the government might take in response to the claims of Chinese-directed Internet attacks.   ''The recent cyberintrusion that Google attributes to China is troubling, and the federal government is looking into it,'' said a White House spokesman,  Nicholas Shapiro. He said that the president had stated that Internet freedom was a central human rights issue on a recent China trip. He also said that the president had made Internet security a national priority.   Gabriel Stricker, a Google spokesman, said Google's decision to publicize the attacks was  motivated in part by  its desire to alert activists that their accounts could have been compromised.    The attacks present a challenge for the Obama administration, which last year debated the role of a federal Internet security adviser. The administration is grappling on how to balance stricter security controls and the freedom of technology companies to innovate.    Several Internet security specialists were quick to point out that a group within the White House led by Lawrence H. Summers, the national economic adviser,  had pointed to Google in debates on the appointment as an example of an innovative Silicon Valley company that might be hamstrung by strict new Internet security restrictions.   ''It's ironic that the new economy folks at the White House were pushing back against faster movement on cybersecurity to protect companies like Google from stricter regulations,'' said James Lewis, an Internet security specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Last year, Mr. Lewis led a bipartisan study calling for the creation of a strong Internet czar reporting directly to the president to combat a rash of new security threats.   The White House said on Tuesday that Robert A. Schmidt, a compromise candidate who was chosen last month to be the Internet security adviser, would not start in the position until later in the month.   "
Military Computer Attack Confirmed,"WASHINGTON -- A top Pentagon official has confirmed a previously classified incident that he describes as ''the most significant breach of U.S. military computers ever,'' a 2008 episode in which a foreign intelligence agent used a flash drive to infect computers, including those used by the Central Command in overseeing combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. Plugging the cigarette-lighter-sized flash drive into an American military laptop at a base in the Middle East amounted to ''a digital beachhead, from which data could be transferred to servers under foreign control,'' according to William J. Lynn 3d, deputy secretary of defense, writing in the latest issue of the journal Foreign Affairs.  ''It was a network administrator's worst fear: a rogue program operating silently, poised to deliver operational plans into the hands of an unknown adversary,'' Mr. Lynn wrote. The incident was first reported in November 2008 by the Danger Room blog of Wired magazine, and then in greater detail by The Los Angeles Times, which said that the matter was sufficiently grave that President George W. Bush was briefed on it. The newspaper mentioned suspicions of Russian involvement. But Mr. Lynn's article was the first official confirmation. He also put a name -- Operation Buckshot Yankee -- to the Pentagon operation to counter the attack, and said that the episode ''marked a turning point in U.S. cyber-defense strategy.'' In an early step, the Defense Department banned the use of portable flash drives with its computers, though it later modified the ban. Mr. Lynn described the extraordinary difficulty of protecting military digital communications over a web of 15,000 networks and 7 million computing devices in dozens of countries against farflung adversaries who, with modest means and a reasonable degree of ingenuity, can inflict outsized damage. Traditional notions of deterrence do not apply. ''A dozen determined computer programmers can, if they find a vulnerability to exploit, threaten the United States's global logistics network, steal its operational plans, blind its intelligence capabilities or hinder its ability to deliver weapons on target,'' he wrote. Security officials also face the problem of counterfeit hardware that may have remotely operated ''kill switches'' or ''back doors'' built in to allow manipulation from afar, as well as the problem of software with rogue code meant to cause sudden malfunctions. Against the array of threats, Mr. Lynn said, the National Security Agency had pioneered systems -- ''part sensor, part sentry, part sharpshooter'' -- that are meant to automatically counter intrusions in real time. His article appeared intended partly to raise awareness of the threat to United States cybersecurity -- ''the frequency and sophistication of intrusions into U.S. military networks have increased exponentially,'' he wrote -- and partly to make the case for a larger Pentagon role in cyberdefense. Various efforts at cyberdefense by the military have been drawn under a single organization, the U.S. Cyber Command, which began operations in late May at Fort Meade, Maryland, under a four-star general, Keith B. Alexander. But under proposed legislation, the Department of Homeland Security would take the leading role in the defense of civilian systems. Though the Cyber Command has greater capabilities, the military operates within the United States only if ordered to do so by the president. Another concern is whether the Pentagon, or government in general, has the nimbleness for such work. Mr. Lynn acknowledged that ''it takes the Pentagon 81 months to make a new computer system operational after it is first funded.'' By contrast, he noted, ''the iPhone was developed in 24 months.''  "
German Agency Finds Flaws In Apple's Mobile Software,"BERLIN -- A German government agency warned citizens on Wednesday about two software vulnerabilities in Apple's mobile operating system, iOS, which it said could be exploited to infect the company's best-selling iPhone, iPad and iPod devices.  The agency, the German Federal Office for Information Security, said its technical experts had confirmed the vulnerabilities in several versions of iOS, which could be exposed when Apple users visited infected Web sites or opened infected PDF documents. The agency, a branch of the German Interior Ministry, is charged with warning government employees and the public of software threats that could compromise private communications. Apple acknowledged the security flaw and said a fix would be forthcoming. ''We are aware of the reported issue,'' said Natalie Harrison, a spokeswoman for the company. ''We have already developed a fix and it will be available to customers in an upcoming software update.'' She declined to say whether the security flaw had been exploited by hackers. Katrin Alberts, a spokeswoman for the German agency, said its technical experts had investigated the security of the iOS system after a computer hacker using the name Comex disclosed the weaknesses over the weekend in several online forums and on Twitter. Comex belongs to a group that is apparently developing ways to open Apple's proprietary operating system to software that has not been approved by the company. ''Our internal experts confirmed these weaknesses,'' Ms. Alberts said. ''That is why we put out the advisory today.'' So far, Ms. Alberts said her agency had not received any reports of malware being developed that sought to exploit the weaknesses. Ms. Alberts said the agency had been in discussions with Apple this week. The agency warned consumers to use caution when surfing the Internet with Apple devices, especially when asked to click on Web links or PDF attachments in unsolicited e-mails. The agency said Apple products that were vulnerable included iPhone iOS versions 3.1.2 through 4.0.1; iPad iOS versions 3.2 through 3.2.1. and iPod Touch iOS versions 3.1.2. to 4.0. The agency said it could not rule out a risk in other models.  "
Germany Asks Apple About iPhone's Data-Gathering,"BERLIN -- The justice minister of Germany expressed concern on Monday over Apple's practice of compiling data on users of its new iPhone, making the company the latest  technology giant to fall afoul of the country's strict privacy laws.    The latest version of the company's smartphone, the iPhone 4, went on sale in Germany on Thursday. Under German law, the mere act of collecting personal data without an individual's permission, whether it be geographic location or Web traffic, is illegal.     The justice minister, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, asked Apple to tell state data protection officials about the kind of data the company was gathering on individual iPhone users in Germany. The company is also being asked to outline  how long the data is being stored and for what purpose.    ''Apple has the obligation to properly implement the transparency so often promised by Steve Jobs,'' Ms. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said in an interview with the magazine Der Spiegel.    Apple, in a statement, said that iPhone 4 gives its users in Germany the option of denying the transfer of any personal information, including geographic location, to third parties. Referring to the phone's operating system, it said, ''With iOS4, Apple has gone further to protect users' privacy, particularly with respect to location, than anyone else has to date.''   In the user manual for the new phone circulated in Germany, Apple says it reserves the right to forward data like the geographic location of individuals to other companies.    German privacy laws are among the strictest in Europe, giving individuals, including convicted felons, virtually total control over the use of their personal information.    Several Internet companies, like Google, Facebook and now Apple, have become ensnared in German regulations as they try to carry out business models that rely in part on the use of private information. On June 6, the German consumer protection minister, Ilse Aigner, threatened Facebook with fines if it did not improve the protection of information provided by German users of the social networking site. Ms. Aigner also said she planned to delete her own Facebook entry.    At the request of a data protection supervisor in Hamburg, Google disclosed in May that it had improperly collected 600 gigabytes of personal data, including fragments of e-mail messages and unencrypted passwords, on individuals around the world as it scanned home Wi-Fi networks while it gathered information for its Street View map archive.    The disclosure set off investigations in 12 countries and territories, including Germany, the United States, France and Spain. European regulators are pressing the company to hand over the data it improperly collected on their citizens.    Ulrich Staudigl, a spokesman for the German justice minister, said Ms. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger had not threatened to fine Apple but had merely asked the company to inform state officials. Privacy laws are enforced at the state level in Germany.    Stefan Kopsell, an instructor in data protection at the Technical University in Dresden, said Apple could probably settle the controversy surrounding the iPhone 4 by obtaining the consent of German users before the data was forwarded.    ''I think there is probably a fundamental conflict between some Internet business models and German privacy law,'' Mr. Kopsell said. ''But in general, evidence shows that most Germans are willing to participate if there's a benefit.''    For example, 60 percent of households in Germany use a retail bonus card called Payback, owned by Loyalty Partner of Munich, which gives them points that can be used toward future purchases. By participating, consumers give the company the right to collect and market data on their purchasing habits, as well as send them advertising. ''I would think the same would be possible for Apple,'' Mr. Kopsell said.   "
"Ohio State Says Hackers Breached Data on 760,000","Ohio State University is notifying about 760,000 people whose personal information was stored in the university's computer server that a data breach could put them at risk for identity theft.  The university, located in Columbus, began sending letters on Wednesday to current and former faculty and staff members, students and applicants, telling them that hackers had broken into the server that stored their names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth and addresses. The university said that although there was no evidence that the information had been used for identity theft, it was nonetheless offering a year of free credit protection to everyone whose data was on the server. ''We regret that this has occurred and are exercising an abundance of caution in choosing to notify those affected,'' Joseph A. Alutto, the university provost, said in a news release. While suspicious activity on the server was discovered in late October, said Jim Lynch, a university spokesman, the disclosure was delayed to give Ohio State time to investigate and set up support systems, including a call center, for those affected. Mr. Lynch said that as soon as the university found that unauthorized people had logged into the server, it hired computer forensic consultants to investigate. ''They found no evidence that any of the data was taken out of the system,'' he said. ''They did find evidence that the purpose of the unauthorized access was to launch cyberattacks on online business entities. Apparently, if you're going to flood a company with e-mails, you don't use your home computer, but you slip into someone else's server.'' While dozens of universities have been plagued by hackers gaining access to their servers, the Ohio State intrusion was, by far, the largest breach of security this year, according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer group. Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy at the clearinghouse, said that despite the university's assertion that no information had been taken from the server, people whose information was compromised should take heed. ''If it were me, obviously, I'd take the year of credit protection,'' he said. ''The fact that there are Social Security numbers involved makes it somewhat worrisome. On the other hand, one can take some comfort in the fact that there are so many records involved. Would it be physically possible for a criminal to use them all?''

Twitter Settles F.T.C. Privacy Case,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Twitter, the rapidly growing Internet messaging service, has settled a Federal Trade Commission investigation into the security and privacy protections it offers its users.   For the last 11 months, the F.T.C. has been looking into two security breaches at Twitter in 2009 in which a hacker got access to the accounts of several prominent members, including Barack Obama, then the president-elect, and was able to read their private Twitter messages and send out fake messages from their accounts.    The F.T.C.'s punishment was not severe.  Twitter, based in San Francisco, agreed to set up a security program that will be audited by an outside company, and, according to the F.T.C.'s news release on the case, ''will be barred for 20 years from misleading consumers about the extent to which it maintains and protects the security, privacy and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information.''     ''When a company promises consumers that their personal information is secure, it must live up to that promise,'' said David Vladeck, director of the F.T.C.'s bureau of consumer protection, in a statement. ''Likewise, a company that allows consumers to designate their information as private must use reasonable security to uphold such designations. Consumers who use social networking sites may choose to share some information with others, but they still have a right to expect that their personal information will be kept private and secure.''   The incidents occurred in the first half of  2009. In the first, more serious attack, an unknown hacker used an automated software program to guess at Twitter's administrative password -- a weak, lowercase, common dictionary word, the F.T.C. said -- and obtain control over the service. The hacker penetrated 45 user accounts for a short period of time, reset their passwords and posted the new passwords online.    The hacker also sent humorous messages out from the accounts of some users, including President-elect Obama, who that day offered his thousands of Twitter followers the opportunity to win free gasoline.    In a post on the company's blog, Twitter's general counsel, Alexander Macgillivray,wrote thatthe incident occurred when the service employed fewer than 50 people and was growing rapidly. ''Even before the agreement, we'd implemented many of the F.T.C.'s suggestions and the agreement formalizes our commitment to those security practices,'' he wrote.   In the second incident, in April, a hacker accessed a Twitter employee's personal e-mail account and was able to use information obtained there to guess the employee's administrative password to the service, which he used to get into 10 more user accounts. This attack was perpetrated by Francois Cousteix, a 23-year-old French-born hacker who went by the online handle Hacker-Croll.  He avoided jail time this week when a French court gave him a suspended sentence over the incident.   Over the last few years, the F.T.C. has become more aggressive on matters of data security. It said the case was the 30th it had brought over faulty data security measures, but the first against a social networking service.   In a fact sheet about the settlement that Twitter distributed on Thursday morning, the company referred to more recent data breaches involving AT&T, Google and Apple, and wrote of the F.T.C., ''We think they saw it as an opportunity to make an example of us in the hopes of curtailing breaches -- including those many more serious than ours -- in our industry.''

Google Data Admission Angers European Officials,"BERLIN -- European privacy regulators and advocates reacted angrily Saturday to the disclosure by Google, the world's largest search engine, that it had systematically collected private data since 2006 while compiling its Street View photo archive.   After being pressed by European officials about the kind of data the company compiled in creating the archive -- and what it did with that information -- Google acknowledged on Friday that it had collected snippets of private data around the world. In a blog post on its Web site, the company said information had been recorded as it was sent over unencrypted residential wireless networks as Google's Street View cars with mounted recording equipment passed by.   The data collection, which Google said was inadvertent and the result of a programming error, took place in all the countries where Street View has been catalogued, including the United States and parts of Europe. Google apologized and said it had not used the information, which it plans to delete in conjunction with regulators.   But in Germany, Google's collection of the data -- which the company said could include the Web sites viewed by individuals or the content of their e-mail -- is a violation of privacy law, said Ilse Aigner, the German minister for food, agriculture and consumer protection. In a statement Saturday, her ministry demanded a full accounting.    ''Based on the information we have before us, it appears that Google has illegally tapped into private networks in violation of German law,'' Ms. Aigner said. ''This is alarming and further evidence that privacy law is a foreign concept to Google.''   Johannes Caspar, the data protection supervisor for Hamburg, who is leading the German government's dealings with Google on the issue, said the company's revelation of illegal data collection would be taken up by a panel of European national data protection chiefs that advises the European Commission.   ''This is a data scandal of a much larger magnitude,'' Mr. Caspar said. ''We are talking here about the large-scale collection of private data on individuals.''   He declined to speculate what action European officials might take.   Mr. Caspar said he had inspected one of Google's Street View recording vehicles at the company's invitation this month and had noticed that the recording device's hard drive had been removed. When he asked to view the drive, he said he was told he couldn't read the information anyway because it was encoded. He said he pressed Google to disclose what type of information was being collected, which prompted the company to examine the storage unit.   ''I am glad that this cat-and-mouse game with Google is finally over,'' Mr. Caspar said. ''I hope now that the company does what it says it will do.''   ''I think this is going to damage the company irreparably,'' said Simon Davies, the director of Privacy International, a London-based group of privacy advocates from 40 countries. ''Three years ago the company was wearing a halo. But over the past year it has moved substantially in the direction of being perceived as Big Brother.''   Kay Oberbeck, a Google spokesman in Hamburg, said the company was in contact with data protection officials in Germany and in the rest of Europe to address their concerns. He disputed the notion that Google was recklessly collecting private information, saying the company's services were meant to let users control what information is made public.   ''This was obviously a mistake, and we are profoundly sorry,'' Mr. Oberbeck said. ''We take individual privacy very seriously at Google. There was a breakdown in the communication between teams and within teams, and we are investigating this and want to take up the lessons we learn from this to improve our processes and to have instruments installed which are really robust to make this never happen again.''   Google was collecting the data on locations of wireless networks to improve geolocation for mobile devices. Some cellphones can determine their location by scanning for nearby wireless networks and comparing that information to databases like the one Google has compiled.   Google plans to hire an outside auditor to investigate what personal data was collected through Street View. The improper collection of data came to light, Mr. Oberbeck said, after German data protection officials asked Google two weeks ago to detail exactly what information it had collected from household wireless local area networks, or WLANs.   Initially, Google had told German officials that the data it had collected was limited to just two bits of information: the publicly broadcast ID number of the device, which is called a MAC address, and the name assigned to it by the owner, called an SSID.   But in its review, Mr. Oberbeck said the company learned that its data collection performed by roving Street View vehicles was much more extensive, including a record of sites viewed by the user and potentially the contents of messages if users did not secure their WLANS with a password.   Despite its internal efforts to address the situation, Google may face an uphill battle in Germany overcoming skepticism about its intentions. So far, thousands of Germans have signed up to have their properties excluded from Google's Street View archives.   If Google's software makes a mistake, it could be costly for the company. Till Steffen, the justice senator for the city-state of Hamburg, where Google's German headquarters is located, said Google's latest disclosure raised questions about its intent to follow local laws.   Mr. Steffen has introduced a bill in the German Parliament that would fine Google for displaying personal property in Street View without the consent of owners. On Saturday, he demanded that Google turn over the illegally obtained information to regulators.   ''Google is in the process of frittering away its last shred of credibility,'' Mr. Steffen said. ''The company must immediately disclose to what degree it has secretly eavesdropped as we've sent e-mails to friends in Germany and the rest of Europe or as we've done our banking in the Internet.''   Mr. Steffen on May 7 introduced a bill in the upper house of the German Parliament that would fine Google 50,000 euros, or $62,500, for each time it failed to remove the personal property of a citizen who requested to be exempted from Street View. Action on the bill is not likely before summer.   The latest episode will further complicate Google's business in Europe, where the company has faced a series of legal entanglements over privacy issues.   In April, data protection regulators from eight European countries and Israel and New Zealand sent a joint letter to Google's chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, criticizing the company's Buzz social networking service, which unwittingly publicized the connections of some users without their permission.   In Switzerland, Google has agreed to halt the display of further Street View images pending the outcome of a court case lodged by Swiss federal data protection officials.  "
Attacker That Sharpened Facebook's Defenses,"A friend on Facebook suggests that you watch an amazing or funny or sexy video. The link may seem innocuous enough. But with a few simple clicks, you could end up infecting your PC with the Koobface worm. Koobface, whose name is an anagram for its preferred social network, is a malicious program that has plagued Facebook for more than two years, ensnaring hundreds of thousands of people and keeping the site's security team on the defense. The worm was Facebook's first major security challenge and remains the most persistent threat on the site. As such, Koobface has played a big role in shaping Facebook's approach to combating malicious software, or malware, and propelled the development of increasingly elaborate defenses. Yet the worm continues to be a thorn in the side of Facebook's in-house investigators, who say they are on the trail of the organized criminal group that created it but, so far, have been denied the satisfaction of arrests.  Koobface, which spreads only on social networks, appeared on Facebook in May 2008 and has hit nearly every major social network since then. While not the first or only worm to strike social sites, it is notable for the way it has relentlessly returned again and again, particularly to Facebook. There have been 136 versions of Koobface's main component alone, said Ryan R. Flores, a senior threat researcher at the security software company Trend Micro. By continually adapting to obstacles set up by Facebook and the security industry, ''Koobface is the one that made it big,'' he said. The attacks have pushed Facebook to expand its security team, to develop a sophisticated apparatus for quickly detecting and stopping malicious activity, to create tools for talking with its users about security and to build relationships within the security industry. And the company continues to gather evidence that could help law enforcement arrest and prosecute those responsible. ''Our goal with regard to Koobface, and with every case, is to make sure that the damage stops, and that's our No. 1 priority,'' said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer at Facebook. ''We want the message to get out that we will go on the offensive and that we will be aggressive in these types of cases.'' The saber-rattling comes after Nick Bilogorskiy, a malware expert at Facebook, told a crowd at a security industry conference in September that Facebook knew the identities of Koobface's creators and was working with law enforcement. Mr. Sullivan declined to provide further details, citing a company policy on not discussing investigations. The lack of arrests in the case underscores how difficult it is to find and apprehend online criminals, who often hide their tracks and live in countries where they have little to fear from the law. Researchers at Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian group, released a report on Friday that details the Koobface criminal enterprise, saying its operators live in St. Petersburg, Russia. ''The Koobface gang might as well be living on Mars, so poorly developed are the mechanisms of international law enforcement cooperation,'' wrote Ron Deibert and Rafal Rohozinski in the report. Nart Villeneuve, the report's lead researcher, estimated that the group earned more than $2 million from June 2009 to June 2010 by delivering the victims of its worm to unscrupulous marketers and makers of fake antivirus software. He said the release of the report coincided with a multiweek effort to dismantle the group's infrastructure and take down its ''botnet,'' or network of Koobface-infected PCs, though he conceded it was likely to be rebuilt. With the group still at large, Facebook can only limit the damage by acting quickly to stop attacks. The company's security team has about 20 members, but at any one time, some 50 Facebook employees from various departments are focused on such problems. ''When it comes to malware, it's kind of a companywide effort because it is one of our biggest threats,'' said Mr. Sullivan, who spent eight years as a prosecutor with the Justice Department and was its first prosecutor to focus full time on high-tech crime, working closely with the F.B.I. and other agencies. A Koobface attack starts with an invitation to watch a video and a message about updating the computer's Flash software. Clicking to get the update begins the download of Koobface, which gives criminals control of the computer, while the worm tries to spread itself further through the victim's social network contacts. The computer then becomes part of the Koobface botnet, which the security software firm Kaspersky Labs estimates is made up of 400,000 to 800,000 PCs worldwide. ''That definitely makes Koobface one of the most significant botnets out there,'' said Roel Schouwenberg, a senior researcher. To halt Koobface, Facebook uses algorithms that can detect suspicious posts and hijacked accounts, looking for unusual behavior like log-ins from odd places and a surge in messages sent. Facebook also keeps a blacklist of malicious Web links to prevent them from being shared on the site. When Koobface posts find a way through, members of the operations team remove them. All this typically happens within an hour or so of the suspicious posts, Mr. Sullivan said. ''The whole purpose of a social network is to help facilitate communication. So as a result, there's the potential for fast propagation if we don't stay on top of things.'' Facebook also has systems to detect the fake profiles the group uses to seed attacks. Still, researchers recently identified more than 20,000 fake accounts, which they reported to Facebook as part of the takedown effort. The profiles tend to include pictures of attractive women, and some accumulated as many as a thousand ''friends,'' even though Facebook warns users not to befriend strangers on the site. Facebook developers have created roadblocks that can help halt the attacks. For instance, if Facebook detects malicious activity and suspects a user's PC has become infected, it will temporarily suspend the account and require that the user run a free McAfee antivirus scan and remove infections. The safeguards are not always foolproof. The Koobface group has managed to circumvent ''Captcha'' tests, or requirements to type words that are difficult for machines to read, by tricking its victims into solving them. Some in the security industry express frustration over a lack of progress in the Koobface case. Mr. Rohozinski said his group decided to go public with its findings after becoming convinced that there would be no arrests. Mr. Sullivan is taking a more patient approach. ''The speed that investigations and prosecutions move, sometimes they can from the outside seem slow,'' he said. While the obstacles are real -- gathering evidence across borders is particularly time-consuming -- American law enforcement is committed to fighting international Internet crime, he said. Raymond A. Pompon, senior security officer at HCL CapitalStream, which provides electronic services for financial institutions, said such prosecutions were tricky. ''Oftentimes you do know who it is, but you actually have to prove this person did it -- his hands were on the keyboard.'' If or when the time for prosecution comes, Facebook is unlikely to hold back. It has pursued a number of civil suits against spammers and scammers that have led to record judgments. ''We're pretty relentless,'' Mr. Sullivan said.  "
"Researchers Spy on Computer Spies, Tracing Data Theft to China","TORONTO -- Turning the tables on a China-based computer espionage gang, Canadian and United States computer security researchers have monitored a spying operation for the past eight months, observing while the intruders pilfered classified and restricted documents from the highest levels of the Indian Defense Ministry.   In a report issued Monday night, the researchers, based at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, provide a detailed account of how a spy operation it called the Shadow Network systematically hacked into personal computers in government offices on several continents.   The Toronto spy hunters not only learned what kinds of material had been stolen, but were able to see some of the documents, including classified assessments about security in several Indian states, and confidential embassy documents about India's relationships in West Africa, Russia and the Middle East. The intruders breached the systems of independent analysts, taking reports on several Indian missile systems. They also obtained a year's worth of the Dalai Lama's personal e-mail messages.   The intruders even stole documents related to the travel of NATO forces in Afghanistan, illustrating that even though the Indian government was the primary target of the attacks, one chink in computer security can leave many nations exposed.     ''It's not only that you're only secure as the weakest link in your network,'' said Rafal Rohozinski, a member of the Toronto team. ''But in an interconnected world, you're only as secure as the weakest link in the global chain of information.''   As recently as early March, the Indian communications minister, Sachin Pilot, told reporters that government networks had been attacked by China, but that ''not one attempt has been successful.'' But on March 24, the Toronto researchers said, they contacted intelligence officials in India and told them of the spy ring they had been tracking. They requested and were given instructions on how to dispose of the classified and restricted documents.    On Monday, Sitanshu Kar, a spokesman for the Indian Defense Ministry, said officials were ''looking into'' the report, but had no official statement.   The attacks look like the work of a criminal gang based in Sichuan Province, but as with all cyberattacks, it is easy to mask the true origin, the researchers said. Given the sophistication of the intruders and the targets of the operation, the researchers said, it is possible that the Chinese government approved of the spying.   When asked about the new report on Monday, a propaganda official in Sichuan's capital, Chengdu, said ''it's ridiculous'' to suggest that the Chinese government might have played a role. ''The Chinese government considers hacking a cancer to the whole society,'' said the official, Ye Lao. Tensions have risen between China and the United States this year after a statement by Google in January that it and dozens of other companies had been the victims of computer intrusions coming from China.   The spy operation appears to be different from the Internet intruders identified by Google and from a surveillance ring known as Ghostnet, also believed to be operating from China, which the Canadian researchers identified in March of last year. Ghostnet used computer servers based largely on the island of Hainan to steal documents from the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, and governments and corporations in more than 103 countries.   The Ghostnet investigation led the researchers to this second Internet spy operation, which is the subject of their new report, titled ''Shadows in the Cloud: An investigation Into Cyberespionage 2.0.'' The new report shows that the India-focused spy ring made extensive use of Internet services like Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot, blog.com, Baidu Blogs and Yahoo! Mail to automate the control of computers once they had been infected.   The Canadian researchers cooperated in their investigation with a volunteer group of security experts in the United States at the Shadowserver Foundation, which focuses on Internet criminal activity.    ''This would definitely rank in the sophisticated range,'' said Steven Adair, a security research with the group. ''While we don't know exactly who's behind it, we know they selected their targets with great care.''    By gaining access to the control servers used by the second cyber gang, the researchers observed the theft of a wide range of material, including classified documents from the Indian government and reports taken from Indian military analysts and corporations, as well as documents from agencies of the United Nations and other governments.    ''We snuck around behind the backs of the attackers and picked their pockets,'' said Ronald J. Deibert, a political scientist who is director of the Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity research group at the Munk School. ''I've not seen anything remotely close to the depth and the sensitivity of the documents that we've recovered.''   The researchers said the second spy ring was more sophisticated and difficult to detect than the Ghostnet operation.   By examining a series of e-mail addresses, the investigators traced the attacks to hackers who appeared to be based in Chengdu, which is home to a large population from neighboring Tibet. Researchers believe that one hacker used the code name ''lost33'' and that he may have been affiliated with the city's prestigious University of Electronic Science and Technology. The university publishes books on computer hacking and offers courses in ''network attack and defense technology'' and ''information conflict technology,'' according to its Web site.   The People's Liberation Army also operates a technical reconnaissance bureau in the city, and helps finance the university's research on computer network defense. A university spokesman could not be reached Monday because of a national holiday.   The investigators linked the account of another hacker  to a Chengdu resident whose name appeared to be Mr. Li. Reached by telephone on Monday, Mr. Li denied taking part in computer hacking. Mr. Li, who declined to give his full name, said he must have been confused with someone else. He said he knew little about hacking. ''That is not me,'' he said. ''I'm a wine seller.''    The Canadian researchers stressed that while the new spy ring focused primarily on India, there were clear international ramifications. Mr. Rohozinski noted that civilians working for NATO and the reconstruction mission in Afghanistan usually traveled through India and that Indian government computers that issued visas had been compromised in both Kandahar and Kabul in Afghanistan.   ''That is an operations security issue for both NATO and the International Security Assistance Force,'' said Mr. Rohozinski, who is also chief executive of the SecDev Group, a Canadian computer security consulting and research firm.    The report notes that documents the researchers recovered were found with ''Secret,'' ''Restricted'' and ''Confidential'' notices. ''These documents,'' the report says, ''contain sensitive information taken from a member of the National Security Council Secretariat concerning secret assessments of India's security situation in the states of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura, as well as concerning the Naxalites and Maoists,'' two opposition groups.    Other documents included personal information about a member of the Indian Directorate General of Military Intelligence.    The researchers also found evidence that Indian Embassy computers in Kabul, Moscow and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and at the High Commission of India in Abuja, Nigeria had been compromised.   Also compromised were computers used by the Indian Military Engineer Services in Bengdubi, Calcutta, Bangalore and Jalandhar; the 21 Mountain Artillery Brigade in Assam and three air force bases. Computers at two Indian military colleges were also taken over by the spy ring.   Even after eight months of watching the spy ring, the Toronto researchers said they could not determine exactly who was using the Chengdu computers to infiltrate the Indian government.    ''But an important question to be entertained is whether the P.R.C. will take action to shut the Shadow Network down,'' the report says, referring to the People's Republic of China. ''Doing so will help to address longstanding concerns that malware ecosystems are actively cultivated, or at the very least tolerated, by governments like the P.R.C. who stand to benefit from their exploits though the black and gray markets for information and data.''  "
Hackers Said to Breach Google Password System,"Ever since Google disclosed in January that Internet intruders had stolen information from its computers, the exact nature and extent of the theft has been a closely guarded company secret. But a person with direct knowledge of the investigation now says that the losses included one of Google's crown jewels, a password system that controls access by millions of users worldwide to almost all of the company's Web services, including e-mail and business applications.    The program, code named Gaia for the Greek goddess of the earth, was attacked in a lightning raid taking less than two days last December, the person said. Described publicly only once at a technical conference four years ago, the software is intended to enable users and employees to sign in with their password just once to operate a range of services.    The intruders do not appear to have stolen passwords of Gmail users, and the company quickly started making significant changes to the security of its networks after the intrusions. But the theft leaves open the possibility, however faint, that the intruders may find weaknesses that Google might not even be aware of, independent computer experts said.    The new details seem likely to increase the debate about the security and privacy of vast computing systems such as Google's that now centralize the personal information of millions of individuals and businesses. Because vast amounts of digital information are stored in a cluster of computers, popularly referred to as ''cloud'' computing, a single breach can lead to disastrous losses.   The theft began with an instant message sent to a Google employee in China who was using Microsoft's Messenger program, according to the person with  knowledge of the internal inquiry, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.   By clicking on a link and connecting to a ''poisoned'' Web site, the employee inadvertently permitted the intruders to gain access to his (or her) personal computer and then to the computers of a critical group of software developers at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Ultimately, the intruders were able to gain control of a software repository used by the development team.   The details surrounding the theft of the software have been a closely guarded secret by the company. Google first publicly disclosed the theft in a Jan. 12 posting on the company's Web site, which stated that the company was changing its policy toward China in the wake of the theft of unidentified ''intellectual property'' and the apparent compromise of the e-mail accounts of two human rights advocates in China.    The accusations became a significant source of tension between the United States and China, leading Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to urge China to conduct a ''transparent'' inquiry into the attack. In March, after difficult discussions with the Chinese government, Google said it would move its mainland Chinese-language Web site and begin rerouting search queries to its Hong Kong-based site.   Company executives on Monday declined to comment about the new details of the case, saying they had dealt with the security issues raised by the theft of the company's intellectual property in their initial statement in January.   Google executives have also said privately that the company had been far more transparent about the intrusions than any of the more than two dozen other companies that were compromised, the vast majority of which have not acknowledged the attacks.    Google continues to use the Gaia system, now known as Single Sign-On. Hours after announcing the intrusions, Google said it would activate a new layer of encryption for Gmail service. The company also tightened the security of its data centers and further secured the communications links between its services and the computers of its users.    Several technical experts said that because Google had quickly learned of the theft of the software, it was unclear what the consequences of the theft had been. One of the most alarming possibilities is that the attackers might have intended to insert a Trojan horse -- a secret back door -- into the Gaia program and install it in dozens of Google's global data centers to establish clandestine entry points. But the independent security specialists emphasized that such an undertaking would have been remarkably difficult, particularly because Google's security specialists had been alerted to the theft of the program.    However, having access to the original programmer's instructions, or source code, could also provide technically skilled hackers with knowledge about subtle security vulnerabilities in the Gaia code that may have eluded Google's engineers.   ''If you can get to the software repository where the bugs are housed before they are patched, that's the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,'' said George Kurtz, chief technology officer for McAfee Inc., a software security company that was one of the companies that analyzed the illicit software used in the intrusions at Google and at other companies last year.   Rodney Joffe, a vice president at Neustar, a developer of Internet infrastructure services, said, ''It's obviously a real issue if you can understand how the system works.'' Understanding the algorithms on which the software is based might be of great value to an attacker looking for weak points in the system, he said.   When Google first announced the thefts, the company said it had evidence that the intrusions had come from China. The attacks have been traced to computers at two campuses in China, but investigators acknowledge that the true origin may have been concealed, a quintessential problem of cyberattacks.    Several people involved in the investigation of break-ins at more than two dozen other technology firms said that while there were similarities between the attacks on the companies, there were also significant differences, like the use of different types of software in intrusions. At one high-profile Silicon Valley company, investigators found evidence of intrusions going back more than two years, according to the person involved in Google's inquiry.   In Google's case, the intruders seemed to have precise intelligence about the names of the Gaia software developers, and they first tried to access their work computers and then used a set of sophisticated techniques to gain access to the repositories where the source code for the program was stored.    They then transferred the stolen software to computers owned by Rackspace, a Texas company that offers Web-hosting services, which had no knowledge of the transaction. It is not known where the software was sent from there. The intruders had access to an internal Google corporate directory known as Moma, which holds information about the work activities of each Google employee, and they may have used it to find specific employees.  "
The Lock That Says 'Pick Me',"The recent computer attacks on the mighty Google left every corporate network in the world looking a little less safe.    Google's confrontation with China -- over government censorship in general and specific attacks on its systems -- is an exceptional case, of course, extending to human rights and international politics as well as high-tech spying. But the intrusion into Google's computers and related attacks from within China on some 30 other companies point to the rising sophistication of such assaults and the vulnerability of even the best defenses, security experts say.   ''The Google case shines a bright light on what can be done in terms of spying and getting into corporate networks,'' said Edward M. Stroz, a former  high-tech crime agent with the F.B.I. who now heads a computer security investigation firm in New York.   Computer security is an ever-escalating competition between so-called black-hat attackers and white-hat defenders. One of the attackers' main tools is malicious software, known as malware, which has steadily evolved in recent years. Malware was once mainly viruses and worms, digital pests that gummed up and sometimes damaged personal computers and networks.     Malware today, however, is likely to be more subtle and selective, nesting inside corporate networks. And it can be a tool for industrial espionage, transmitting digital copies of trade secrets, customer lists, future plans and contracts.   Corporations and government agencies spend billions of dollars a year on specialized security software to detect and combat malware. Still, the black hats seem to be gaining the upper hand.   In a survey of 443 companies and government agencies published last month, the Computer Security Institute found that 64 percent reported malware infections, up from 50 percent the previous year. The financial loss from security breaches was $234,000 on average for each organization.   ''Malware is a huge problem, and becoming a bigger one,'' said Robert Richardson, director of the institute,  a research and training organization. ''And now the game is much more about getting a foothold in the network, for spying.''   Security experts say employee awareness and training are a crucial defense. Often, malware infections are a result of high-tech twists on old-fashioned cons. One scam, for example, involves small U.S.B. flash drives, left in a company parking lot, adorned with the company logo. Curious employees pick them up, put them in their computers and open what looks like an innocuous document. In fact, once run, it is software that collects passwords and other confidential information on a user's computer and sends it to the attackers. More advanced malware can allow an outsider to completely take over the PC and, from there, explore a company's network.   With this approach, the hackers do not need to break through a company's network defenses because a worker has unknowingly invited them inside.   Another approach, one used in the Google attacks, is a variation on so-called phishing schemes, in which an e-mail message purporting to be from the recipient's bank or another institution tricks the person into giving up passwords. Scammers send such messages to thousands of people in hopes of ensnaring a few. But with so-called spear-phishing, the bogus e-mail is sent to a specific person and appears to come from a friend or colleague inside that person's company, making it far more believable. Again, an attached file, once opened, unleashes the spy software.    Other techniques for going inside companies involve exploiting weaknesses in Web-site or network-routing software, using those openings as gateways for malware.    To combat leaks of confidential information, network security software looks for anomalies in network traffic -- large files and rapid rates of data transmission, especially coming from corporate locations where confidential information is housed.   ''Fighting computer crime is a balance of technology and behavioral science, understanding the human dimension of the threat,'' said Mr. Stroz, the former F.B.I. agent and security investigator. ''There is no law in the books that will ever throw a computer in prison.''      As cellphones become more powerful, they offer new terrain for malware to exploit in new ways. Recently, security experts have started seeing malware that surreptitiously switches on a cellphone's microphone and camera. ''It turns a smartphone into a surveillance device,'' said Mark D. Rasch, a computer security consultant in Bethesda, Md., who formerly prosecuted computer crime for the Justice Department.   Hacked cellphones, Mr. Rasch said, can also provide vital corporate intelligence because they can disclose their location. The whereabouts of a cellphone belonging to an investment banker who is representing a company in merger talks, he said, could provide telling clues to rival bidders, for example.   Security experts say the ideal approach is to carefully identify a corporation's most valuable intellectual property and data, and place it on a separate computer network not linked to the Internet, leaving a so-called air gap.    ''Sometimes the cheapest and best security solution is to lock the door and don't connect,'' said James P. Litchko, a former government security official who is a manager at Cyber Security Professionals, a consulting firm.   Some companies go further, building ''Faraday cages'' to house their most critical computers and data. These cages typically have a metal grid structure built into the walls, so no electromagnetic or cellphone transmissions can come in or out. Defense contractors, aerospace companies and some automakers have built Faraday cages, named for the 19th-century English scientist Michael Faraday, who  designed them to shield electrical devices from lightning and other shocks.   But in the  Internet era, isolationism is often an impractical approach for many companies. Sharing information and knowledge with industry partners and customers is seen as the path to greater flexibility and efficiency. Work is routinely done by far-flung project teams. Mobile professionals want vital company data to be accessible wherever they are.     Most of that collaboration and communication is done over the Internet, increasing the risk of outside attacks.  And the ubiquity of Internet access inside companies has its own risks. In a case of alleged industrial theft that became public recently, a software engineer at Goldman Sachs was accused last year of stealing proprietary software used in high-speed trading, just before he left for another firm. The engineer, who pleaded not guilty, had uploaded the software to a server computer in Germany, prosecutors say.   The complexity of software code from different suppliers, as it intermingles in corporate networks and across the Internet, also opens the door to security weaknesses that malware writers exploit. One quip among computer security experts is: ''The sum of the parts is a hole.''   But, security experts say, the problem goes well beyond different kinds of software not playing well together. The software products themselves, they say, are riddled with vulnerabilities -- thousands of such flaws are detected each year across the industry. Several weaknesses, it seems,  including one in the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser, were exploited in the recent attacks on Google that were aimed at Chinese dissidents.   The long-term answer, some experts assert, lies in setting the software business on a path to becoming a mature industry, with standards, defined responsibilities and liability for security gaps, guided by forceful self-regulation or by the government.    Just as the government eventually stepped in to mandate seat belts in cars and safety standards for aircraft, says James A. Lewis, a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the time has come for software.   Mr. Lewis, who advised the Obama administration about online security last spring, recalled that he served on a White House advisory group on secure public networks in 1996. At the time, he recommended a hands-off approach, assuming that market incentives for the participants would deliver Internet security.   Today, Mr. Lewis says he was mistaken. ''It's a classic market failure -- the market hasn't delivered security,'' he said. ''Our economy has become so dependent on this fabulous technology -- the Internet -- but it's not safe. And that's an issue we'll have to wrestle with.''   "
"Cloud Computing Grows in Asia, Despite Political and Technical Hurdles","SINGAPORE -- The Youth Olympic Games here in August presented organizers with a formidable, but temporary, computing hurdle: Manage 3,600 athletes, 20,000 volunteers and 370,000 spectators for two weeks. Rather than buy or lease the equipment necessary to run the event, organizers rented the required computer capacity from a data center run by Singapore Telecommunications. The Games were a showcase for cloud computing in Asia: software, data storage, networking and even computing equipment on tap -- as much as a customer desired for only as long as needed.  ''In past Olympic games, they had to buy these servers,'' said Bill Chang, an executive vice president at Singapore Telecommunications, ''and then after the Games all this equipment would be fire-sold away or given away.'' Mr. Chang said that by using cloud services, customers like the organizers of the Youth Olympic Games could save 60 percent to 80 percent of the cost of purchasing the equipment themselves. The research firm IDC estimates that the market for cloud computing in Asia outside Japan will grow to about $1.3 billion this year and will continue expanding at a rate of about 40 percent a year until 2014. That figure is just a splash in the estimated $68.3 billion that cloud computing will bring in globally in 2010, according to the research firm Gartner. And for every case of avid adoption, as in Singapore, there are other countries where acceptance is hindered by regulations, concerns about data security and poor Internet connections. ''What will drive adoption is broadband penetration,'' said Emilio Umeoka, president of Microsoft's Asian operations in Singapore. ''If you don't have the pipe, you can't get onto the cloud.'' For potential customers, the savings from cloud computing are enticing. Like equipment leasing before it, cloud computing turns what once was a big-ticket capital expenditure into an operating expense for companies -- one that can be tuned up or down, depending on business conditions. ''The savings comes in infrastructure,'' Mr. Umeoka said. ''Your company would have less services, less people to manage the servers, less people to manage bugs or patches.'' What is giving Asian customers pause, though, is the same concern being voiced elsewhere: that a company's precious financial and customer data could be lost, stolen or even rendered temporarily inaccessible through no fault of its own. To many, the threat posed by hackers, possible government interference and even power failures justifies keeping their data housed on their own premises, in their own countries. As a result, cloud computing in Asia is taking off faster among small, more cost-sensitive start-ups than among larger companies. China's big state-owned businesses, for example, tend not to trust third-party providers with their data. ''The propensity to outsource in China is the lowest in the region,'' said Philip Carter, a research director at IDC in Singapore. ''It comes back time and time again in surveys to control and risk mitigation. They want to keep control of I.T. assets.'' Adoption of cloud computing in China is also held back by regulation. Beijing, which also blocks Facebook, prohibits companies from storing their data offshore, meaning they can use data centers only inside China. As a result, IDC estimated, only about 4 percent of companies in China were using cloud-based services last year, compared with 16 percent in Singapore. But with about 40 million small and medium-size companies, the Chinese market holds enormous appeal for the providers of cloud computing services. NEC of Japan estimates the nascent Chinese market will grow 30 percent a year to reach around $2.3 billion by 2012. ''The Chinese customers are more receptive to the whole way of doing business online,'' said Enwei Xie, Microsoft's general manager for software development business in China. ''They're sort of familiar with this whole host model.'' As is typical in China, local companies like Kingdee and Ufida so far have dominated the market, crowding out international firms like NEC, SAP of Germany or Oracle of the United States. Poor bandwidth access, however, is keeping China from becoming a cloud hub. That limitation also applies to India, and followers of the industry say it is unlikely such services will be outsourced to either country anytime soon. And cloud computing providers are flocking to Hong Kong and Singapore. Even India's Tata Communications is opening a data center in Singapore to offer cross-border cloud services. IDC estimates that 24 percent of all companies in Asia will use some form of cloud computing this year, up from 11 percent in 2009. Technically, Singapore is not the ideal location for data centers. Land is expensive and temperatures are high, meaning it costs more to keep servers cool. But cutting-edge telecommunications infrastructure, a pool of technology experts and generous government incentives more than compensate, executives said. Microsoft, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard have also picked Singapore as the center of their own regional cloud computing initiatives. ''We didn't set up a lab in Singapore because we wanted to do cloud computing,'' said Christopher Whitney, managing director of a new lab Hewlett-Packard opened in the city-state in February, ''but because we wanted to access its infrastructure and talent.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Step Taken to End Impasse Over Cybersecurity Talks,"A group of cybersecurity specialists and diplomats representing 15 countries has agreed on a set of recommendations to the United Nations secretary general for negotiations on an international computer security treaty.  The recommendations were finalized on Friday, after a series of meetings in New York and Geneva. They represent the first step toward ending an impasse of more than a decade between the United States and Russia over how to deal with threats to the Internet. In recent years, an explosion in cybercrime has been accompanied by an arms race in cyberweapons, as dozens of nations have begun to view computer networks as arenas for espionage and warfare. The group of specialists and diplomats was chartered by the United Nations in 2005 to explore problems in international cybersecurity. Little obvious progress, however, had been made until this week. ''This is yet another example that the cooperation in the field of cybersecurity is vital for all countries, and the U.S.A., Russia, China have been able to achieve a major milestone,'' said Veni Markovski, a representative for an international organization that oversees Internet technical issues, which is known as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann. The Russians have been trying to build support for a cybersecurity treaty that would be similar to agreements on chemical weapons. The United States has insisted a treaty is unnecessary. Instead, American officials have been trying to increase cooperation among law enforcement agencies around the world, particularly Chinese and Russian. The Obama administration released a position paper in January intended to bring the various sides, including the Chinese and Russians, closer together. The recommendations to the United Nations from the specialists and diplomats, which were released in a report, reflect an effort to find ways to address the dangers of the anonymous nature of the Internet, as in the case of the object of a cyberattack misconstruing the identity of the attacker. Among the troubling issues is the existence of ''proxies,'' which may act for one interest or nation but appear to be acting on behalf of another, according to an American diplomat who participated in the preparation of the report, but was not authorized to speak about it. ''The U.S. put forward a simple notion that we hadn't said before,'' the diplomat said. ''The same laws that apply to the use of kinetic weapons should apply to state behavior in cyberspace.'' The report recommends five steps to improve international cybercooperation and security: having more discussions about the ways different nations view and protect their computer networks, including the Internet; discussing the use of computer and communications technologies during warfare; sharing national approaches on legislation about computer security; finding ways to improve the Internet capacity of less developed countries; and negotiating to establish common terminology to improve the communications about computer networks. The signers are major cyberpowers and of other nations: the United States, Belarus, Brazil, Britain, China, Estonia, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Qatar, Russia, South Africa and South Korea.

Was the East Anglia Incident a Crime? Yes.,"July 18, 2012, 7:05 p.m. | Updated Today saw the publication of the Independent Climate Change Email Review, the last of three inquiries into issues raised by the unauthorized release of thousands of files and e-mail messages from the climatic research unit of the University of East Anglia in Britain. The incident is better known as ""Climategate"" among the community fighting restrictions on greenhouse gases or insisting that the collection of messages and files undermines the case for human-driven global warming. (See the end of this post for my views on that point.) The new review, paid for by the university but conducted by an independent panel, will look at a host of questions raised by the contents of the disclosed material, as well as the unit's approach to Freedom of Information laws and the like. But it will not get at one question that has remained unanswered through nearly eight months. Was a crime committed? The university, from the start, said its view was that it was the victim of a criminal act. A British government agency that investigated the university's handling of requests under Britain's Freedom of Information laws concluded that laws had been broken, but that was an issue completely unrelated to the question of who released the files -- and whether the perpetrator(s) acted from within the climate center or without, inside the bounds of the law or in what amounts to a cybercrime. All the while, the Norfolk Constabulary, which has jurisdiction on police matters at the university (in the city of Norwich), has been mum on the hacking or release -- as is the tradition in British criminal investigations. I asked Tuesday morning for an update on the case and Jonathan Dack, a spokesman, forwarded a reply you can read below, along with comments on the status of the criminal case from several of the scientists whose communications were prominently featured in the batch of released material.  From the Norfolk police: Norfolk Constabulary continues its investigations into the alleged criminal offences in relation to the data breach at the University of East Anglia. During the enquiry officers have been working with various specialist organizations. The U.E.A. also continues to co-operate with our enquiries. However, this is a major investigation which involves detailed enquiries which are still being followed up. It would be inappropriate for us to comment any further at this stage. [July 18, 6:59 p.m. | Updated | The Norfolk Police concluded on July 18, 2012, that the release of University of East Anglia climate files and e-mail exchanges was not an inside job:   ...While no criminal proceedings will be instigated, the investigation has concluded that the data breach was the result of a 'sophisticated and carefully orchestrated attack on the CRU's data files, carried out remotely via the internet'.] In a group e-mail message on Monday, I asked half a dozen scientists featured prominently in the climate files two questions: 1) Have you been interviewed by British or other criminal investigators? 2) Do you feel frustrated by the lack of evident police action (which is distinct from what may be occurring behind the scenes)? Here are the responses so far: Thomas Wigley, National Center for Atmospheric Research -- Yes, I have been in touch with the Norwich police. They contacted me and asked a bunch of questions. So there IS awareness that the hacking was a crime. But ... who did it? What can anyone do if there are no clues? Second, by now the cops should have figured out that this *was* a crime. They investigated the ""in house"" aspect at length as far as I can see, and have had plenty of time to figure out whether this ""deliberate leak"" option was supported by any evidence. So ... no comment on this is pretty deplorable. One problem is that this crime is way outside their areas of expertise. They needed expert advice on hacking. Whether they sought this I do not know, but my contacts with them give me no evidence that they did... Kevin Trenberth, National Center for Atmospheric Research -- 1) No I have not been interviewed by the police or [anyone] other than reporters. 2) Yes it is frustrating. It is bothersome to me that all the fuss occurred over material that was illegally obtained and noone went after those who really committed crimes, including those who misused and abused the material. Whether it was a crime or whether it was a hack that took advantage of sloppiness at U.E.A., the way the material has been used and abused is indeed troubling and unprincipled in many cases. Where are the ethical considerations? Benjamin Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was the most concise: The answers to your questions are 1) No; and 2) Yes. Stephen H. Schneider, Stanford University -- I have spoken to authorities, once initiated by them--Norfolk Constabulary -- and several times here by me. The latter with one exception were not really interested--the hate mails were saying I should be executed for treason, but they didn't threaten to do it themselves so police were uninterested.... The interested party here was State Department security, whom I notified when a neo-nazi site listed me and Santer and Todd Stern, among others with Jewish sounding last names, to a ""climate murderers"" list, pictures and all.... And when I sent all my hate emails to Norfolk some months back at their request, they bounced back with a spam filter saying ""too many expletives""! Pretty funny. I had to resend to a private address. I have heard nothing, like Tom, in months from them after a few hours of phone conversations. I think the department was security and terrorism, not white collar crimes, so maybe they keep this stuff close to the vest?? No idea. Local police here, totally uninterested. Gavin Schmidt, Goddard Institute for Space Studies and a founding editor and writer at Realclimate.org -- I was interviewed by Norwich police back in December and I sent them log files of the RC hack (which very clearly was criminal under both U.S. and U.K. law). [] As you correctly note, U.K. police work is not performed in the media spotlight as it is here (to their credit in my opinion), but of course one would have hoped for a little more progress. At this point, it is probably clear that there isn't any obvious route back to the culprit(s), and so my guess is that we aren't going to find out unless they decide to break cover in some way (possibly as a result of their disappointment in the inquiries????) []. I have no other information. I asked Schmidt whether a criminal investigation was ever conducted into the Real Climate hack. Here's his reply: It would have been up to us to report it, and I didn't think it was worth it - If you recall, we were kind of busy. ;) I think it's unfortunate that the Real Climate team did not press this case if the law in the United States is as clear-cut as Schmidt asserted. But, in his defense, he clearly did have vast challenges on his plate then, fending off heaps of unwarranted attacks and now dealing with a mountain of Freedom of Information requests (not to mention his ongoing research into climate change). Questions of criminal charges aside for the moment, the repercussions of this incident largely remain what they were when : One lesson is that anyone hoping to up-end decades of research pointing to a growing human influence on the climate by challenging a single batch of studies (in this case efforts to chart past temperatures using indirect clues like tree rings) is almost surely on a fool's errand. Another is that scientists, even when under relentless pressure, need to conduct their work scrupulously, carefully and openly and understand that transparency is inevitable in the digital era. A third is that scientists in highly specialized fields would do well to reach out for added statistical expertise when trying to test broader implications of their work. I'll be writing more in the morning, of course.   "
Job Hunting Via Facebook,"5:00 p.m.  Updated  Readers, thank you for all of your submissions. Feel free to continue to comment below, but we are no longer accepting questions for Facebook. We are sending a list to Facebook this afternoon and plan to have a follow-up post on the Bits blog early next week. Stay tuned!     As I reported on Thursday, Facebook users stumbled across a technical glitch on the Web site that exposed supposedly private information for a limited period of time.   Although Facebook moved quickly to close the security hole, the breach amplified a feeling among many users that it is becoming hard to trust the service to protect their personal information.   Part of the sentiment comes from recent changes to Facebook's platform and privacy policy that encourages users to make more of their personal information accessible to anyone on the Web.   As Facebook has evolved its approach to privacy and sharing, the company has introduced new privacy controls that give users the ability to adjust how and when their information is displayed. But the tools have grown increasingly convoluted, and many users are unsure of what information is available and to whom.   For my article, I interviewed Elliot Schrage, vice president for public policy at Facebook; he  acknowledged that there was some confusion and anxiety about privacy on the site.   As part of a larger effort to address those concerns head-on, Mr. Schrage offered to field questions from readers about Facebook's recent changes and the future of privacy on the platform.   So, readers, have at it: What are your burning questions for Facebook?   Please leave them in the comment section below. We'll send a list to Mr. Schrage and publish his responses.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
"A Little Less Privacy, a Bit More Security","SINGAPORE -- The European Union has announced that it will overhaul its data protection rules in 2011. Later this month, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Commerce Department will release their own reports on online privacy. Meanwhile, as part of the much-hyped efforts to prepare for ''cyberwar,'' the U.S. National Security Agency is strengthening ties with organizations like Google and its efforts to mine social networking sites like Facebook. The dynamic is a familiar one. As usual, privacy will lose.  In recent years, the battleground of privacy has been dominated by fights over warrantless electronic surveillance in the United States and closed-circuit television( CCTV ) in Britain. The coming months will see further debates over data mining, DNA databases and biometric identification. There will be protests and lawsuits, editorials and elections resisting these attacks on privacy. The battles are worthy, but the war will be lost. Efforts to prevent governments from collecting such information are doomed to failure because modern threats increasingly require that governments collect the information; because governments are increasingly able to collect it; and because citizens increasingly accept that they will collect it. Spying on foreigners has long been regarded as an unseemly but necessary enterprise. Spying on one's own citizens in a democracy, by contrast, has historically been subject to various forms of legal and political restraint. There were, to be sure, violations of these principles -- spectacularly culminating in Watergate and the resignation of President Richard Nixon. Such scandals reinforced the 20th-century view that foreign and domestic intelligence should and could be kept apart. That position is no longer tenable. Three factors are driving the erosion of the distinction. First, many of the threats facing modern democracies do not respect national borders. For the foreseeable future, the most significant threat of violence in countries like the United States will come from terrorists who do not have an obvious state sponsor. The targets of intelligence services will therefore be individuals rather than states. The second factor is the revolution in technology and communications. The increased use of electronic communications has been matched by the development of ever more sophisticated tools of surveillance. It has also blurred the distinction between what is foreign and what is domestic. The idea that the National Security Agency, for example, can intercept e-mail sent by foreigners but not by U.S. citizens poses -- apart from anything else -- a technical challenge: When a message is routed through strings of Internet service providers, it is not always clear what is ''foreign'' and what is ''local.'' Third, changes in culture are progressively reducing the sphere of activity that citizens can reasonably expect to be kept from government eyes. This is most obvious in the amount of information voluntarily disclosed through social-networking Web sites, as well as the increased toleration of CCTV in public spaces. It is also implicit in the use of e-mail, credit cards, and other everyday transactions where significant amounts of personal information are passed on to corporations, the government or both. Arguments over the appropriate balance between liberty and security have a long pedigree. During debates on the U.S.A. Patriot Act in 2001, one senator invoked a founding fathers: ''As Ben Franklin once noted, 'if we surrender our liberty in the name of security, we shall have neither.''' In fact Franklin's words were more nuanced: ''Those who would give up essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary Safety deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.'' More than two centuries later, the idea that we must choose between liberty and safety needs to be rethought. Instead of simply entrusting governments and other actors with personal data and relying on their good faith, the new arrangement can be thought of as a kind of social contract. In its traditional formulation, people gave a government coercive powers to make organized society possible. What we are witnessing now is the emergence of a new social contract, in which individuals give the state (and, frequently, other actors) power over information in exchange for security and the conveniences of living in the modern world. In a post-privacy world, the debate needs to move away from whether information should be collected and focus on how that information can and should be used. Reframing the question in the language of a social contract, mediated by a citizenry that is an active participant rather than passive target, offers a framework to defend freedom without sacrificing liberty. Simon Chesterman is director of the New York University School of Law Singapore Program. His book ''One Nation Under Surveillance: A New Social Contract to Defend Freedom Without Sacrificing Liberty,'' will be published in March.  "
U.S. to Reveal Some Rules On Security For Internet,"The Obama administration on Tuesday plans to declassify portions of the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative,  created during the Bush administration as a secret effort to harness the nation's defensive and offensive strategies for protecting commercial and government networks.   The announcement is to  be made  by Howard A. Schmidt, the industry cybersecurity veteran who was appointed in December as the White House Internet security adviser, at an industry convention  in San Francisco.    The declassification effort, which will not include the entire directive, will be focused on showing that the government has a clear and workable strategy for protecting the nation's computer systems, Mr. Schmidt said in a telephone interview Monday evening.   The cybersecurity initiative emerged from a classified National Security Presidential Directive signed by President George W. Bush in January  2008. The initiative was intended to unify the efforts of various government agencies as well as to develop security programs to protect the nation's computer networks. Although the budget for the program has been secret, independent estimates have suggested that it may cost as much as $40 billion over the next five years.   The plan comprises 12 initiatives, Mr. Schmidt said, and general descriptions of the 12 will be published Tuesday afternoon on the whitehouse.gov Web site. A portion of the  initiative deals with the nation's offensive plans for cyberwarfare, and Mr. Schmidt said that part  would not be made public.   ''The C.N.C.I. was shrouded in a lot of classification,'' he said. ''The president has said very specifically that we need to make sure the administration is transparent with not only the American public but with an international audience as well.''   In his first public speaking engagement at the RSA Conference, which is scheduled to open Tuesday, Mr. Schmidt said he would focus on two themes: partnerships and transparency.   ''In order to be successful against today's cybersecurity threats,'' he said, ''we must continue to seek out innovative new partnerships -- not only within government, but also among industry, government and the American public.''   Mr. Schmidt also said his office planned to appoint an official to oversee privacy and civil liberties issues.   ''I don't think there will be any surprises,'' he said. ''Much of what has been going on has been what people would expect us to be doing.''   He said that the speech would represent the moving away from strategy and toward implementation on the part of the administration in specific areas like identity management and research and development of new technologies.    ''I will talk about our incident response plan and the Department of Homeland Security secretary will also speak on the issue and go into more detail,'' Mr. Schmidt said.   He said that he would not speak specifically about Google and the company's recent revelations about intrusions that it said it believed had come from China.   He pointed to two specific initiatives as examples of the areas where the administration would try to improve cybersecurity: No. 7, which is an effort to develop a framework for international partnerships building a common cybersecurity policy, and No. 10, which is the effort to create an identity management strategy that would be able to balance the competing issues of security and privacy. Critics have been skeptical about efforts to end anonymity on the Internet, arguing that they will place limits on privacy and freedom of speech.   In his new office just a little more than a month, Mr. Schmidt said he remained optimistic about improving the nation's cybersecurity preparedness and he believed he had the right people in place to do that.   ''It's a matter of getting the sense of urgency in it,'' he said.  "
Judges Divided Over Rising GPS Surveillance,"WASHINGTON -- The growing use by the police of new technologies that make surveillance far easier and cheaper to conduct is raising difficult questions about the scope of constitutional privacy rights, leading to sharp disagreements among judges. A federal appeals court, for example, issued a ruling last week that contradicts precedents from three other appeals courts over whether the police must obtain a warrant before secretly attaching a Global Positioning System device beneath a car. The issue is whether the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches covers a device that records a suspect's movements for weeks or months without any need for an officer to trail him. The GPS tracking dispute coincides with a burst of other technological tools that expand police monitoring abilities -- including automated license-plate readers in squad cars, speed cameras mounted on streetlight poles, and even the widely discussed prospect of linking face-recognition computer programs to the proliferating number of surveillance cameras. Some legal scholars say the escalating use of such high-tech techniques for enhancing traditional police activities is eroding the pragmatic considerations that used to limit how far a law-enforcement official could intrude on people's privacy without court oversight. They have called for a fundamental rethinking of how to apply Fourth Amendment privacy rights in the 21st century.  ''Often what we have to do with the march of technology is realize that the difference in quantity and speed can actually amount to significantly more invasive practices, '' said Paul Ohm, a University of Colorado law professor and former federal computer-crimes prosecutor. ''It's like you keep turning the volume knob and it becomes something different, not the same thing just a little louder.'' Last week, such calls seemed to be answered by an ideologically diverse panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. It overturned a drug trafficking conviction because the evidence against the defendant included tracking data from a GPS receiver that the police hid under his sport utility vehicle without a warrant. The device essentially recorded his whereabouts 24 hours a day for four weeks. Traditionally, courts have held that the Fourth Amendment does not cover the trailing of a suspect because people have no expectation of privacy for actions exposed to public view. But the appeals court argued that people expect their overall movements to be private because different strangers see only isolated moments and a police department's surveillance resources are limited. GPS technology, by allowing police departments to inexpensively track someone's comings and goings, changes that equation, it said. ''Prolonged surveillance reveals types of information not revealed by short-term surveillance, such as what a person does repeatedly, what he does not do, and what he does ensemble,'' wrote Judge Douglas Ginsburg. ''A person who knows all of another's travels can deduce whether he is a weekly churchgoer, a heavy drinker, a regular at the gym, an unfaithful husband, an outpatient receiving medical treatment, an associate of particular individual or political groups -- and not just one such fact about a person, but all such facts.'' Supreme Court review of the decision seems likely. It contradicted decisions in three similar GPS-related cases by appellate panels in Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco. In 2007, for example, Judge Richard Posner argued that ''following a car on a public street'' is ''unequivocally not a search within the meaning'' of the Fourth Amendment. While acknowledging that ''technological progress poses a threat to privacy by enabling an extent of surveillance that in earlier times would have been prohibitively expensive,'' he concluded that using a GPS device to investigate a suspect crossed no constitutional line. The Fourth Amendment ''cannot sensibly be read to mean that police shall be no more efficient in the 21st century than they were in the 18th,'' he wrote. ''There is a tradeoff between security and privacy, and often it favors security.'' Judge Posner also cited a 1983 Supreme Court ruling upholding the use of a hidden radio transmitter that helped police trail a suspect. But other judges have argued that the limited power of that device make it different from the prolonged, automated tracking that GPS devices enable. On Thursday, five judges on the San Francisco appeals court dissented from a decision not to re-hear a ruling upholding the warrantless use of GPS trackers. Chief Judge Alex Kozinski characterized the tactic as ''creepy and un-American'' and contended that its capabilities handed ''the government the power to track the movements of every one of us, every day of our lives.'' There is no central repository of how many police forces use the devices, which cost several hundred dollars. But there has been a recent spate of cases about them. Several state supreme courts -- including those in Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and Washington -- have ruled that their state constitutions require police to obtain a warrant to use them. Related questions have arisen over businesses' customer records, which courts generally allow police to obtain without a warrant. The appeals court in Philadelphia is considering whether the Fourth Amendment protects location data for cellphones. The few Fourth Amendment cases involving contemporary technologies to reach the Supreme Court so far have generally stuck to the principle that privacy rights cover only actions no one else could normally see or hear. In 2001, for example, the court ruled that without a warrant, police cannot point a thermal imaging device at a home in search of heat associated with marijuana growing. Privacy advocates say the volume of public information about people that is increasingly collectable has called into question that approach. Stephen Leckar, who represented the defendant in the GPS case before the District of Columbia appeals court, argued that judicial oversight is needed over the mass collection of information like a suspect's movements, in order to maintain checks and balances. But Orin Kerr, a George Washington University professor and former federal computer-crimes prosecutor, criticized the ruling. He argued that the police need clear rules, and said it would sow confusion to require warrants for collecting large amounts of information about suspects' action in public because investigators cannot know ahead of time how much they will eventually compile -- or how much is too much. ''Police will never know whether they have violated the Fourth Amendment until some judge tells them,'' Mr. Kerr said. In other privacy contexts, courts have recognized that aggregating information can make a legal difference. For example, the Supreme Court has interpreted a privacy exception in the Freedom of Information Act as covering ''rap sheets'' compiling people's criminal records -- even though each offense was separately listed in public documents scattered through decades of courthouse files.

A Reassured F.T.C. Ends Google Street View Inquiry,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- The Federal Trade Commission announced Wednesday that it had ended its investigation of Google's collection of Internet users' personal communications by the company's Street View cars.  In a letter, David C. Vladeck, the director of the bureau of consumer protection, said that the F.T.C. was satisfied with the steps Google had taken to prevent a recurrence of the problem, including naming a director of privacy and beefing up privacy training for employees. The company assured the commission that it had not used the data and promised to delete it as soon as possible. Last Friday, Google said that its cars taking pictures of buildings along city streets, which had also checked for Wi-Fi hotspots, had collected even more information about Internet users than it had first thought last May. That information included passwords, e-mail messages and Web addresses carried on unencrypted Wi-Fi networks, Google said. Google stopped driving Street View cars in May and restarted in the summer, but without the collecting Wi-Fi data. Last week, Google also announced that it had appointed Alma Whitten as director of privacy for engineering and product management. The company will require engineers and other employees to complete training on the appropriate collection, use and handling of data and require engineering project leaders to maintain privacy documents for the products they work on. ''We are mortified by what happened, but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users,'' Alan Eustace, senior vice president of engineering and research, wrote in a company blog post. Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy group, called the F.T.C.'s decision ''premature and wrong.'' ''Once again, Google, with its myriad of government connections, gets a free pass,'' John M. Simpson, director of the group's Inside Google Project, said in a statement. The breach was first made public in May, when German data protection authorities discovered that Google's Street View cars, which take pictures for Google Maps, were collecting Internet users' information, known as payload data, over unsecured wireless networks. Google had been collecting the information in about 30 countries, and faces several investigations, including in Germany, France and Italy. In the United States, Google faces multiple class-action lawsuits over the privacy invasion. In a statement, Google said that it welcomed the news from the F.T.C. and reiterated that ''we did not want and have never used the payload data in any of our products or services.''  "
British Agency Says Google Violated Privacy Law,"PARIS -- British data protection officials said Wednesday that Google had committed a ''significant breach'' of privacy laws when its Street View mapping service gathered e-mail messages, computer passwords and other personal information without the owners' knowledge. Yet Google managed to avoid a fine, with the Information Commissioner's Office accepting a promise from the company that it would take steps to avoid repeating what it has described as an inadvertent error.  The collection of the data occurred when camera-equipped cars cruised the streets of Britain and other countries to take pictures for Street View, which enhances Google's online maps with street-level pictures. In gathering information for the maps, including the location of wireless networks, the cars intercepted communications from unsecured Wi-Fi systems. The matter is still being investigated in a number of other European countries, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission said last week that it had dropped an inquiry after Google promised upgrades to its security practices. The British information commissioner said Google had agreed to train employees better on privacy issues; to allow the agency to conduct an audit of privacy and security practices within nine months; and to delete the data it had collected in Britain, subject to legal obligations. ''The most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from Google that this will not happen again,'' the commissioner, Christopher Graham, said in a statement. Google said in a statement that it was ''profoundly sorry'' for the breach of Britain's data protection act, and said it had already been working with the information commissioner to improve its internal controls. ''As we have said before, we did not want this data, have never used any of it in our products or services and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible,'' said Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel. Some privacy groups criticized the information commissioner's action as a slap on the wrist. The agency was recently granted the power to fine companies up to $:500,000, or about $800,000, for violations of the British data protection act. ''Ruling that Google has broken the law, but then taking no action against it, shows the commissioner to be a paper tiger,'' Big Brother Watch, a London-based group that campaigns for privacy rights, said in a statement. ''The commissioner is an apologist for the worst offender in his sphere of responsibility, not a policeman of it.'' The Information Commissioner's Office countered in a statement that ''monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied, including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress -- this alone would be very hard to prove in this case.'' The agency had looked into the situation last spring, but put its inquiry on hold after concluding that only fragments of information, like incomplete Web addresses and e-mail snippets, had been collected. Google initially described the privacy breach in this way, but acknowledged last month that in some cases entire e-mail messages, passwords and other information were collected. At that point, the information commissioner reopened the investigation. Google's disclosures have heightened concerns elsewhere about Street View, which, while popular, has also prompted a backlash from privacy campaigners and some individuals. In Germany, Google said 244,000 people had asked the company to remove images of their homes from Street View prior to the recent introduction of the service in that country. Perhaps because of the legacies of Nazi and Communist regimes, Germans are particularly sensitive about privacy, but concerns about Street View are growing elsewhere, too. In Britain, for example, the House of Commons held a debate last week on privacy issues related to Street View. This week, the culture minister, Ed Vaizey, called for the development of a new code of practice to help individuals take action against Internet companies if they felt their privacy had been violated.

Google Asks Spy Agency to Look Into Cyberattacks,"Google has turned to the National Security Agency for technical assistance to learn more about the computer network attackers who breached the company's cybersecurity defenses last year, a person with direct knowledge of the agreement said Thursday.   The collaboration between Google, the world's largest search engine company, and the federal agency in charge of global electronic surveillance raises both civil liberties issues and new questions about how much Google knew about the electronic thefts it experienced when  it stated last month that it might end its business operations in China, where it said the attacks originated. The agreement was first reported on Wednesday evening by The Washington Post.   By turning to the N.S.A., which has no statutory authority to investigate domestic criminal acts, instead of the Department of Homeland Security, which does have such authority, Google is clearly seeking to avoid having its search engine, e-mail and other Web services regulated as part of the nation's ''critical infrastructure.''     The United States government has become increasingly concerned about the computer risks confronting energy and water distribution systems and financial and communications networks. Systems designated as critical infrastructure are increasingly being held to tighter regulatory standards.   On Jan. 12, Google announced a ''new approach to China,''  stating that the attacks were ''highly sophisticated'' and came from China. At the time, it gave few details about the attacks other than to say that a theft of its intellectual property had occurred and that a primary goal of the attackers had been to gain access to the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.   In reaching out to the N.S.A., which has extensive abilities to monitor global Internet traffic, the company may have been hoping to gain more certainty about the identity of the attackers. A number of computer security consultants who worked with other companies that experienced attacks similar to those of Google have stated that the surveillance system was controlled from a series of compromised server computers based in Taiwan. It is not clear how Google determined that the attacks originated in China.   A Google spokeswoman said the company was declining to comment on the case beyond what it published last month. An N.S.A. spokeswoman said, ''N.S.A. is not able to comment on specific relationships we may or may not have with U.S. companies,'' but added, the agency worked with ''a broad range of commercial partners'' to ensure security of information systems.    The agency's responsibility to secure the government's computer networks almost certainly was another reason Google turned to it, said a former federal computer security specialist.   ''This is the other side of N.S.A. -- this is the security service that does defensive measures,'' said the specialist, James A. Lewis, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''It's not unusual for people to go to N.S.A. and say 'please take a look at my code.' ''   The agreement will not permit the agency to have access to information belonging to Google users, but it still reopens long-standing questions about the role of the agency.   ''Google and N.S.A. are entering into a secret agreement that could impact the privacy of millions of users of Google's products and services around the world,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based policy group. On Thursday, the organization filed a lawsuit against the N.S.A., calling for the release of information about the agency's role as it was set out in National Security Presidential Directive 54/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 , a classified 2008 order issued by President George W. Bush dealing with cybersecurity and surveillance.   Concerns about the nation's cybersecurity have greatly increased in the past two years. On Tuesday, Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence, began his annual threat testimony before Congress by saying that the threat of a crippling attack on telecommunications and other computer networks was growing, as an increasingly sophisticated group of enemies had ''severely threatened'' the sometimes fragile systems behind  the country's information infrastructure.   ''Malicious cyberactivity is occurring on an unprecedented scale with extraordinary sophistication,'' he told the committee.   The relationship that the N.S.A. has struck with Google is known as a cooperative research and development agreement, according to a person  briefed on the relationship. These were created as part of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and are essentially a written agreement between a private company and a government agency to work together on a specific project. They are intended to help accelerate the commercialization of government-developed technology.   In addition to the N.S.A., Google has been working with the F.B.I. on the attack inquiry, but the bureau has so far declined to comment publicly or to share information about the intrusions with Congress.

Credit Card Hackers Visit Hotels All Too Often,"E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com HERE'S something that the struggling hotel sector prefers not to spotlight: it is a favorite target of hackers.   A study released this year by SpiderLabs, a part of the data-security consulting company Trustwave, found that 38 percent of the credit card hacking cases last year involved the hotel industry. The sector was well ahead of the financial services industry (19 percent), retailing (14.2 percent), and restaurants and bars (13 percent).   Why hotels? Well, to paraphrase the bank robber Willie Sutton, hackers hit hotels because that is where the richest vein of personal credit card data is. At hotels with inadequate data security, ''the greatest amount of credit card information can be obtained using the most simplified methods,'' said Anthony C. Roman, a private security investigator with extensive experience in the hotel industry.     ''It doesn't require brilliance on the part of the hacker,'' Mr. Roman said. ''Most of the chronic security breaches in the hotel industry are the result of a failure to equip, or to properly store or transmit, this kind of data, and that starts with the point-of-sale credit card swiping systems.''   The sophistication of such systems can vary widely from one hotel to the next, even within the same corporate chain, making it an easy route for hackers.   The Trustwave report said that ''organizations large and small were found to be moving forward with plans to implement new technology, while leaving basic security threats overlooked.''    Mr. Roman works with hotels to improve security technology, but he said that as the industry hit tough economic times and hotel owners cut spending, security upgrades sometimes lagged.  Proper technology security ''requires purchasing not only of software and hardware, firewalls and encryption programs,'' but training staff and constantly monitoring of transactions and data access, he said.   ''We're seeing thousands and thousands of credit cards being hacked out of hotel systems. So I would say the industry is not doing incredibly well on this,'' Mr. Roman said.    The full extent of credit card fraud by those who breach  hotel systems is unknown. But anecdotally, hacking incidents occur with disturbing regularity.    Last month, Destination Hotels and Resorts, a chain of luxury properties in the United States, notified customers that credit cards ''may have been compromised.''    ABC News reported that Destination had been victimized by ''an intense database attack that lasted over three months,'' and quoted law enforcement authorities saying that losses, which totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars, averaged $2,000 to $3,000 on each of the estimated 700 credit card numbers stolen.   Also last month, Wyndham Hotels sent customers a statement saying that a ''sophisticated hacker had penetrated our computer system'' at as many as 31 hotels from Nov.  7, 2009, to Jan. 23. Wyndham said it was improving its security technology.   It often takes months for these attacks to be discovered by hotels -- and by customers who may be on the road frequently and not monitoring card activity reports carefully.    My wife and I had separate credit cards that we used for business travel, but each account was compromised in the last eight months shortly after hotel stays. In both cases, hackers made multiple unauthorized purchases -- all for small amounts and as many as 10 in one day -- from merchants like the Apple iTunes Store.    In both cases, the total charges exceeded $400 before we noticed the fraud and called our  card companies. Fortunately, we had called  in a timely manner and were not responsible for the charges.   Fraud experts say that hackers often steal personal data and make multiple small charges to validate a card, probe its vulnerability and test the vigilance of a cardholder before making bigger charges.    Meanwhile, credit card companies are pressuring merchants, including hotels, to adopt uniform security standards.    After all, the credit card company usually gets stuck with most of the bill if a consumer notifies the company of the misuse promptly, Mr. Roman said. To guard against such problems, he advises travelers to be vigilant about checking charges online after business trips.    And one additional piece of advice he offered to hotels and travelers alike: ''Shred everything.''  "
Microsoft Puts a Time Limit on Bing Data,"Bowing to pressure in Europe, Microsoft said Tuesday that it would comply with regulators and discard all data collected on users of its Bing search engine after six months.   John Vassallo, a Microsoft vice president and associate general counsel, said the company would introduce the change over the next 18 months. The company aims to satisfy a European advisory group that had been critical of how search engines collect and retain data on individuals for advertising purposes.   The concession, relatively painless for Microsoft given its tiny share of the global search market -- just 3 percent -- is yet another example of an American technology giant's changing its way of doing business to suit stricter European concepts of antitrust and privacy laws.    The European Commission in December dropped an antitrust case against Microsoft after the software maker took the unprecedented step of agreeing to distribute the browsers of its competitors through its Windows operating system.   Unlike the agreement on browsers, which will be confined to consumers in Europe, Microsoft's decision to discard data will affect users around the world, including in the United States.   Hendrik Speck, a professor of computer science at the University of Applied Sciences in Kaiserslautern, Germany, said competitors would probably follow Microsoft's decision because consumers were increasingly concerned about online privacy amid widespread data theft and rising use of social networks.   ''Google and other engines are starting to realize that consumers around the world are placing an increasing value on privacy and that can have business consequences,'' Professor  Speck said.   Europe is the world's largest market for Internet searches, accounting for 32 percent of online queries, according to comScore, a market research company. The Asia-Pacific region had 31 percent of searches and North America 22 percent, according a comScore  report in July. Google has a 67 percent share of the global search market, according to comScore, but a more than 80 percent share in Europe, where Microsoft has just 2 percent of the market.   In 2008, a panel of national privacy regulators from each European Union country asked Microsoft, Google and Yahoo to eliminate all online query data, like a computer's unique identification number, location and the text typed into search fields, after six months.   The panel, known as the Article 29 Working Group, held a hearing with representatives of the search engine companies last February, and has given each until the end of January to respond.   Like other search engines, Bing  had been keeping user data for more than 18 months. Last year, Microsoft said it would change its policy to make an individual's Internet protocol, or I.P., address anonymous after six months if its major competitors did also.   In its announcement Tuesday, Microsoft said it would delete I.P. addresses after six months but would retain cookies and other session identifiers -- software that recognizes a returning computer -- for 18 months. Once it deletes an I.P. address, Microsoft said the link between data and a specific computer became effectively untraceable.   In a statement, Google gave no indication it would accept the  European Union's demands. The company's global privacy counsel, Peter Fleischer, reaffirmed Google's policy of making user data anonymous after nine months, saying it struck the proper balance between ensuring user privacy and refining the functioning of its leading search engine.   ''Data from our search queries represents a crucial arm in our battle to protect the security of our services against hacks and fraud,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''It also represents a critical element allowing us to help users by innovating and improving the quality of our searches.''   Yahoo, which had been deleting only a portion of individual I.P. addresses, said it would now delete the entire address after 90 days and make anonymous the log of a user's activities. The policy would not apply to requests from law enforcement agencies that data be retained, said Amber Allman, a Yahoo spokeswoman.   Mr. Vassallo, the Microsoft executive, said his company's decision to conform to European requests on data retention was meant to avert the possibility of new regulation.   ''It is possible that the European Union will take a position to regulate this one way or the other,'' Mr. Vassallo said. ''That would need a high level of responsibility from industry.''  "
A Little 'i' to Teach About Online Privacy,"A LITTLE blue symbol is carrying big implications.   Trying to ward off regulators, the advertising industry has agreed on a standard icon -- a little ''i'' -- that it will add to most online ads that use demographics and behavioral data to tell consumers what is happening. Jules Polonetsky, the co-chairman and director of the Future of Privacy Forum, an advocacy group that helped create the symbol, compared it to the triangle made up of three arrows that tells consumers that something is recyclable.    The idea was ''to come up with a recycling symbol -- people will look at it, and once they know what it is, they'll get it, and always get it,'' Mr. Polonetsky said.   Most major companies running online ads are expected to begin adding the icon to their ads by midsummer, along with phrases like ''Why did I get this ad?''    When consumers click on the icon, a white ''i'' surrounded by a circle on a blue background, they will be taken to a page explaining how the advertiser uses their Web surfing history and demographic profile to send them certain ads.   The symbol will be introduced Wednesday by Mr. Polonetsky's group and a coalition of trade groups that have been vocal about fending off government regulation.   It comes amid a fierce debate about privacy. Congress has shown interest in the subject. And Federal Trade Commission officials have been vocal, saying that privacy policies of companies are not clear or accessible enough to protect visitors, and debating whether online data is being used appropriately.   Maneesha Mithal, associate director for the division of privacy and identity protection at the Federal Trade Commission, said it was ''too early to tell'' whether the icon and phrases would work with consumers.   ''We support industry efforts to develop a consistent symbol and message that would help educate consumers about online advertising,'' Ms. Mithal said in an e-mail message. ''We hope they will share data, such as click-through and opt-out rates, that will inform the debate.''   The conversations between the commission and trade groups have become intense over the last year. The gauntlet was thrown last February, when the Federal Trade Commission warned that unless the industry wanted it to step in, it had better devise stricter self-regulatory principles.    That report inspired the project from Mr. Polonetsky and his co-chairman, Christopher Wolf.   ''One of the key points,'' Mr. Polonetsky said, was about privacy policies. ''Legalese is not especially working.''   Mr. Polonetsky's group, which is a mix of privacy officers of privacy advocates, academics and corporations, began experimenting with icons. Several divisions of the advertising holding company WPP, including GroupM, the Kantar Group and Ogilvy, helped create the icons.   ''We said, let's turn to creative people whose job it is to sell things, to communicate, instead of to lawyers whose job is to create highly accurate things that mean only what they mean and can be highly complex,'' Mr. Polonetsky said.   The WPP divisions came back with several potential icons, which were presented to focus groups. The little ''i,'' which was dubbed ''Power I,'' did well, as did an asterisk that resembled a silhouette (''Asterisk Man'').    Icons that failed included one that looked like a ''T'' in a thought bubble. (''The focus group recipients just didn't know what to make of this one,'' Mr. Polonetsky said.)   The forum also tested some different phrases to go with the icon, like ''Why this ad?''    ''The feedback from focus group users was, don't ask me to click something, tell me something and then I'll decide to click,'' Mr. Polonetsky said.    The group narrowed the icons down to Asterisk Man and Power I. Next, the WPP divisions, along with two professors, tested the icons and phrases with a panel of 2,604 Internet users to see if they remembered them and understood what they meant. Two of the phrases -- ''Why did I get this ad?'' and ''Interest-based ads'' -- did the best, while industry groups also liked the phrase ''Ad choice,'' which had done well in the focus groups.   Of course, without industry adoption, an icon is pretty meaningless. That is where the advertising groups come in.   Industry groups had already begun trying to avoid regulation and legislation when the F.T.C. report was issued last winter. The groups argued that legislation or regulation would move too slowly to reflect technological changes, and would choke Internet revenue.   In July, major advertising groups representing most name-brand advertisers and agencies agreed on new self-regulatory principles. Those included the adoption of a new, industry-standard icon that group members would run, which would link visitors to a page with information about privacy. Rather than stuffing information about so-called behavioral targeting into the privacy policy, the idea was to make the information much more visible.   There is no legal requirement that all the groups' members, which include major online companies like Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, and traditional marketers like Procter & Gamble and General Electric, along with some ad networks and ad exchanges, adopt the icon, said Stuart P. Ingis, a partner at the Venable law firm and a lawyer for the coalition of trade groups. But, he said, he expects that within a couple of months, many of the companies will begin running it, and ''you'll wind up capturing a large percentage of the marketplace.''   The Interactive Advertising Bureau, which is involved in the self-regulation effort, has already begun an online campaign to explain the behavioral tactic to consumers. Mike Zaneis, vice president for public policy for the group, said the second phase of that campaign, beginning in a couple of months, would focus on what the Power I is and how consumers are supposed to interact with it.   And, similar to recycling's role in environmental protection, Mr. Polonetsky is not expecting that his icon will immediately fix all the problems.   ''This is not the full solution, but this moves the ball forward,'' he said.    "
License Plate Software Stirs Privacy Concerns,"THE notion of roving cameras snapping pictures of license plates conjures up television shows like Fox's counterterrorism series, ''24.''    It's not just fantasy, though. Americans are already watched by a variety of security agencies using electronic surveillance technology, and in this post-9/11 world, there seems to be no turning back.    Privacy advocates, though, are not altogether comfortable with license plate numbers being electronically recorded by commercial operations.    While their views on the gathering this data may vary, privacy groups uniformly agree that the real issue is what happens to the photos after they are taken: how long they are stored and by whom; how secure the data is and whether it might be shared with third parties. Are the photographed license plate numbers matched against other lists, like credit scores or addresses?   ''It's a huge Pandora's box,'' Jack Gillis, a spokesman for the Consumer Federation of America, said. ''There are possibilities for tremendous violations if it is used to find out where people are at a given time. Until the access to this technology can be controlled, it has scary potential.''   MVTRAC, whose database of delinquent borrowers is offered on a subscription basis to auto repossession outfits, said that it stores plate numbers recorded by users for years -- and uses a high level of encryption to protect the data.    Still, with automatic license plate recognition technology now in private hands, its potential uses are magnified. As with other data streams, like records of cellphone calls or toll transponder payments, the accumulated data can be subpoenaed as evidence in court. MVTRAC and others say that repo men see personal information only when they find a wanted car, the same as they would in the faxes and e-mails they receive from auto lenders.   But invariably, technology finds other applications, said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a civil liberties advocacy group. You can imagine a scenario, he said, where someone spots a car with an attractive driver, types the license plate number into a computer program and finds the owner's name. Many companies say their data is encrypted, he said, but ''you have to ask, 'who has the key?' ''   "
Should You Trust Mint.com?,"A friend recently mentioned to me that he was considering using Mint.com but was worried whether he should trust the site with his bank account information. To take advantage of Mint.com's money tracking services, you need to enter your bank account user names and passwords so Mint.com can keep track of how much you're spending and saving. This raises the question of how safe sharing that data is and how easy it may be for someone to get that information from Mint.com and then use it to log into your accounts and swipe out your money. There's also the question of what would happen to that data if the site were ever to close, which is the fate of at least one rival site. A Mint.com competitor, Wesabe, announced late last week that it was shutting down its similar budget tracking service as of July 31. ""We were able to keep the business going for seven months after exhausting our venture backing, but did not get to profitability and made the decision to stop pursuing the business,"" Marc Hedlund, Wesabe chief executive officer, wrote to Bucks in an e-mail message. Mint.com  has recognized that not all consumers are comfortable entering all of their bank information into its site.  In fact, partly in an effort to gain more users, Mint.com recently introduced a service aimed at helping consumers reach their long-term goals that doesn't require the entering of any financial account information. So should you trust Mint.com? For answers, we turned to Mint.com's founder, consulted with identity theft and data privacy experts and found out what is going to happen to the sensitive financial data that customers have given Wesabe. Aaron Patzer, from Mint.com, said the site protects user names and passwords with the same level of security as a financial institution. Specifically, none of that information is accessible on the site and no personal identifying information other than your e-mail is linked to your account, meaning someone who had your Mint.com log-in couldn't access your bank account information. Instead, the account information is encrypted and stored on Mint.com's own servers, which are located in an unmarked building. To get into the building, Mr. Patzer said, one needs to scan his or her hand, pass by a guard and then go through a long hallway where you'll be trapped if there are suspicions about you. Inside, the servers are locked in a cage separated from other systems and constantly monitored. The only way to decrypt the user names and passwords from those servers, and to change the way the data is encrypted, is to use an encryption key that is broken up on five different smart cards carried by senior Mint.com executives, Mr. Patzer said. On a quarterly basis, Mint.com also hires ""white knights,"" i.e. good hackers, to try and break into the system and so far, according to Mr. Patzer, ""no one has been able to break into the core of our system where any sensitive financial information would be stored."" How does that system stack up? Jay Foley, co-founder of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said he would trust the site. ""Their security level is pretty decent, all things considered,"" he said, noting it was in line with the standard at financial institutions but the information could still be encrypted at a higher level on par with that of the military. Above all, however, he said what makes him trust the site is that it is owned by Intuit and has Intuit's reputation behind it. ""For them to make a boo-boo would be a serious, serious bad thing,"" Mr. Foley said. ""People would come at them."" He said he wouldn't necessarily trust another money tracking site that didn't have a big player like Intuit behind it. The bigger risk than someone breaking into Mint.com's servers and getting your information, he said, is someone at your bank leaving the information around in an easily obtainable area or someone breaking into your own computer and catching your bank user name and password as you enter into it into Mint.com. Mr. Foley said to avoid such a situation, make sure the security software on your computer is up to date, don't use the same passwords for everything and don't have your computer remember your financial institution passwords. ""The bigger threat would be the security that you have on your personal home computer,"" he said. Still, not all experts feel the same way. ""There is no doubt that it probably is very secure but anytime that you provide your information to an additional entity, you are really compounding the opportunities for your personal information to be breached,"" said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. Since no site is ever 100 percent secure, Mr. Stephens said deciding whether to give out your information was really personal, related to how comfortable you would feel doing that. He personally doesn't share his bank and brokerage account information with anyone but the institutions. ""It's an individual choice that you need to make;"" he said, adding that ""there is a trade off"" between the benefits you get with aggregating your data and creating ""the additional opportunity for your data to be breached."" According to both experts, there have been cases of fraudulent users getting others' account user names and passwords and using them to steal money from accounts. But neither was aware of any cases related to theft of information from services like Mint.com. (To be sure, it's possible that even if such breaches occur, no one would know about them. While many states have laws in place requiring that consumers be notified of data breaches, sometimes companies themselves don't know when breaches have occurred, Mr. Stephens said.) You may also want to keep in mind that there may be issues of who is liable if someone somehow gets a hold of your account data from a site like Mint.com and uses it to log in to your account. Mr. Stephens said some financial institutions may require in their contracts with you that you keep your password private and don't share it with anyone, meaning you could be on the hook for the lost money, though Mr. Stephens said he wasn't aware of this being tested in courts. Mr. Foley, meanwhile, said he thought a site like Mint.com would ultimately be liable in a case like this since it promised to keep your data secure. Finally, besides security issues, there are also privacy issues associated with using such sites. The sites are sitting on financial behavior information that would be extremely valuable in aggregate to marketers and others if they chose to sell it, an option Mr. Patzer of Mint.com has spoken about in the past. Plus, even if a site promises now not to sell aggregate data about customers, it could change the agreement at any time and go ahead and sell the data. In addition, if such sites go bankrupt, even if they currently don't sell data, trustees may decide to sell it to maximize the value of the assets. The closing of Wesabe's service may offer some hints of what would happen if Mint.com ever were to meet a similar fate. Mr. Hedlund said in an e-mail that the site had created its own hosting apparatus to store customer account user names and passwords. When it shuts down its service, Wesabe ""will delete all copies of the data including all off site backups, and will destroy the hard drives on which that data was held,"" Mr. Hedlund wrote. In addition, customers have until July 31 to download any data they want to keep from Wesabe (instructions on how to do that are here) and then the site will delete all data and passwords, including backups. In addition, Mr. Hedlund wrote that Wesabe will not sell users' data or passwords to anyone ""nor have we ever done so."" The community discussion part of the site will remain open and Wesabe is planning to open source some parts of its software so people can use it on their own computer if they want to. It would be up to those who use the open source option to keep their passwords and data secure on their own machines. ""I would not recommend anyone use the open source version unless they feel confident in their ability to do that.

Iran Worm Can Deal Double Blow to Nuclear Program,"The German software engineer who in September was the first to report that a computer worm was apparently designed to sabotage targets in Iran said Friday that the program contained two separate ''digital warheads.''  The malicious program, known as Stuxnet, is designed to disable both Iranian centrifuges used to enrich uranium and steam turbines at the Bushehr nuclear power plant, which is scheduled to begin operation next year, said the engineer, Ralph Langner, an industrial control systems specialist based in Hamburg, Germany. His analysis adds further detail to a report by researchers at the Symantec Corporation, an American computer security company, which concluded that the software code was intended to induce fluctuations in the rotational speed of motors, by taking over a power device known as a frequency converter. ''It's an awful complex code that we are looking at,'' said Mr. Langner, who has spent several months studying the program, which was discovered by a Russian antivirus company in June, after the company received complaints from Iranian customers. The link between the worm and an Iranian target was first made at an industrial systems cybersecurity conference in the Washington area on Sept. 20 by Mr. Langner. In a statement Friday on his Web site, he described two different attack modules that are designed to run on different industrial controllers made by Siemens, the German industrial equipment maker. ''It appears that warhead one and warhead two were deployed in combination as an all-out cyberstrike against the Iranian nuclear program,'' he wrote. In testimony before the Senate on Wednesday, federal and private industry officials said that the Iranian nuclear program was a probable target, but they stopped short of saying they had confirming evidence. Mr. Langner said, however, that he had found enough evidence within the programs to pinpoint the intended targets. He described his research process as being akin to being at a crime scene and examining a weapon but lacking a body. The second code module -- aimed at the nuclear power plant -- was written with remarkable sophistication, he said. The worm moves from personal computers to Siemens computers that control industrial processes. It then inserts fake data, fooling the computers into thinking that the system is running normally while the sabotage of the frequency converters is taking place. ''It is obvious that several years of preparation went into the design of this attack,'' he wrote. When asked about Mr. Langner's new analysis, Eric Chien of Symantec said the company's researchers had also seen evidence of a second attack module, but that the module was disabled in the version of Stuxnet they studied. Mr. Langner is among a small group of industrial control specialists who warned that the widespread distribution of the Stuxnet code could lead to disaster. Equipment made by Siemens and its competitors is used around the globe to manage virtually all of the world's transportation, power distribution and communications systems. Joe Weiss, managing partner at Applied Control Systems, a consulting firm based in the Silicon Valley that organized the conference in September, said he was concerned that computer security organizations were not adequately conveying the potential for serious industrial sabotage that Stuxnet foretells. ''I just want the lights to stay on and water flowing, and people not dying,'' he said.  "
"Your Financial Situation, in the Palm of Your Hand","April 15 can be a good day to reflect on all the poor financial decisions you made  the  year before  --  a financial day of atonement, of sorts. And it can be a good day to resolve to do better.   For me at least, most of those resolutions have rarely held, because  the details of my budget were never on hand when I stared at a wine list, say, or a BMW.    But now that lame excuse goes out the window.   Mobile phone apps have grown increasingly effective at giving you an at-a-glance sense of your budget, even able to alert you when your checking balance is low or your credit card balance is high, or when other critical elements of your financial life have changed.   The best of the bunch, currently, are Mint.com (free, on iPhone and soon on Android), and Pageonce Personal Assistant (free on iPhone, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile and Android, or $7 without ads), with more basic apps like BillTracker ($1) and BillMinder ($1) also worth a look.   Mint.com's great strength is that it is linked to the company's Web site, which has attracted 2.8 million registered users since its introduction in late 2007. The service, which is owned by Intuit, stores login and password information for your financial accounts, and sends  you S.M.S. or e-mail alerts when bills are due or when your credit card company changes your interest rate, for instance.   Mint.com  -- both on the Web and on its iPhone app  -- also gives you, at a glance, a firm idea of how much money you spend in specific categories.   The app's storing of login and password information might concern some people with an ear for stories about hackers outpacing Internet security experts.   Intuit's privacy and security policy, though, suggests the company is serious about protecting your data. Among other things, Intuit encrypts all communications between you and the company, and its internal data-handling policies are intended to minimize the chances that an employee can see your information.   Personal Assistant also stores your login and password information; executives from Personal Assistant's parent company, Pageonce, said they had procedures similar to those of Intuit.   For those sufficiently comforted by these procedures  -- Mint.com has about 500,000 iPhone users, and Personal Assistant about two million mobile users  -- the rewards can be substantial.    On Mint.com, for instance, when you open the app you are greeted with spending summaries divided by category or merchant, and punctuated with color graphics.   So if you aren't sure if another restaurant meal will bust your budget, it will quickly show you how close you are to your monthly limit. Likewise, if you're curious how much you spent on that cab ride you charged last week, you'll find the exact amount in the merchant category.   If you're at the store and aren't sure how much room you have beneath your credit limit, you can send a short-code text message to Mint, and it will send you the balance information for that account.   Mint.com will also refer you to financial products that might be worthwhile. If, for instance, it knows your savings account  pays only 1 percent interest, it will notify you if  you can qualify for a better deal elsewhere. Mint.com earns a commission if you bite.   Personal Assistant will start offering money-saving suggestions next month, bringing it even with Mint.com on yet another feature.   Already, the two services let you set a passcode, so you can share the phone with friends without worrying they might dig into the details about your 401(k). And if the phone is lost, you can remotely clear your financial information by logging onto the companies' Web sites.   Mint.com can sync your account with 16,000 financial institutions in the United States, and Personal Assistant says it does the same.   Some people will prefer Personal Assistant's approach to dividing account information.  Personal Assistant lets you input your login and password information for a wider range of accounts, like frequent flier programs, eBay and Amazon. So if you are a heavy user of those sites, you can check your spending history for those accounts directly, rather than, say, sifting through your credit card payments  to find Amazon transactions or what you spent on your last electric bill, as  with Mint.com.   And unlike on Mint.com, Personal Assistant lets users open new accounts with their mobile phones, which might appeal to the heaviest mobile users.   BillTracker and BillMinder, meanwhile, will appeal to those who don't want their financial information seen by anyone but themselves. But that greatly limits what you can do with the applications.   For instance, you can use the apps to input your credit card's monthly due date. Then, when you receive a bill, you can put the amount in the app and it will alert you when the bill is due. But you still have to do all the data-entry work.   If you are conscientious enough to do that for every bill, BillTracker and BillMinder will be helpful.   If, however, the sight of 1963 Chateau d'Yquem or a 2010 Z4 Roadster is enough to distract you from those pesky bill-tracking duties, you're better off elsewhere.   Quick Calls    What a difference a year makes. Last year when Palm unveiled the Pre for $200 on Sprint, it was seen as a potential iPhone killer -- especially once it made it to Verizon. Now, though, Verizon has cut the price on the Pre Plus to $50, and on the Pixi Plus to $30, both with a two-year contract. The hitch is that neither phone has  much of a following with app developers.    "
"With McAfee Deal, Intel Looks for Edge","SAN FRANCISCO -- Hoping to accelerate its move into smartphones and consumer electronics, the chip maker Intel has turned to security software and services as a way to separate its products from those of its rivals. On Thursday, Intel paid $7.68 billion to acquire McAfee, one of the leading sellers of antivirus and other computer security software. The companies, both based in Santa Clara, Calif., plan to create tight links between Intel's chips and McAfee's security technology. Such ties will be crucial as millions of products, including phones, cars and home appliances, gain more computing horsepower and access to the Web, according to the chief executive at Intel, Paul S. Otellini.  ''This will better protect Internet users and their devices,'' Mr. Otellini told Wall Street analysts. Investors appeared flummoxed by the purchase, Intel's biggest ever, sending the company's shares down about 3.5 percent, to $18.90, in afternoon trading. McAfee shares rose 57.07 percent, to $47.01. With the purchase, Intel is spending a huge chunk of the $12.2 billion in cash and short-term investments it had on hand as of last quarter. Analysts expect that other technology companies sitting on large cash hoards, like Microsoft, Apple, Cisco and Google, are primed to make more major acquisitions, though some analysts have urged the companies to give shareholders some of the money in dividends. Analysts doubted that McAfee's business would have much near-term impact on Intel's bottom line. Intel's fortunes are tied to PCs and the computer servers that go into data centers. As such, Intel, with revenue of $35.1 billion in 2009, goes through boom-and-bust cycles as demand waxes and wanes. McAfee, with revenue of $1.93 billion last year, sells a great deal of software on a subscription basis, which can smooth out financial results from quarter to quarter and year to year. ''There are no immediate synergies that I can see,'' said Stacy A. Rasgon, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''It is a strategic deal, and it is a pretty rich price for a strategic buy.'' Intel will pay $48 a share in cash, a 60 percent premium over McAfee's Wednesday closing stock price of $29.93. The deal hinges on standard regulatory approvals. Demand for McAfee's core security products should rise as people look to protect their smartphones, cars and Web-ready products from Internet threats, said David G. DeWalt, the chief executive at McAfee. Consumer electronics products like phones and hand-held gadgets face fewer threats than PCs, although it is expected they will be subjected to the same torments from hackers as they gain access to the Internet. McAfee has 17.7 percent of the market for securing computing devices, trailing the market leader Symantec, which has 36.2 percent, according to the research firm IDC. In the last couple of years, McAfee has gained ground on Symantec by signing a large number of deals with PC makers and Internet service providers to offer its security software to consumers and workers. Intel already builds a number of security hooks into its chips. These tools can help block malicious software from disrupting a computer or give a technician the ability to fix a computer from a remote location. The purchase of McAfee would give Intel access to more security specialists and the ability to hardwire more of these types of tools into its chips. Still, analysts noted that Intel spent plenty to obtain these security skills. ''Eventually the software features will get embedded in the hardware,'' said Ashok Kumar, a technology analyst with Rodman & Renshaw. ''So maybe this is an expensive way for Intel to acquire domain expertise.'' With its share price stagnant for years, Intel has been hunting for growth outside of the PC and computer server markets. In particular, Intel has decided to go after the smartphone and consumer electronics segments, which are dominated by rival chip designs. Intel's growth push has been met with resistance, largely because its chips remain more expensive and power-hungry than those of rivals. McAfee will operate as an Intel subsidiary, reporting to Renee J. James, the head of Intel's software and services group. In an interview, Ms. James declined to provide details on how Intel products would gain an edge over the competition through the McAfee technology. She has led Intel's transformation into a software powerhouse. Last year, Intel bought Wind River for $884 million, giving it a software maker that played in the consumer electronics and wireless markets. Earlier, Intel purchased Havok, a company that provided software tools to video game makers. Intel and Nokia also work together on the MeeGo operating system for smartphones and other consumer electronics devices, placing the companies in competition with Apple, Google and Microsoft.  "
Academic Paper in China Sets Off Alarms in U.S.,"It came as a surprise this month to Wang Jianwei, a graduate engineering student in Liaoning, China, that he had been described as a potential cyberwarrior before the United States Congress.    Larry M. Wortzel, a military strategist and China specialist, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 10 that it should be concerned because ''Chinese researchers at the Institute of Systems Engineering of Dalian University of Technology published a paper on how to attack a small U.S. power grid sub-network in a way that would cause a cascading failure of the entire U.S.''   When reached by telephone, Mr. Wang said he and his professor had indeed published ''Cascade-Based Attack Vulnerability on the U.S. Power Grid'' in an international journal called Safety Science last spring. But Mr. Wang said he had simply been trying to find ways to enhance the stability of power grids by exploring potential vulnerabilities.    ''We usually say 'attack' so you can see what would happen,'' he said. ''My emphasis is on how you can protect this. My goal is to find a solution to make the network safer and better protected.'' And independent American scientists who read his paper said it was true: Mr. Wang's work was a conventional technical exercise that in no way could be used to take down a power grid.    The difference between Mr. Wang's explanation and Mr. Wortzel's conclusion is of more than academic interest. It shows that in an atmosphere already charged with hostility between the United States and China over cybersecurity issues, including large-scale attacks on computer networks, even a misunderstanding has the potential to escalate tension and set off an overreaction.     ''Already people are interpreting this as demonstrating some kind of interest that China would have in disrupting the U.S. power grid,'' said Nart Villeneuve, a researcher with the SecDev Group, an Ottawa-based cybersecurity research and consulting group. ''Once you start interpreting every move that a country makes as hostile, it builds paranoia into the system.''   Mr. Wortzel's presentation at the House hearing got a particularly strong reaction from Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California, who called the flagging of the Wang paper ''one thing I think jumps out to all of these Californians here today, or should.''    He was alluding to concerns that arose in 2001 when The Los Angeles Times reported that intrusions into the network that controlled the electrical grid were traced to someone in Guangdong Province, China. Later reports of other attacks often included allegations that the break-ins were orchestrated by the Chinese, although no proof has been produced.   In an interview last week about the Wang paper and his testimony, Mr. Wortzel said that the intention of these particular researchers almost did not matter.    ''My point is that now that vulnerability is out there all over China for anybody to take advantage of,'' he said.    But specialists in the field of network science, which explores the stability of networks like power grids and the Internet, said that was not the case.    ''Neither the authors of this article, nor any other prior article, has had information on the identity of the power grid components represented as nodes of the network,'' Reka  Albert, a University of Pennsylvania physicist who has conducted similar studies, said in an e-mail interview. ''Thus no practical scenarios of an attack on the real power grid can be derived from such work.''   The issue of Mr. Wang's paper aside, experts in computer security say there are genuine reasons for American officials to be wary of China, and they generally tend to dismiss disclaimers by China that it has neither the expertise nor the intention to carry out the kind of attacks that bombard American government and computer systems by the thousands every week.    The trouble is that it is so easy to mask the true source of a computer network attack that any retaliation is fraught with uncertainty. This is why a war of words, like the high-pitched one going on these past months between the United States and China, holds special peril, said John Arquilla, director of the Information Operations Center at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.   ''What we know from network science is that dense communications across many different links and many different kinds of links can have effects that are highly unpredictable,'' Mr. Arquilla said. Cyberwarfare is in some ways ''analogous to the way people think about biological weapons -- that once you set loose such a weapon it may be very hard to control where it goes,'' he added.   Tension between China and the United States intensified earlier this year after  Google threatened to withdraw from doing business in China, saying that it had evidence of Chinese involvement in a sophisticated Internet intrusion. A number of reports, including one last October by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, of which Mr. Wortzel is vice chairman, have used strong language about the worsening threat of  computer attacks, particularly from China.    ''A large body of both circumstantial and forensic evidence strongly indicates Chinese state involvement in such activities, whether through the direct actions of state entities or through the actions of third-party groups sponsored by the state,'' that report stated.    Mr. Wang's research subject was particularly unfortunate because of the widespread perception, particularly among American military contractors and high-technology firms, that adversaries are likely to attack critical infrastructure like the United States electric grid.    Mr. Wang said in the interview that he chose the United States grid for his study basically because it was the easiest way to go. China does not publish data on power grids, he said. The United States does and had had several major blackouts; and, as he reads English, it was the only country he could find with accessible, useful data. He said that he was an ''emergency events management'' expert and that he was ''mainly studying when a point in a network becomes ineffective.''   ''I chose the electricity system because the grid can best represent how power currents flow through a network,'' he said. ''I just wanted to do theoretical research.''   The paper notes the vulnerability of different types of computer networks to ''intentional'' attacks. The authors suggest that certain types of attacks may generate a domino-style cascading collapse of an entire network. ''It is expected that our findings will be helpful for real-life networks to protect the key nodes selected effectively and avoid cascading-failure-induced disasters,'' the authors wrote.   Mr. Wang's paper cites the network science research of Albert-Laszlo Barabasi,   a physicist at Northeastern University. Dr. Barabasi has written widely on the potential vulnerability of networks to so-called engineered attacks.   ''I am not well vested in conspiracy theories,'' Dr. Barabasi said in an interview, ''but this is a rather mainstream topic that is done for a wide range of networks, and, even in the area of power transmission, is not limited to the U.S. system -- there are similar studies for power grids all over the world.''

Securing a Laptop's Data,"If your laptop happens to be stolen, as mine recently was, it can be a big hassle to protect your data after the fact. That's why it's important to know how to secure your laptop before it's gone. The easiest way to do that, of course, is simply not to keep any sensitive information on your laptop in the first place. ''I recommend you don't store any sensitive documents on your hard drive, particularly if it's a laptop, and instead store those documents in a U.S.B. flash drive and store that in a locked secure place,'' said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.  Still, with that strategy alone, it's hard to guarantee that there is not any sensitive information on your hard drive. And it may be difficult to completely keep your computer clean of your passwords and site visit history. Luckily, a host of high-tech encryption and antitheft tools now exist that can help make sure your information will be safeguarded in the event your laptop is ever stolen. First, Jay Foley, executive director of the Identity Theft Resource Center, recommended making sure any sensitive information was encrypted. ''Encryption would be like having a safe beyond a locked screen door. Thieves may be able to get into the house but they won't be able to get into the safe unless they have safe-cracking skills,'' he said. ''And if that's the case, why aren't they taking down a bank instead of bothering with you?'' In terms of encryption tools that can help you do this, this recent New York Times article, ''Safe Travels for You and Your Data,'' runs through some of the major encryption software options. Among the options mentioned, you can use BitLocker in Windows Vista and 7 and the open-source tool TruCrypt for Windows, Mac and Linux to encrypt your full disk. With encryption, Mr. Foley said, you basically set up a code and then the encrypted information will remain scrambled until you put that code back in. Still, the average consumer may need some help using some of these services. TrueCrypt ''is a very difficult program for new computer users to use,'' said one antitheft product aficionado I know, Andrew W. Chen of Los Angeles. Beyond just encryption, Mr. Foley said other software offerings, like that from The CyberAngel, combine encryption services with the ability to have your machine locked up or tracked if it's stolen. MyLaptopGPS, he said, offers similar functions as does Absolute Software, which offers a host of computer security tools. One of its tools, LoJack for Laptops, can help you track down your lost computer and remove data from it once it's stolen. According to Mr. Foley, many of these types of services use the Internet to help track a stolen laptop worldwide. This can mean, however, that you may be out of luck if the thief doesn't go online. Among other helpful sources, this recent New York Times story, ''Putting a Private Detective in Your Laptop,'' also runs through a number of the software antitheft offerings out there. According to the article, some of these software offerings try to locate the computer when it's connected to the Internet or lock it down, while others monitor how the computer is being used and take pictures of the user. Another offering is reviewed in this Gadgetwise blog post. How have you secured your laptop? What high-tech tools do you recommend? This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
WikiLeaks Struggles to Keep a Step Ahead of Hackers,"The operators of the WikiLeaks Web site are in the midst of a game of virtual dodge ball, as they battle a diverse group of hackers and try to keep their stash of once confidential documents online. The WikiLeaks site has been under attack since Sunday when it began releasing about 250,000 leaked State Department documents relating to American foreign policy. Someone portraying himself as an American patriot took credit for the first spate of disruptions to the site, a claim that security experts said was credible. Later in the week, the organization faced more widespread attacks from armies of zombie computers in Europe, Russia and Asia that try to overwhelm Web sites with floods of requests. It is unclear who orchestrated these actions, security experts said.  WikiLeaks relies on a dispersed network of computer servers to keep its information available but sought extra computing muscle after facing so many attacks. So it turned to Amazon.com, which provides a variety of Web services to help fend off the hackers. But on Wednesday, Amazon.com kicked WikiLeaks off its systems after inquiries from an aide to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut. Amazon said WikiLeaks had violated its terms of service. Then on Thursday, WikiLeaks ran into another roadblock. It was abandoned by EveryDNS.net, which is one of many companies that manage the underlying domain name system of the Internet, and act as a directory to help people find Web sites. EveryDNS.net, which provides domain names for about 500,000 Web sites, including WikiLeaks's, said the mass influx of traffic coming from hackers put its operations at risk. The result was that people who tried to visit the WikiLeaks site found an error message. On Friday, WikiLeaks began a mad dash to direct users to alternative routes to its site through Web addresses based in Europe. Given the delicate political nature of the documents released by WikiLeaks, chatter in technology circles immediately centered on the notion that a government body had spearheaded the disruptions. But security experts cautioned that the attacks were likely to remain murky because data about them had not been made public, and because it was easy for hackers to conceal their identity. ''We're at a loss as to what individuals they are and whose behalf they might be acting on,'' said Dr. Jose Nazario, senior security researcher at Arbor Networks, which provides network security technology. Still, security experts said they could glean some information about the attacks by monitoring and analyzing network traffic from around the globe. They noted that computers in eastern Europe, Russia and Thailand have bombarded WikiLeaks's Web sites with huge volumes of requests through a network of computers known as a botnet. A hacker will usually try to compromise thousands of computers through malicious software programs and then issue commands to the PCs. Creating and controlling a botnet does not require great amounts of expertise, so the people controlling the systems going after WikiLeaks could range from teenagers having fun to disgruntled technophiles or governments. ''There are plenty of possible actors out there, including mercenaries for hire,'' said Tom Kellermann, a vice president at Core Security Technologies, which advises organizations on how to find and fix security problems. A hacker who calls himself The Jester -- or th3j35t3r -- claimed responsibility for some of the initial disruptions on his Twitter account, portraying his actions as patriotic efforts meant to keep people from looking at American secrets. A former defense operative with knowledge of Special Forces activities said the hacker was a onetime military contractor who had worked on projects for Special Operations Command. People familiar with The Jester's hacking exploits said his claims involving the first wave of attacks were credible, but doubted that he had much to do with the later attacks. The Jester tended to favor a software-based hack that confused computer servers and required little computing horsepower to execute. The most recent attacks on WikiLeaks came from the botnets, which pounded Web sites with high volumes of traffic. ''The second round of attacks don't appear to fit his profile or tools,'' said Michael S. Menefee, the founder of Infosec Island, a popular forum for security experts. By Friday, WikiLeaks was directing users to Web addresses in a number of European countries, including Switzerland, Germany, Finland and the Netherlands. This was WikiLeaks's effort to solve the problems caused when EveryDNS.net dropped it. The Swiss domain, WikiLeaks.ch, is registered to the Swiss branch of the Swedish Pirate Party, a political organization that has previously worked with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks continues to distribute information from a Web site hosted by a Swedish company, Bahnhof.  "
Hacked in Beijing,"BEIJING -- The reality -- and my fears -- dawned only slowly.   For weeks, friends and colleagues complained I had not answered their e-mail messages. I swore I had not received them.   My e-mail program began crashing almost daily. But only when all my contacts disappeared for the second time did suspicion push me to act.   I dug deep inside my Yahoo settings, and I shuddered. Incoming messages had been forwarding to an unfamiliar e-mail address, one presumably typed in by intruders who had gained access to my account.   I'd been hacked.    That phrase has been popping up a lot lately on Web chats and at dinner parties in China, where scores of foreign reporters have discovered intrusions into their e-mail accounts.   But unlike malware that trawls for bank account passwords or phishing gambits that peddle lonely and sexually adventurous Russian women, these cyberattacks appear inspired by good old-fashioned espionage.   Recent probes by cyber-countersleuths at the University of Toronto have unmasked electronic spy rings that have been pilfering documents and correspondence from computers in 100 countries. A few patterns have been noted: many of the attacks originated on computers located in China and the spymasters seemed to have a fondness for the Indian Defense Ministry, Tibetan human rights advocates, the Dalai Lama and foreign journalists who cover China and Taiwan.   Although the authors of the reports were careful not to blame the Chinese, a subtext in their findings was not hard to discern: Someone in China -- maybe a rogue individual or perhaps a government agency -- has been engaged in high-tech surveillance and thievery against perceived enemies of the state.   If that is indeed happening, it would represent a new chapter in the long history of Chinese attempts to manage the foreign journalists who live and work here, who now number more than 400.   The monitoring and manipulation of foreign reporters -- the ability to keep them and their sources on edge -- would have come a long way since the days when thick-set men in ill-fitting blazers would trail correspondents to interviews, and when unmistakable clicking noises during phone calls gave new meaning to the expression ''party line.''   Perhaps most disturbing would be the anonymity of the attacks -- the prospect that we and our sources will never know just what we are facing or whom to blame.   Nart Villeneuve, a Canadian researcher who helped analyze the attacks, including an infectious e-mail message designed to dupe the assistants of foreign reporters in Beijing, cautioned there was not enough hard evidence to blame the Chinese, or at least the Chinese government.   ''The attackers tend to mask their location,'' said Mr. Villeneuve, who is the chief researcher at SecDev.cyber, an Internet security company. ''On the other hand, you have to wonder who has the time and interest to produce these kinds of targeted attacks.''   Those of us who live and work in China might be forgiven for suspicions that focus on our hosts, or at least on the legion of so-called patriotic hackers who take umbrage at our coverage and use their computer skills accordingly. While impossible to know for sure, it may have been these nationalistic lone wolves who last week shut down the Web site of the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China, the association that represents overseas journalists in China.   To be clear, the lot of the foreign journalist has greatly improved in recent years. But there is an undeniably contentious edge to our relationship with China, one rooted in history and a stubborn conviction held by many Chinese that reporters here are spies with an ability to turn a phrase. (This point was driven home recently by a friend's mother, who warned him to stay away from me lest he be ensnared by my subterfuge.)   Even if we have scant evidence, most foreign journalists have come to assume our phone conversations are monitored. We have learned to remove our cellphone SIM cards when meeting dissidents. At the office, we often reflexively lower our voices when discussing ''politically sensitive'' topics.   Is that just paranoia? Perhaps. But recent history provides plenty of examples of government intrusion into the affairs of overseas journalists and their employees. It was only in 2007 that Zhao Yan, a researcher in the Beijing bureau of The New York Times, emerged from three years of detention after he was convicted of fraud. The unrelated accusations that led to his arrest -- that he had revealed state secrets -- were based on a Times article that correctly predicted the impending retirement of a senior Chinese leader. The state secrets charge, which was far more serious than fraud, eventually was dismissed, but not before the prosecutors introduced documents that had come from a desk in the Times office -- an indication that we were never truly alone.   Even now, Western news organizations complain when their employees are called in for tea-drinking sessions with security personnel who ask about the stories they are working on.   The antagonism and surveillance, by most accounts, have become less harsh and blatant over the years. The nadir may have been in 1967, when one of the first foreign reporters allowed into the country, Anthony Grey, a British correspondent for Reuters, spent more than two years confined to a room of his Beijing home. Accused of being a spy but never formally charged, his detention was widely thought to be retaliation for the arrest of Chinese journalists in Hong Kong, then a British colony. They had been detained during a protest, and were released long before he was.   When the author and journalist Orville Schell arrived in 1975, in the waning days of the Cultural Revolution, fear effectively deterred Chinese citizens from having any meaningful interaction with foreigners, whose reputations had been thoroughly maligned by a decade of extravagant anti-Western propaganda. Mr. Schell said that the few times he wandered away from his minders, security officers would find him and escort him back to his hotel.   On one occasion, after he managed to chat up a man tending an apple orchard in Shanxi Province, Mr. Schell was pronounced sick and locked in his accommodations, which at the time happened to be a cave. Even when he managed to pose questions to pedestrians, his queries were often waved away or ignored. ''People were almost completely standoffish and unreceptive,'' he said. ''We foreigners lived in a bubble.''   Restrictions and attitudes relaxed during the reforms of the 1980s but then tightened up again after the student-led protests of 1989 ended in a violent crackdown. Nicholas Kristof, then the Times Beijing correspondent along with his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, recalls early morning jogs shadowed by a small caravan of vehicles. ''Sometimes they weren't very subtle,'' he said. ''We had lists of all the license plates of the cars that were following us.''   Although Mr. Kristof said they learned to evade some of the monitoring by sneaking out of their building through a stairwell or speaking in code to arrange interviews, he was devastated to find out that one of his closest friends, a Chinese journalist, was actually working as a government spy. ''We didn't really get used to it,'' he said of the surveillance. ''We were always terrified that a Chinese friend would get into trouble and we had some close calls.''   The Chinese government does not censor the dispatches of foreign correspondents, but the authorities can express disapproval of a writer's work by withholding visa renewals -- a not uncommon practice. In extreme cases, there is always the option of expulsion, which is what happened to a Times bureau chief, John Burns, after he was accused of illegally entering a military zone and taking pictures in 1986.   Most journalists working in China today would agree that outward signs of surveillance have decreased markedly. Some, however, say that the monitoring has become more sophisticated and subtle, which brings us back to the recent rash of hacking.   Because Yahoo will not discuss the nature of the incidents, it is unclear exactly what happened. The company informed some victims that their accounts had been breached, but declined to be more specific. Were their e-mail messages read? Were their sources endangered? They do not know.   Even if poorly understood, the intrusions have left many reporters, including myself, feeling unnerved. One reporter, a friend with many years of experience in China, said she felt violated and angry after learning her e-mail account was compromised. Even more frustrating, she said, was not knowing whom to blame.   ''I worry about Chinese friends who may have written things they could come to regret,'' she said, asking that her name and affiliation not be printed for fear of drawing the attention of freelance hackers. ''I'd be more relieved if they had just stolen my credit card information.''  "
Taking the Mystery Out of Web Anonymity,"THE Obama Administration is trying to fix the Internet's dog problem.   The problem, as depicted in Peter Steiner's legendary 1993 New Yorker cartoon, is that on the Internet nobody knows you're a dog. And thus the enduring conundrum over who can be trusted in cyberspace.   The Internet affords anonymity to its users -- a boon to privacy and freedom of speech. But that very anonymity is also behind the explosion of cybercrime that has swept across the Web.    Can privacy be preserved while bringing a semblance of safety and security to a world that seems increasingly lawless?   Last month, Howard Schmidt, the nation's cyberczar, offered the Obama administration's proposal to make the Web a safer place -- a ''voluntary trusted identity'' system that would be the high-tech equivalent of a physical key, a fingerprint and a photo ID card, all rolled into one. The system might use a smart identity card, or a digital credential linked to a specific computer, and would authenticate users at a range of online services.   The idea is to create a federation of private online identity systems. Users could select which system to join, and only registered users whose identities have been authenticated could navigate those systems. The approach contrasts with one that would require a government-issued Internet driver's license. (Civil liberties groups oppose a government system, fearful that it could lead to national identity cards.)   Google and Microsoft are among companies that already have these ''single sign-on'' systems that make it possible for users to log in just once but use many different services.   In effect, the approach would create a ''walled garden'' in cyberspace, with (virtually) safe neighborhoods and bright (cyber) streetlights to establish a sense of a trusted community.   Mr. Schmidt described it as a ''voluntary ecosystem'' in which ''individuals and organizations can complete online transactions with confidence, trusting the identities of each other and the identities of the infrastructure that the transaction runs on.''   Still, the administration's plan has divided privacy rights activists. Some applaud the approach; others are apprehensive. ''It seems clear,'' Lauren Weinstein, the editor of Privacy Journal, wrote ''that such a scheme is a pre-emptive push toward what would eventually be a mandated Internet 'driver's license' mentality.''   The plan has also been greeted with skepticism by some computer security experts, who worry that the ''voluntary ecosystem'' envisioned by Mr. Schmidt would still leave much of the Internet vulnerable. They argue that all Internet users should be forced to register and identify themselves, in the same way that drivers must be licensed to drive on public roads.   ''The privacy standards the administration wants to adopt will make the system both unwieldy and less effective and not good for security,'' said Stewart Baker, a former chief counsel of the National Security Agency who favors government-issued Internet driver's licenses.   But Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy rights group, said such criticism was unfair. He said the Obama administration had created a policy framework that will make it possible for private industry to improve privacy and security technologies.   Some members of the Internet's technical community say that the Web-of-trust approach is too little, too late to solve the Internet's security problems. The problem is no longer just about cyberspace stalkers, thieves and con artists, but about the trustworthiness of the very fabric of the network itself.   ''We're now seeing attacks on the Internet's plumbing,'' said Rodney Joffe, senior technologist at Neustar, an Internet infrastructure firm. ''If you get control of the plumbing there are lots of things you can do because the plumbing was never designed for a world where there is a lack of trust.''   The essential plumbing components are the routers, which direct traffic on computer networks. Operators of these routers -- mostly private companies -- share instructions with each other on how to direct that traffic. They trust the information is accurate. But at least three times this year, a substantial fraction of the global network's messages were mis-routed through China, potentially opening millions of users to spying or tampering. Chinese Internet engineers say the misroutings were mistakes; other engineers are not so sure.   ''If our web of trust is corrupted or penetrated or broken, I don't quite know what to do about that,'' said Vinton Cerf, a Google vice president and one of the designers of the Internet. ''That's one of the nightmares that I worry about.''   He is pushing efforts to create standards that would secure the Internet's plumbing, though those may take longer than a decade to be put in place globally. As for making the network more secure for users, he said he was optimistic and that he saw a relatively straightforward -- though not exactly inexpensive -- way to make the network more secure.   In the future, he envisions a card that each of us will carry, perhaps equipped with a fingerprint reader, that will in effect be a one-time password system. It will digitally hold all of our different personalities: who we are at work, while playing on-line games, banking and using our smart phones and make it possible for others to be sure we are who we say we are.   But Mr. Joffe said he worried that the time for such systems might already have run out.   ''Imagine what would happen if people lost trust in using the Internet: what would that do to our economy?'' Mr. Joffe asked. ''You would have to go down to your local bank branch and you'd join 5,000 other people waiting to do their banking. That infrastructure has gone away and the banks can't cope with it anymore.''  "
"E-Mail Accounts of Activists, Scholars and Journalists Hit by Hackers in China","BEIJING -- In what appears to be a coordinated assault, the e-mail accounts of more than a dozen rights activists, academics and journalists who cover China have been compromised by unknown intruders. A Chinese human rights organization also said that hackers disabled its Web site for a fifth straight day.   The infiltrations, which involved Yahoo e-mail accounts, appeared to be aimed at people who write about China and Taiwan, rendering their accounts inaccessible, according to those who were affected. In the case of this reporter, hackers altered e-mail settings so that all correspondence was surreptitiously forwarded to another e-mail address.    The attacks, most of which began last Thursday, occurred the same week that Google angered the Chinese government by routing Internet search engine requests out of the mainland to a site in Hong Kong. Google said the move was prompted by its objections to censorship rules and by a spate of attacks on Google e-mail users that the company suggested had originated in China.   Those cyberattacks, which began as early as last April, affected dozens of American corporations, law firms and individuals, many of them rights advocates critical of China's authoritarian government.   The victims of the most recent intrusions included a law professor in the United States, an analyst who writes about China's security apparatus and several print journalists based in Beijing and Taipei, the capital of Taiwan.   ''It's very unsettling,'' said Clifford Coonan, the China correspondent for Variety magazine, whose e-mail account was rendered inaccessible last week after Yahoo detected that someone had gained access to it remotely. ''You can't help but wonder why you've been targeted.''   In an e-mail exchange, Dana Lengkeek, a Yahoo spokeswoman, declined to discuss the incidents, citing company policy. ''We are committed to protecting user security and privacy and we take appropriate action in the event of any kind of breach,'' Ms. Lengkeek said.   Kathleen McLaughlin, an American freelance journalist in Beijing who sits on the board of the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China, said the group has confirmed that 10 journalists, including herself, had their accounts compromised.   Like the others, said she received a message from Yahoo on Thursday indicating that her account had been disabled because, according to an automated message, ''we have detected an issue with your account.''   She said she contacted Yahoo but has yet to receive an explanation of what happened. ''Someone is clearly targeting journalists,'' she said. ''It makes me feel very uncomfortable.''Yahoo, which in 2005 sold its China operations to the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, has faced criticism for cooperating with government security officials in the past. In 2004, Yahoo turned over data that officials used to help prosecute several dissidents. One, a journalist named Shi Tao, was later given a 10-year sentence for leaking a secret propaganda directive.   Although the company owns a 39 percent stake in Alibaba, Ms. Lengkeek, the Yahoo spokeswoman, stressed that Yahoo no longer has operational control over the China business.   Unlike Google and Microsoft, the company maintains servers in China, a factor that has driven many privacy-conscious Chinese away from Yahoo's e-mail services.   Computer security experts say infiltration of Yahoo's e-mail service once again highlights the challenges that Internet companies face in protecting their customers from hackers.   Paul Wood, a senior analyst at the Symantec Corporation, said a growing number of malignant viruses were tailored to specific recipients, with the goal of tricking them into opening attachments that would insert malware onto their computers. Mr. Wood said his company, which designs anti-virus software, now blocks about 60 such attacks each day, up from 1 or 2 a week in 2005. ''They're very well crafted and extremely damaging,'' he said.   A report issued by Symantec on Monday found that nearly 30 percent of attacks originated from computers in China; about 20 percent of those came from Shaoxing, a relatively obscure city in Zhejiang Province previously known for winemaking.   Mr. Wood and other experts point out that attacks appearing to come from a certain location can just as easily be emanating from computers infected with botnets, a virus that allows them be controlled remotely by other computing systems.   It is this kind of rogue software that is probably responsible for crippling the Web site of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a group that has been an assertive critic of China's human rights violations. Since last Thursday, the group's Chinese-language site has been overwhelmed by hackers flooding it with junk requests, a tactic known as denial of service. Although the site has been attacked before, the attacks did not last more than a few hours.   Renee Xia, the international director for the human rights group, said the assault began the same day the American company that is host to its site, Go Daddy, announced that it would stop registering domain names in China. ''Maybe it's a coincidence, but we don't think so,'' Ms. Xia said.   Google Finds New Cyberattack   SAN FRANCISCO -- Google said Tuesday that it had discovered a cyberattack aimed at Vietnamese Internet users around the world. The attack was less sophisticated than those that originated in China and appeared to be aimed at Chinese human rights activists.   Google said the attack may have infected the computers of tens of thousands of people who downloaded Vietnamese keyboard language software.  "
"How Privacy Can Vanish Online, a Bit at a Time","If a stranger came up to you on the street, would you give him your name, Social Security number and e-mail address?   Probably not.    Yet people often dole out all kinds of personal information on the Internet that allows such identifying data to be deduced. Services like Facebook, Twitter and Flickr are oceans of personal minutiae -- birthday greetings sent and received, school and work gossip, photos of family vacations, and movies watched.    Computer scientists and policy experts say that such seemingly innocuous bits of self-revelation can increasingly be collected and reassembled by computers to help create a picture of a person's identity, sometimes down to the Social Security number.     ''Technology has rendered the conventional definition of personally identifiable information obsolete,'' said Maneesha Mithal, associate director of the Federal Trade Commission's privacy division. ''You can find out who an individual is without it.''   In a class project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that received some attention last year, Carter Jernigan and Behram Mistree analyzed more than 4,000 Facebook profiles of students, including links to friends who said they were gay. The pair was able to predict, with 78 percent accuracy, whether a profile belonged to a gay male.   So far, this type of powerful data mining, which relies on sophisticated statistical correlations, is mostly in the realm of university researchers, not identity thieves and marketers.    But the F.T.C. is worried that rules to protect privacy have not kept up with technology. The agency is convening on Wednesday the third of three workshops on the issue.   Its concerns are hardly far-fetched. Last fall, Netflix awarded $1 million to a team of statisticians and computer scientists who won a three-year contest to analyze the movie rental history of 500,000 subscribers and improve the predictive accuracy of Netflix's recommendation software by at least 10 percent.    On Friday, Netflix said  that it was shelving plans for a second contest -- bowing to privacy concerns raised by the F.T.C. and a private litigant. In 2008, a pair of researchers at the University of Texasshowed  that the customer data released for that first contest, despite being stripped of names and other direct identifying information, could often be ''de-anonymized'' by statistically analyzing an individual's distinctive pattern of movie ratings and recommendations.   In social networks, people can increase their defenses against identification by adopting tight privacy controls on information in personal profiles. Yet an individual's actions, researchers say, are rarely enough to protect privacy in the interconnected world of the Internet.   You may not disclose personal information, but your online friends and colleagues may do it for you, referring to your school or employer, gender, location and interests. Patterns of social communication, researchers say, are revealing.   ''Personal privacy is no longer an individual thing,'' said Harold Abelson, the computer science professor at M.I.T.  ''In today's online world, what your mother told you is true, only more so: people really can judge you by your friends.''   Collected together, the pool of information about each individual can form a distinctive ''social signature,'' researchers say.   The power of computers to identify people from social patterns alone was demonstrated last year in a study by the same pair of researchers that cracked Netflix's anonymous database: Vitaly Shmatikov, an associate professor of computer science at the University of Texas, and Arvind Narayanan,  now a  researcher at Stanford University.   By examining correlations between various online accounts, the scientists showed that they could identify more than 30 percent of the users of both Twitter, the microblogging service, and Flickr, an online photo-sharing service, even though the accounts had been stripped of identifying information like account names and e-mail addresses.   ''When you link these large data sets together, a small slice of our behavior and the structure of our social networks can be identifying,'' Mr. Shmatikov said.     Even more unnerving to privacy advocates is the work of two researchers from Carnegie Mellon University. In a paper published last year, Alessandro Acquisti and Ralph Gross reported that they could accurately predict the full, nine-digit Social Security numbers for 8.5 percent of the people born in the United States between 1989 and 2003 -- nearly five million individuals.    Social Security numbers are  prized by identity thieves because they are used both as identifiers and to authenticate  banking, credit card and other transactions.   The Carnegie Mellon researchers used publicly available information from many sources, including profiles on social networks, to narrow their search for two pieces of data crucial to identifying people -- birthdates and city or state of birth.    That helped them figure out the first three digits of each Social Security number, which the government had assigned by location. The remaining six digits had been assigned through methods the government didn't disclose, although they were related to when the person applied for the number. The researchers used projections about those applications as well as other public data, like the Social Security numbers of dead people, and then ran repeated cycles of statistical correlation and inference to partly re-engineer the government's number-assignment system.   To be sure, the work by Mr. Acquisti and Mr. Gross suggests a potential, not actual, risk. But unpublished research by them  explores how criminals could use similar techniques  for large-scale identity-theft  schemes.   More generally, privacy advocates worry that the new frontiers of data collection, brokering and mining, are largely unregulated. They fear ''online redlining,'' where  products and services are offered to some consumers and not others based on statistical inferences and predictions about individuals and their behavior.   The F.T.C. and Congress are weighing  steps like tighter industry requirements  and the creation of a ''do not track'' list, similar to the federal ''do not call'' list,  to stop online monitoring.   But Jon Kleinberg, a professor of computer science at Cornell University who studies social networks, is skeptical that rules will have much impact. His advice: ''When you're doing stuff online, you should behave as if you're doing it in public -- because increasingly, it is.''  "
A Wide Call To Improve Web Privacy,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A broad coalition of technology companies, including AT&T, Google and Microsoft, and advocacy groups from across the political spectrum said Tuesday that it would push Congress to strengthen online privacy laws to protect private digital information from government access.   The group, calling itself the Digital Due Process coalition, said it wanted to ensure that as millions of people moved private documents from their filing cabinets and personal computers to the Web, those documents remained protected from easy access by law enforcement and other government authorities.    The coalition, which includes the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy and Technology, wants law enforcement agencies to use a search warrant approved by a judge or a magistrate rather than rely on a simple subpoena from a prosecutor to obtain a citizen's online data.    The group also said that it wanted to safeguard location-based information collected by cellphone companies and applications providers.   Members of the group said that they would lobby Congress for an update to the current law, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which was written in 1986, nearly a decade before Internet use became mainstream. They acknowledged that some proposals were likely to face resistance from law enforcement agencies and the Obama administration.   Under a proposed set of principles, law enforcement agencies or other government representatives would have to obtain a search warrant based on a showing of probable cause before they could obtain a person's e-mail, photos or other electronic documents stored in a service like Gmail, Flickr or Facebook. Under current law, much of that information is accessible through a simple subpoena, which can be issued under looser rules.    Obtaining access to information about where people are located or the places they have visited would be protected under the same standard. Currently, courts are divided on whether access to location information requires a warrant or a subpoena.    Advocates of the changes said that the new rules were merely intended to ensure that protections that Americans have enjoyed in the past remain in place as technology evolves.    ''The U.S. Constitution protects data in your home and on your PC very strongly,'' said Mike Hintze, an associate general counsel at Microsoft.    ''We don't believe that the balance between privacy and law enforcement should be fundamentally turned on its head,'' Mr. Hintze added, simply because people now choose to store documents online rather than in their homes.    Members of the coalition acknowledged they would probably face resistance. This year, Justice Department lawyers argued in court that cellphone users had given up the expectation of privacy about their location by voluntarily giving that information to carriers. The coalition said it expected a long debate before Congress agrees to change the law.    ''We are not expecting that these will be enacted this year,'' said Jim Dempsey, vice president for public policy at the Center for Democracy and Technology. ''But it is time to begin the dialog.''   Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said he welcomed the work of the coalition and planned to hold hearings on the issue. ''While the question of how best to balance privacy and security in the 21st century has no simple answer, what is clear is that our federal electronic privacy laws are woefully outdated,'' he said in a statement.   The coalition said that the new principles would not affect the access of private digital information for national security purposes. And they would not affect the use of personal information for commercial purposes, like marketing, a mounting source of concern among users.    Some privacy advocates welcomed the proposals but said that they hoped that Congress would consider broader protections.    ''We also need some consumer protections against private data being reused for commercial purposes,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.    While some earlier coalitions between industry and advocacy groups have failed in their efforts to promote changes in privacy law, Digital Due Process is remarkable for its breadth. While it includes groups often affiliated with left-leaning causes, like the A.C.L.U. and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, it also has libertarian groups like the Progress and Freedom Foundation and the Competitive Enterprise Institute.    The coalition includes rivals, like Google and AT&T, and court adversaries. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, for example, is involved in longstanding class-action lawsuit against AT&T over the company's participation in a plan by the National Security Agency to monitor the private communications of consumers.    Kevin Bankston, a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that members of the coalition disagreed on several issues, but he added, ''We can all agree that this area of the law needs to be updated to reflect changes in technology.''  "
Dial-Up Law in a Broadband World,"The Internet has given the government powerful 21st-century tools for invading people's privacy and monitoring their activities, but the main federal law governing online privacy is a 20th-century relic. Adopted in 1986, it has had trouble keeping up with technological advances and is now badly out of date.    Congress has not moved to fix this problem, but a surprising coalition of major technology companies and civil liberties advocates have produced a blueprint for updating the law and both houses of Congress are poised to hold hearings. Having lawmakers proclaim their concern and ask learned questions will not be enough. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act is long past due for an upgrade.   Privacy is central to American law. And in 1986, Congress applied that principle to electronic communications by setting limits on law enforcement access to Internet and wireless technologies. It was a laudable law at the time, but cellphones were still oddities, the Internet was mostly a way for academics and researchers to exchange data and the World Wide Web that is an everyday part of most Americans' lives did not exist.   The law is no longer comprehensive enough to cover the many kinds of intrusions made possible by the advances of the past 24 years. In the absence of strong federal law, the courts have been adrift on many important Internet privacy issues. The law is not clear on when search warrants are required for the government to read stored e-mail, what legal standards apply to GPS technology that tracks people's whereabouts in real time and other critical questions.   Digital Due Process -- a coalition that includes Google, Microsoft, the Center for Democracy and Technology and the American Civil Liberties Union -- recently proposed a good set of principles for addressing those issues. The coalition recommends that all private data not voluntarily made public, such as stored e-mail or private financial data, should be as protected as data in a person's home. To get it, the government should need a search warrant.   For locational data -- information about where a person has physically been, or currently is -- the coalition also recommends that a search warrant be required. That would clear up a murky area of the law in which courts have reached different conclusions about information obtained through GPS devices, cellphone towers and other technologies.    The coalition argues that when federal law authorizes a subpoena for customer data, it should be limited to information about a particular individual or individuals. This would prevent fishing expeditions, such as a request for data on everyone who visited a particular Web site on a given day.   The coalition's recommendations do not address other important Internet privacy issues that involve the ability of private companies to monitor and record their users' behavior. They also sidestep questions about how accessible data should be to private litigants, such as one company suing another. The recommendations do not include requirements that companies report on the personal data they are collecting and storing -- a kind of transparency that customers should be entitled to.   Despite that, the Digital Due Process has gotten this much-needed discussion off to a strong start and set the bar high for hearings by the Senate and House Judiciary Committees.  "
A Candidate Shaped in Crucible of Facebook and Privacy Issues,"Chase Davis covers money and politics for California Watch, a project of the nonprofit, independent Center for Investigative Reporting. Chris Kelly made a relatively abrupt entry into California politics. Mr. Kelly, a former Facebook executive, decided to run for attorney general less than a year ago, and since then has pumped nearly $10 million into his largely self-financed campaign.   High-tech politicians are not much of a novelty these days, especially in California's June primaries. Carly Fiorina, a Republican candidate for the Senate, was chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, the hardware giant founded in 1939 in a Palo Alto garage. And Meg Whitman and Steve Poizner, Republican candidates for governor, both led companies that came out on the right side of the 1990s dot-com boom. But whereas Ms. Fiorina and Ms. Whitman in particular have drawn on their corporate backgrounds to craft images as experienced executives, Mr. Kelly, a Democrat, springs from a corner of the technology world that is only now beginning to flex its political muscle: the young, trendy social media companies that are starting to define the newest generation of Silicon Valley.   The lightly regulated world of social media has created highly publicized privacy and security controversies for companies like Facebook, Google and others that collect and disseminate huge amounts of personal data from millions of users worldwide.    Bringing order to that Wild West environment has given candidates like Mr. Kelly, formerly Facebook's chief privacy officer, a chance to work on policy making long before they hold elected office. But social media companies like Facebook also sit at the heart of intense debates over online privacy.   Mr. Kelly's campaign will be a litmus test for how these privacy issues resonate with the public in the political arena, and also for other executives who may consider running for public office rate the strengths and vulnerabilities of a background in social media companies.   In Mr. Kelly's case, the office he is seeking throws the questions into particularly high relief.    ''The irony here is that he's running for A.G., which presumably among other things is supposed to protect privacy and civil liberties,'' said Larry Gerston, a political science professor at San Jose State University, ''and he comes from an environment that opens all that stuff up.''    In many ways, Mr. Kelly typifies the youth and ambition that characterize the start-up culture. A 39-year-old, Harvard-educated lawyer, he worked during his 20s as an aide in Bill Clinton's presidential campaign and later moved back home to Silicon Valley to advise start-ups on privacy and intellectual property law.   In 2005, he began his job as general counsel and chief privacy officer at Facebook, where he was quickly given the task of sorting out privacy and security concerns for the site's rapidly increasing user base, which grew to 400 million earlier this year, from 5.5 million in 2005.    Mr. Kelly has often made the case that his work prepared him for being attorney general, saying in an interview that he was grateful to ''work on these issues as the Internet was moving in a different direction.''   Much of that work involved collaborating with privacy regulators, including a nationwide group of attorneys general and officials overseas, to establish safeguards related to privacy and sexual predators.   Those issues overlap with the responsibility of the California attorney general's office, which also investigates identity theft and can influence policy related to online crime -- concerns Facebook has dealt with firsthand.   The company was notably humbled in 2007, when an undercover investigation by Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York found that the site lagged in responding to complaints about sexual predators and failed to filter pornographic content, despite making claims to the contrary.   During the sting operation, the investigators crafted a suggestive conversation between a fake sexual predator and a fake 13-year-old girl, and then, acting as the girl's mother, filed complaints about the exchange. It took Facebook at least 10 days to respond.    Mr. Cuomo's office filed a subpoena and warned that the company could face charges of consumer fraud for exaggerating the effectiveness of its security measures.    Facebook settled the case within three weeks, agreeing to speed its response time for complaints about sexual content and harassment. Mr. Cuomo praised its cooperation, as did advocacy groups with a stake in the issue.   In an interview, Mr. Kelly acknowledged that Facebook's transformation from college curiosity to worldwide phenomenon left the company sometimes struggling to address problems.   ''With the rapid growth,'' he said, ''we were actually frustrated at times with the level of response to the complaints we had.''   Still, he has framed the case as a victory, highlighting Facebook's quick reaction and subsequent collaboration with Mr. Cuomo's office to design laws making it easier to track and regulate sex offenders online.    Victims rights groups involved in the issue gave Facebook credit as well, emphasizing the company's response rather than its failure to prevent the incidents in the first place.   In recent weeks, Mr. Kelly's opponents -- particularly the campaign of Kamala Harris, San Francisco's district attorney -- have questioned whether Mr. Kelly has implicitly acknowledged vulnerabilities by distancing himself from his role in Facebook's major privacy decisions, a contention the Kelly campaign denies. Mr. Kelly has styled his profession as ''attorney/businessman'' on the ballot and in recent months has favored more general titles like ''legal counsel'' in press releases and political ads when describing his duties at Facebook, rather than ''chief privacy officer,'' which he often used earlier in the campaign.   Mr. Kelly said the shift reflected the campaign's efforts to align his public descriptions with his official ballot designation. Ballot designations cannot contain company names and are typically limited to three words, which would prohibit a title like ''Facebook chief privacy officer.''   Lawsuits and public complaints about Facebook's privacy changes have made headlines for years, and this campaign season has been no different.   Last month, several United States senators, including Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, sent a letter to Facebook expressing concerns over how new developments at the company could expose users' personal data to third-party Web sites without the users' consent.   The Kelly campaign pivoted quickly, releasing a statement to separate the candidate from the controversy.   ''Facebook's recent changes to its privacy policy and practices with regard to data sharing occurred after I left the company,'' Mr. Kelly's statement read. ''I strongly encourage Facebook to structure all its programs to allow Facebook users to give permission before their information is shared with third parties.''   Even during Mr. Kelly's tenure, Facebook was no stranger to privacy controversies, both in the United States and abroad.   Last summer, for example, Canada's privacy commissioner, Jennifer Stoddart, raised concerns over how the site shared personal information.   ''It's clear that privacy issues are top of mind for Facebook,'' Ms. Stoddart said in a July 2009 statement, ''and yet we found serious privacy gaps in the way the site operates.''    Mr. Kelly said many of the complaints Facebook had received about privacy reflected a disconnect between the privacy views of regulators and those of the company.   Regulators, he said, often see privacy as tantamount to secrecy, arguing that personal information should be closed. Facebook's philosophy, and his own, is that sharing some information is beneficial as long as it is properly controlled.   ''There are quite a number of regulators around the world who don't have that perspective,'' Mr. Kelly said.    "
Marketers Can Glean Private Data On Facebook,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Online advertising offers marketers the chance to aim ads at very specific groups of people -- say, golf players in Illinois who make more than $150,000 a year and vacation in Hawaii. But two recent academic papers show some potential pitfalls of such precise tailoring. Both papers focus on Facebook ads and show that in certain circumstances, advertisers -- or snoops posing as advertisers -- may be able to learn sensitive profile information, like a person's sexual orientation or religion, even if the person is sharing that information only with a small circle of friends. Facebook does not share such information with advertisers.  The papers come amid an intense focus on vulnerabilities in Facebook's privacy safeguards. In one paper, researchers from Microsoft in India and the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Germany found that it was possible for an advertiser to find the stated sexual preference of Facebook users. The researchers created six nearly identical Facebook accounts, three for men and three for women. The one significant difference was that in one account for each gender, the profile specified that the user was ''interested in'' people of the same sex. Not surprisingly, the different accounts were shown different ads, because advertisers can specify what types of people they want to reach on the site. In particular, the accounts that appeared to belong to gay people received ads for things like gay bars. But the researchers also found that the gay profiles were shown ads that were not shown to straight people and had no obvious connection to sexual preference -- like those for a nursing degree at a medical college in Florida, which appeared exclusively in the gay man's account. If users click on such an ad and visit the advertiser's site, they are essentially revealing to the advertiser that they are gay. ''The danger with such ads, unlike the gay bar ad where the target demographic is blatantly obvious, is that the user reading the ad text would have no idea that by clicking it he would reveal to the advertiser both his sexual preference and a unique identifier,'' the researchers wrote. The researchers did not seek evidence that any advertiser actually employed this technique. What's more, the identifier -- typically a cookie or a computer's Internet address -- does not necessarily disclose the identity of the person who clicked. But privacy experts said an advertiser could potentially obtain the name in other ways and link it to the user's sexual orientation, perhaps by asking the person to sign up for a newsletter or fill out a form. ''This is yet another example that there are privacy landmines built into Facebook,'' said Christopher Soghoian, a privacy advocate and research fellow at the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research at Indiana University. ''Even if the company is trying to do the right thing, when they have this many users, they are going to be a target for bad guys.'' Mr. Soghoian said that other advertising systems may have similar problems, but that most online ad systems do not allow ads aimed at sensitive characteristics like sexual orientation. A Facebook spokesman, Barry Schnitt, defended the company's system and said its guidelines prohibit advertisers from collecting any data about users that is obtained by running ads on the site. He also suggested that the ads for the nursing school violated its policies, because the company requires ''that targeting of ads based on a user attribute be directly relevant to the offer in the advertisement.'' In a separate study, Aleksandra Korolova, a researcher at Stanford, said she was able to find the age and sexual orientation of specific Facebook users by tailoring certain ads to their profiles. She said an attacker could use the technique to find other profile information that was not public, including relationship status and political and religious affiliation. She also said that the technique could be used on other social networks or Web sites, like Google and MySpace. In her paper, Ms. Korolova said she used public sources to collect information like the location, gender, age and interests of a Facebook user. Then she placed an ad on Facebook that was aimed at those characteristics and also to people who are interested in people of the same sex. If Facebook's system indicated that the ad had been displayed to someone, she would know that the person was gay, because nobody else on Facebook was a match for those other attributes. (For ethical reasons, she used the profile of a friend in her experiment.) In an interview, Ms. Korolova said she alerted Facebook to the issue in July. Facebook responded by changing its system so that if an advertiser's targeting criteria is so precise that fewer than 20 people would see the ad, it is not allowed. But Ms. Korolova said she could, in theory, circumvent that measure by creating 20 profiles to match the known characteristics of the person whose information she is trying to uncover, and then staying out of those accounts once the ad was placed. Facebook disputed that, saying that its terms of service prohibit fake accounts and that it works hard to eliminate them. It said that if someone quickly created 20 similar accounts, its automated systems would detect them. ''We are confident that our techniques address the practical concerns of the privacy violations Aleksandra discusses,'' the company said in a statement. Mr. Soghoian said it was unlikely the attack described by Ms. Korolova could be used widely, but said it exposed yet another vulnerability in online networks. Earlier this week, in response to an article in The Wall Street Journal, Facebook acknowledged that many popular applications on its site had improperly shared identifying information about users, and in some cases about their friends, with advertisers and Web tracking companies. On Friday, MySpace acknowledged similar problems. It said that it had leaked some personal information to advertisers and that applications running on its site had also shared such information with third parties, in violation of its policies.  "
"Don't Look, Don't Read: Government Warns Its Workers Away From WikiLeaks Documents","WASHINGTON -- In a classic case of shutting the barn door after the horse has left, the Obama administration and the Department of Defense have ordered the hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contractors not to read the secret cables and other classified documents published by Wikileaks and news organizations around the world unless the workers have the required security clearance or authorization.  ''Classified information, whether or not already posted on public websites or disclosed to the media, remains classified, and must be treated as such by federal employees and contractors, until it is declassified by an appropriate U.S. Government authority,'' said the notice sent on Friday afternoon by the Office of Management and Budget, which is part of the White House, to agency and department heads, urging them to distribute it to their staff. The directive applies to both government computers and private devices that employees or contractors might carry in their briefcases and pockets or have in their homes. It does not advise agencies to block WikiLeaks or other websites on government computer systems, a White House official said Saturday. And it does not prohibit federal employees from reading news stories about the topic. But if they have ''accidentially'' already downloaded any of these documents, they are being told to notify their ''information security offices.'' The Department of Defense, in its own directive to military personnel and icontractors, says that simply reading these documents, without proper authorization, will violate long-standing rules even though they are accessible to the public at large on Internet sites. ''Viewing or downloading still classified documents from unclassified government computers creates a security violation,'' a spokeswoman said in a statement on Saturday. The effort, while understandable, seems entirely futile, said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington nonprofit group that has combated government efforts to keep certain government documents secret. ''It just may be a little too late for the government to push these documents down the memory hole,'' Mr. Rotenberg said, adding that his center did not support the initial public release of the material. ''This is Orwell thought police in the age of the Internet, as these are already so widely accessible on servers around the world.''The Library of Congress has joined in the push, blocked visitors to its reading rooms, or anyone else using its computer system, from accessing the WikiLeaks site, noting that ''unauthorized disclosures of classified documents do not alter the documents' classified status or automatically result in declassification of the documents.'' The moves have not apparently discouraged staff at WikiLeaks, as the organization continues to post Twitter feeds mocking the efforts to limit access to the documents, including one note on Saturday reading: ''Digital McCarthyism: U.S. Military Tries to Intimidate Soldiers Into Not Reading Wikileaks''.  "
A Call for a Federal Office to Guide Online Privacy,"A Commerce Department task force called for the creation of a ''Privacy Bill of Rights'' for online consumers and the establishment of an office within the department that would work to strengthen privacy policies in the United States and coordinate initiatives with other countries. The department's Internet Policy Task Force, in a report released on Thursday, said the ''Privacy Bill of Rights'' would increase transparency on how user information was collected online, place limits on the use of consumer data by companies and promote the use of audits and other forms of enforcement to increase accountability.  The new protections would expand on the framework of Fair Information Practice Principles that address data security, notice and choice -- or the privacy policies many users agree to on Web sites -- and rights to obtaining information on the Internet. ''The simple concept of notice and choice is not adequate as a basis for privacy protections,'' said Daniel J. Weitzner, the associate administrator for the office of policy analysis and development at the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Consumer and privacy advocates said they were encouraged by the idea to expand on the fair practice principles. The report comes at a time when Internet privacy is a big priority in Washington with the release of a similar report by the Federal Trade Commission this month, the establishment of a White House subcommittee on privacy and Internet policy and the pending revision of the privacy directive of the European Union. The F.T.C., in its report on online privacy this month, also called for improvements to the practice principles, but focused on installing a ''do not track'' mechanism that would allow computer users to opt out of having their information collected surreptitiously by third-party companies. That recommendation caused concern in the online advertising industry, which has said that such a mechanism would hamper the industry's growth and could potentially limit users' access to free content online. The task force report made little mention of a ''do not track'' option, but its members did recommend the creation of voluntary codes of conduct that would address emerging technologies and issues not covered by an expanded set of practice principles. The codes would be created by technology companies in the industry and would be approved by the Federal Trade Commission. The new Privacy Policy Office proposed by the task force would work with the administration, the F.T.C. and other agencies on issues surrounding international and commercial data privacy issues. The office would not have enforcement authority. ''America needs a robust privacy framework that preserves consumer trust in the evolving Internet economy while ensuring the Web remains a platform for innovation, jobs and economic growth,'' the commerce secretary, Gary F. Locke, said in a statement. ''Self-regulation without stronger enforcement is not enough. Consumers must trust the Internet in order for businesses to succeed online.'' During a conference call after the announcement, however, representatives from the World Privacy Forum, the Consumer Federation of America and other organizations said they were concerned that a privacy policy office would be part of the Commerce Department and not an independent agency. The report recommends that the F.T.C. remain the lead enforcement agency for consumer privacy issues. It also recommends that the United States continue to discuss privacy frameworks with other countries. ''Today's report is a road map for considering a new framework that is good for consumers and businesses,'' Mr. Locke said. ''And while our primary goal is to update the domestic approach to online privacy, we are optimistic that we can take steps to bridge the different privacy approaches among countries, which can help us increase the export of U.S. services and strengthen the American economy.'' Mike Zaneis, the senior vice president and general counsel at the Interactive Advertising Bureau, said he was encouraged by the report. ''It gives us an opportunity as an industry to prove that we can continue to move the ball forward on consumer privacy,'' Mr. Zaneis said. According to a statement issued by the department, global online transactions are estimated at $10 trillion a year. Data from a 2009 study commissioned by the Interactive Advertising Bureau reported that interactive ads were responsible for $300 billion of economic activity in the United States annually. The department will seek comment on the report through Jan. 28 and will publish questions from the report next week. No date has been set for the publication of final recommendations.  "
Anger Leads To Apology From Google About Buzz,"Google moved quickly over the weekend to try to contain mounting criticism of Buzz, its social network, apologizing to users for features that were widely seen as endangering privacy and announcing product changes to address those concerns.    Todd Jackson, product manager for Gmail and Google Buzz, wrote in a blog post on Saturday that Google had decided to alter one of the most-criticized features in Buzz: the ready-made circle of friends the service provided to new users based on their most frequent e-mail and chat contacts in Gmail. Instead of automatically connecting people, Buzz will in the future merely suggest to new users a group of people they may want to follow or be followed by, he said.   Mr. Jackson, who said that the auto-follow feature had been intended to make it easy for people to get started on Buzz, acknowledged the criticism that was heaped on Google in the last few days.     ''We're very sorry for the concern we've caused and have been working hard ever since to improve things based on your feedback,'' Mr. Jackson wrote. ''We'll continue to do so.''   The start-up process for Buzz, which Google introduced on Tuesday as its answer to Facebook and Twitter, drew angry responses on technology blogs and beyond, as users feared that the names of their e-mail correspondents would be publicly exposed. A first set of changes that Google announced on Thursday failed to quell the uproar.    Some critics said the latest modifications to Buzz, which is tightly coupled with Gmail, appeared to have addressed the most serious privacy concern.    ''Turning off the auto-follow was a huge improvement,'' Danny Sullivan, a longtime Google analyst and the editor of SearchEngineLand, said in an e-mail message.   But Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said his organization  still intended to file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission this week pending its review of Google's changes.    ''Even with these changes, there is still the concern that Gmail users are being driven into a social networking service that they didn't sign up for,'' Mr. Rotenberg said in an interview on Sunday.    The privacy concerns about Buzz, and Google's rapid efforts to address its critics, echo episodes that have bedeviled other social networks, most notably Facebook. None of those events have slowed the growth of Facebook, which recently said it had reached more than 400 million users. Gmail has 176 million users, according to the research firm comScore.   ''I think the privacy issues earlier this week with Buzz will blow over and not harm the product in the long term,'' Mr. Sullivan said. But privacy will continue to haunt Google, he said, and many people will point to the release of Buzz as an overreach by Google and a reason that the company could not be trusted.   The change in the start-up process for new users of Buzz was the most significant of a series of modifications that Mr. Jackson announced on Saturday.    Google also said that it would create a new Buzz tab in Gmail's settings page to allow users to hide Buzz from Gmail completely. The page gives users the option to disable Buzz, deleting their posts and removing their Google profile, which in many cases listed publicly their circle of contacts in Buzz. The new feature could address concerns that disabling Buzz and removing a public profile was a multistep process that confused many users and that some described as a game of whack-a-mole.   Google also will no longer automatically connect public Picasa albums and items shared on Google Reader, another feature that had been widely criticized by some users and privacy advocates.   In the next two weeks, existing Buzz users will be directed to the new start-up process to give them a ''second chance to review and confirm'' the people they are following, Mr. Jackson said.   The changes Google announced on Saturday will be carried out  in the next few days.   While it is too early to gauge Buzz's success, Google said tens of millions of people had tried the service in its first 48 hours.    Mr. Sullivan of SearchEngineLand said that the level of activity on Buzz appeared to be significant.    ''I suspect Google might have a minor hit on its hands already,'' he said.  "
Redrawing The Route To Online Privacy,"ON the Internet, things get old fast. One prime candidate for the digital dustbin, it seems, is the current approach to protecting privacy on the Internet.    It is an artifact of the 1990s, intended as a light-touch policy to nurture innovation in an emerging industry. And its central concept is ''notice and choice,'' in which Web sites post notices of their privacy policies and users can then make choices about sites they frequent and the levels of privacy they prefer.    But policy and privacy experts agree that the relentless rise of Internet data harvesting  has overrun the old approach of using lengthy written notices to safeguard  privacy.     These  statements are rarely read, are often confusing and can't hope to capture the complexity of modern data-handling practices. As a result,  experts say,  consumers  typically have little meaningful choice about the online use of their personal information -- whether their birth dates, addresses, credit card numbers or Web-browsing habits.   ''There are essentially no defenders anymore of the pure notice-and-choice model,'' said Daniel J. Weitzner, a senior policy official at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration  of the Commerce Department. ''It's no longer adequate.''   So if the current model is broken, how can it be fixed? There are two broad answers: rules and tools.   Rules would mean new regulations. And Congress and the  Federal Trade Commission are looking at further rules that could limit how personal information is used. For example, the government might ban the use  of  recorded trails of a person's Web-browsing behavior -- so-called click streams -- in  employment or health insurance decisions.    Still, the next round of online privacy regulation  needs to proceed  carefully, policy experts warn. They say that online data collection and analysis  is an economic imperative, and that the Internet industry of the future  will involve adding value to the free flow of information -- much of it created by individuals and their browsing activity. Google, Facebook and Twitter are evidence of the trend, and so are legions of start-ups seeking riches in fields like social networking, cloud computing and smartphone applications.    ''Getting this balance right is critical to the future of the Web, to foster innovation and economic growth,'' Mr. Weitzner said.   Whatever the future of regulation, better digital tools are needed. Enhancing online privacy is a daunting research challenge that involves not only computing, but also human behavior and perception. So researchers nationwide are tackling the issue in new ways.   At Carnegie Mellon University, a group is working on what it calls ''privacy nudges.'' This approach taps computer science techniques like machine learning, natural language processing and text analysis, as well as  disciplines like behavioral economics.   The goal is to design software that essentially sits over your shoulder and provides real-time reminders -- short on-screen messages -- that the information you're  about to send has privacy implications. ''It learns, helps you and occasionally prompts you,'' said Lorrie Faith Cranor, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon.  ''When we go online, there are a lot of ways we can inadvertently give up our privacy.''   On a social networking site, Ms. Cranor says, people often type in their birth dates and widely circulate them, hoping to receive online birthday greetings. But a birth date posted online, she notes, can also be used for marketing profiling, identification and potentially identity theft. A software agent, she says, could inform the user of that before a birth date is typed.   An on-screen alert is a mild nudge.  A stronger one might be automatically enrolling the user in an online lottery for cash prizes (perhaps financed by the industry, to avoid tougher privacy regulation), if the person doesn't  disclose potentially sensitive personal information. The stronger incentive, says Alessandro Acquisti, a researcher who specializes in the economics of privacy, may be needed to offset the bias toward immediate gratification in human decision-making -- thinking only of the emotionally satisfying birthday greeting next week instead of the privacy risks down the road.    M. Ryan Calo, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at the Stanford Law School, is exploring technologies  that deliver ''visceral notice.'' His research involves voice and animation technology that emulates humans. When putting information in a personal health record, for example, a virtual nurse could explain to the user the privacy implications, and trade-offs, of sharing personal information with doctors, family members, insurers and drug companies.   Mr. Calo explains that people naturally react more strongly, in a visceral way, to anthropomorphic cues. He points to a sociological experiment that had people pay for coffee on an honor system. One box for depositing cash had a picture of  flowers on it, while another had a picture of human eyes. Time and again, he said, people paid more often for coffee when the box had eyes instead of flowers. ''Our brains are hard-wired to respond to images that look human, alive,'' Mr. Calo said.   At Princeton, Edward W. Felten, a computer scientist,  wants to re-engineer the Web browser for greater privacy. A key, he says, is to alter the software's design so that information about on-screen viewing sessions is kept separate and not routinely passed along so a person's browsing behavior can be tracked. His plan would push mainstream browsing toward anonymous mode, which can be done in the latest browser software, but only by opening a separate, specially designed window.    ''The browser,'' Mr. Felten said, ''needs to be less promiscuous about revealing the information collected.''    "
ESSAY; Maybe It's Time for the Full-Money Monty,"LET'S talk about getting naked.   I don't mean this as a come-on, though you're looking mighty fine today -- have you been working out?  No, we're here to talk about financial transparency. Which is, metaphorically speaking, getting naked.   If you don't see the connection, first consider the new generation of body scanners being used at airports around the world. The Obama administration intends to spend hundreds of millions of dollars for more of the machines. Unlike basic metal detectors, they can spot nonmetallic weapons smuggled under clothing -- like a packet of explosive powder in someone's underwear. The scanners, which present a ghostly image of each passenger's body under their clothing, are fairly controversial. Groups like the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, call them a ''digital strip search.''     England is deploying them, but ran into concerns that scanning younger fliers might violate child pornography laws. In Germany, puckish protesters stripped at Berlin-Tegel airport, showing off anti-scanner slogans inked on their bodies and making a bold point about privacy.    Here in the United States, Congress originally approved the scanners' use as a secondary search for people who aroused suspicion, but now we'll all have a chance for a little high-tech streaking. The government has tried to reassure people that it has taken steps to address privacy concerns: people can opt for a pat-down search instead of exposure by the scanners, for example.    The administration assures us that the machines can't store images, and that the person viewing the images will be in a room without gawkers or gigglers. EPIC, however, obtained documents that suggest the government's assurances might not be entirely supported by the facts: some users can change settings to increase image clarity and store pictures.   The government clearly thinks it's a good idea to trade privacy for safety. So why not go naked financially, too?    Here's my logic, such as it is: Experts blamed the near-collapse of the American economy on shadowy derivatives and hidden debt exposure, which is a lot like having powdered explosives in our financial underpants. So maybe we need more, um, transparency.   I don't say this because I like being naked. I'm not a naturist, though I do remember, back in my college days in Austin, Tex., a couple of sheepish visits to a skinny-dipping stretch of lakeside known as Hippie Hollow.    I just think that if we really believe in transparency, we ought to be willing to stand up for the concept in the extreme, and put the privates back in privacy. Those captains of finance who boldly took risks with the American economy? The next time they testify before Congress, they go au naturel. Force the emperors to show that they really have no clothes, under the bright lights of national television, and I guarantee that you'll see malfeasance shrink. C-Span ratings might get a boost, too, though most companies would have to hire more attractive executives before that would work.   Maybe we should take the idea even further: everybody strips, if not by shedding their clothes, then at least by exposing their assets. We're already rendered nearly nude, metaphorically, when we apply for a mortgage refinancing or a credit card. Have you seen the information they can pull on us from databases? We're walking around like patients in hospital gowns, with the back flapping free and feeling the breeze; let's drop the meaningless scrap of fiscal cotton and have all of our data out there all the time.   How? If you're shy, there's no need to tattoo your mutual fund account numbers on your chest, or your mortgage balance on your nether parts. Embroidery on your shirt and a string of revealing numbers on the signature lines of your e-mail will do just fine. With the full-money monty and no secrets, we might avoid future financial embarrassment.   You might be thinking, ''Schwartz, you idiot'' -- and believe me, you wouldn't be the first. But my idea is not new. One of my favorite movies, ''L.A. Story,'' provides a pretty good example of fiscal nudity in action: A trendy restaurant demands the economic data on each guest. (The maitre d' asks, ''You think with a financial statement like this you can have the duck?'') The only problem with this brilliant visualization is that ''L.A. Story'' was a comedy, so people didn't take it seriously.    I decided to call an expert to test my theory. Nicky Hoffman, the managing director of the Naturist Society, works with people who get naked for fun. (The first time she addressed a Naturist Society conference, she says, she was a bit nonplussed, so they told her to imagine the audience with their clothes on.)   Ms. Hoffman initially warmed to my theory, especially when it comes to airport security. ''They should let us go through naked -- then you wouldn't have any of these problems,'' she said with a laugh.   But when I started talking about financial nakedness, and putting our monetary information out there for all the world to see, even Ms. Hoffman became a little skittish. ''It's invasive,'' she said. ''I'd rather have somebody see my body than see my bank account.''   That's a problem. If Ms. Hoffman is against it, how can I expect the rest of my nation to strip for our financial health?    It's O.K. I didn't want to see Richard Fuld, the former chairman of Lehman Brothers, in the buff anyway.    "
"Coupons From Internet Know A Lot About You, and They Tell","For decades, shoppers have taken advantage of coupons. Now, the coupons are taking advantage of the shoppers.   A new breed of coupon, printed from the Internet or sent to mobile phones, is packed with information about the customer who uses it. While the coupons look standard, their bar codes can be loaded with a startling amount of data, including identification about the customer, Internet address, Facebook page information and even the search terms the customer used to find the coupon in the first place.    And all that information follows that customer into the mall. For example, if a man walks into a Filene's Basement to buy a suit for his wedding and shows a coupon he retrieved online, the company's marketing agency can figure out whether he used the search terms ''Hugo Boss suit'' or ''discount wedding clothes'' to research his purchase (just don't tell his fiancee).    Coupons from the Internet are the fastest-growing part of the coupon world -- their redemption increased 263 percent to about 50 million coupons in 2009, according to the coupon-processing company Inmar. Using coupons to link Internet behavior with in-store shopping lets retailers figure out which ad slogans or online product promotions work best, how long someone waits between searching and shopping, even what offers a shopper will respond to or ignore.    The coupons can, in some cases, be tracked not just to an anonymous shopper but to an identifiable person: a retailer could know that Amy Smith printed a 15 percent-off coupon after searching for appliance discounts at Ebates.com on Friday at 1:30 p.m. and redeemed it later that afternoon at the store.    ''You can really key into who they are,'' said Don Batsford Jr., who works on online advertising for the tax preparation company Jackson Hewitt, whose coupons include search information.  ''It's almost like being able to read their mind, because they're confessing to the search engine what they're looking for.''   While companies once had a slim dossier on each consumer, they now have databases packed with information. And every time a person goes shopping, visits a Web site or buys something, the database gets another entry.    ''There is a feeling that anonymity in this space is kind of dead,'' said Chris Jay Hoofnagle, director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology's information privacy programs.    None of the tracking is visible to consumers. The coupons, for companies as diverse as Ruby Tuesday and Lord & Taylor, are handled by a company called RevTrax, which displays them on the retailers' sites or on coupon Web sites, not its own site.    Even if consumers could figure out that RevTrax was creating the coupons, it does not have a privacy policy on its site -- RevTrax says that is because it handles data for the retailers and does not directly interact with consumers. RevTrax can also include retailers' own client identification numbers (Amy Smith might be client No. 2458230), then the retailer can connect that with the actual person if it wants to, for example, to send a follow-up offer or a thank-you note.   Using coupons also lets the retailers get around Google hurdles. Google allows its search advertisers to see reports on which keywords are working well as a whole but not on how each person is responding to each slogan.      ''We've built privacy protections into all Google services and report Web site trends only in aggregate, without identifying individual users,'' Sandra Heikkinen, a spokeswoman for Google, said in an e-mail message.   The retailers, however, can get to an individual level by sending different keyword searches to different Web addresses. The distinct Web addresses are invisible to the consumer, who usually sees just a Web page with a simple address at the top of it.    So clicking on an ad for Jackson Hewitt after searching for ''new 2010 deductions'' would send someone to a different behind-the-scenes URL than after searching for ''Jackson Hewitt 2010,''  though the Web pages and addresses might look identical. This data could be coded onto a coupon.   RevTrax works as closely with image-rich display ads, with coupons also signaling what ad a person saw and on what site.   ''Wherever we provide a link, whether it's on search or banner, that thing you click can include actual keywords,'' said Rob O'Neil, director of online marketing at Tag New Media, which works with Filene's. ''There's some trickery.''   The companies argue that the coupon strategy gives them direct feedback on how well their marketing is working.    Once the shopper prints an online coupon or sends it to his cellphone and then goes to a store, the clerk scans it. The bar code information is sent to RevTrax, which, with the ad agency, analyzes it.    ''We break people up into teeny little cross sections of who we think they are, and we test that out against how they respond,'' said Mr. Batsford, who is a partner at 31 Media, an online marketing company.    RevTrax can identify online shoppers when they are signed in to a coupon site like Ebates or FatWallet or the retailer's own site. It says it avoids connecting that number with real people to steer clear of privacy issues, but clients can make that match.   The retailer can also make that connection when it is offering coupons to its Facebook fans, like Filene's Basement is doing.   ''When someone joins a fan club, the user's Facebook ID becomes visible to the merchandiser,''  Jonathan Treiber, RevTrax's co-founder, said. ''We take that and embed it in a bar code or promotion code.''   ''When the consumer redeems the offer in store, we can track it back, in this case, not to the Google search term but to the actual Facebook user ID that was signing up,'' he said. Although Facebook does not signal that Amy Smith responded to a given ad, Filene's could look up the user ID connected to the coupon and ''do some more manual-type research -- you could easily see your sex, your location and what you're interested in,'' Mr. Treiber said. (Mr. O'Neil said Filene's did not do this at the moment.)   The coupon efforts are nascent, but coupon companies say that when they get more data about how people are responding, they can make different offers to different consumers.    ''Over time,'' Mr. Treiber said, ''we'll be able to do much better profiling around certain I.P. addresses, to say, hey, this I.P. address is showing a proclivity for printing clothing apparel coupons and is really only responding to coupons greater than 20 percent off.''   That alarms some privacy advocates.   Companies can ''offer you, perhaps, less desirable products than they offer me, or offer you the same product as they offer me but at a higher price,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the United States Public Interest Research Group, which has asked the Federal Trade Commission for tighter rules on online advertising. ''There really have been no rules set up for this ecosystem.''  "
Google Says It Collected Private Data By Mistake,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Google said on Friday that for more than  three years it had inadvertently collected snippets of private information that people send over unencrypted wireless networks.   The admission, made in an official blog post by Alan Eustace, Google's engineering chief, comes a month after regulators in Europe started asking the search giant pointed questions about Street View, the layer of real-world photographs accessible from Google Maps. Regulators wanted to know what data Google collected as its camera-laden cars methodically trolled through neighborhoods, and what Google did with that data.   Google's Street View misstep adds to the widespread anxiety about privacy in the digital age and the apparent willingness of Silicon Valley engineers to collect people's private data without permission.    Facebook is currently engaged in a heated debate with its 400 million members about its shifting privacy guidelines, while Google has had to contend with other privacy missteps, like the introduction of its Buzz social network earlier this year that publicly exposed people's closest e-mail contacts without permission.   Google appears to have acted quickly after questions were raised by the European regulators. Two weeks ago, Google tried to address their questions and criticism in a blog post. It said it did collect certain kinds of data around the world that identify Wi-Fi networks to help improve its mapping products. The information on wireless networks can be used for  location-based advertising services for mobile phones, which can sometime be pinpointed via a wireless network even if they lack a GPS chip.    But the company explicitly said then that it did not collect or store so-called payload data  --  the actual information being transmitted by users over unprotected networks.   In a confession made on Friday afternoon (and late night, European time) that is sure to raise new questions about its privacy policies, Google said that its previous claims were wrong.   Mr. Eustace wrote that a review of the Street View software has revealed that because of a programming error in 2006, the company had indeed been mistakenly collecting snippets of data that happened to be transmitted over nonpassword protected Wi-Fi networks that the Google camera cars were passing. This occurred  in Europe, in the United States and in other major cities elsewhere.    Mr. Eustace tried to play down the revelation, saying that Google ''never used that data in any Google products.'' He said that it collected only fragments of data, because the cars were moving constantly and changing channels many times each second. Only when someone was using their unencrypted, nonpassword-protected network was the data collected and stored.   Google said it had temporarily halted  its Street View cars and would stop collecting Wi-Fi network data entirely, Mr. Eustace wrote. He also said Google wanted to delete the data, in cooperation with regulators, as soon as possible.   But the revelation that the data was collected is likely to set off a firestorm of protest and possibly new legal problems. Google could be accused of intercepting private communications and violating wiretap laws in the United States, although it would most likely argue that it never had any intent to collect or use the data.    And in Europe, where Google has taken great pains to assure a queasy public about a giant American corporation taking photos of their neighborhoods, trust is likely to be further eroded.   Last month, Peter Schaar, Germany's federal commissioner for data protection, said he was ''horrified'' by the earlier revelation that Google was collecting data about the location of Wi-Fi networks. He called on the company to ''delete previously unlawfully collected personal data on the wireless network immediately and stop the rides for Street View.'' Mr. Schaar could not be reached for further comment last night.   German data protection officials had initially questioned the legality of Street View but dropped their objections last July after Google agreed to hide details of faces, license plates and house numbers through pixilation, and to give citizens the option of removing their property entirely from the 360-degree photo archive. Since then, hundreds have made such requests. Some German politicians  have advocated laws that would levy fines on companies that do not remove the information.    Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, said that Friday's news would ''give quite a bit of ammunition to not only the European privacy commission but the European public, which has been very uneasy about Street View, far more than  in the U.S.''    In the blog post, Mr. Eustace said of the Google engineering team: ''We are profoundly sorry for this error and are determined to learn all the lessons we can from our mistake.''

Facebook Bows to Pressure Over Privacy,"PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Ever since Facebook was founded  in 2004, Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, has pushed its users to share more information about themselves. Time and again, users have pushed back, complaining that some new feature or setting on the site violated their privacy.    But the reaction has rarely been as strong as in the last few weeks, as users, privacy advocates and government officials in many countries lobbed a series of increasingly vociferous complaints against the company. On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg responded, unveiling a set of controls that he said would help people better understand what they were sharing online, and with whom.    ''It has been a pretty intense few weeks for us,'' said Mr. Zuckerberg, who added that he had been huddled with other senior executives for the last two weeks to help shape Facebook's response.    The back and forth between Facebook and its users over privacy is gaining importance as the company's growth continues unabated. It now has nearly 500 million users around the world, and its policies, more than those of any other company, are helping to define standards for privacy in the Internet age.    The new settings would simplify a system that required users to sort through about 150 options.   ''Facebook is trying to change privacy on the Internet, and users are pushing back,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which recently filed a complaint about Facebook's privacy practices with the Federal Trade Commission. ''This is about who controls the disclosure of data. Facebook cannot make that decision for users.''   Mr. Rotenberg and other privacy advocates said the changes that Facebook announced on Wednesday were generally positive ones, but they said they hoped for further changes and for more oversight from Congress and regulators.   Mr. Zuckerberg announced the changes during a press conference at Facebook's headquarters here. He appeared contrite and conceded mistakes, but he did not apologize to users.   He said the new privacy settings, which will show up in users' accounts over the next couple of weeks, would make it easier for users to understand how much of their personal information was publicly accessible. ''The settings have gotten complex, and it has become hard for people to use them effectively,'' he said.    Facebook said it would give its users  simple controls to determine whether their information was visible to only friends, friends of friends, or everyone on the Internet. Those settings will be applied retroactively to everything users have already published on Facebook.   In addition, Facebook said it was changing its directory of users to show only minimal information when people search for others, like name, profile picture and gender. It had earlier required users to make more information public.   Facebook will also include an easy way for users to turn off its new and controversial ''instant personalization'' feature, which allows partner sites like Yelp and Pandora to gain access to their personal data.   The latest crisis for Facebook began to build shortly after its conference for software developers in late April, where it unveiled new features and a plan to extend Facebook functions across the Web.    The company argued, as it has for some time, that more and broader sharing makes the site better for everyone. While getting more information about users also helps Facebook customize the advertising it displays, Mr. Zuckerberg said none of the changes affecting privacy were financially motivated.   Some critics say the company was slow to respond to the resulting criticisms. But internally a debate was brewing, with some executives arguing that Facebook might be able to get away with making no changes to the site, said Facebook employees who asked not to be named.     Earlier user rebellions had eventually died down, and despite some defections publicized by technology blogs, Facebook users were not canceling their accounts any more than at any other time.    But eventually the amount of bad publicity became impossible to ignore.  ''No one likes to see the amount of feedback that we are getting,'' Mr. Zuckerberg said in an interview. ''A lot of the blogs and feedback were really negative.''    Once he decided to make changes to the privacy settings, he and some of the company's top executives, product managers and senior engineers huddled for nearly two weeks. Working virtually around the clock and through two weekends, they worked out the controls announced Wednesday. Mr. Zuckerberg also personally met with some of his harshest critics.   ''We've been working nonstop on this for a few weeks,'' he said. ''There are lot of people who have not eaten or slept or changed clothes a lot in the last couple of weeks.''    Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook's biggest mistake was failing to notice that as Facebook added new features and its privacy controls grew increasingly complicated, those controls became effectively unusable for many people. ''We probably should have been more sensitive to this issue beforehand,'' he said.   Mr. Zuckerberg, 26 said the crisis was challenging, but not  as stressful as fending off billion-dollar acquisition offers from the likes of Yahoo and Viacom when he was 22. ''That was definitely the most stressful situation I had at the company,'' he said.    Kurt Opsahl, a senior staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who pressed Facebook on privacy, said the new settings were a step forward. But he said that Facebook should not push users into the instant personalization feature without their  consent. ''This is a change in how data was used that was different from the expectations that people had when they gave the data,'' he said.    Mr. Opsahl also said Facebook did not appear to offer a good way to manage settings that allow third-party applications like the game FarmVille to have access to personal information. Users can open either all of the applications or none of them.    This latest tussle between Facebook and its users could affect the privacy policies of other technology companies, said Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner. ''Facebook is a very large canary in the coal mine,'' he said. ''Competitors are watching to see how much Facebook can get away with and what are the limits that are considered acceptable by government and users.''   During the news conference, Mr. Zuckerberg said this would be the last overhaul to privacy controls that the company planned to make for a while. He said the preferences that a user expressed with the new settings would apply to all future products and site changes. ''The big takeaway is, don't mess with the privacy stuff for a long time.''

"Despite Privacy Inquiries, Germans Flock to Google, Facebook and Apple","BERLIN -- Chenchao Liu has 446 friends on Facebook, loves his iPhone 3GS and is obsessed with  Google searches and maps.     In that respect, Mr. Liu, 21,  is like many American college students. But Mr. Liu lives in Germany, a country whose strict data protection laws have spurred inquiries into the practices of Facebook, Apple and Google -- the companies responsible for the products and services he enjoys.   He is one of the millions of users who have helped make  the  offerings successful in Germany.    ''I think many people in Germany, especially those in my age group, do not have as many problems with data protection as the regulators are making out,'' said Mr. Liu, who studies chemistry at Technical University in Munich. ''What it all comes down to is personal responsibility. No one is forcing anyone to use any of these services.''   American technology companies are under close scrutiny in Germany. Google is being investigated for having errantly collected personal Internet information like e-mail passwords while doing research for its Street View mapping service.    Facebook is being investigated for collecting data on non-Facebook users from the mailing lists of active users. And Apple has been asked to explain what kind of information its latest iPhone 4 is storing on users and for how long.    Johannes Caspar, a data protection supervisor in Hamburg who is conducting the investigations into Google and Facebook, said his agency was trying to  protect consumers from themselves. ''The problem is that many people are unaware what is being done with their data,'' he said.    Strict privacy laws are a product of the post-World War II reconstruction, when German lawmakers restricted the use of personal information to prevent the government from singling out citizens and persecuting them.    It is illegal, for example, to publish the image or name of any private person without permission. This  includes felons, who are usually identified in the media by the initial of their last name only, like Klaus P.    That has not stopped Germans from flocking to a social networking site or downloading the latest smartphone applications.    As of May, Googe controlled 92 percent of the online search market in Germany, compared with 65 percent in the United States, according to comScore, a research firm in Reston, Va.     Facebook has about 7.7 million users in Germany (which has a population of about 82 million), according to Inside Network, a research group in Palo Alto, Calif. All versions of the iPhone, including the iPhone 4, which went on sale in Germany in June, have sold out within days. Apple does not provide specific sales figures in Germany.   ''What I think we have in Germany is a big disconnect between data privacy laws and consumer sentiment toward privacy,'' said Felix Haas, the chief executive and founder of Amiando, a company in Munich that is the largest online event registration platform in Europe.   Amiando is a case in point. Its software is used by the concert promoters of German entertainers like Lena Meyer-Landrut, the winner of the Eurovision song contest this year, and even by the country's own data protection officials, who registered online to attend their annual convention.   The regulators typed their names, addresses and other details into Amiando's registration form and -- if they wanted to receive offers on related events -- checked a box authorizing the mailings. Amiando, like most German online businesses, does not sell its data to third parties, but it makes its list available for focused mailings.   The American practice of selling customer names and details, Mr. Haas said, is legal in Germany but almost never used because ''it would erode the trust we have built up.''   Yet more and more Germans are disclosing personal details if they can save money doing so. A retail bonus card, called Payback, has 19.4 million subscribers. In exchange for discounts at retailers, cardholders give Payback's operator, Loyalty Partner of Munich, permission to send them offers.   The company scored a  legal victory in August 2008 when the German supreme court, the Bundesgerichtshof, rejected a complaint from  consumer protection officials who had claimed that Payback did not tell consumers enough about how it used their personal information in marketing efforts.    Dieter Weng, the president of the German Dialogue Marketing Association, a group of 800 businesses that includes online marketers, said Germany was unlikely to loosen its privacy restrictions.    But the need to encourage the growth of the Internet economy, Mr. Weng said, could help lower barriers for online marketing.   ''I think Germans are concerned about personal data being misused by government or law enforcement,'' Mr. Weng said. ''But for behavioral or attitudinal data about customer preferences, people are more willing to share if they see an advantage in it for them.''   Peter Barron, a Google spokesman in London, said the challenge for regulators was to strike a balance between data protection and nurturing Internet businesses.    ''If that balance isn't right,'' Mr. Barron said, ''then users and businesses will lose out.''  "
You Want My Personal Data? Reward Me for It,"LIFE, as they say, imitates art. And the way things work commercially today across much of the Web recalls that chapter in ''The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' where Tom cajoles his guileless friends into whitewashing Aunt Polly's fence. They supply the labor, but he gets the reward. On the Internet, users supply the raw material that helps generate billions of dollars a year in online advertising revenue. Search requests, individual profiles on social networks, Web browsing habits, posted pictures and many Internet messages are all mined to serve up targeted online ads.  All of this personal information turns out to be extremely valuable, collectively. So why should Google, Yahoo, Facebook and other ad businesses get all the rewards? That is the question that animates Bynamite, a start-up company based in San Francisco. ''There should be an economic opportunity on the consumer side,'' said Ginsu Yoon, a co-founder of the company. ''Nearly all the investment and technology is on the advertising side.'' Bynamite, to be sure, is another entry in the emerging market for online privacy products. The business interest in such products, of course, is being fed by worries about how much personal information marketers collect. Also playing a part are recent outcries after Facebook changed its privacy practices and Google introduced a social networking tool, Buzz, that initially shared information widely without users' permission. Venture capital has been pouring into Web-based monitoring and privacy protection products like ReputationDefender and Abine, as well as services that help parents protect children's privacy online, like SafetyWeb and SocialShield. Bynamite brings a somewhat different perspective to the privacy market. ''Our view is that it's not about privacy protection but about giving users control over this valuable resource -- their information,'' Mr. Yoon said. Both the protection and the value approaches to the privacy market could well pay off, says Randy Komisar, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm. ''What's intriguing about Bynamite,'' he said, ''is its emphasis on privacy as revolving around choice and ownership of data, and ultimately a notion of an exchange of value.'' (Kleiner Perkins is an investor in ReputationDefender but not in Bynamite.) Although Bynamite is a tiny start-up, it points toward larger issues about privacy transactions and pricing of personal data. ''In reality, we constantly make transactions involving our personal information,'' said Alessandro Acquisti, an associate professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. Every search on Google, Mr. Acquisti notes, is implicitly such a transaction, involving a person ''selling'' personal information and ''buying'' search results. But people do not think about, or are unaware of, the notion that typed search requests help determine the ads that Google displays and what its ad network knows about them. Bynamite, Mr. Acquisti said, is ''simply trying to make these kinds of transactions explicit, more transparent to the user.'' Last week, Bynamite introduced an early, or beta, version of its software, a downloadable plug-in for browsers. That software and its Web service monitor what ad networks and e-commerce sites collect and assume to know about a user. A user's interests are then assembled on a Web page, grouped by categories like ''news and current events,'' ''general health,'' ''travel,'' ''technology'' and ''shopping.'' The categories are weighted by how often you visit different categories of sites or make purchases at some online merchants. The information tracked by Bynamite is steadily updated, and, at least for me last week, a small pop-up alert at the bottom of my computer screen appeared every day, informing me of new information about me from ad networks. Mr. Yoon calls the product's early version mainly a ''mirror,'' showing users how the commercial Internet sees them. Users can change that mirror to represent their interests more accurately. For example, I don't own a car, but my ''automotive'' folder soon had several entries, saying I was interested in Mercedes-Benz and other brands, presumably because middle-age men who visit the Web sites I do are typically attractive targets for car ads. I deleted the auto interests, suggesting to advertisers that I'm not necessarily a good prospect. Still, I saw a few car ads on sites I later visited. Bynamite is by no means anti-advertising. It does not block ads. Its Web site recommends free tools, like AdBlock and NoScript, for people who want ads blocked. In essence, the company has a libertarian, free-market ethos. If consumers have more power and control, it says, personal information should flow more efficiently to the benefit of both consumers and advertisers, who will be able to more accurately aim their ads. Like most start-ups, Bynamite faces long odds. To succeed, it must be easy to use, and users must trust it as a reliable middleman handling their data. It has no business model yet, though it could offer product recommendations, based on interests, and collect fees on resulting sales from merchants. It hasn't ruled out accepting ads itself. To start, its free plug-in software works only on Mozilla and Chrome browsers. IF Bynamite gains momentum, Mr. Yoon predicts that individuals will be able to use their portfolios of interests as virtual currency. He calls the idea a ''consumer's preference wallet.'' Mr. Yoon and his co-founder, Ian Wilkes, are former business and engineering managers at Second Life, the online community where trading virtual currency for digital goods is common. In a few years, Mr. Yoon says, a person's profile of interests could be the basis for micropayments or discounts. A media company, for example, might charge a monthly subscription fee of $10 for news or entertainment programming, but offer it for $8 to those who exchanged their preference wallets. The discount, in theory, would be justified because advertisers would pay more to market to people whose interests they knew precisely and thus were more likely to buy. ''I may be wrong about the product and our company,'' Mr. Yoon said. ''But I'm absolutely convinced that the direction is right, giving people a way to identify and use this store of value that is their personal information.''  "
Emirates to Cut Data Services Of BlackBerry,"The United Arab Emirates, citing security concerns, said Sunday that it would suspend BlackBerry mobile services like e-mail and text messaging beginning in October, the latest high-stakes clash between governments and communications providers over the flow of digital information. The Emirates have been in a long dispute with Research In Motion, the smartphone's producer, over the BlackBerry's highly encrypted data system, which offers security to users but makes it more difficult for governments to monitor communications. The decision could have significant implications for BlackBerry use in the Persian Gulf region, where Saudi Arabia has been closely studying the issue and may follow suit. Other countries, including Kuwait and Bahrain, have also raised concerns. Disputes involving privacy and censorship have flared more frequently between governments and communications providers as the Internet connects people worldwide. In July, China and Google settled a standoff over access to information. YouTube has been periodically blocked in countries like Turkey and Pakistan, and Pakistan temporarily blocked Facebook in May because of what it called offensive, anti-Islamic content.  Officials of Research In Motion, which is based in Waterloo, Ontario, and the company's outside public relations firm did not respond Sunday to telephone calls and e-mail. The monitoring of information is a particularly thorny issue for autocratic regimes in the Persian Gulf worried that the Internet might be used for antigovernment purposes -- a concern heightened by the passionate online response in Iran to the 2009 presidential election that helped energize the opposition and led to weeks of unrest. The United Arab Emirates, in particular, were alarmed by the killing in January of a Palestinian operative in a Dubai hotel, possibly by a hit team from the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. The episode infuriated the government, which wants to encourage tourism and business, and heightened its desire for increased electronic surveillance and security. ''The U.A.E. has never been a place that offered much in the way of electronic privacy,'' said Jim Krane, author of ''City of Gold,'' a history of Dubai. ''The government makes no secret that it monitors electronic communication, including text messages, phone calls and e-mail. The revelation that secure BlackBerry data is frustratingly out of the government's reach only confirms this.'' Other smartphones, like the AppleiPhone, are not tied to one e-mail service. In general, that means e-mail to and from the devices mostly travels over the open Internet and can be relatively easily monitored. But the BlackBerry uses highly encrypted data that is received by wireless carriers' towers and is immediately routed through a closed, global network operated by the company. To enforce the ban, the carriers will stop forwarding that data. Because of this level of security, the United States government allows many military and law enforcement employees to send confidential messages by BlackBerry, but it also makes surveillance correspondingly difficult. As a result, R.I.M. officials have clashed with officials elsewhere in recent years. In 2008, security agencies in India suggested that BlackBerry service might be shut down there unless R.I.M. installed servers in that country to allow them to intercept messages. The company refused, but sent representatives to meet with the Indian government. Indian regulators, while expressing reservations, have said they have no plans to restrict the service. Analysts and telecommunications experts also believe that security concerns delayed the arrival of BlackBerry service in China. It is unclear what actions the company took, if any, to alleviate those worries. There were conflicting reports Sunday about whether Saudi Arabia had also decided to ban the BlackBerry services. Some news agencies cited an interview with a Saudi Telecom official on the Al Arabiya television network that confirmed the decision, but in other Al Arabiya news reports company officials denied the service would be blocked The Saudi authorities released no official statement, and an adviser to the Saudi government, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said no decision had been made as far as he knew. But one prominent Saudi economist, Ihsan Ali Bu-Hulaiga, said ''it seems to me a number of other countries in the region will follow the lead of the U.A.E.'' for the same security-related reasons. In the emirates, concerns are also fueled by the fact that native Emiratis are a minority there, and the government regards electronic surveillance as an important tool against would-be terrorists, swindlers and other potential troublemakers drawn to the country's relatively unfettered environment. The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven emirates in the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula bordering Saudi Arabia. Among the seven states are Abu Dhabi and Dubai, both economic centers that encourage international trade and discourage financing of radical Islamic movements. Because of this, Mr. Krane suggested, the security concerns are not unfounded. ''The U.A.E. is an open country, a key travel and business hub, with one of the world's largest airports and airlines,'' he said. ''It welcomes just about anyone to visit, and even to settle and work. Nationals of many countries don't even need entry visas. In this environment, the government probably feels that electronic eavesdropping and surveillance are key to maintaining internal security.'' In a statement Sunday, a government body in the Emirates, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, said officials were prepared to block BlackBerry data service beginning Oct. 11 because it was the only service in the Emirates that exported mobile data to servers outside its borders. It will not affect phone service. The agency also said that it had been trying since 2007 to strike a deal under which it would assume authority over BlackBerry services within that country. ''In their current form, certain BlackBerry services allow users to act without any legal accountability, causing judicial, social and national security concerns for the U.A.E.,'' the agency said. While the company has disclosed little information about the centers that manage BlackBerry services, it is widely believed that data from the Middle East is handled by a company operations center in Slough, England. There are about 500,000 BlackBerry users in the United Arab Emirates, a large number of them in the business hub of Dubai. ''R.I.M. has had three years to address these security concerns,'' said a U.A.E. government official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. The dispute between the United Arab Emirates and R.I.M. took an unusual turn about a year ago when the company warned users that software described as a BlackBerry upgrade by an Emirates carrier, Etisalat, was actually spyware. ''Independent sources have concluded that Etisalat's 'Registration' software application is not actually designed to improve performance of a BlackBerry Handheld, but rather to send received messages back to a central server,'' R.I.M. warned customers in an online posting that included directions on removing the software.  "
False Sense Of Security,"If you rely on Microsoft's Internet Explorer's privacy settings to control cookies on your computer, you may want to rethink that strategy. Large numbers of Web sites, including giants like Facebook, appear to be using a loophole that circumvents I.E.'s ability to block cookies, according to researchers at CyLab at the Carnegie Mellon University School of Engineering. A technical paper (note: clicking on the link will initiate a download of a pdf) published by the researchers says that a third of the more than 33,000 sites they studied have technical errors that cause I.E. to allow cookies to install, even if the browser has been set to reject them. Of the 100 most visited destinations on the Internet, 21 sites had the errors, including Facebook, several of Microsoft's own sites, Amazon, IMDB, AOL, Mapquest, GoDaddy and Hulu. Typos and honest mistakes likely explain many of the errors, says Lorrie Faith Cranor, director of the CyLab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory and one of the paper's authors. But she estimates that more than half represent deliberate efforts to keep I.E. from blocking certain types of third-party cookies based on privacy policies.  Cookies are used to store information about a user or computer's Web use so sites can customize that user's experience, including what ads they see. So-called persistent or tracking cookies are data placed not by the site visited, but by other third-party Web sites that have placed content or advertising on the visited Web page. These types of cookies can stay on computers for long periods of time and gather data about surfing habits, and have long raised hackles among those concerned about privacy online. The loophole resides deep in an exchange of data between browser and site. Normally, Internet Explorer checks the privacy policy of a site to see if it complements the browser's own security settings. This checking is done through ''compact policies'': lines of computer code (in this case, three- or four-letter codes) that reflect the content of the tomelike privacy policies that sites have written out in English. For illustrative purposes, imagine an interaction between browser and site that goes something like this: Browser: I don't allow cookies that store personally identifiable information that could be used to contact me without permission.Site: I do have some cookies to place here, but none do that.Browser: That sounds fine. Come on in. Compact policies are voluntary and are part of an Internet standard called Platform for Privacy Preferences, or P3P, that was developed in the 1990s. Dr. Cranor was on the standards committee that developed P3P. The goal of compact policies was to create a way of describing sites' privacy practices when it comes to cookies that computers could read and use. Microsoft's I.E. browser is the only major browser to make meaningful use of P3P; it uses compact policies to block and control certain cookies by default with its ''medium'' privacy setting. (Access the settings in I.E. Version 8 by clicking ''Tools,'' then ''Internet Options'' and then ''Privacy.'' Change your setting using the slider.) And it has been the power of I.E.'s market share-60 percent, according to NetMarketshare-that has led sites that want to install cookies onto PCs to use compact policies, say experts like Dr. Cranor and Ari Schwartz, vice president at the Center for Democracy and Technology until he joined the Obama administration last month. Browsers like Chrome, Firefox and Safari have simpler security settings. Instead of checking a site's compact policy, these browsers simply let people choose to block all cookies, block only third-party cookies or allow all cookies. The loophole sites are using to evade I.E.'s cookie blocker shows up in the process the browser uses to check compact policies. I.E. checks only for codes that indicate a site doesn't have the right privacy protections, Dr. Cranor says. If it finds a compact policy with bad inputs - say, the codes are wrong (there are certain three- and four-letter combinations) or there aren't enough of the codes to complete a proper policy (at least five) - it simply lets the cookies install. When students at Carnegie Mellon started investigating these bad codes, they noticed the exact same insufficient three-code combination showing up in more than 2,700 Web sites. Curious how everyone could make the same mistake, they searched for the code in Google and found, surprisingly, a Microsoft support page. Microsoft says it has now ''retired'' the page cited by CyLab (you can see it, cached, here), adding that the codes shown there were meant only to be an example, not a recommendation. It notes it also provides an article to guide Web developers on how to properly configure P3P so it matches their written privacy policy. CyLab found that some of the Internet's largest sites make use of the loophole, and through other means than the inaccurate Microsoft codes. For instance, Facebook last year had a compact policy with the cheeky entry ''HONK,'' Dr. Cranor says. (''Honk'' is not a valid compact-policy code, nor does it resemble any valid codes, which would explain codes that were mistyped.) Facebook now has a policy with two correct codes, which is unusable because there must be at least five codes. A Facebook spokesman said in an e-mailed statement: ''We're committed to providing clear and transparent policies, as well as comprehensive access to those policies. We're looking into the paper's findings to see what, if any, changes we can make.'' Ben Maurer, a software engineer at Facebook, said that the site used only two codes instead of five because current compact-policy codes do not ''allow a rich enough description to accurately represent our privacy policy.'' Mr. Maurer said he did not know the history of how ''HONK'' made it into a compact policy. The paper also notes that 134 sites with TRUSTe seals, which are meant to reassure consumers that strong privacy measures are in place at a Web site, have faulty compact policies. Only 391 of more than 3,000 sites with the seal had compact policies at all. TRUSTe's president, Fran Maier, said in a blog post that the group was investigating the matter and contacting customers mentioned in the paper. She noted that customers self-attest to the accuracy of their policies, though TRUSTe will help them accomplish that. She said P3P adoption has been poor across the Internet because it was difficult to put into effect and because consumers didn't see value in it. Dr. Cranor says she thinks the real trouble is the lack of a regulatory requirement to use P3P, noting that few consumers know what P3P is. ''I'm hoping companies will do the right thing, and it may take pressure form regulators to make that happen,'' she says. ''Beyond companies that are basically trying to look good on privacy, there is no incentive because you don't have to do it.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Ad Group Unveils Plan To Improve Web Privacy,"As the debate around online privacy and advertiser access to users' data continues, a group of the advertising industry's largest trade organizations was to announce on Monday the details of a self-regulatory program that would allow users to opt out of being tracked by its member organizations.  The program provides details on how companies can adopt some of the principles for conducting online behavioral advertising outlined in a report released last July. The program includes the use of an icon called the ''Advertising Option Icon'' that marketers can place near their ads or on the Web pages that collect data that is used for behavioral targeting. Users who click on the icon, a lower case letter ''I'' inside a triangle that is pointing right, will see an explanation of why they are seeing a particular ad and will be able to opt out of being tracked. Some companies may still serve less focused ads after a user opts out, while others may stop showing ads to that user altogether. But representatives for the trade organizations said the steps were not an indication that the privacy debate had ended. ''This is a big step forward in what's going to be on ongoing dialogue for many years,'' said Stuart P. Ingis, a partner at the Venable law firm and a lawyer for the trade groups. The program would affect the 5,000 companies that are represented by the trade organizations, which include the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the American Advertising Federation, the Association of National Advertisers, the Direct Marketing Association and the Interactive Advertising Bureau, with additional support from the Council of Better Business Bureaus. The Better Business Bureaus group and the Direct Marketing Association will be charged with monitoring and enforcing compliance with the program and will also manage consumer complaints. The organizations will provide Web seminars with information on the newly created program for advertisers, and will also use donated advertising space online to advertise the program to consumers. Marketers that collect data for behavioral advertising will also be able to visit AboutAds.info to start to use the icon or register for the opt-out mechanism. The trade groups have teamed up with Better Advertising, a New York start-up, which will provide the technology to monitor the ads online and report findings so the industry groups can take action. They will also monitor changes to the privacy policies for participating companies and report updates or changes. But privacy advocates say self-regulation is not enough. ''This is just the latest version in a long series of failed self-regulatory efforts. We need the government to step in and set rules for industry,'' said Pam Dixon, the executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit group based in California.  "
Hacking for Fun and Profit in China Underworld,"With a few quick keystrokes, a computer hacker who goes by the code name Majia calls up a screen displaying his latest victims.   ''Here's a list of the people who've been infected with my Trojan horse,'' he says, working from a dingy apartment on the outskirts of this city in central China. ''They don't even know what's happened.''   As he explains it, an online ''trapdoor'' he created just over a  week ago has already lured 2,000 people from China and overseas -- people who clicked on something they should not have, inadvertently spreading a virus that allows him to take control of their computers and steal bank account passwords.   Majia, a soft-spoken college graduate in his early 20s, is a cyberthief.    He operates secretly and illegally, as part of a community of hackers who exploit flaws in computer software to break into Web sites, steal valuable data and sell it for a profit.   Internet security experts say China has legions of hackers just like Majia, and that they are behind an escalating number of global attacks to steal credit card numbers, commit corporate espionage and even wage online warfare on other nations, which in some cases have been traced back to China.    Three weeks ago, Google blamed hackers that it connected to China for a series of sophisticated attacks that led to the theft of the company's valuable source code. Google also said hackers  had infiltrated the private Gmail accounts of human rights activists, suggesting the effort might have been more than just mischief.     In addition to independent criminals like Majia, computer security specialists say there are so-called patriotic hackers who focus their attacks on political targets. Then there are the intelligence-oriented hackers inside the People's Liberation Army, as well as more shadowy groups that are believed to work with the state government.    Indeed, in China  --  as in parts of Eastern Europe and Russia  --  computer hacking has become something of a national sport, and a lucrative one. There are hacker conferences, hacker training academies and magazines with names like Hacker X Files and Hacker Defense, which offer tips on how to break into computers or build a Trojan horse, step by step.   For less than $6, one can even purchase the ''Hacker's Penetration Manual.'' (Books on hacking are also sold, to a lesser extent, in the United States and elsewhere.)   And with 380 million Web users in China and a sizzling online gaming market, analysts say it is no wonder Chinese youths are so skilled at hacking. Many Chinese hackers interviewed over the last few weeks describe a loosely defined community of computer devotees working independently,  but also selling services to corporations and even the military. Because it is difficult to trace hackers, exactly who is behind any specific attack and how and where they operate remains to a large extent a mystery, technology experts say.    And that is just the way Majia, the young Chinese hacker, wants it. On  condition that he not be identified by his real name, Majia agreed two weeks ago  to allow a reporter to visit his modest home in a poor town outside Changsha, and watch him work.    Slim and smartly dressed in black, Majia seemed eager to tell his story; like many hackers, he wants recognition for his hacking skills even as he prizes anonymity to avoid detection. The New York Times found him through another well-known hacker who belongs to a hacker group and vouched that Majia was skilled at what he did.    While Majia's claims, of course, cannot be verified, he is happy to demonstrate his hacking skills. He met a journalist at a cafe one night just over a week ago, and then invited him to his home, where he showed how he hacked into the Web site of a Chinese company. Once the Web site popped up on his screen, he created additional pages and typed the word ''hacked'' onto one of them.   Majia says he fell in love with hacking in college, after friends showed him how to break into computer systems during his freshman year.   After earning a degree in engineering, he took a job with a government agency, largely to please his parents. But every night after work, he turns to his passion: hacking.    He is consumed by the challenges it presents. He reads hacker magazines, swaps information with a small circle of hackers and writes malicious code. He uses Trojan horses to sneak into people's computers and infect them, so he can take control.   ''Most hackers are lazy,'' he says, seated in front of a computer in his spare bedroom, which overlooks a dilapidated apartment complex. ''Only a few of us can actually write code. That's the hard part.''   Computer hacking is illegal in China. Last year, Beijing revised and stiffened a law that makes hacking  a crime, with punishments of up to seven years in prison. Majia seems to disregard the law, largely because it is not strictly enforced. But he does take care to cover his tracks.    Partly, he admits, the lure is money. Many hackers make a lot of money, he says, and he seems to be plotting his own path. Exactly how much he has earned, he won't say. But he does admit to selling malicious code to others; and boasts of being able to tap into people's bank accounts by remotely operating their computers.   Financial incentives motivate many young Chinese hackers like Majia, experts say. Scott J. Henderson, author of ''The Dark Visitor: Inside the World of Chinese Hackers,'' said he had spent years tracking Chinese hackers, sometimes with financial help from the United States government. One Chinese hacker who broke into a United States government site later lectured on hacking at a leading university, Mr. Henderson said, and  worked for China's security ministry. But recently, many have been seeking to profit from stealing data from big corporations, he said, or teaching others how to hijack computers.   ''They make a lot of money selling viruses and Trojan horses to infect other people's computers,''  Mr. Henderson said in a telephone interview. ''They also break into online gaming accounts, and sell the virtual characters. It's big money.''   Majia lives with his parents, and his bedroom has little more than a desktop computer, a high-speed Internet connection and a large closet. The walls are bare.   Most of his socializing occurs online, where he works from about 6:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m., starting every evening by perusing computer Web sites like cnBeta.com.   Asked why he doesn't work for a major Chinese technology company, he sneers at the suggestion, saying that it would restrain his freedom.    He even claims to know details of the Google attack. ''That Trojan horse on Google was created by a foreign hacker,'' he says, indicating that the virus was then altered in China. ''A few weeks before Google was hijacked, there was a similar virus. If you opened a particular page on Google, you were infected.''   Oddly, Majia said his parents did not know that he was hacking at night. But at one point, he explained the intricacies of computer hacking and stealing data while his mother stood nearby, listening silently, while offering a guest oranges and candy.   Majia and his fellow hackers keep secret their knowledge of certain so-called zero-day vulnerabilities  --  software flaws  --  for future use, he says.   ''Microsoft and Adobe have a lot of zero days,'' he said, while scanning Web sites at home. ''But we don't publish them. We want to save them so that some day we can use them.''   When asked whether hackers work for the government, or the military, he says ''yes.''   Does he? No comment, he says.   "
Hackers Said to Breach Gmail Accounts in China,"Google e-mail accounts of at least two foreign journalists in Beijing have been compromised, a journalists' advocacy group in China said on  Monday, adding that hackers changed Gmail program settings so that all messages would be forwarded to unfamiliar addresses.    The journalists apparently discovered the irregularities after Google announced last week that hackers had tried sophisticated attacks on its security infrastructure. The company suspects that those attacks originated in mainland China.    Google also said that two Gmail accounts had been compromised, adding separately that the e-mail accounts of dozens of people pressing for human rights in China had been hacked.   In response, Google said last week that it would talk to the Chinese government about ending self-censorship of its Chinese-language search engine, Google.cn, and that the company could close down or curtail its operations in China.   The two foreign journalists were among a large number of Gmail users in China who discovered that their accounts had been compromised after Google made its announcement. In many cases, it was unclear when the hackers had broken into the accounts.    The attacks on e-mail accounts were separate from those weeks ago aimed at the security infrastructure of Google and more than 30 other companies and entities, most of them based in Silicon Valley in  California.   One of the two journalists is a television reporter in the Beijing bureau of The Associated Press, which has one of the largest foreign news operations in China. E-mail messages in the reporter's account were being forwarded to an e-mail address that the reporter did not recognize. The reporter said that other people the reporter knew in Beijing had experienced the same kind of attack, though none of the forwarding addresses were the same.   It is not known who was behind the e-mail attacks or whether the Chinese government, whose security forces sometimes closely monitor the activities of foreign journalists, had any involvement.   ''We remind all members that journalists in China have been particular targets of hacker attacks in the last two years,'' the journalists' advocacy group, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China, said in its announcement concerning the compromised Gmail accounts.   Several human rights advocates in China said last week that their Gmail accounts had been compromised, among them Ai Weiwei, an artist, and Teng Biao, a lawyer.    People in the United States briefed on the investigation of the infrastructure attacks said Google was exploring all options, including the possibility that employees in China or elsewhere could have been involved. But that possibility did not appear to be central to the inquiry.    The people noted that the attacks were highly sophisticated and probably would have been successful whether or not Google had employees in China.   Dan Brody, Google's first employee in China, who now heads an Internet media investment company in Beijing, said speculation about moles in Google China's engineering department, while plausible, remained wholly unsupported.  "
Google Delays Release of Cellphones in China,"Google said Tuesday that it and a Chinese cellphone service company had postponed the release this week of two mobile phones that would use Google's Android software.    Google did not give a reason for the delay, but a person briefed on the situation said the company did not feel that the phones should be released given the current uncertainty over its Chinese operations and its Chinese-language search engine. The company announced last week that it would negotiate with Chinese officials over the government's unwelcome requirement that Google censor searches on its Chinese search engine, Google.cn. The company, based in Northern California, said it could shut down or curtail operations in China if the government did not relent.    Google made last week's announcement after it discovered that hacking attacks traced to mainland China had been directed at its security infrastructure and that of more than 30 other companies based in the United States. Google was also frustrated by separate attacks against the Google e-mail accounts of rights advocates working on China issues.   Opponents of China's complex system of Internet censorship, nicknamed  the Great Firewall, and of the authoritarian nature of the Communist Party in general were pleased with Google's move, though some skeptics say Google has little to lose from withdrawing from China since its search engine has  a relatively small market share here. Baidu, which runs a homegrown search engine, is dominant.   The announcement that Google and China Unicom were postponing the release of the cellphones showed that Google has more at stake in China than just the revenue from Google.cn.    The two phones were to be released on Wednesday and are made by Samsung and Motorola, with service provided by China Unicom. The phones use an open-platform software developed by Google called Android. Anyone can download the source code of Android, install the software on their cellphones and customize it. Because of this, cellphone companies have already offered Android phones in China, and individual users here have presumably used the software before.   What makes these two phones different is that Google has been working closely with Samsung, Motorola and China Unicom on their design and operating systems. Google applications had been carefully packaged with the phones.   Google thought it would be ''irresponsible'' to release the phones since it did not ''know how things are going to turn out in the coming weeks,'' the person briefed on the situation said. The person agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive political nature of the dispute between Google and China.   ''Put yourselves in the shoes of a consumer thinking about what phone to buy next week or the week after -- there's just a lot of uncertainty and confusion,'' the person said.   On Tuesday afternoon, Ma Zhaoxu, a foreign ministry spokesman, said at a news conference that ''foreign enterprises in China need to adhere to China's laws and regulations, respect the interests of the general public and cultural traditions, and shoulder corresponding responsibilities. Google is no exception.''  "
Stolen Facebook Accounts for Sale,"Researchers at VeriSign's iDefense division tracking the digital underworld say bogus and stolen accounts on the Facebook are now on sale in high volume on the black market.   During several weeks in February, iDefense tracked an effort to sell log-in data for 1.5 million Facebook accounts on several online criminal marketplaces, including one called Carder.su.   That  hacker, who used the screen name ''kirllos'' and appears to deal only in Facebook accounts, offered to sell bundles of 1,000 accounts with 10 or fewer friends for $25 and with more than 10 friends for $45, says Rick Howard, iDefense's director of cyber intelligence.    The case points to a significant expansion in the illicit market for social networking accounts from Eastern Europe  to the United States, he said.   Criminals steal log-in data for Facebook accounts, typically with ''phishing''  techniques that tricks users into disclosing their passwords or with malware  that logs keystrokes. They then use the accounts to send spam, distribute malicious programs and run identity and other fraud.   Facebook says it believes that the  hacker's claims to control large numbers  of Facebook accounts are bogus. The  company attempted to purchase accounts as part of its investigation into the  incident, said a spokesman, Barry  Schnitt. However, ''the hacker was unable to produce anything for our buyer,''  he said.   Facebook's investigators also discovered that ''kirllos'' has a reputation  ''for wild claims,'' he said.   ''We would expect iDefense or anyone  presenting themselves as a security expert to do this kind of verification (or any  verification) rather than just reading a  forum post and accepting the claims as fact and publicizing them,'' Mr. Schnitt  said in an e-mail message.   IDefense could not be immediately  reached for comment on the legitimacy  of the hacker's offer. However, it previously said that it did not purchase any of  the accounts as part of its study because that would violate its corporate policy.   Criminals  steal log-in data for Facebook accounts, typically with ''phishing'' techniques   that tricks users into disclosing their passwords or with malware that logs keystrokes. They then use the accounts to send spam, distribute malicious programs and run identity and other fraud.   Facebook accounts are attractive because of the higher level of trust on the site than exists in the broader Internet. People are required to use their real names and tend to connect primarily with people they know.   As a result, they are more likely to believe a fraudulent message or click on a dubious link on a friend's wall or an e-mail message. Moreover, the accounts allow criminals to mine profiles of victims and their friends for personal information like birth dates, addresses, phone numbers, mothers' maiden names, pets' names and other tidbits that can be used in identity theft.   Last summer, Eileen Sheldon's Facebook account was hacked and used to send messages to about 20 friends claiming she was stranded in  Britain without a passport and needed money. Ms. Sheldon, who lives in California, had recently been living in London, and one friend, believing the ruse, wired about $100 to the thieves.   Other friends smelled a fraud and warned Ms. Sheldon, who quickly reported the problem to Facebook.  She does not know how her password was stolen.   While the accounts that were compromised and offered for sale could be legitimate ones like Ms. Sheldon's, they  most likely also included bogus accounts,  Mr. Howard said. IDefense did not see  the accounts themselves, but the inclusion of many accounts with small numbers of friends suggests the seller could  have created fake accounts, perhaps using an automated tool, and sent out blind  friend requests.   Many users are eager to amass friends and accept friend requests from people they do not know, even though Facebook discourages it.   Facebook says it has sophisticated systems to defeat fake accounts, including tools for flagging them when they are created so they can be investigated. This allows Facebook to ''disable them before the bad guys get very far,'' a  spokesman, Simon Axten, said.   Facebook also monitors for unusual activity that is associated with fake accounts, like many friend requests in a short period of time and high rates of friend requests that are ignored. It also investigates reports of suspicious users .   The relatively low asking prices for the Facebook accounts points to the fact that Facebook accounts do not translate into instant profit. ''The people that buy these things are going to have to do more work to make money,'' Mr. Axten said.  "
India's Aim To Thwart Online Spies May Be Costly,"NEW DELHI -- As India prepares to adopt new import regulations designed to thwart spying and sabotage, the country's mobile phone operators say the costs of implementing the rules could squeeze their thin profits even further and accelerate an impending wave of consolidation in the industry. The proposed rules would require phone operators in India to have all foreign equipment they purchase inspected by third-party laboratories in the United States, Canada or Israel for the presence of spyware or ''malware'' -- software that could monitor or shut down the country's mobile phone networks.  The rules are being reviewed by the Indian Ministry of Law and Justice and are expected to be introduced shortly, said Rajan Mathews, director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India, a trade group. The rules would apply to network equipment like towers and switches but not to consumer handsets. India is concerned about spying and sabotage from neighboring countries, particularly China and Pakistan. A report this year by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said a gang of computer hackers based in China had conducted extensive spying operations in India, including obtaining information from the Department of Defense. The costs of implementing the regulations could accelerate consolidation in the world's second largest mobile market by subscribers, after China. Some Indian operators are already unprofitable and most charge less than one penny a minute for local calls. Last month, Reliance Communications, one of India's biggest operators, said it would sell 26 percent of the company to raise cash. ''At this point, no one has a clue'' about how the new rules will affect operators, said Mr. Mathews of the trade group. He said the rules are an interim step and that India plans to set up its own testing center for telecommunications equipment in the next few years. It could cost $100 million to set up that facility, he estimated. Mobile operators say that the companies that could be approved to do the inspections are EWA Canada of Ottawa; Infoguard, an information management company in a Lansdale, Pennsylvania; and Altal Security Consulting, based in Israel. Since December, telecommunications operators in India have been required to vet the purchase of any foreign equipment with the Ministry of Home Affairs, which deals with security concerns. The ministry has approved a few dozen purchases, and hundreds more are still waiting, operators in India say. Chinese equipment manufacturers have been effectively shut out of the country, operators say. The strain on Indian mobile phone networks is being felt strongly in some urban areas, with phone users facing dropped calls and ''network busy'' messages. Some personal data devices do not get signals for hours at a time. ''All orders have been on hold for the last seven months,'' said one telecommunications executive who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity about security concerns. The company has been unable to build its network in some rural areas, and service quality is being affected in other areas where it has gained new subscribers, he said. On Friday, A. Raja, a cabinet minister in the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference that he had recently met the minister of Home Affairs. ''We do hope the issue will be resolved with the Home Ministry in a couple of weeks,'' he said. A Ministry of Home Affairs spokesman declined to comment. At the end of May, India had 617 million mobile phone subscribers. Indian phone operators spent about $34 billion on equipment and other capital expenses in the past fiscal year, the trade group estimates, with about 40 percent of that from China. Many individuals in India have mobile phones but do not have landline phones, broadband Internet or any other telecommunications connection, making the mobile phone network incredibly important, operators here say. ''In India, you only have one network,'' said Mr. Mathews. ''If that goes down, you are finished.''  "
Inquiry Is Said to Link Attack On Google to Chinese Schools,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A series of online attacks on Google and dozens of other American corporations have been traced to computers at two educational institutions in China, including one with close ties to the Chinese military, say people involved in the investigation.  They also said the attacks, aimed at stealing trade secrets and computer codes and capturing e-mail of Chinese human rights activists, may have begun as early as April, months earlier than previously believed. Google announced on Jan. 12 that it and other companies had been subjected to sophisticated attacks that probably came from China.     Computer security experts, including investigators from the National Security Agency, have been working since then to pinpoint the source of the attacks. Until recently, the trail had led only to servers in Taiwan.   If supported by further investigation, the findings raise as many questions as they answer, including the possibility that some of the attacks came from China but not necessarily from the Chinese government, or even from Chinese sources.    Tracing the attacks further back, to an elite Chinese university and a vocational school, is a breakthrough in a difficult task. Evidence acquired by a United States military contractor that faced the same attacks as Google has even led investigators to suspect a link to a specific computer science class, taught by a Ukrainian professor at the vocational school.    The revelations were shared by the contractor at a meeting of computer security specialists.    The Chinese schools involved are Shanghai Jiaotong University and the Lanxiang Vocational School, according to several people with knowledge of the investigation who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the inquiry.    Jiaotong has one of China's top computer science programs. Just a few weeks ago its students won an international computer programming competition sponsored by I.B.M. -- the ''Battle of the Brains'' -- beating out Stanford and other top-flight universities.   Lanxiang, in east China's Shandong Province, is a huge vocational school that was established with military support and trains some computer scientists for the military. The school's computer network is operated by a company with close ties to Baidu, the dominant search engine in China and a competitor of Google.    Within the computer security industry and the Obama administration, analysts differ over how to interpret the finding that the intrusions appear to come from schools instead of Chinese military installations or government agencies. Some analysts have privately circulated a document asserting that the vocational school is being used as camouflage for government operations. But other computer industry executives and former government officials said it was possible that the schools were cover for a ''false flag'' intelligence operation being run by a third country. Some have also speculated that the hacking could be a giant example of criminal industrial espionage, aimed at stealing intellectual property from American technology firms.   Independent researchers who monitor Chinese information warfare caution that the Chinese have adopted a highly distributed approach to online espionage, making it almost impossible to prove where an attack originated.    ''We have to understand that they have a different model for computer network exploit operations,'' said James C. Mulvenon, a Chinese military specialist and a director at the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis in Washington. Rather than tightly compartmentalizing online espionage within agencies as the United States does, he said, the Chinese government often involves volunteer ''patriotic hackers'' to support its policies.    Spokesmen for the Chinese schools said they had not heard that American investigators had traced the Google attacks to their campuses.    If it is true, ''We'll alert related departments and start our own investigation,'' said Liu Yuxiang, head of the propaganda department of the party committee at Jiaotong University in Shanghai.    But when asked about the possibility, a leading professor in Jiaotong's School of Information Security Engineering said in a telephone interview: ''I'm not surprised. Actually students hacking into foreign Web sites is quite normal.'' The professor, who teaches Web security, asked not to be named for fear of reprisal.   ''I believe there's two kinds of situations,'' the professor continued. ''One is it's a completely individual act of wrongdoing, done by one or two geek students in the school who are just keen on experimenting with their hacking skills learned from the school, since the sources in the school and network are so limited. Or it could be that one of the university's I.P. addresses was hijacked by others, which frequently happens.''   At Lanxiang Vocational, officials said they had not heard about any possible link to the school and declined to say if a Ukrainian professor taught computer science there.   A man named Mr. Shao, who said he was dean of the computer science department at Lanxiang but refused to give his first name, said, ''I think it's impossible for our students to hack Google or other U.S. companies because they are just high school graduates and not at an advanced level. Also, because our school adopts close management, outsiders cannot easily come into our school.''    Mr. Shao acknowledged that every year four or five students from his computer science department were recruited into the military.   Google's decision to step forward and challenge China over the intrusions has created a highly sensitive issue for the United States government. Shortly after the company went public with its accusations, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton challenged the Chinese in a speech on Internet censors, suggesting that the country's efforts to control open access to the Internet were in effect an information-age Berlin Wall.   A report on Chinese online warfare prepared for the U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission in October 2009 by Northrop Grumman identified six regions in China with military efforts to engage in such attacks. Jinan, site of the vocational school, was one of the regions.   Executives at Google have said little about the intrusions and would not comment for this article. But the company has contacted computer security specialists to confirm what has been reported by other targeted companies: access to the companies' servers was gained by exploiting a previously unknown flaw in Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser.   Forensic analysis is yielding new details of how the intruders took advantage of the flaw to gain access to internal corporate servers. They did this by using a clever technique -- called man-in-the-mailbox -- to exploit the natural trust shared by people who work together in organizations.    After taking over one computer, intruders insert into an e-mail conversation a message containing a digital attachment carrying malware that is highly likely to be opened by the second victim. The attached malware makes it possible for the intruders to take over the target computer.    "
AT&T Said to Expose iPad Users' Addresses,"A group of hackers said Wednesday that it had obtained the e-mail addresses of 114,000 owners of 3G Apple iPads, including those of military personnel, business executives and public figures, by exploiting a security hole on AT&T's Web site.     The group, which calls itself Goatse Security and says it specializes in exposing security vulnerabilities, also obtained the identification number that those iPads use when they communicate over AT&T's network, known as an ICC-ID, according to a member of the group who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity.    AT&T acknowledged the breach, which was first reported by Gawker late Wednesday, but the company sought to minimize its importance.    ''AT&T was informed by a business customer on Monday of the potential exposure of their iPad ICC-IDs,'' AT&T said in a statement. ''The only information that can be derived from the ICC-IDs is the e-mail address attached to that device.''   AT&T said that by Tuesday it had turned off the feature on its Web site that allowed the group to find the e-mail addresses.    Apple did not respond to a request for comment.    The incident is likely to be a public relations black eye for AT&T, which is Apple's partner for wireless service on the iPhone and iPad in the United States. But security experts said it was not clear whether the breach would have serious consequences for those whose information was obtained.    Even in the wrong hands, e-mail addresses are of limited use beyond sending junk e-mail or attempting to pull people in with so-called phishing attacks, security experts said. What is more, e-mail addresses can be easy to guess. Members of the military are permitted to use only unclassified addresses on devices like the iPad.    But experts said that ICC-ID numbers could, in the right hands, be used to get other information, like an iPad's location.    The breach ''should be worrying people a lot,'' said Nick DePetrillo, an independent security consultant.   Michael Kleeman, a communications network expert at the University of California, San Diego, said that AT&T should never have stored the information on a publicly accessible Web site. But he added that the damage was likely to be limited.    ''You could in theory find out where the device is,'' Mr. Kleeman said. ''But to do that, you would have to gain access to very secure databases that are not generally connected to the public Internet.''     The list of e-mail addresses included military personnel, staff members in the Senate and the House, and people at the Justice Department, NASA and the Department of Homeland Security, said the group member. Private-sector addresses that were exposed include those of executives at The New York Times Company, Dow Jones, Conde Nast, Viacom, Time Warner, the News Corporation, and HBO,  the person said.    AT&T said  it would notify affected customers. ''We apologize to our customers who were impacted,'' it said.  "
F.B.I. Memos Reveal Cost Of Hacking On Google,"Repelling a hacker attack can be costly as PayPal, Visa and MasterCard undoubtedly found out last week as they tried - with mixed success - to keep their Web sites from being knocked offline by supporters of Wikileaks.  How much money exactly? An unrelated attack several years earlier on Google may provide some insight. In 2005 Google was battling the Santy worm, a bit of malicious software that caused infected computers across the globe to automatically enter search queries - so many, in fact, that Google was overwhelmed. Details of the episode are chronicled in internal F.B.I. memos obtained by The New York Times through a Freedom of Information Act request. On Dec. 22, 2005, Google complained to the F.B.I. that the attack had slowed its search engine's performance. For 12 to 18 months previous, Google said it had been plagued by variants of the worm, which used search queries to find vulnerable Web sites and deface them by exploiting a security hole in community forum software PHP Bulletin Board. Under pressure from antivirus groups, Google had tried to filter queries containing phrases linked to the worm, but with limited success. ''As Google filters out certain string search phrases, within minutes, the subjects modify the search phrase to once again bypass Google's filters,'' an F.B.I. agent in San Francisco wrote to colleagues in recommending that an investigation be opened. Moreover, Google's efforts to stop the worm had unintended consequences. Its filters blocked legitimate searches, the agent wrote. In a measure in the seriousness of the attack, Google devoted an entire engineering team to the battle. Preliminary estimates put the cost to the company in terms of man hours and lost revenue at up to $500,000, according to the report. A year earlier, Google suffered a $100,000 loss from the MyDoom virus, which caused Google's search engine to slow or stall for several hours, according to documents from a separate F.B.I. investigation. In examining the software code used in one variant of the Santy worm, Google engineers found a potential lead to the person responsible. In the code was embedded a Gmail address for a technical contact that the F.B.I. said may belong to the variant's creator. That e-mail address was redacted from the document as were the names of any Google employees who spoke with the F.B.I. The F.B.I. issued two subpoenas shortly thereafter for an individual or individuals to appear before a federal grand jury in San Jose. All information about the subpoenas' recipient was redacted. A few weeks later, Google had a change of heart. On Jan. 31, 2006, the F.B.I. noted that Google's legal department had told the agency that the company was no longer interested in any further investigation. ''Inasmuch as Google is the victim and their assistance in the form of providing logs is necessary to pursue prosecution, it is recommended this case be administratively closed,'' the F.B. I. agent wrote. Google, of course, recovered from the attack and continued its rapid growth. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Cars' Computer Systems Called at Risk to Hackers,"Automobiles, which will be increasingly connected to the Internet in the near future, could be vulnerable to hackers just as computers are now, two teams of computer scientists are warning in a paper to be presented next week.    The scientists say that they were able to remotely control braking and other functions, and that the car industry was running the risk of repeating the security mistakes of the PC industry.   ''We demonstrate the ability to adversarially control a wide range of automotive functions and completely ignore driver input -- including disabling the brakes, selectively braking individual wheels on demand, stopping the engine, and so on,'' they wrote in the report, ''Experimental Security Analysis of a Modern Automobile.''    In the paper, which will be presented at a computer security conference next week in Oakland, Calif., computer security specialists at the University of Washington and the University of California, San Diego, report that while modern cars have extensive safety engineering in the design of their computer control systems, little thought has been given to the potential threat of hackers who may want to take over the networks that increasingly control modern cars.   ''We noticed the extent to which automobiles were becoming computerized,'' said Stefan Savage, a computer scientist at U.C.S.D. who was a member of one of two groups that have been studying the electronic control units of two different cars to look for network vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a potential attacker. ''We found ourselves thinking we should try to get in front of this before it suddenly becomes an issue.''   The researchers, financed by the National Science Foundation, tested two versions of a late-model car in both laboratory and field settings. They  did not identify the maker or the brand of the car, but said they believed they were representative of the computer network control systems that have proliferated in most cars today.   The researchers asked what could happen if a hacker could gain access to the network of a car, said Tadayoshi Kohno, a University of Washington computer scientist. He said the research teams were able to demonstrate their ability to circumvent a wide variety of systems critical to the safety of drivers and passengers.   They also demonstrated what they described as ''composite attacks'' that showed their ability to insert malicious software and then erase any evidence of tampering after a crash.   The researchers were able to activate dozens of functions and almost all of them while the car was in motion.   Wireless connections are increasingly becoming available in a wide range of automobiles. For example, services like the OnStar system from General Motors now report vehicle position and diagnostic information to the manufacturer. The system can permit communications between passengers and emergency personnel in the event of a crash and can enable authorized OnStar personnel to remotely unlock cars and stop them for purposes of theft recovery.   ''Taken together, ubiquitous computer control, distributed internal connectivity, and telematics interfaces increasingly combine to provide an application software platform for external network access,'' the researchers write. ''There are thus ample reasons to reconsider the state of the vehicular computer security.''   The researchers said they did not address the question of the defenses the cars might have against remote access, but said the experience of the PC industry, which did not have extensive security problems until computers became networked, was worth remembering.   ''To be fair, you should expect that various entry points in the automotive environment are no more secure in the automotive environment than they are in your PC,'' Mr. Savage said.   Although there has been widespread speculation about the role of software-controlled systems in the safety crisis that Toyota has faced this year, the researchers said they were not exploring the general issue of the safety of computerized systems, only the issues related to network security.  "
A Code for Chaos,"IN June, a Belarus-based computer security firm identified a new computer malware program, Stuxnet, which was repeatedly crashing the computers of one of its clients. Then, last month, a German security researcher suggested that the program's real target might be the Iranian nuclear program -- and that clues in the coding suggested that Israel was the creator. Since then, there has been growing alarm about the worm, as its target and sophistication have become more apparent. The code has appeared in many countries, notably China, India, Indonesia and Iran. It appears designed to attack a certain type of Siemens industrial control computer, used widely to manage oil pipelines, electrical power grids and many kinds of nuclear plants. The question is: Just how dangerous has this worm and cyberwarfare become? How widespread is cyberwarfare?  A 2007 F.B.I. report asserted that 108 countries had at least some offensive cyberwarfare capabilities. And there has been widespread speculation that a secret cyberwar ''arms race'' is under way as a number of countries build sophisticated software and hardware attack capabilities. Most recent wars and military engagements, like Russia's quarrel with Estonia in 2007 or with Georgia in 2008, have been accompanied by a ''cyberwar'' engagement, in which government and financial Web sites have been targeted. What was the earliest case of cyberwarfare? In his book ''At the Abyss,'' Thomas C. Reed, a former secretary of the Air Force, described a software program known as a Trojan horse, in which industrial control software was covertly added by the United States to equipment being shipped to the Soviet Union from Canada. When the equipment was installed in a trans-Siberian gas pipeline in June 1982, it suddenly went haywire, touching off a huge explosion and fire, according to Mr. Reed. Another episode in January 1990, the collapse of AT&T's long-distance network, also raised suspicions of sabotage. But security experts have been concerned about potential cyberattacks since the 1970s, during the early days of the Arpanet, an experimental, military-financed research network that was the predecessor to the Internet. There was great concern about a network connection -- a now old-fashioned 9600 baud modem -- that had been installed by scientific researchers linking Moscow and the United States, via a mathematics research center in Vienna. When national security officials discovered the link, financing to the center was canceled. How is Stuxnet different? Stuxnet is the first widely analyzed malware program that is intended to jump from Windows-based computers to a specialized system used for controlling industrial equipment, like electric power grids, manufacturing plants, gas pipelines, dams and power plants. Previously, most high-profile cyberattacks have focused on Web sites and corporate or military networks. At least, that's true when it comes to proven cyberattacks. But there has also been speculation about episodes that could have been caused by sabotage. For example, The Los Angeles Times reported in 2001 that intrusions into the network that controlled the electrical grid were traced to someone in Guangdong Province, China. Later reports of other electric grid attacks have often included allegations that the break-ins were orchestrated by the Chinese, although no proof has been produced. In the case of Stuxnet, what are arguments for and against Israel's involvement? Ralph Langner, a German security researcher, was the first to point out that it appeared that the Stuxnet program had been tailored to attack a nuclear facility or a uranium enrichment plant. And several hints in the code suggest Israeli authorship, including a possible allusion to the Book of Esther, which describes Jewish retaliation against a Persian threat, and a number -- 19790509 -- that appears to refer to the date of the execution of an Iranian Jew by a firing squad in Tehran. But many military and intelligence analysts, including several with direct knowledge of Israeli intelligence operations, have said it is unlikely that either an Israeli or United States operation would leave such blatant clues. That leaves the possibility that someone wanted to plant evidence pointing incorrectly to Israeli involvement. Most computer security specialists say the authorship of the program may never be discovered. What kind of attack do computer security experts fear most? There has been widespread fear about attacks that jam or damage large financial networks, the electric power grid, power plants, transportation systems or any of the modern infrastructure underlying industrial economies. In many cases, the first step in securing these systems has been to insure that they are entirely separated from the Internet. However, even if they are separated from the Internet, in many cases they use internal networks based on the Internet protocol, as well as common computing equipment, like Microsoft and Intel-based computers. That means they remain potentially vulnerable to a ''sneakernet'' attack, in which a malicious program is physically carried into an isolated network either accidentally or by an intruder. Can this kind of attack be done by a lone hacker? In the case of Stuxnet, computer security specialists generally agree that it was not the work of one person but rather a team of sophisticated programmers. Many who have examined the malicious code have stated that it would have required an organization with substantial financial resources to develop, test and then release such a program. Certainly nations with cyberwar capabilities are potential suspects, but they are not the only possible creators. China, Israel and the Palestinians are all known to have irregular cyberarmies of motivated hackers with significant skills.  "
U.S. Treads Lightly in Wake of Google's Loud Stance on China,"Last month, when Google engineers at their sprawling campus in Silicon Valley began to suspect that Chinese intruders were breaking into private Gmail accounts, the company began a secret counteroffensive.   It managed to gain access to a computer in Taiwan that it suspected of being the source of the attacks. Peering inside that machine, company engineers actually saw evidence of the aftermath of the attacks, not only at Google, but also at at least 33 other companies, including Adobe Systems,  Northrop Grumman and Juniper Networks, according to a government consultant who has spoken with the investigators.   Seeing the breadth of the problem, they alerted American intelligence and law enforcement officials and worked with them to assemble powerful evidence that the masterminds of the attacks were not in Taiwan, but on the Chinese mainland.     But while much of the evidence, including the sophistication of the attacks, strongly suggested an operation run by Chinese government agencies, or at least approved  by them, company engineers could not definitively prove their case. Today that uncertainty, along with concerns about confronting the Chinese without strong evidence, has frozen the Obama administration's response to the intrusion, one of the biggest cyberattacks of its kind, and to some extent the response of other targets, including some of the most prominent American companies.    President Obama, who has repeatedly warned of the country's vulnerability to devastating cyberattacks, has said nothing in public about one of the biggest examples since he took office. And the White House, while repeating Mr. Obama's calls for Internet freedom, has not publicly demanded a Chinese government investigation. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who had been the most senior U.S. official to talk of the seriousness of the breach, discussed it on Thursday with a Chinese diplomat in Washington, however, and a senior administration official said there would be a ''demarche in coming days'' -- a diplomatic move.   On Thursday, China's Foreign Ministry deflected questions about Google's charges and dismissed its declaration that it would no longer ''self-censor'' searches conducted on google.cn, its Chinese search engine. A ministry spokeswoman said simply that online services in China must be conducted ''in accordance with the law.''   In interviews in which they disclosed new details of their efforts to solve the mystery, Google engineers said they doubted that a nongovernmental actor could pull off something this broad and well organized, but they conceded that even their counterintelligence operation, taking over the Taiwan server, could not provide the kind of airtight evidence needed to prove the case.   The murkiness of the attacks  is no surprise. For years the National Security Agency and other arms of the United States government have struggled with the question of ''attribution'' of an attack; what makes cyberwar so unlike conventional war is that it is often impossible, even in retrospect, to find where the attack began, or who was responsible.    The questions surrounding the Google attacks have companies doing business in China scrambling to confirm that they were victims. Symantec, Adobe and Juniper Networks acknowledged in interviews that they were investigating whether they had been attacked. Northrop and Yahoo, also described as subjects of the attacks, declined to comment.    Besides being unable to firmly establish the source of the attacks, Google investigators have been unable to determine the goal:  to gain commercial advantage; insert spyware; break into the Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents and American experts on China who frequently exchange e-mail messages with administration officials; or all three. In fact, at least one prominent Washington research organization with close ties to administration officials was among those hacked, according to one person familiar with the episode.   Even as the United States and companies doing business in China assess the impact, the attacks signal the arrival of a new kind of conflict between the world's No. 1 economic superpower and the country that, by year's end, will overtake Japan to become No. 2.   It makes the tensions of the past, over China's territorial claims or even the collision of an American spy plane and Chinese fighter pilots nine years ago, seem as outdated as a grainy film clip of Mao reviewing the May Day parade. But it also lays bare the degree to which China and the United States are engaged in daily cyberbattles, a covert war of offense and defense on which America is already spending billions of dollars a year.   Computer experts who track the thousands of daily attacks on corporate and government computer sites report that the majority of sophisticated attacks seem to emanate from China. What they cannot say is whether the hackers are operating on behalf of the Chinese state or in a haven that the Chinese have encouraged.    The latest episode illuminates the ambiguities.    For example, the servers that carried out many of the attacks were based in Taiwan, though a Google executive said ''it only took a few seconds to determine that the real origin was on the mainland.'' And at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, there is little doubt that Beijing was behind the attacks. Partly that is because while Mr. Obama was hailing a new era of cautious cooperation with China, Google was complaining of mounting confrontation, chiefly over Chinese pressure on it to make sure Chinese users could not directly link to the American-based ''google.com'' site, to evade much of the censorship the company had reluctantly imposed on its main Chinese portal, google.cn.    ''Everything we are learning is that in this case the Chinese government got caught with its hand in the cookie jar,'' said James A. Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, who consulted for the White House on cybersecurity last spring. ''Would it hold up in court? No. But China is the only government in the world obsessed about Tibet, and that issue goes right to the heart of their vision of political survival and putting down the separatists' movements.''    Over the years, there have been private warnings issued to China, notably after an attack on the computer systems used by the office of the defense secretary two years ago. A senior military official said in December that that attack ''raised a lot of alarm bells,'' but the attacker could not be pinpointed. The administration cautioned Chinese officials that attacks seemingly aimed at the national security leadership would not be tolerated, according to one American who took part in delivering that message.  "
Hacker's Arrest Offers a Peek Into an Elusive Russian Underworld,"MOSCOW -- On the Internet, he was known as BadB, a disembodied criminal flitting from one server to another selling stolen credit card numbers despite being pursued by the United States Secret Service. And in real life, he was nearly as untouchable -- because he lived in Russia. BadB's real name is Vladislav A. Horohorin, according to a statement released last week by the United States Justice Department, and he was a resident of Moscow before his arrest by the police in France during a trip to that country earlier this month. He is expected to appear soon before a French court that will decide on his potential extradition to the United States, where Mr. Horohorin could face up to 12 years in prison and a fine of $500,000 if he is convicted on charges of fraud and identity theft. For at least nine months, however, he lived openly in Moscow as one of the world's most wanted computer criminals.  The seizing of BadB provides a lens onto the shadowy world of Russian hackers, the often well-educated and sometimes darkly ingenious programmers who pose a recognized security threat to online commerce -- besides being global spam nuisances -- who often seem to operate with relative impunity. Law enforcement groups in Russia have been reluctant to pursue these talented authors of Internet fraud, for reasons, security experts say, of incompetence, corruption or national pride. In this environment, BadB's network arose as ''one of the most sophisticated organizations of online financial criminals in the world,'' according to a statement issued by Michael P. Merritt, the assistant director of investigations for the Secret Service, which pursues counterfeiting and some electronic financial fraud. As long ago as November 2009, the United States attorney's office in Washington, in a sealed indictment, identified BadB as Mr. Horohorin, a 27-year-old residing in Moscow with dual Ukrainian and Israeli citizenship. But it was not until Aug. 7 this year that Mr. Horohorin, who was traveling from Russia to France, was detained on a warrant from the United States as he boarded a plane to return to Russia at an airport in Nice, in southern France. The Secret Service released a statement on Aug. 11, when the indictment was unsealed. Max Milien, a Secret Service spokesman in Washington, said the agency could not comment about the decision to arrest Mr. Horohorin in France. Olga K. Shklyarova, spokeswoman for the Russian bureau of Interpol, said no American law enforcement agency had requested Mr. Horohorin's arrest in her country. ''We never received such a request,'' she said by telephone. According to the Secret Service statement, Mr. Horohorin managed Web sites for hackers who were able to steal large numbers of credit card numbers that were sold online anonymously around the globe. Those buyers would do the more dangerous work of running up fraudulent bills. The numbers were exchanged on Web sites called CarderPlanet -- carder.su and badb.biz -- according to the Secret Service, and payment was made indirectly through accounts at a Russian online settlement system known as Webmoney, an analogue to PayPal. Underscoring the nationalistic tone of much of Russian computer crime, one site featured a cartoon of the Russian prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin, awarding medals to Russian hackers. ''We awaiting you to fight the imperialism of the U.S.A.'' the site said, in approximate English. Mr. Horohorin lived openly in Moscow. As a foreign citizen, he registered with the police, according to Dmitri Zakharov, a spokesman for the Russian Association of Electronic Communication, an industry lobby for legitimate Russian Internet businesses, who cited a database of such registries. A phone number for Mr. Horohorin was out of service Thursday. Arrests in Russia for computer crimes are rare, even when hackers living in Russia have been publicly identified by outside groups, like Spamhaus, a nonprofit group in Geneva and in London that tracks sources of spam. The F.B.I. in 2002 resorted to luring a Russian suspect, Vasily Gorshkov, to the United States with a fake offer of a job interview (with a fictitious Internet company called Invita), rather than ask the Russian police for help. To obtain evidence in the case, F.B.I. computer experts had hacked into Mr. Gorshkov's computer in Russia. When this was revealed, Russian authorities expressed anger that the F.B.I. had resorted to a cross-border tactic. Online fraud is not a high priority for the Russian police, Mr. Zakharov said, because most of it is aimed at computer users in Europe or the United States. ''This is a main reason why spammers are not arrested,'' he said. Politics may also play a role. Vladimir Sokolov, deputy director of the Institute of Information Security, a Russian research organization, said the United States and Russia were still at odds on basic issues of computer security, although the differences were narrowing. The United States tends to view computer security as a law enforcement matter. Russia has pushed for an international treaty that would regulate the use of online weapons by military or espionage agencies. Last year the United States opened talks on a treaty, but it has continued to press for closer law enforcement cooperation, Mr. Sokolov said. Computer security researchers have raised a more sinister prospect: that criminal spamming gangs have been co-opted by the intelligence agencies in Russia, which provide cover for their activities in exchange for the criminals' expertise or for allowing their networks of virus-infected computers to be used for political purposes -- to crash dissident Web sites, perhaps. Sometimes, the collateral damage for online business is immediate. A year ago, for example, hackers used a network of infected computers to direct huge amounts of junk traffic at the social networking accounts of a 34-year-old political blogger in Georgia, a country that fought a war with Russia in 2008. The attack, though, spun out of control and briefly crashed the global service of Twitter and slowed Facebook and LiveJournal, affecting tens of millions of computer users worldwide. The Russian authorities have repeatedly denied that the state has any connection to such attacks. Spamhaus says 7 of the top 10 spammers in the world are based in the former Soviet Union, in Ukraine, Russia and Estonia. More ominously, Western law enforcement agencies have traced a code intended for breaking into banking sites to Russian programming. In 2007, Swedish experts identified a Russian hacker known only by his colorful sobriquet -- the Corpse -- as the author of a virus that logged keystrokes on personal computers to capture passwords for Nordea, a Swedish bank, and the accounts were drained of about $1 million. For a time, these rogue programs were openly for sale on a Russian Web site. The home page displayed an illustration of Lenin making a rude gesture. Since Mr. Horohorin's arrest, the badb.biz Web site has gone dark. But through Monday, at least, its CarderPlanet counterpart, the Russian site carder.su, was still open for business.  "
"Follow the Law, China Tells Internet Companies","Two days after Google announced that it would quit China unless the nation's censors eased their grip, the Chinese government offered an indirect but unambiguous response: Companies that do business in China must follow the laws of the land.   The comments, by two different officials on Thursday, suggested that China was unlikely to give ground on Google's demands that its search engine results be unfiltered. In announcing its decision on Tuesday that it might leave the world's biggest Internet market, Google also cited a series of cyberattacks aimed at breaching the accounts of human rights advocates on its e-mail service, Gmail.    Several of those who said their e-mail accounts were hacked provided more details about the assaults on Thursday.   After a day of silence, the Foreign Ministry said that China welcomed foreign Internet companies but that those offering online services must do so ''in accordance with the law.'' Speaking at a scheduled news conference, Jiang Yu, a ministry spokeswoman, did not address Google's complaints about censorship and cyberattacks and simply stated that ''China's Internet is open.''   The remarks, and those of another high-ranking official who called for even tighter Internet restrictions, may speed Google's departure and increase friction between Beijing and the Obama administration, which has made priorities of Internet freedom and online security.   On Wednesday, Nicholas Shapiro, a White House spokesman, said he found Google's accusations of cyberintrusion ''troubling,'' but beyond that, United States officials had yet to say how they might respond.   If the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman's comments were vague, those of Wang Chen, the information director for the State Council, or China's cabinet, were more pointed.   In the transcript of an interview posted Thursday on the council's Web site, Mr. Wang urged Internet companies to increase scrutiny of news or information that might threaten national stability and emphasized the importance of ''guiding'' online public opinion.   Web sites in China are required to employ people who monitor and delete objectionable content; tens of thousands of others are paid to ''guide'' bulletin board Web exchanges in the government's favor.   ''China's Internet is entering an important stage of development, confronting both rare opportunities and severe challenges,'' Mr. Wang said. ''Internet media must always make nurturing positive, progressive mainstream opinion an important duty.''   Despite what appeared to be an unsympathetic stance toward Google, some analysts and writers saw an opening for compromise. Zhao Jing, a journalist and blogger popularly known as Michael Anti, described the government's initial response as having struck a balance between moderation and not wanting to appear too quiescent to its domestic audience.   He said Google's stature and the United States' increasingly vocal stance on Internet freedom could not easily be ignored. Google's pulling out, he said, would ''set a bad example for the business climate in China and make a joke of the government claims of a free Internet.''   Such optimism was hard to find in the state-run Chinese media. Those that even covered the cyberattacks in much detail portrayed Google's move as a cynical attempt either to embarrass Beijing or to escape its business failings in China. Even the English-language China Daily, which provides foreign readers a reliably liberal selection of news, ran on its front page the headline ''Google Pullout Threat 'a Pressure Tactic.'''   Guo Liang, the director of the China Internet Project at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said he thought Google's accusations were little more than public whining. ''Google may use politics as its excuse, which is easy for Westerners to accept, but in essence this is just a business failure,'' he said in an interview. ''If I were the government, I wouldn't even bother to respond.''   Both inside China and overseas, the number of people stepping forward to report accounts of hacking, both suspected and successful, continued to rise.    Zeng Jinyan, the wife of the imprisoned rights defender Hu Jia, said on her blog that shadow copies of recent e-mail messages she had sent had automatically been sent to an address she did not recognize.   Teng Biao, a civil rights lawyer, discovered the same thing. In an interview, he said copies had been sent to a Gmail address just two characters different from his own.   Tenzin Seldon, a Tibetan activist and a student at Stanford University in California, said Google had examined her laptop and confirmed that hackers had gained access to her Gmail account.   And in Washington, Nury A. Turkel, a lawyer who advocates for China's Uighur minority, said that he was certain someone had hacked into his Gmail account because text he had used in a message ended up in the body of an e-mail message that he said was harboring a virus.   Among those who say they were victimized was Gregory Fayer, a lawyer who represents a California software maker suing the Chinese government over claims of piracy. He said more than a dozen employees at the firm had received e-mail messages on Monday that purported to come from their managing partner.   Investigators, he said, later determined that the messages were so-called Trojan horse attacks intended to breach computers and allow the infiltrators to remove files. ''We have no idea who is sending these, but they're very sophisticated,'' said Mr. Fayer, whose client, Cybersitter, filed a $2.2 billion suit last week. ''People feel violated.''   Among Chinese Internet users, there was widespread talk about what appeared to be a loosening of restrictions on Google's China-based search engine. On Wednesday and Thursday, the words ''Tiananmen Incident'' was ranked as the fastest rising search terms on Google.cn. At some points, search results yielded iconic images of the lone man blocking a column of tanks during the pro-democracy demonstrations of 1989 and even a graphic photograph of those killed during the government's violent crackdown.   But there were limits. By Thursday evening, many of the same topics, including politically toxic subjects like ''Tibetan Independence'' or Web sites sponsored by Falun Gong, the banned spiritual group, brought up a familiar tagline: ''In accordance with local laws, regulations, and policies, some search results are not shown.''  "
Activists Say Web Assault For Assange Is Expanding,"LONDON -- The online activist group Anonymous, which has been waging a campaign of cyberattacks in defense of WikiLeaks, opened new offensives on Friday as Internet security experts said that tens of thousands more supporters had downloaded the attack software in the days since the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, was jailed in Britain. The Web site for Moneybookers, a British PayPal competitor that ceased dealings with WikiLeaks in recent days, was under attack on Friday, according to members of Anonymous who were reached by e-mail and online chat services and who asked for anonymity in discussing activity that could be illegal. Independent Internet security analysts confirmed the accounts.  Amazon.com, MasterCard, Visa and PayPal are among the other commercial sites that, after halting their dealings with WikiLeaks, have been struggling with overwhelming demands for access that have crashed or drastically slowed their sites. Some governmental sites have also been hit. On Friday, Dutch prosecutors said their Web site had been overwhelmed in attacks they connected to their arrest of a 16-year-old in The Hague on Thursday, Reuters reported. The police said the teenager had admitted to aiding in the attacks on MasterCard and Visa. He has been ordered to spend 13 days in custody while the case is being examined, according to Reuters. The attackers -- operating by the thousands behind the shroud of the Internet -- are rallying behind Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks as champions of freedom of information, and are defying those who they believe are influenced by the American government to halt the disclosures of classified documents. That belief appears to be broadening, despite denials from the companies, the American government and the Swedish prosecutors seeking to question Mr. Assange on accusations of sexual coercion. An international Internet security company, Imperva, said Friday that until Tuesday there had been less than 1,000 daily downloads of the Anonymous software used against Moneybookers and in other attacks. That was when Mr. Assange was jailed in Britain on an extradition warrant in the Swedish case. The number of downloads then leaped to about 10,000 a day, most coming from the United States, it said. The United States government has been looking into ways to pursue prosecutions over the leaks, and on Friday, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said that the Justice Department was investigating the Web attacks as well, Reuters reported. But Mr. Holder also added to the denials that American pressure was behind the moves against Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks, telling reporters in San Francisco, ''We have not pressured anybody to do anything.'' Paul Mutton, a Web security analyst with the British firm netcraft, said that the attackers were not being as invisible as they might hope. ''Maybe people taking part think they're just downloading software,'' he said, ''but they are doing something illegal, and particularly if they have a high-bandwidth Internet connection, they may be found.'' In conversations late Thursday, several of the group's members said that support for the campaign was growing significantly beyond the 1,000 or so core activists who began it last weekend with the release of two manifestos. Many of the new attackers, they said, are ordinary people using available tools to defend the right to information. ''We're technically not hackers, though we do have some professionals on board,'' one said. ''We're mostly normal people, we have doctors and lawyers and guys who work at McDonald's.'' He said, ''We see WikiLeaks as a litmus test for freedom of speech.'' Previous high-profile campaigns by Anonymous, most notably against the Church of Scientology in 2008 and 2009, put enough infrastructure in place for the group to be able to handle the rush of new supporters, said Gregg Housh, a member of the group who helped instigate that campaign but who disavowed any personal illegal action. ''There are propaganda people and programming people and different groups with different levels of engagement,'' he said. In the campaign in defense of WikiLeaks, those groups are marshaled by five to 10 core members who occupy a private chat room on an Anonymous online forum, according to group members.  "
20-Year Sentence in Theft of Card Numbers,"BOSTON (AP) -- A computer hacker from Florida was sentenced Thursday to 20 years in prison for helping engineer one of the largest thefts of credit and debit card numbers in American  history.    Judge Patti Saris of Federal District Court sentenced the hacker,  Albert Gonzalez of Miami, who pleaded guilty last year to breaking into computer systems of major retailers, including TJX Companies  and BJ's Wholesale Club.   Prosecutors  sought 25 years for Mr. Gonzalez, saying he victimized millions of people and cost companies, banks and insurers nearly $200 million. His lawyer argued Mr. Gonzalez should get no more than 15 years.   Mr. Gonzalez pleaded guilty last year in three separate hacking cases brought in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. The Thursday hearing dealt with the Massachusetts case. A second sentencing Friday, also in Boston, will deal with the others.   Mr. Gonzalez's Boston lawyer, Martin Weinberg,  said his client, a self-taught computer expert, displayed behavior consistent with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism.     A defense psychiatrist's report described Mr. Gonzalez as a socially awkward Internet addict with an  ''idiot savantlike genius for computers and information technology.''   Authorities said Mr. Gonzalez and two foreign co-defendants, with a laptop computer,  would drive past retailers and tap into those with vulnerable wireless Internet signals.    They would then install  ''sniffer programs'' that picked off credit and debit card numbers as they moved through a retailer's computers before trying to sell the numbers overseas, authorities said.   Mr. Gonzalez, known online as  ''soupnazi,'' became a Secret Service informant after he was first arrested for hacking in 2003.   But even as he helped the government catch other hackers, prosecutors said, he kept breaking into retailers' computer systems, amassing $2.8 million he used to buy a Miami condominium, a car, Rolex watches and a Tiffany ring for his girlfriend.  "
Iran Fights Malware Attacking Computers,"WASHINGTON -- The Iranian government agency that runs the country's nuclear facilities, including those the West suspects are part of a weapons program, has reported that its engineers are trying to protect their facilities from a sophisticated computer worm that has infected industrial plants across Iran. The agency, the Atomic Energy Organization, did not specify whether the worm had already infected any of its nuclear facilities, including Natanz, the underground enrichment site that for several years has been a main target of American and Israeli covert programs.  But the announcement raised suspicions, and new questions, about the origins and target of the worm, Stuxnet, which computer experts say is a far cry from common computer malware that has affected the Internet for years. A worm is a self-replicating malware computer program. A virus is malware that infects its target by attaching itself to programs or documents. Stuxnet, which was first publicly identified several months ago, is aimed solely at industrial equipment made by Siemens that controls oil pipelines, electric utilities, nuclear facilities and other large industrial sites. While it is not clear that Iran was the main target -- the infection has also been reported in Indonesia, Pakistan, India and elsewhere -- a disproportionate number of computers inside Iran appear to have been struck, according to reports by computer security monitors. Given the sophistication of the worm and its aim at specific industrial systems, many experts believe it is most probably the work of a state, rather than independent hackers. The worm is able to attack computers that are disconnected from the Internet, usually to protect them; in those cases an infected USB drive is plugged into a computer. The worm can then spread itself within a computer network, and possibly to other networks. The semiofficial Mehr news agency in Iran on Saturday quoted Reza Taghipour, a top official of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, as saying that ''the effect and damage of this spy worm in government systems is not serious'' and that it had been ''more or less'' halted. But another Iranian official, Mahmud Liai of the Ministry of Industry and Mines, was quoted as saying that 30,000 computers had been affected, and that the worm was ''part of the electronic warfare against Iran.'' ISNA, another Iranian news agency, had reported Friday that officials from Iran's atomic energy agency had been meeting in recent days to discuss how to remove the Stuxnet worm, which exploits some previously unknown weaknesses in Microsoft's Windows software. Microsoft has said in recent days that it is fixing those vulnerabilities. It is extraordinarily difficult to trace the source of any sophisticated computer worm, and nearly impossible to determine for certain its target. But the Iranians have reason to suspect they are high on the target list: in the past, they have found evidence of sabotage of imported equipment, notably power supplies to run the centrifuges that are used to enrich uranium at Natanz. The New York Times reported in 2009 that President George W. Bush had authorized new efforts, including some that were experimental, to undermine electrical systems, computer systems and other networks that serve Iran's nuclear program, according to current and former American officials. The program is among the most secret in the United States government, and it has been accelerated since President Obama took office, according to some American officials. Iran's enrichment program has run into considerable technical difficulties in the past year, but it is not clear whether that is because of the effects of sanctions against the country, poor design for its centrifuges, which it obtained from Pakistan, or sabotage. ''It is easy to look at what we know about Stuxnet and jump to the conclusion that it is of American origin and Iran is the target, but there is no proof of that,'' said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and one of the country's leading experts on cyberwar intelligence. ''We may not know the real answer for some time.'' Based on what he knows of Stuxnet, Mr. Lewis said, the United States is ''one of four or five places that could have done it -- the Israelis, the British and the Americans are the prime suspects, then the French and Germans, and you can't rule out the Russians and the Chinese.'' President Obama has talked extensively about developing better cyberdefenses for the United States, to protect banks, power plants, telecommunications systems and other critical infrastructure. He has said almost nothing about the other side of the cybereffort, billions of dollars spent on offensive capability, much of it based inside the National Security Agency. The fact that the worm is aimed at Siemens equipment is telling: the company's control systems are used around the world, but have been spotted in many Iranian facilities, say officials and experts who have toured them. Those include the new Bushehr nuclear power plant, built with Russian help. But Bushehr is considered by nuclear weapons experts to be virtually no help to Iran in its suspected weapons program; there is more concern about the low-enriched uranium produced at Natanz, which could, with a year or more of additional processing, be converted to bomb fuel.

Hackers Hit Europe's Carbon Market,"The latest setback for carbon trading has come from cyberspace. Fraudsters used faked e-mail messages to obtain access codes for individual accounts on national registries that are part of the European Emission Trading System, then carried out a number of transactions before they were discovered, according to a number of European authorities.  In the case of Germany, seven of about 2,000 users who received the fake e-mail messages gave the hackers access to their accounts. About 250,000 allowances, with a value of about 12 euros each - about $16 - were improperly transferred on Jan. 28, according to Hans-Juergen Nantke, a spokesman for the German Emissions Trading Authority.   (A warning to traders about the scam from the German trading authority is here.) The fraudsters ""could have made money,"" Mr. Nantke said. ""They transferred allowances to accounts in Denmark and Great Britain and then further traded to other accounts so they probably were able to carry out sales.""  Mr. Nantke said his authority immediately warned all 2,000 users in Germany when the problem came to light. Those users are made up of about 1,650 businesses and factories, and about 350 traders and bankers.  The fraudsters used ""a malicious Web site"" and asked respondents to ""disclose their user identification code and password"" - a practice known as phishing in the jargon of the Internet - according to the European Commission, which oversees the system. A ""fake Web site appeared genuine by using the Commission's visual identity,"" the commission said in a statement, adding that it had been alerted by authorities in the Netherlands and Norway.  ""The Commission also started immediate investigations of the fake Web site and is working on closing it definitively,"" it said.  The attack came as the commission prepares to expand the system to cover the aviation sector in 2012. All airlines landing in the European Union or taking off from the trade bloc - including American carriers - will need to hold a certain quantity of credits.  Those credits are likely to be accessible through some of the same national registries that were part of the cyberattack. The commission insisted that the security of the Community Registry and the Community Independent Transaction Log - the central data banks that hold records of all credits, trades and transactions - had ""not been compromised.""  But to counter a recurrence of such an attack, the commission said it had ""proposed a number of elements aimed at achieving high-security standards in its legislation to prepare for the inclusion of the aviation sector.""  It also said that it had proposed an action plan in case of future such incidents. The trading system, in operation since 2005, already includes the credits that companies must hold in sectors including power generation, chemicals and steel making. President Obama has recommended that the United States adopt a similar system to control greenhouse gases.  But in Europe, where the system is most advanced, it has had a rocky start.  Coal-burning utilities have earned windfall profits from the system, while the prices of credits have never been high enough for long enough to force utilities and businesses to replace conventional power with significant quantities of renewable energy and other clean sources.  Fraudsters also have added the E.U.'s value added tax to the price of carbon permits sold to businesses, then disappeared before turning the tax over to the government - although authorities across Europe say they have plugged that loophole.

Breaking Into the Smartphone (Risks Included),"Keith Medenblik is captivated by the iPhone. He bought his first iPhone, the 3G model, two years ago. A year later he upgraded to a 3GS and more recently to Apple's newest creation, the iPhone 4. Soon after buying his first iPhone, Mr. Medenblik heard of jailbreaking, a way to broaden the phone's potential by circumventing the software controls put in place by Apple. He liked what it offered but was hesitant to give it a try. Then, finally, he took the plunge.  ''I kept thinking I was going to damage the phone,'' said Mr. Medenblik, a network engineer in Tulsa, Okla. The jailbreak went smoothly and enabled Mr. Medenblik to buy two applications outside of Apple's App Store -- a text-messaging program and a tethering program that turns his phone into a Wi-Fi hot spot. He said he would not jailbreak if these features were made available through Apple and AT&T, the service provider. Stories are similar for owners of phones that run Google's Android platform, like the Nexus One, Droid X and Sprint's HTC EVO, though usually the process is called rooting. Chas Percodani, 25, of Athol, Mass., rooted his HTC EVO to bolster the phone's speed and performance, but also for more philosophical reasons. ''I feel that I should have control and be able to install what I want, use the phone the way I want to,'' said Mr. Percodani, who is planning to study computer programming. Because today's smartphones pack the power of personal computers, they attract innovators, hackers and people who want the freedom to customize. In a jailbreak or root, the user slips through the phone's defenses and takes down barriers established by phone makers. It is not a common practice, partly because people have the impression it is illegal. A recent ruling by the Library of Congress said jailbreaking did not violate copyright laws. That decision, combined with new techniques that make jailbreaking and rooting easier, has added fresh momentum to the movement. Flurry, an analytics company that tracks the behavior of iPhone users, said the number of jailbroken devices fluctuates from 5 to 8 percent. Jailbreaking has downsides. It may void a phone's warranty, though a jailbreak can be reversed. Security precautions do need to be taken. After jailbreaking, you should change the password for the all-powerful user known as root, according to David Marcus, director of security research and communications for McAfee Labs. Otherwise, he said, the phone is vulnerable to attack. It is also important to use the same vigilance you use when considering a program for your computer. Some programs may be malicious. Learn about the developers by visiting their Web sites, reading reviews and talking to other users to gain assurances of reliability and trustworthiness. Apple maintains a tight grip on the iPhone experience by wielding veto power over what developers can sell at the App Store and by limiting the scope of their programming powers. Apple, which argued against jailbreaking in the copyright case, says it comes with risks. It can severely degrade the iPhone experience and cause the iPhone to become unreliable, according to Natalie Harrison, an Apple spokeswoman. Should you want to try jailbreaking anyway, numerous methods are available. After navigating to jailbreakme.com, using the phone's Safari browser, a jailbreak can take place quickly if the phone's operating system, called iOS, is a supported version. Other ways to jailbreak are made available at sites like Spiritjb.com and Limera1n.com. A new site, HelpMeJailbreak.com, publishes a list of options based on the phone's model and iOS version. Some of the better apps that are then available include iRealSMS ($12.99, irealsms.com), the text-messaging app that Mr. Medenblik likes. He can send and receive messages while other apps like video and games are still running. IRealSMS and other programs, including MyWi ($19.99, intelliborn.com), the app that can turn an iPhone into a Wi-Fi hot spot, are available from a store called Cydia (cydia.saurik.com). Users can buy apps, themes and lesser-known programs called tweaks. In these, programmers have figured out ways to modify other apps. A tweak called YourTube (cocoanuts.co), for example, adds a download option to the YouTube app that comes with the phone, enabling users to save videos. Rooting an Android phone is similar to jailbreaking an iPhone. There are various ways to root phones. A program called Easy Root ($.99, unstableapps.com/buyme.html) is fast though it supports only a few models. Another source for rooting is RootzWiki (rootzwiki.com). Custom versions of the operating system, called custom ROMs, are one benefit of rooting. They are created by programmers like Steven Bird, known among Android hackers as Birdman. ''It's something that is actually yours,'' said Mr. Bird, who recently developed one for the Droid X. ''It's not just whatever the manufacturer gives you.'' Earl Dombroski of Albuquerque installed a ROM on his HTC EVO. He got it from XDA Developers (xda-developers.com) and prepared by reviewing the installation steps and practicing for about a day. The actual process took less than an hour. ''It was a lot less scary than I was anticipating,'' said Mr. Dombroski, who has experience in computer programming. After installing the ROM, he was able to remove several preinstalled applications that came with the phone. The result, he said, was improved battery life. Also because of root access he can use Titanium Backup (free, matrixrewriter.com/android), an app that enables him to quickly restore entire backups of his phone. Other rooters, like Mr. Percodani, are increasing the speed of their phones by over-clocking the processor with SetCPU ($1.99, pokedev.com/setcpu), an app that also lets you reduce the speed to improve battery life. Others are turning their phones into Wi-Fi hot spots with Wireless Tether for Root Users (free, code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether). Apps for rooted phones are available in Google's Android Market store by searching for keywords like root or rooted. For Android phones, too, there are rooting risks. It voids phone warranties and it risks damaging the phone. One misstep during a root and you could turn the phone into an expensive paperweight, a mishap the Android community calls bricking.  "
Voting Test Falls Victim To Hackers,"Hackers infiltrated the District of Columbia's online voting system last week. They changed all votes for mayor to Master Control Pro and elected HAL 9000 the council chairman. The blaring University of Michigan fight song played whenever a new ballot was successfully cast.  The hackers, a team of computer scientists from Ann Arbor, Mich., were capable of damage far less sophomoric. When the District's Board of Elections and Ethics issued an open invitation for hackers to find vulnerabilities in a pilot system to allow overseas and military voters to cast ballots over the Web, it took about 36 hours for J. Alex Halderman and his students to break in. They found a document containing the names and 16-digit passwords of all 937 voters who were invited to use the system during the real election on Nov. 2. The team could have used the data to ''vote in the name of every real voter and keep the real voters from voting,'' Professor Halderman told the Council of the District of Columbia on Friday. He said he also saw signs that computer users in Iran and China were trying to crack the system's master password -- which his team obtained from an equipment manual. (Network administrators had never changed the four-character default password.) He said that the foreign hackers were probably not specifically trying to break into the District's voting system, but that they represented a threat nonetheless. It took the elections board two days to notice the pranks. ''A real attack might be completely invisible and could've gone on undetected for much, much longer,'' Professor Halderman said. He testified with other members of a coalition that contends that security technology might never be adequate for voting by secret ballot. ''The next set of people who test it will find a whole new set of problems,'' Jeremy Epstein, a computer scientist at the policy group SRI International who was also critical of the voting system, said Friday during an interview. Since the test, the elections board has scaled back the Web voting plan, though voters may still print out a ballot and mail it in. But Paul Stenbjorn, the board's director of information services, said there were no plans to abandon the project. ''The lesson learned is not to be more timid, but more aggressive about solving the problem,'' he responded. ''The computer science community needs to understand that this toothpaste is already out of the tube, and no volume of warnings can put it back,'' he said. Mr. Epstein said that computer voting has been tried in Estonia and in some recent primaries in America, but added that the ballots had not been anonymous. Currently, several West Virginia counties are participating in a pilot project to use online voting next month for Americans overseas and in the military.  "
U.S. Workers Are on Alert After Breach Of Data,"WASHINGTON -- Federal workers at the General Services Administration are on alert against identity theft after an employee sent the names and Social Security numbers of the agency's entire staff to a private e-mail address.  The agency, which manages federal property, employs more than 12,000 people. Officials apologized to employees for the incident in a letter dated Oct. 25 -- almost six weeks after the breach occurred. The agency said it had paid for employees to enroll in a one-year program to monitor their credit reports, along with up to $25,000 in identity theft insurance coverage. The letter was signed by Casey Coleman, the chief information officer, and Gail Lovelace, the agency's senior privacy official. Neither returned calls or e-mails for comment. Sara Merriam, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in a statement on Wednesday: ''Ensuring the security of employee data is no small challenge in large organizations. We will continue to evolve our protocols to protect the employee information entrusted to us.'' Documents show that officials first notified employees on Sept. 28. But workers who spoke with The New York Times said they did not learn of the incident until early November, when the letters arrived in the mail. Previous notices had been sent as security alert e-mails, which employees said they received frequently and often ignored. According to interviews and documents obtained by The Times, technicians discovered the e-mail with names and Social Security numbers while reviewing logs on Sept. 22, a week after the message was sent, and deleted it from the recipient's e-mail account and laptop. The agency explained to employees that one worker had apparently transmitted the file containing the personal data by accident while seeking ''work-related assistance,'' and that it had not been forwarded. Those involved had cooperated, and the computer that received the data was scrubbed clean by agency technicians. Still, Jack Hanley, who presides over a council representing the roughly 4,000 General Services employees who are members of the National Federation of Federal Employees union, said the agency's delay in notifying employees had put them at greater risk. Additionally, he said, employees would remain vulnerable after the one-year period. ''Some of them have come to our office who have worked years to clean up their credit and have just got mortgages approved,'' he said in an interview on Wednesday. ''And now if someone messes with their credit, they're going to lose.'' According to the documents, the agency inspector general is investigating the incident. The inspector general, Brian Miller, did not return calls for comment.  "
Security and Privacy,"To the Editor: I was pleased to read your Nov. 16 editorial ''Searching Your Laptop.'' Two years ago I introduced legislation regarding laptop searches identical to what your editorial describes.  My bill, the Securing Our Borders and Our Data Act (H.R. 239), would require a border agent to have a reasonable suspicion before searching a traveler's laptop, BlackBerry, cellphone or other electronic device. It would also require a higher standard for an agent to seize a device or make a copy of any data. An electronic device is not like a piece of luggage. Laptops often contain vast amounts of personal or confidential data; travelers store health and personal data, lawyers have client records, doctors could have patients' health data. I want to ensure our security as much as anyone, and it makes sense to expect your luggage to be scanned or searched upon arriving in our country. However, we should also expect a certain level of privacy with our most personal and confidential information. We can protect ourselves from terrorists, or others who wish to do us harm, while maintaining our privacy rights. We must defend our country, just as we must also defend our constitutional rights as Americans. Eliot L. Engel Member of Congress, 17th Dist., N.Y. Washington, Nov. 17, 2010  "
Europe Distrusted U.S. Efforts To Monitor Bank Transactions,"WASHINGTON -- When the European Parliament ordered a halt in February to an American government program to monitor international banking transactions for terrorist activity, the Obama administration was blindsided by the rebuke.  ''Paranoia runs deep especially about US intelligence agencies,'' a secret cable from the American Embassy in Berlin said. ''We were astonished to learn how quickly rumors about alleged U.S. economic espionage'' had taken root among German politicians who opposed the program, it said. The memo was among dozens of State Department cables that revealed the deep distrust of some traditional European allies toward what they considered American intrusion into their citizens' affairs without stringent oversight. The program, created in secrecy by the Bush administration after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, has allowed American counterterrorism officials to examine banking transactions routed through a vast database run by a Brussels consortium known as Swift. When the program was disclosed in 2006 by The New York Times, just months after the newspaper reported the existence of the National Security Agency's warrantless wiretapping program, it set off protests in Europe and forced the United States to accept new restrictions. But by 2010, new leaders at the European Parliament had what one State Department memo called ''a fixation'' on privacy issues. On Feb. 10, the Europeans voted 378 to 196 to halt the Swift program. Obama administration officials valued it because it allowed them to trace the transactions of suspected terrorist financiers while including ''robust'' privacy protections, according to the cables. But many Europeans were skeptical. Some allies not only were concerned that program might be used to steal secrets from European companies, but also considered it of ''dubious'' value. In Austria, for example, ''the Nazi legacy and familiarity with communist regimes'' have fueled ''a widespread presumption against government data collection and in favor of stringent privacy protections,'' officials at the embassy wrote. Many Germans, meanwhile, remember ''how the Stasi,'' the former East German secret police, ''abused information to destroy people's lives,'' according to a dispatch from the American Embassy in Berlin. Opposition in Germany was particularly damaging because the country was among a handful of allies that, according to a 2006 cable, organized a ''coalition of the constructive'' to ensure that the Swift operation was not ''ruined by privacy experts.'' After German representatives voted against the program, a German official reported to American diplomats that Chancellor Angela Merkel -- a strong supporter of the program -- was ''angrier than he had ever seen her.'' After mobilizing top officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., the administration was able to reverse course. The European Parliament voted 484 to 109 in July to restart the program after the United States made modest concessions that promised greater European oversight.  "
"Microsoft, Spurred by Privacy Concerns, Introduces Tracking Protection to Its Browser","As the debate continues about a potential privacy system that would allow consumers to opt out of having their data collected online, Microsoft on Tuesday announced a feature for the newest version of Internet Explorer that would permit users to stop certain Web sites from tracking them.  The feature, which will exist in Internet Explorer 9, available next year, will let users limit the ability of third-party companies to track them online. The announcement comes less than a week after the Federal Trade Commission advocated a ''do not track'' mechanism that could be built into a browser and alert Web sites that a user did not want to be monitored. Jon Leibowitz, the commission's chairman, said in a statement that he was encouraged by Microsoft's move. ''Microsoft deserves enormous credit for taking a critical step toward providing consumers with more choice about who can track their online browsing,'' Mr. Leibowitz said. ''Just as important, this announcement proves that technology is available to let consumers control tracking.'' A blog post issued by Microsoft said the company was applying the principles outlined in the F.T.C.'s report, including the idea that companies should build privacy features into their products. The new feature, called Tracking Protection, would rely on lists that users create that indicate which sites they do not want to share information with. Lists can be created by individuals or by organizations, like consumer advocacy groups, which can make their lists available for anyone to use. Once enabled, the tracking protection would exist for all Web pages the user visits and would take effect each time they start a new browsing session. The mechanism would identify and block third parties from collecting data through cookies and other mechanisms that track users. Jules Polonetsky, the co-chairman and director of the Future of Privacy Forum, said users would most likely decide to use lists published by Web sites they trusted instead of creating their own, adding that most people would likely ignore the option all together. ''The average user is not going to have a list of 500 ad networks and 600 analytics companies,'' Mr. Polonetsky said. ''They end up relying on a privacy watch dog to give them a do-not-track list that the browser will respect.'' Microsoft's announcement comes at a time when some in the online advertising community fear that a government-mandated do-not-track system could have severe ramifications for their business models. Rik van der Kooi, the corporate vice president of the advertiser and publisher solutions group at Microsoft, said in a statement that the new privacy tools could co-exist with the growth of online advertising.  "
Technology Outpaces Privacy (Yet Again),"HOW far does consumer privacy protection lag behind data-collection systems, those advanced technologies that media companies use to gather, share and profit from our personal information? Too far, according to two privacy advocates. ''Solitude and privacy have become more essential to the individual; but modern enterprise and invention have, through invasions upon his privacy, subjected him to mental pain and distress,'' the privacy experts wrote in the Harvard Law Review. ''In this, as in other branches of commerce, the supply creates demand,'' they added; and that demand, they noted, ends up broadcasting our private matters in public spheres. Sound familiar? The review article, written in 1890 by the young lawyers Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis, concerned the spread of that era's viral technology: snapshot photography. Newspaper photographers, the lawyers wrote, were feeding an ''unseemly gossip'' industry by taking and publishing candid shots of people without their consent.  Before the advent of the camera, explains Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, newspaper photographers would have had difficulty carting heavy daguerreotype equipment and using it to peer over people's back garden fences. ''But once you went to a real camera,'' Mr. Leibowitz said in an interview last week, ''that could easily be done.'' As the adage goes: Everything old is new again. On the one hand, consumers often benefit from newfangled gizmos -- be they cameras, tape recorders or cellphones. On the other hand, the widespread adoption of technology has often left legislators and regulators racing to play catch up. The F.T.C., for instance, just published a report in which agency experts concluded that data-collection techniques on the Web had outdistanced user privacy control. So it was only natural that Mr. Leibowitz looked to tradition and invoked the 19th-century law review article, which essentially laid the legal foundations for protecting Americans' privacy rights. (My colleagues Tanzina Vega, Edward Wyatt and Verne Kopytoff have written in depth this month about the F.T.C. report, its proposed framework for increasing consumers' privacy choices and its implications for the online marketing industry). Mr. Warren and Mr. Brandeis wrote, for example, that privacy, an intangible right, was as important as more tangible common law rights, like the ownership of private property. People have the right, they wrote, to control dissemination of their personal thoughts or images. People also have ''the right to be let alone.'' In a similar fashion, the F.T.C.'s report recommends that Internet and mobile app users receive better control over who sees, collects and shares information about their electronic behavior -- like, say, the Web sites they peruse or the terms they plug into search engines. Indeed, the commission proposed a ''do not track'' mechanism that would allow consumers to opt out of ''behavioral advertising,'' the kind of marketing that tailors ads to a consumer's personal track record. This is not the first time since snapshot photography that new technology has inspired legal experts to rethink privacy protections. ''The laws haven't really kept pace with the unbelievable developments,'' says Jessica Rich, deputy director of the trade commission's bureau on consumer protection. As an example, Ms. Rich cited the 1960s, when deeper credit reporting allowed companies to use advanced database technology to collect consumers' financial information. Once legislators began to understand how such databases could affect people's ability to obtain mortgages, housing and even jobs, she said, Congress enacted the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The 1970 law allowed consumers to retrieve and correct credit information about themselves. Indeed, privacy regulation is often reactive, says William McGeveran, a privacy scholar at the University of Minnesota Law School. Take the Video Privacy Protection Act, enacted by Congress in 1988, after a local newspaper in Washington obtained and published the video rental records of Robert Bork, a Supreme Court nominee. The so-called Bork law, one of the country's strongest privacy statutes, prohibits the disclosure of personally identifiable rental information without consumer consent. ''One of the comical attributes of privacy regulation is -- a lot of it is responsive to fire alarms,'' says Professor McGeveran. Indeed, over time Congress has increased privacy regulation in different industries, he says. There's the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, for one, that in 1996 established certain federal protections for personal health information. And the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which required financial service companies to notify customers about their information policies and allow them to opt out from having their data shared with unaffiliated parties. ''Maybe now it's online privacy's turn to have more of a direct regulatory intervention,'' Professor McGeveran says. The trade commission's report proposes new industry practices to enhance online privacy choices for consumers. For those to take effect, however, either the interactive advertising industry would have to increase self-regulation or Congress would have to enact a law enabling the commission to enforce new rules. Some industry groups are already stepping up transparency. In October, the Digital Advertising Alliance, a coalition of trade groups, introduced an ''advertising option icon''-- a logo that Web sites can display to indicate that they collect consumer data and that they allow people to opt out of behavioral advertising. Next month, some data collection firms in that coalition are introducing the Open Data Partnership, a program that will allow consumers to edit their information profiles on certain sites or opt out of being tracked by participating companies. But Christopher Soghoian, a privacy researcher and graduate student at Indiana University, says most Web sites don't allow consumers to opt out of tracking. Companies ''promise they won't use the data they collect for the purpose of picking the individual ads they are showing you,'' he says, ''but they don't actually offer to stop collecting data about you.'' AND there's another potential problem, Mr. Soghoian says. Web sites often deposit cookies on consumers' computers to track online preferences and activities. The F.T.C.'s recommendation for an opt-out mechanism would play on that idea with a privacy cookie, encoded in people's browsers, that would alert advertising networks to users' privacy choices. But a few smaller companies have already moved beyond cookies, Mr. Soghoian says, with a technique called ''device fingerprinting.'' That advanced technology can follow online behavior -- not by using cookies but by tracking signals that are specific to a person's individual laptop or mobile device. ''That's not something you can opt out of,'' Mr. Soghoian says. ''There's no way to delete my fingerprint because there's no way for me to delete my phone or my computer.'' Once again, technology forges ahead. Not much has changed since 1890.  "
Documents Send Mixed Signal on Airport Scanners,"The Transportation Security Administration has promised not to store or transmit nude images of airline passengers made by whole-body scanners, but when it asked manufacturers to submit bids for such machines, it required that the scanners have exactly those capabilities, according to agency documents obtained in a lawsuit.   The bid specifications, obtained by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, also show that companies wanting to sell such machines to the government were required to equip them with ''10 selectable levels of privacy,'' although the document, which was partly censored before its release, does not specify what those are. Some of the machines provide blurring, or the electronic equivalent of a G-string over the genitals.    The government required that the machines have a testing mode that would allow the ''exporting of image data'' and provide ''a secure means for high-speed transfer of image data,'' according to the documents.   The images to be stored and transmitted are supposed to be of test subjects, not passengers, for training purposes.    The agency has said that images of passengers will not be transmitted or stored. The documents make clear that as the images are made, they will be sent to a display screen in a remote room to an operator who cannot see the actual passenger, and that the operator will delete the image after examining it.    The machines are supposed to provide ''image filters to protect the identity, modesty and privacy of the passenger,'' the companies were told, but the filters have to be modifiable by users with higher-level passwords.    The documents were initially marked as ''security sensitive information,'' which is a level of secrecy lower than ''classified.''    Two T.S.A. officials, speaking on the condition that they not be identified by name, said that the scanners are delivered with the ability to store and transmit images, but that these capabilities are disabled by the agency before the machines are installed at an airport and that officers at the airport cannot re-enable them. The operator, who is forbidden to take a camera into the remote room, must clear one image before the next passenger image can be seen, they said.    Critics call the machines the digital equivalent of a strip search and say the machines' ability to record images could be abused by operators.    ''This is in direct contradiction to multiple assurances, that they could not capture nor would they store these images,'' said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah. ''Obviously, they have a capability of doing both, and the intention of doing both.''   Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research center in Washington that supports greater privacy protection, said that in addition to violating the privacy of travelers, the machines might not achieve their intended purpose, because the documents make no mention of one form of explosives: powders.    The machines provide a clear image of passengers under their clothes and are meant to find threats that existing metal detectors cannot, like ceramic knives and bomb components. The T.S.A. initially said the machines would be used only for secondary screening -- that is, when screeners had a special reason to believe that a passenger required closer scrutiny -- but the government now plans to have 450 of them by the end of September and use them as a first-line tool.

Europe Rejects Sharing Of Bank Data With U.S.,"The European Parliament on Thursday broadly rejected an agreement with the United States on sharing information about bank transfers that was aimed at tracking people suspected of being terrorists.   The vote underlined differences between the United States and the European Union over how to balance personal privacy guarantees with concerns on national and international security.    The agreement, rejected 378 to 196 with 31 abstentions, would have freed the United States from having to seek bank data on a country-by-country basis. It went into effect provisionally at the start of February and was to last nine months while a more permanent arrangement was sought.    But many members of the Parliament complained that the agreement had failed to guarantee the privacy rights of European citizens.   Members also were angered when ministers from the body's 27 national governments agreed on the provisional deal a day before activation of a treaty that gave members of the European Parliament greater say over data-protection issues.   Underscoring the importance of the agreement to the United States, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner had promised to cooperate with the Parliament in negotiating the long-term accord.   Question about sharing bank data emerged in 2006, after The New York Times reported  that a Belgian cooperative responsible for routing about $6 trillion daily among banks, brokerage houses, stock exchanges and other institutions had provided information about transactions involving thousands of Americans and others in the United States in the wake of the 9/11  attacks.    The cooperative, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, is based near Brussels.    American and European leaders had warned that rejecting the accord would leave a security gap. Some legislators said use of the Swift data had already made it possible to thwart attacks.   A statement issued on Thursday by the United States Mission to the European Union said the decision to reject the agreement ''disrupts an important counterterrorism program which has resulted in more than 1,500 reports and numerous leads to European governmental authorities and has contributed significantly to collaborative counterterrorism efforts between the United States and Europe.'' The statement said the ''outcome is a setback for U.S.-E.U. counterterror cooperation.''   But a large number of European Parliament members complained that the agreement would have granted the United States far too much power to intrude into the lives of European citizens.   A German member, Martin Schulz, said  this week that he was concerned the data on European citizens could be kept on file for nearly a century.   The accord was signed in November but needed parliamentary consent to be legally binding.   Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union's commissioner for home affairs, had argued in favor of the agreement, and on Thursday pleaded in favor of postponing a decision.   The United States could still rely on an agreement on mutual legal assistance to seek the data. But that could make the process of gathering the information more cumbersome.  "
California Lawmakers Consider Creating an Online Registry for Animal Abusers,"California may soon place animal abusers on the same level as sex offenders by listing them in an online registry, complete with their home addresses and places of employment.   The proposal, made in a bill introduced Friday by the State Senate's majority leader, Dean Florez, would be the first of its kind in the country and is just the latest law geared toward animal rights in a state that has recently given new protections to chickens, pigs and cattle.    Mr. Florez, a Democrat who is chairman of the Food and Agriculture Committee, said the law would provide information for those who ''have animals and want to take care of them,'' a broad contingent in California, with its large farming interests and millions of pet owners. Animal protection is also, he said, a rare bipartisan issue in the state, which has suffered bitter partisan finger-pointing in the wake of protracted budget woes.    ''We have done well with these laws,'' he said.    Last fall, California became the first state to outlaw so-called tail-docking of dairy cows, where the tail is partly amputated to ease milking. In 2008, voters in the state passed Proposition 2, which gave hens, calves and pigs more room in their crates or cages. That law has upset many in the California egg industry and prompted some agriculturally-minded residents to even talk about seceding from the state.   Under Mr. Florez's bill, any person convicted of a felony involving animal cruelty would have to register with the police and provide a range of personal information and a current photograph. That information would be posted online, along with information on the person's offense.   The bill was drafted with help from the Animal Legal Defense Fund, an animal-protection group based in Cotati, Calif., north of San Francisco. The group has promoted the registry not only as a way to notify the public but also as a possible early warning system for other crimes.    ''We know there's a link between those who abuse animals and those who perform other forms of violence,'' said Stephan Otto, the group's director of legislative affairs. ''Presumably if we're able to track animal abusers and be able to know where they live, there will be less opportunity where those vulnerable to them would be near them.''   In addition to sex offenders, California lists arsonists in an online registry, and the animal abusers would be listed on a similar site, Mr. Florez said. Such registries have raised privacy concerns from some civil libertarians, but Joshua Marquis, a member of the defense fund's board and the district attorney in Clatsop County, Ore., said the worries were unfounded.    ''Does it turn that person into a pariah? No,'' Mr. Marquis said. ''But it gives information to someone who might be considering hiring that person for a job.''    He added: ''I do not think for animal abusers it's unreasonable considering the risk they pose, much like the risk that people who abuse children do.''   One supporter of the proposed law, Gillian Deegan, an assistant commonwealth's attorney in Botetourt County, Va., says such a registry could also be valuable in tracking people who run puppy mills and animal-fighting rings, as well as hoarders, who sometimes collect hundreds of animals, often resulting in neglect.    ''A lot of times these people will just pick up and move to another jurisdiction or another state if they get caught,'' said Ms. Deegan, who has written on animal welfare laws. ''It would definitely help on those types of cases where people jump around.'' One Web site -- Petabuse.com -- already offers a type of online registry, with listings of animal offenders and their crimes.    Such registries have been introduced in other states, but never passed. In 2008, a similar bill in Tennessee stalled after passing the State Senate.   That legislation was endorsed by the Humane Society of the United States, said Wayne Pacelle, the president and chief executive of the society.    Mr. Pacelle said that the proposed financing mechanism for the California bill, a small tax on pet food, was ''an extremely controversial idea'' and unpopular with the pet food industry.    Taxes are usually opposed by Republicans in California, and that gives Mr. Pacelle doubts about the bill's prospects.    ''The idea of that succeeding in this climate in California is not high,'' he said.    But the bill's sponsor, Mr. Florez, who recently helped establish an Animal Protection Caucus, which includes Republican members of the State Senate and Assembly, says he is confident that he has the votes to move the measure forward and estimates that the registry would cost less than $1 million to establish. He also said his background -- he hails from the farming-friendly Central Valley -- will help the cause.    ''I think people think, well, if Dean is supporting it,'' he said, ''it can't be that off the wall.'' Connecting Life    To the Internet Several years ago, I heard a talk by Vint Cerf, who helped draft the architecture of the Internet and is now chief Internet evangelist at Google. He discussed some of the strange early networking experiments his team did, but he also talked about his socks. He explained that one day everything would be connected to the Internet, and if one sock should fall behind the washing machine while he was doing laundry, it would be able to notify the other sock of its whereabouts. This concept is known as ''the Internet of things.''    The day when we have communicative socks might not be too far off, according to a report released last week by McKinsey & Company. The paper highlights some of the major changes to come from the growing ubiquity of sensors and objects connected to the Internet.   The report points out that in some instances, these systems are already a reality. Pill-shaped microcameras are used to explore the human digestive tract and send information and pictures to doctors. Farming equipment can collect data from remote satellites and sensors in the ground to change fertilizer mixes. And billboards in Asia can change to display the preferences of passers-by.   But this is all just the beginning. The report asserts that as more sensors are built into our devices and clothing, we will have the ability to monitor the behavior of people, places and things through space and time.   One particular area that makes sense for this kind of sensor-based monitoring is health care. The McKinsey report notes: ''In health care, sensors and data links offer possibilities for monitoring a patient's behavior and symptoms in real time and at relatively low cost, allowing physicians to better diagnose disease and prescribe tailored treatment regimens.''   The report notes that many privacy concerns will emerge. McKinsey suggests that industry groups and government will need to explore how data privacy is safeguarded in a world of unlimited information and monitoring.

"Screen Language,   Deciphered ","Q.I'm shopping around for a laptop, but get confused at the different type of L.C.D. screens offered. For example, I have a choice of C.C.F.L. or LED -- what does that even mean?   A. The two technologies in question here, C.C.F.L. (cold cathode fluorescent lamp) and LED (light-emitting diode) are two different ways to provide a backlight for the laptop's screen.    Of these two, C.C.F.L. is the older and cheaper method and may be the default display option from some manufacturers. C.C.F.L. backlight has some drawbacks, however. It consumes relatively more power and also contains mercury, which makes the technology less friendly to the environment.   In comparison, a typical LED backlight uses less power and does not contain mercury. Choosing an LED backlight may make the computer more expensive by $20 or more, but it's a ''greener'' machine. Some laptop makers have phased out C.C.F.L. altogether.   Depending on the manufacturer, other display options may include selecting a glossy or a matte finish. People who like intense, vibrant colors for viewing videos and photos often favor glossy displays. Matte screens show less glare (and fingerprints), but also generally have less contrast and color depth than glossy screens.   Screens advertised as ''high nit'' are brighter than standard displays and are made for highly lighted or outdoor work areas where monitors tend to get washed out. A nit is a unit of measurement used to describe screen brightness; one nit equals one candela per square meter and the more nits, the brighter the display.   Protecting   Digital Archives   Q.I'm scanning hundreds of personal documents, and some include credit card and Social Security numbers and other confidential information. What is the best way to safeguard the files from hackers? I've read a little that password-protected zip files could be used.   A. It is possible to put protected documents in a compressed archive (zip) file by requiring a password to open the archive. Microsoft, for instance, has instructions for Windows XP users at support.microsoft.com/kb/306531.    But for all the guides you can find for adding passwords to zip files, you can also find many guides to cracking them open (eHow has an example at bit.ly/7aFPnS). So this may not be the most secure way to protect the files.   Depending on your operating system, you may have other options. Mac OS X has a program called FileVault for encrypting your Home folder (bit.ly/1DxPc0). Some high-end versions of Windows have a file-encryption feature or a drive-encryption tool called BitLocker (the difference is explained at bit.ly/7LRwFN).    For deeply personal files that are scanned primarily to make digital archive copies, you may want to consider not storing them on the main computer, but on an external hard drive that can be encrypted itself with programs like PGP (pgp.com) or the free TrueCrypt (truecrypt.org). Make sure your computer has an active firewall and other security software and unplug the drive when you are not using those files.

Senators' Fears About Facebook,"4:09 p.m.  Updated  Added a report from the senators' meeting with Facebook executives.   Four senators are raising privacy concerns over new features that Facebook introduced last week and have asked the social networking company to roll back some of the changes.    In a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, the senators took particular issue with Facebook's ''instant personalization,'' a feature that allows a handful of Facebook partner Web sites like Yelp and Pandora to gain access to personal information about Facebook users.   The four senators, all Democrats, include Charles E. Schumer of New York, Michael Bennet of Colorado, Mark Begich of Alaska and Al Franken of Minnesota. They said they were concerned ''that this feature will now allow certain third party partners to have access not only to a user's publicly available profile information, but also to the user's friend list and the publicly available information about those friends. As a result of the other changes noted above, this class of information now includes significant and personal data points that should be kept private unless the user chooses to share them.''   They acknowledged that Facebook allowed users to opt out of such instant personalization but said that the company should not turn the feature on unless a user specifically authorizes it, a method known as ''opt-in.''   Our colleagues at Gadgetwise explained in detail how to opt out of instant personalization.   The senators also raised other privacy concerns, like the ability of third-party sites to store data about Facebook users indefinitely and the expanded sharing by Facebook of certain portions of its users profiles.   In a response to the senators, Elliot Schrage, Facebook's vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy, wrote that ''the new products and features are designed to enhance personalization and promote social activity across the Internet while continuing to give users unprecedented control over what information they share,  when they want to share it, and with whom.'' Mr. Schrage said that Facebook looked forward to a dialog with the lawmakers.   Congressional staffers met on Wednesday with Facebook executives to discuss the issues raised by the senators. Both sides described their discussions as ''productive.'' Facebook agreed to respond soon to a number of the concerns raised, according to spokesmen for Facebook and Mr. Schumer.   In their letter, the senators called social networking the ''Wild West'' of the Internet. Mr. Schumer recently asked the Federal Trade Commission to scrutinize the privacy practices of Facebook and other social networks. On Mr. Schumer's Facebook page, some users praised the senator while others urged him to ''leave the industry alone.''   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.    "
"In a State's Search for Sales Tax, Amazon Raises Privacy Concerns","NORTH CAROLINA last month began an audit of online businesses, assuming that millions of dollars in sales taxes owed to the state had disappeared into the Internet.    ''This is really an issue of fairness and equity for small businesses, the brick and mortar, corner store operations,'' said Kenneth R. Lay, the state's secretary of revenue. ''These businesses are at a competitive disadvantage when they have to collect sales taxes that other businesses do not.''    The response of one of those online businesses, Amazon.com, was succinct: back off.    In a complaint filed in Federal District Court in Seattle, the company said that the audit violated the First Amendment and privacy rights of the customers, as well as the company itself.    The case offers a glimpse at the changed landscape of  privacy in the United States. Under the old model, the law was meant to protect the public from a snooping government. And the government was generally the only entity with the resources to snoop on people in a systematic way.    Today, the online snooping (make that ''data collection'') never stops. Can the old tools really prevent the government from closely monitoring its people when so much information is a mere Internet search away? And is the government the one we really need protection from?    Amazon's lawyers say the Constitution protects the company so that it ''may sell  --  and customers may read, hear or view  --  a broad range of popular and unpopular expressive materials with the customers' private content choices protected from unnecessary government scrutiny.''    The complaint gave examples of books Amazon had shipped to North Carolina: ''Bipolar Disorder: A Guide for Patients and Families,'' by Francis Mark Mondimore, and ''He Had It Coming: How to Outsmart Your Husband and Win Your Divorce,'' by Stacy Schneider. The movies, the complaint said, included ''Lolita,'' ''Brokeback Mountain'' and ''Fahrenheit 9/11.''    It is a telling list: imagine what the government could do with ''Converting to Islam for Dummies'' or ''Plant Your Own Marijuana Field.'' For this reason, privacy experts say, library records have been granted special protections and are generally not kept for long, lest they offer a tempting target for investigators.    One thing, though. There happens to be an organization that does have a good idea of who is reading what  --  Amazon. For many isolated people, Amazon is the closest thing to a library. The closest thing, perhaps, until Google enters the e-book business, and knows what books you have bought and even what pages you've read online.   In an interview, Mr. Lay said North Carolina never wanted to know the titles of books or movies that were sold. ''It is important to know whether a book or steak was sold, but we don't care about the title of the book or the type of steak,'' he said, adding that the tax rates are different in each case. ''We have too much data. The last thing we need is data we don't need.''   The dispute over whether Amazon will have to reveal the names of its customers, without the titles, is still in court. ''To comply with their demand will reveal the personal preferences of North Carolina consumers,'' Amazon said in a statement.   The lawsuit can seem like the front line of the battle for privacy in the Internet age, with Amazon on the barricades holding back an overreaching government. After all, the company does not share its purchasing lists with anyone. And as Amazon argued in federal court, its business would be hurt if it ever did, whether in aid of tax collection or as a business proposition.   ''Customers who fear that their purchases will not be private are less likely to purchase books, movies, music or other items that might be personal, sensitive or controversial,'' the company argued.    What remains is a sobering combination  --  on  one hand, there is the detailed information held by companies like Amazon and  Google, which have a strong business incentive to fight off the government. Yet even as they go to court to protect the information they have collected, that information still represents a ''honey pot for the government,'' Cindy Cohn, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says.    In cases where the government gains a court's approval, it would have access to a trove of material that 10 years ago would be unthinkable in its detail.    ''That's why we are trying to convince all people who store data not to do it,'' she said. ''We need to strengthen the law that when we collect information for one purpose, it isn't used for another.''   In addition, there is all the material that roams freely available on the Internet, particularly on social networks like Facebook, which are convinced that more sharing is what their users want.    This information can find its way to the government without need of a warrant, Joel R. Reidenberg, a professor of law at Fordham University, says. And while each piece of data can seem innocuous, when collected and weaved into a personal profile, it can be quite revealing.    ''If a private company has information, they can sell it,'' including to the government, he said. ''You need a warrant when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy,'' he added, but if a private company has the information, on what basis would someone expect it to be private from the government?   ''The bleed from privately held data to state surveillance can happen very quickly,'' he said.  "
"In Progress, A Network To Observe Midtown","The Police Department has been planning a high-tech security network for Midtown Manhattan involving surveillance cameras, license plate readers and chemical sensors, although it was not clear whether it could have prevented the attempted car bombing in Times Square on Saturday night.    The network, patterned after one under development in Lower Manhattan, would eventually use public and private security cameras and license plate readers and would be able to record and track every vehicle moving between 34th and 59th Streets, river to river. But because neither the S.U.V. used in the attempt nor the license plate on it had been reported stolen, it would not have raised any immediate red flags.   Eventually, police officials have said, the networks would be able to notice whether a car was circling any area suspiciously. Because the security network is not yet in place in Midtown, it was not known whether the S.U.V. was driven directly to its target on Saturday night.   The network could have been triggered via its chemical, biological and radiological sensors, presuming that the material in the vehicle, which is not yet  fully analyzed, was detectable.   The department secured a $24 million Department of Homeland Security grant last fall to begin building the network. Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said he was seeking more federal money to complete it. Paul J. Browne, a spokesman for the department, said that license plate readers are already being used.    ''There really isn't a downside to it,'' said Louis Anemone, a former official for the New York Police Department and former head of security for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. ''Next time it may not get this far because of the technology.''   Even if it could not help prevent an attack, he said, ''it helps to clearly identify the people involved and get good photos so officers can follow up.''    Mr. Kelly, calling the network ''a whole new area for us,'' said Sunday, ''It has a lot of promise;  in that regard we are very enthusiastic about it.''   The New York Civil Liberties Union has raised privacy concerns about the networks, and has sued the Police Department and Department of Homeland Security for information about the networks and how long the surveillance images and data would be retained in their databases.

Move to Aid Privacy Is Greeted With Criticism,"A  LONG-AWAITED draft of a Congressional bill would extend privacy protections both on the Internet and off line, but privacy advocates said the bill did not go far enough in protecting consumers.   The draft legislation was released Tuesday by Representatives Rick Boucher, Democrat of Virginia, and Cliff Stearns, Republican of Florida. Mr. Boucher is the chairman of the House subcommittee on communications, technology and the Internet, and Mr. Stearns is the panel's ranking minority member. The two lawmakers will collect comments on the draft, and hope to have formal legislation introduced within a month or so, Mr. Boucher said in an interview.   Consumer groups have been fighting what they see as the prevalence of online tracking, where online advertising is selected for a certain user -- perhaps because he once visited a company's home page, perhaps because he showed an interest in automobiles or baby products, or perhaps because he is a middle-aged man.    As  opposition has intensified, companies like Google and Yahoo have adjusted their own privacy policies in response to consumer concern. Industry groups, while arguing that free Internet content depends on this type of sophisticated advertising, have issued their own self-regulatory principles.   This, though, ''would be the first law that applies generally to businesses requiring privacy notice, particularly in the offline space,'' said Lisa J. Sotto, a partner at Hunton & Williams who heads the law firm's privacy and information management practice. ''This bill represents a sea change.''   Right now, Ms. Sotto said, there is no national legislation governing how companies tell consumers that they are collecting data, but companies do post privacy notices because certain state laws require it.    The proposed bill would expand what information should be considered confidential. It would require companies to post clear and understandable privacy notices when they collected information. Such information could  range from health or financial data to any unique identifier, including a customer identification number, a user's race or sexual orientation, the user's precise location or any preference profile the user has filled out. It could also include an Internet Protocol address, the  numerical address assigned to each computer connecting to the Internet that many companies use now to  aim particular messages at users, which the companies argue is not personally identifiable.   Essentially, companies would need to alert consumers whenever any information the companies are collecting can identify a single person or a single computer or device.   ''This bill, were it to pass, would get us closer to the more stringent privacy regimes that we see in other countries,'' Ms. Sotto said.   Significantly, the bill also requires companies to advise  consumers even  when they are collecting any of that information off line, which could include data houses and direct marketers.   The online and off-line privacy notices would have to include a description of the information being collected, why the company was collecting that information, how that information might be linked or combined with other data about the individual or computer, and why the company would disclose that information and to what types of  other companies, among other requirements.   Mike Zaneis, vice president for public policy for the trade group Interactive Advertising Bureau, said that some of these definitions and requirements were ''overly broad.'' For instance, including an I.P. address in covered information would be a huge ''change to existing laws here in the U.S. and would potentially have widespread implications.''   Mr. Boucher said that ''our goal is to enhance electronic commerce -- we are not seeking in any way to disable targeted advertising.''   He added, ''We are largely tracking the best business practices that exist among the most consumer-oriented companies today.''    In a conference call with reporters, representatives from privacy and consumer groups said the draft included several loopholes that might let companies track consumers too closely.    There was an exemption from the disclosure requirements for what was called ''operational'' (defined as ''a purpose reasonably necessary for the operation'' of the company) or ''transactional'' (defined as ''a purpose necessary for effecting, administering or enforcing'' a transaction between company and customer). Those exceptions were ''troubling,'' said Peter Eckersley, senior staff technologist for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, one of these groups.   Privacy advocates said they were disappointed that this approach relied on a privacy policy, which few  site visitors actually read.  "
Price of Facebook Privacy? Start Clicking,"Pop quiz: Which is longer, the United States Constitution or Facebook's Privacy Policy?   If you guessed the latter, you're right. Facebook's Privacy Policy is 5,830 words long; the  United States Constitution, without any of its amendments, is a concise 4,543 words.   Facebook, one of the most popular social networks in the world, has more than 400 million  registered people on its Web site. Half of these users log in to the service every day, the company says, and users spend 500 billion minutes on the site each month.    But in recent months, Facebook has revised its privacy policy to require users to opt out if they wish to keep information private, making most of that information public by default.  Some personal data is now being shared with third-party Web sites.   As a result, the company has come under a blitz from privacy groups, government officials and its own users, who complain that the new policy is bewildering and the new opt-out settings too time-consuming to figure out and use.   ''There are always trade-offs between providing comprehensive and precise granular controls and offering simple tools that may be broad and blunt,'' said Elliot Schrage, vice president for public policy at Facebook. ''We have tried to offer the most comprehensive and detailed controls and comprehensive and detailed information about them.''   The new opt-out settings certainly are complex. Facebook users who hope to make their personal information private should be prepared to spend a lot of time pressing a lot of buttons. To opt out of full disclosure of most information, it is necessary to click through more than 50  privacy buttons, which then require choosing among a total of more than 170 options.   Users must decide if they want only friends, friends of friends, everyone on Facebook, or a customized list of people to see things like their birthdays or their most recent photos. To keep information as private as possible, users must select ''only friends'' or ''only me'' from the pull-down options for all the choices in the privacy settings, and must uncheck boxes that say information will be shared across the Web.   Facebook's ''Help Center'' is available to assist users, but the word count for the privacy-related FAQ adds up to more than 45,000 words.   Even if a user changes all the settings on the privacy section of the site, certain pieces of information will still be shared across the site unless a user takes further action. For example, under the Account Settings option, in the Facebook Ads tab, two options are automatically turned on to share some information with advertising networks and friends. Anyone who wants to keep this information private must uncheck the boxes in that tab.   And still, some information will no longer remain private because Facebook has also added a feature, called community pages, which automatically links personal data, like hometown or university, to topic pages for that town or university. The only way to disappear from those topic pages is to delete  personal data from  Facebook.  "
Europe to Offer 5-Year Plan for Telecom Industry,"BERLIN -- On Wednesday, Neelie Kroes, the new European commissioner for the digital agenda, plans to introduce a five-year plan for the telecommunications industry in Europe, encompassing issues like digital copyright, data protection, net neutrality and e-commerce.   Her goal, she has said, is to create a functioning single European Union market for telecommunications, one that will let people speak, send text messages and use the Internet from anywhere in the bloc's 27 nations without paying exorbitant fees to mobile operators.      But as the release of the long-awaited digital agenda draws near, some competition advocates are worried that Ms. Kroes, who has served on the boards of more than 20 global companies, may not take on the Continent's powerful telecommunications operators.   She plans over the next five years to address the biggest digital issues affecting Europeans, strengthening privacy protections online and preventing operators from limiting Internet content on their networks, according to a draft of the commission's digital agenda obtained by The International Herald Tribune.   The document, running 39 pages, sets out broad goals but lacks detail on important questions like extending the retail price caps on cellphone roaming fees. It is silent on whether to impose similar caps on fees for data, for which charges are unregulated and can exceed 3 euros for each downloaded megabyte of data.   In the consensus-building process of compiling the digital agenda with the other commissioners, Ms. Kroes has had to compromise. For example, she initially sought an explicit commitment and faster track to creating a one-stop licensing process for intellectual property for the entire European Union. The proposal is opposed by national licensing agencies, which fear a loss of political power, and the French music and film industries, which see a single market license increasing the presence  of American culture.   Last Tuesday, Ms. Kroes agreed to compromise with Michel Barnier of France, the European commissioner for internal markets, who has chief responsibility on the issue. The two agreed to abide by the commission's plan to study the issue before considering reforms in 2012, according to two people with knowledge of the agreement, which was intended to be private.   Some lobbyists who have followed the process say the resulting draft is too timid.   ''What I would like to see is a more ambitious agenda, something that ensures that Europe's telecommunications markets will be opened to greater competition,'' said Erzsebet Fitori, a senior manager for regulatory affairs in Brussels at E.C.T.A., the operators' group.   Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for Ms. Kroes, said the commissioner was not available to be interviewed but that she planned to present the agenda Wednesday after its formal adoption by the commission.   A Brussels antitrust lawyer who has worked closely with Ms. Kroes dismissed those questioning her consumer credentials. ''When Mrs. Kroes took office as competition commissioner in 2004, a lot of people were saying she would be soft on business,'' said Jean-Francois Bellis, who represented Microsoft. ''But look at what happened. Mrs. Kroes turned out to be very tough on business.''   Ad Scheepbouwer, the chief executive of the Dutch telecom operator KPN, said Ms. Kroes would seek to create the same level of vigorous competition across Europe that exists in the Dutch telecommunications market, one of Europe's most competitive, where KPN faces alternative telecommunications and cable television operators that together have 58 percent of all Dutch broadband subscribers.   Francisco Mingorance, the senior director for government affairs in Brussels at the Business Software Alliance, a group that represents software makers like Microsoft and SAP, said Ms. Kroes was taking a different approach than that of her predecessor, Viviane Reding.   ''She is not coming in with a big stick and saying: 'You have to bring down consumer costs or I will regulate you,' '' Mr. Mingorance said.   Dennis de Jong, a member of the European Parliament from Rotterdam, where Ms. Kroes began her political career in 1970 on the City Council, said Ms. Kroes had the determination and political skills to produce changes that would benefit European consumers.   ''Mrs. Kroes comes from a market ideology, but she is open-minded,'' said Mr. De Jong, a member of the Socialist Party bloc. ''That is how we know her. She is for free and fair competition and has always worked to remove obstacles, even if they are within the industry.''  "
Facebook Responds,"Facebook built its base of nearly 500 million users on the notion that it was a place for people to connect with each other and post their likes, dislikes, photos, activities with as wide a circle as they chose to define. Facebook, in turn, used that information to show users advertisements based on their tastes.    But Facebook has become the focus of an increasingly heated debate over whether it was keeping its end of the bargain and giving users an easy, straightforward and consistent way to set their limits. It has regularly revised its privacy settings, made them harder to find and massaged the way it describes the meaning of privacy. Leaving Facebook for good is a complex chore.   These are legitimate concerns. After a public outcry, Facebook is responding to them by revising some of its privacy policies.   Last month, the company caused an uproar among privacy advocates and attracted the scrutiny of lawmakers when it redefined many items on users' profiles -- including friends, current city and job, their school, listed interests and Web sites they liked -- as public information, broadly visible on topical pages and accessible by applications running on Facebook. It did not matter how private users wanted to keep the information.    Facebook also started a program allowing Web sites to access the public information of users who clicked Facebook ''like'' buttons and another to share users' public information with corporate partners such as Yelp and Pandora to allow them to personalize their services to users' tastes. Users can opt out, but the process is far from straightforward.   On Monday, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, announced in an op-ed article in The Washington Post that over the next several months the company would ''add privacy controls that are much simpler to use,'' and ''give you an easy way to turn off all third-party services.'' The company added that it would trim the information considered public by default. That would be the right decision for a company that has become a powerful force in the way people communicate online.   Last year, following another consumer backlash over changes to its terms of service, Facebook introduced a set of principles that included this: ''People should have the freedom to decide with whom they will share their information, and to set privacy controls to protect those choices.'' Facebook would do well to abide by this rule.    Indeed, Facebook should commit to give users full control over the use and disclosure of their data. That means asking for permission every time it wants to use the information for a new purpose. It also means providing users --  in a simple, intuitive way --  with the information they need to decide who can see their data and how those details can be used.    Facebook's existence is predicated on people wanting to share information about their lives. It should trust that users who want to share everything will and not force the hand of those who don't want to.  "
Google Balks at Turning Over Private Internet Data to Regulators,"BERLIN -- Google has balked at requests from regulators to surrender Internet data and fragments of e-mail messages that it collected from unsecured home wireless networks, saying it needed time to resolve legal issues.   In Germany, Google said it was not able to fully comply with the Hamburg data protection supervisor's deadline of Thursday to hand over data the company had collected -- inadvertently, it said -- while roving cars were compiling its Street View photo map archive.   The company implied that German privacy laws were preventing it from turning over the information, even to a government agency.    ''As granting access to payload data creates legal challenges in Germany, which we need to review, we are continuing to discuss the appropriate legal and logistical process for making the data available,'' Peter Barron, a Google spokesman in London, said in a statement. ''We hope, given more time, to be able to resolve this difficult issue.''   The Hamburg data protection supervisor, Johannes Caspar, expressed his disappointment.   While prosecutors in Hamburg, where Google has its German headquarters, have opened a criminal investigation into the issue, Mr. Caspar said the state prosecutor, Lutz von Selle, had assured him that complying with the request to hand over the data would not cause additional legal problems for Google.   A refusal to comply with the privacy agency's requests for information could result in a fine of up to 50,000 euros ($61,000), though Mr. Caspar declined to say whether he would immediately push for such a sanction.   ''We will have to show them our weapons, which are not very heavy in this case,'' he said.   Mr. Caspar said Google had cooperated partly with his office, providing ''relevant answers'' about how its Street View driving operations had been organized, among other things. The company also agreed to show investigators the software that was used to gather the data.   ''We will only believe what we see,'' Mr. Caspar said.   Meanwhile, the privacy commissioner in Hong Kong, Roderick B. Woo, threatened unspecified sanctions after Google did not respond to his request to inspect data collected in the territory by the roving cars. Mr. Woo said Google had ignored a deadline on Monday to turn over the information.   ''I am dismayed by Google's apparent lack of sincerity in its handling of this matter,'' Mr. Woo said in a statement. ''I do not see that Google is taking the matter seriously enough. Unless some remedial measures are taken by Google promptly, I shall have to consider escalating the situation and resort to more assertive action.''   A Google representative in Hong Kong could not be reached on Thursday for comment.   The company has said that its cars collected 600 gigabytes of ''fragmentary data'' from unsecured Wi-Fi networks in 33 countries and Hong Kong.   It has declined to describe the data in more detail and says it was gathered inadvertently because of a programming error.   Although the fines and administrative sanctions in privacy cases tend to be limited, one privacy expert said Google's lack of compliance with regulators' requests could damage its reputation.   ''Google's refusal to hand over the data will be seen as a declaration of war by European regulators,'' said Simon Davies, the director of Privacy International, a London organization representing data protection groups in 40 countries. ''This is about sovereignty and a country's right to determine on its citizens' behalf what is right and what is wrong.''   Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., has offered to destroy the data but has not allowed regulators to see and verify what it collected. Google has destroyed data collected in Denmark, Ireland and Austria at the request of local regulators.   But eight other European countries -- Belgium, Britain, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland -- have asked Google to retain data collected in those nations, which may be used as evidence in future legal proceedings.   In the United States, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Jon Leibowitz, told Congress last week that his agency would look into Google's actions.   Some have questioned Google's assertion that it gathered the data inadvertently.   ''If the company is fighting this so hard, it suggests there is more to this than meets the eye,'' said Mr. Davies, of Privacy International. ''The real question is: What was Google collecting from unwitting individuals and why? So far, nobody really knows.''   One privacy lawyer said Google might be wagering that paying fines and enduring negative publicity was preferable to giving regulators insight into its data collection practices.   ''Remember that Microsoft's reputation took a hit for a decade in Europe while it faced its antitrust suit here,'' said Ulrich Borger, a privacy lawyer in Hamburg at Latham & Watkins, an American law firm. ''But at the end of the day, the negative publicity did not affect the company's business bottom line in Europe.''   Regulators and prosecutors may be hard-pressed to compel Google to hand over  hard drives that are not being kept in their countries.   ''Our understanding is that the data collected, including Wi-Fi data, is held overseas in the United States,'' said Karen Curtis, the Australian privacy commissioner.   Prosecutors in Hamburg may also have difficulty bringing charges because Germany has no legal concept of corporate criminal liability. Hamburg prosecutors would have to prove that individuals working for Google deliberately broke wiretapping laws.   Proving that the driver of a Street View recording vehicle had such knowledge and intent may be difficult, Mr. Borger said. ''This is not going to be an easy prosecution.''  "
Managing Reputations on Social Sites,"In response to growing privacy concerns on the Internet, people are increasingly monitoring their online identities. And young Internet users are the most vigilant in restricting access to personal information, according to a Pew report.    Fifty-six percent of people now use search engines to look up information on themselves, as opposed to 47 percent in 2006. The number of people searching for information on others rose by a comparable amount.   Users who have more information available online and search for others are more likely to restrict their own personal data. This habit is most pronounced on social networks, where nearly three-quarters of young users have altered their privacy settings, as opposed to just over half of users older than 50.   Younger social networkers more frequently regret posting content or ask others to remove content, the report says. Moreover, they are the least trusting of social networks, with 28 percent saying they can never trust such sites.   ''Young adults may be more active managers of their online reputations out of necessity,'' Mary Madden, senior research specialist for Pew, said. ''Their use of the Internet and social media takes place at a time in life when there's a lot of attention being paid to self-presentation.'' TEDDY WAYNE   "
Google Sued in Spain Over Data Collecting,"MADRID -- A judge in Spain opened an investigation into whether Google unlawfully collected data from unsecured wireless networks while gathering photographs for Google's photo-mapping service Street View.  The judge, Raquel Fernandino, has ordered a representative from Google to appear before her in early October over a lawsuit filed by a Spanish association of Internet users. The summons was issued last month, but made public only this week. Street View has also caused regulatory and legal problems for Google in other European countries with strict privacy laws, including Germany and Switzerland, where opponents of the Street View photo archive have been particularly outspoken. In May, a judge in Hamburg opened a criminal investigation of Google over its collection of data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks in Germany. Google has described the collection of the data as accidental and has apologized for what it called a programming error. A spokeswoman for Google Spain, Marisa Toro, said on Tuesday that the company planned to cooperate fully with the judge and other Spanish authorities to resolve the privacy concerns. ''We are dedicating a lot of our time to finding a solution so that users can be at ease,'' Ms. Toro said. Google introduced Street View in Spain three years ago, and Ms. Toro said that it had proved ''very popular.'' Plans to expand the coverage in Spain have been delayed pending an outcome in the data collection dispute. The Spanish association of Internet users, whose acronym is Apedanica, contends that Google violated an article in Spain's criminal code that forbids the unauthorized interception and collection of such communications data. Breaching that law can lead to prison sentences of up to four years. The judge's investigation is the most serious threat to date in Spain for Google and its mapping service. But Street View had already raised concerns among local regulators. In June, Artemi Rallo, director of the official Spanish data protection agency, Agencia Espanola de Proteccion de Datos, said in an interview that Google should hand over the original hard drives containing the actual Wi-Fi payload data -- including e-mail text fragments and unencrypted passwords. Under pressure from German privacy regulators, Google acknowledged in May that it had inadvertently collected 600 gigabytes of data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks around the world as it assembled its Street View archive. The company has already agreed to destroy the data collected in Ireland, Denmark and Austria at the request of officials in those countries. Valentin Playa, the lawyer representing the Spanish association that filed the complaint against Google, said on Tuesday that ''recognizing the mistake and the excuses presented by Google are not reasons to prevent the investigation, nor a criminal condemnation, if it is judged that the actions amounted to a crime and that there has been a degree of responsibility from Google.''

Facebook Vows to Fix Flaw in Protection of User Data,"SAN FRANCISCO -- When you sign up for Facebook, you enter into a bargain. You share personal information with the site, and Facebook agrees to obey your wishes when it comes to who can see what you post. At the same time, you agree that Facebook can use that data to decide what ads to show you. It is a complicated deal that many people enter into without perhaps fully understanding what will happen to their information. It also involves some trust -- which is why any hint that Facebook may not be holding up its end of the bargain is sure to kick up plenty of controversy.  The latest challenge to that trust came on Monday, when Facebook acknowledged that some applications on its site, including the popular game FarmVille, had improperly shared identifying information about users, and in some cases their friends, with advertisers and Web tracking companies. The company said it was talking to application developers about how they handled personal information, and was looking at ways to prevent this from happening again. Facebook's acknowledgment came in response to an article in The Wall Street Journal that said several popular applications were passing a piece of data known as a user ID to outside companies, in violation of Facebook's privacy policy. Having a user ID allows someone to look up that user's name and any data posted on that person's public profile, like a college or favorite movies, but not information that the user had set to be visible only to friends. Privacy advocates and technology experts were split on the significance of the issue. ''That is extremely serious,'' said Peter Eckersley, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online liberties group. Mr. Eckersley said advertisers could use the user IDs to link individuals with information they had collected anonymously about them on the Web. ''Facebook, perhaps inadvertently, is leaking the magic key to tracking you online,'' he said. At the same time, Mr. Eckersley said there was no evidence that anyone who had access to this data had actually misused it. Zynga, the maker of FarmVille and other games on Facebook that have a combined 219 million users, did not respond to requests for comment. Several technology pundits and bloggers minimized the issue, with some saying that credit card companies and magazines have access to far more detailed information about customers than any Facebook application. Facebook also sought to play down the importance of the leak, saying the sending of user IDs appeared to have been inadvertent. ''Press reports have exaggerated the implications of sharing'' a user ID, Mike Vernal, a Facebook engineer, wrote on a company blog for application developers. ''Knowledge of a UID does not enable anyone to access private user information without explicit user consent.'' In a statement, Facebook said that while it would be a challenge to do so, it planned to introduce ''new technical systems that will dramatically limit the sharing of user IDs,'' and would continue to enforce its policies on outside applications, shutting them down when necessary. It added that the companies that had received the user IDs said they had not made use of them. Regardless, the problem underscores another challenge facing the company: Facebook has grown so rapidly, in both users and in technical complexity, that it finds it increasingly difficult to control everything that happens on its site. In addition to more than 500 million Facebook users, there are more than one million third-party applications running on the site. The latest information leak was made possible by a quirk in a long-established technical standard used by Web browsers. The standard allows Web sites to record the address of the page a user clicked on to arrive there, a bit of information known as a referrer. Facebook has been including user IDs in these referrers for some time, and last year technology experts pointed out that user IDs had leaked to advertisers that way. Facebook fixed that this year, but apparently never addressed the problem when it came to referrers used by applications on its site. ''Facebook isn't benefiting from it, and Facebook is not intentionally leaking this data,'' said Christopher Soghoian, a privacy advocate and research fellow at the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research at Indiana University. ''But it is not a trivial thing to re-engineer their systems.'' This year he filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, claiming Google was leaking personal information because search terms appeared in its referrers. The latest issue may have had particular resonance with Facebook users because the company has been reeling from a series of privacy controversies, in part because it has been subtly pushing users to share data more publicly. This year, for example, many users complained when Facebook changed the way in which users expressed preferences for certain movies or bands, essentially making it more difficult to keep that information private. And in May, after a series of complaints from some users and privacy advocates, the company made wholesale changes to its privacy settings. Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, apologized to users, saying the settings were often too complicated for people to understand. Despite the changes, the privacy issue has continued to dog Facebook. ''This is one more straw on the camel's back that suggests that Facebook needs to think holistically not just about its privacy policies, but also about baking privacy into their technical design,'' said Deirdre Mulligan, a privacy expert and professor at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley.

Pentagon Will Help Homeland Security Department Fight Domestic Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration has adopted new procedures for using the Defense Department's vast array of cyberwarfare capabilities in case of an attack on vital computer networks inside the United States, delicately navigating historic rules that restrict military action on American soil. The system would mirror that used when the military is called on in natural disasters like hurricanes or wildfires. A presidential order dispatches the military forces, working under the control of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  Under the new rules, the president would approve the use of the military's expertise in computer-network warfare, and the Department of Homeland Security would direct the work. Officials involved in drafting the rules said the goal was to ensure a rapid response to a cyberthreat while balancing concerns that civil liberties might be at risk should the military take over such domestic operations. The rules were deemed essential because most of the government's computer-network capabilities reside within the Pentagon -- while most of the important targets are on domestic soil, whether within the government or in critical private operations like financial networks or a regional power grid. The new approach will begin with a Department of Homeland Security team deploying to Fort Meade, Md., home to both the National Security Agency, which specializes in electronic espionage, and the military's new Cyber Command. In exchange, a team of military networking experts would be assigned to the operations center at the Homeland Security Department. The rules were detailed in a memorandum of agreement signed in late September by Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, but they were not released until last week. Robert J. Butler, the Pentagon's deputy assistant secretary for cyber policy, said the memorandum was intended to cut through legal debates about the authority for operating domestically, and to focus on how best to respond to the threat of attack on critical computer networks. Mr. Butler said teams of lawyers would watch for potential violations of civil liberties. ''We have put protection measures in place,'' he said. The Pentagon is expected to release a full National Defense Strategy for Cyber Operations this year, to be followed by broader interagency guidance from the White House, perhaps in the form of a presidential directive, in 2011. Congress also is weighing legislation that would update domestic law to deal with advances in computer-based surveillance and cyberwarfare. William J. Lynn III, the deputy defense secretary, underscored the Pentagon's ''need to protect our military networks,'' but said that ''it's a national challenge as well.'' In an interview with Charlie Rose broadcast Monday by PBS, Mr. Lynn added: ''We need to protect our critical infrastructure. We need to protect our intellectual property. And that's a whole-of-government effort.'' During a visit last week to NATO headquarters in Brussels, Mr. Gates lobbied for new partnerships to combat computer threats, while warning that the NATO networks were vulnerable. ''On cybersecurity, the alliance is far behind,'' Mr. Gates said. ''Our vulnerabilities are well known, but our existing programs to remedy these weaknesses are inadequate.'' Mr. Gates said he was not concerned that secret intelligence shared with allies would be compromised, but he said NATO had weaknesses in its defenses for computer networks at its headquarters and throughout the shared command structure.

Google vs. China: Considering Threats to Internet Freedom,"Overview | What threats exist to Internet freedom, and how can people and democratic governments combat them? In this lesson, students imagine how they might communicate, and evade censors, if they were antigovernment activists. They then look more closely at the issues involved in the dispute between Google and China and develop ideas for how Google or the United States government should respond. Finally, they do independent research to learn more about the types of information that the Chinese government has sought to block online.  Materials | Handouts Warm-Up | Tell students to imagine that they are forming an activist group to protest the government. How would they communicate and plan to meet? How would they find information that they need? How would they connect with others who are interested in joining the cause? Invite responses and list their ideas on the board. Cross out all mentions of technology and social networking -- like cellphones, Facebook, Twitter or Google -- on the board, and tell them to imagine that the government is using its power to limit activists' ability to use these tools. What then? Again, invite responses. What ideas do students have for getting around such restrictions or for organizing without them? How much would these restrictions hamper their ability to organize? You might share with them recent stories of government crackdowns on protesters using technology to communicate and mobilize in Iran and Moldova. Ask whether students have heard of other cases of governments trying to limit people's use of technology. If no one mentions it, tell them that China has recently come under fire - and Google has threatened to pull its operations there - when evidence was discovered that the Chinese government had hacked into the Google accounts of journalists and human rights advocates. (Note that China has denied the charges.) Have students share their reactions, and, if necessary, review information about China and communism for context and background. Ask students to speculate what the Google hackers in China were trying to do. Ask: How might such actions - and the threat of other such violations - affect citizens and activist groups in China? How do such actions pose a threat to other nations? How can a country defend itself against cyberattacks Share this quote from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's Jan. 21, 2010, speech on Internet freedom: ""Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy, our government and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyberattacks should face consequences and international condemnation."" Ask: Do you agree or disagree with Secretary Clinton? Why? What kinds of threats is she referring to? How, if at all, do you think the United States government should respond to the news about China's actions with respect to Google? Tell students that they will read more about and discuss China's censorship of the Internet, starting with today's featured article. Related | In ""Scaling the Digital Wall in China,"" Brad Stone and David Barboza report on how Chinese citizens have tried to evade government censors: Jason Ng, a Chinese engineering school graduate who will say only that he works in the media business, wakes every day at 8:30 a.m., and then begins his virtual travels through an open, global network by fanqiang, or ""scaling the wall."" He connects to an overseas computer with a link, called a proxy server, that he set up himself. It costs 15 renminbi, or around $2, a month to share with about two dozen other friends. Mr. Ng then works on his blog and checks the news on Google Reader and Twitter to ""officially start my day of information."" Chinese citizens engaged in such practices say the government rarely cracks down on them individually, preferring instead to go after prominent dissidents who publish information about forbidden topics online. As a result, college students, human rights activists, bloggers, journalists and even multinational corporations in China are rushing to use tools that go over or around barriers set up by Chinese regulators, in part because they feel it is the only way to participate in a global online community. Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below. Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:  Activity | Hand out copies of the overview on the Times Topics page on Internet Censorship in China and the handout China, Google and the United States: An Overview (PDF), which consists of passages from Times articles. Tell students to work in pairs to read and process the information, highlighting or underlining pertinent information and jotting down thoughts and questions in the margins or on the back. Alternatively, read some or all of the information aloud, to reinforce students' listening comprehension skills, while they jot down key points. Then ask: What topics are censored in China? Who does the censoring? Who monitors and censors Web sites in China? Why do the companies comply? Why is Google considering pulling out of China? How and why has the federal government gotten involved in the dispute between Google and China? What are the business, political, human rights and other key issues here? What sections of the reading did you mark, and why? What other questions do you have? On the board or chart paper, write this list vertically: ordinary Chinese citizens, netizens, dissidents, Chinese government, American government, Google. Jot down students' ideas and comments under each grouping as they take turns offering ideas about the group you point to: what it wants and what it would most likely accept as fair treatment. Go through the list again, this time naming groups in a different order. Repeat this process as many times as necessary to elicit ideas. Encourage students to, instead of preparing what they will say in advance, listen carefully to the other ideas about different groups in order to respond as specifically as possible, raising their hands rather than waiting for you to name ""their"" group when an immediate response is most appropriate. You might use these questions to guide the discussion:  To wrap up, have students come up with ideas for what Google and the United States government should do to combat cyberterrorism and restrictions on Internet freedom, returning to Secretary Clinton's statement that a cyberattack is an attack on all countries as a basis for response. Invite them to consider various types of responses, including diplomacy, censures, technological techniques, business models and more. Ask students to draw on what they learned in this lesson to explain their positions more fully. Going Further | Students can go online to research issues that China censors, like Tibetan Buddhism, the Falun Gong and the events at Tiananmen Square in 1989. They might try comparing the results they get from Google.com and Google.cn or merely trying to figure out why the Chinese government wants to restrict access to information on these topics. Alternatively, they might restrict their search to NYTimes.com, noting that there is no freedom of the press in China. Give students the writable Censoring the Press handout (PDF) to write about the information they found while researching. When they are finished, have them share their findings.

Iran's Opposition Seeks More Help in Cyberwar With Government,"At a time when the Obama administration is pressing for harsher sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program, democracy advocates in Iran have been celebrating the recent decision by the United States to lift sanctions on various online services, which they say only helped Tehran to suppress the opposition.    But it is still a long way from the activists' goal of lifting all restrictions on trade in Internet services, which opposition leaders say is vital to maintaining the open communications that have underpinned the protests that erupted last summer after the disputed presidential election. In recent months the government has carried out cyberwarfare against the opposition, eliminating virtually all sources of independent news and information and shutting down social networking services.     The sanctions against online services -- provided through free software like Google Chat or Yahoo Messenger -- were intended to restrict Iran's ability to develop nuclear technology, but democracy advocates say they ended up helping the government repress its people. ''The policies were contradictory,'' said Ali Akbar Moussavi Khoini, a former member of Parliament who now lives in Washington, where he pressed for the change.    The new measure will enable users in Iran to download the latest circumvention software to help defeat the government's efforts to block Web sites, and to stop relying on pirated copies that can be far more easily hacked by the government.   But the government's opponents say they need still more help in getting around the government's information roadblocks.   ''The Islamic Republic is very efficient in limiting people's access to these sources, and Iranian people need major help,'' said Mehdi Yahyanejad, the founder of one of the largest Persian-language social networking Web sites, the United States-based Balatarin. ''We need some 50 percent of people to be able to access independent news sources other than the state-controlled media.''    Web sites, social networking and satellite television became major sources of news and tools for organizing and mobilizing people. The opposition posted news about the demonstrations and videos of the security forces' use of violence against protesters. A video of her final moments turned Neda Agha Soltan, the 26-year-old woman who was shot by government forces, into an international symbol.   But the authorities came to realize the significance of the networking tools and began efforts to eliminate them. In December its ''cyberarmy'' attacked Twitter, which was a major communications tool for the opposition. The hackers redirected Twitter users to a page in English that read, ''This page has been hacked by the Iranian cyberarmy.''   In recent months the government slowed the Internet to a crawl, so that users were unable to perform the simplest operations, like opening Gmail or Yahoo accounts. It has become impossible to post a video, and opposition Web sites have been blocked. The government has also jammed opposition and news satellite channels, including Persian-language Voice of America television and BBC Persian, which were watched by millions.   The government has jailed many cyberexperts in recent months, charging some with ''waging war against God,'' potentially a capital crime, for sending political e-mail messages. This month Parliament announced a $500 million budget for cyberwarfare, the Fars news agency recently reported.   The opposition tried to fight back with software designed to circumvent the restrictions, but that became a losing battle after Internet service was slowed.   Opposition leaders say they would like to have access to Internet hardware -- any products made by Cisco Systems, for example, are subject to sanctions -- and high-speed satellite Internet service, which experts say is generally harder to jam than broadcasts. That service is available from the American company Hughes Global Services, in Europe and the Middle East, and could be used by Iranians. But Payam Herischi, senior director at Hughes, said that the company was reluctant to allow its satellites to provide service to Iran until sanctions are lifted.   Iran, which has no communications satellites of its own, is dependent on foreign companies for broadcasting all its local channels as well as English, Persian and Arabic channels. Its jamming of BBC Persian and Voice of America violated international regulations.   ''What Iran is doing can cause serious chaos in the international satellite order,'' said Sadeq Saba, the director of Persian-language BBC television. ''If other countries begin to retaliate and jam Iran's channels, there will be serious chaos.''   After Iranian jamming last December of the Voice of America and the BBC, the French company Eutelsat duplicated the services, which were on one of its popular Hot Bird satellites, on a more advanced satellite that is resistant to jamming. But that required Iranians to purchase new equipment, which is illegal and hard to find.    While most in the opposition focused on the tactical battle with the government, some saw the struggle in broader terms.    ''This is not about the opposition Green Movement in Iran now,'' said Mr. Khoini, a visiting scholar at Stanford. ''This is about democracy and the fact that when people have access to information, they can make wise choices. No one, even the current leaders of the opposition, can hijack the movement like the way the Islamists did in the 1979 revolution if people can have access to free information.''  "
Attacks on Military Computers Cited,"WASHINGTON -- Computer networks essential to the Pentagon and military are attacked by individual hackers, criminal groups and nations hundreds of thousands of times every day, according to the officer nominated to lead a cyberwarfare command.    The officer, Lt. Gen. Keith B. Alexander, said Thursday that one crucial reason that Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates created a Cyber Command was ''the amount of attacks that we're seeing coming into the Defense Department gateways every day.''   Senator Carl Levin, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the new command ''warrants careful scrutiny,'' because ''capabilities to operate in cyberspace have outpaced the development of policy, law and precedent.''    ''This policy gap is especially concerning,'' he said, ''because cyberweapons and cyberattacks potentially can be devastating, approaching weapons of mass destruction in their effects.''    Lawmakers questioned General Alexander on the federal law and presidential authorities governing military capabilities under the Cyber Command that might be called on to operate on American soil in a crisis.   They urged that the new command coordinate closely with the Department of Homeland Security and the military's Northern Command, responsible for defense of United States territory.  "
U.S. Companies Say Chinese Procurement Rules Threaten Proprietary Information,"BEIJING -- China is expected to  issue regulations on Saturday requiring technology companies to disclose proprietary information like data-encryption keys and underlying software code to sell a range of security-related digital technology products to government agencies, American industry officials said on Friday.   But they said it remained unclear how vigorously Chinese officials would enforce the new rules, which already are watered down from a sweeping proposal first raised in 2007. Both the American and European technology industries have contended that the rules are unworkable and that they amount to trade protectionism.    One concern is that the rules will allow the leak of crucial foreign technologies to Chinese competitors who are seeking to build a technology industry on a par with the West.   The European Union's chief trade official, Karel De Gucht, said in a visit to Beijing this week that the rules had ''no real base in reality,'' and urged the Beijing government to overhaul them.   The regulations, set to take effect on Friday, largely affect sales of network routers, smart cards, firewall software and other products involved in protecting digital data. They would require software and equipment from both Chinese and foreign companies to meet new technology standards before being certified for sale to government agencies.   To be certified, companies apparently would have to give government-connected testing laboratories encryption algorithms, software source code and design specifications that, for many of the products, are regarded as sensitive trade secrets.   In interviews, American industry officials argued that the rules not only sought details well beyond what was needed to certify the products, but that there were few safeguards to protect the proprietary information from outsiders.   ''Even if you're not talking about the really sensitive stuff, it's not clear yet how product information will be protected or secured while it is running through the testing process,'' John Neuffer, a vice president at the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group based in Washington, said in a telephone interview.    ''China asks for companies to go through testing labs that are essentially state-owned, government-owned,'' he said. ''That's the sensitive part.''   The regulations are part of a long-running argument between Western technology companies and the Chinese government over the West's access to Chinese markets. In the last month, China averted another dispute by rolling back a second plan aimed at giving Chinese companies an advantage in government technology purchases.   But foreign companies still contend that the latest regulations will grant Chinese companies an unfair edge in government sales, a comparatively small but growing part of the market here.   They also worry that the disclosure rules will enable Chinese competitors to copy Western technology.  When the 2007 certification proposal was first introduced, some Chinese officials cast it as part of a broader campaign to help the nation's computer-technology companies gain ground against more advanced Western competitors.   In negotiations, Chinese officials have argued that the United States imposes similar disclosure requirements on many advanced technologies. Mr. Neuffer and others said, however, that except for some military and national security technologies, American certification procedures are far less rigorous and are conducted in testing labs independent from the government.   Other foreign critics have called the regulations an example of trade protectionism, in that they would set standards for selling goods to Chinese governments that Western companies find difficult to meet. Many Chinese technology companies  have agreed to abide by the rules.   In Beijing, an American industry expert who has negotiated with the Chinese government on the issue said that most American companies were likely to abandon sales to the Chinese government rather than turn over trade secrets. That expert declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the talks with the Chinese.   American industry officials also have argued that the new rules would gut their technology exports, because few other nations would purchase technology whose essential security secrets had been shared with the Chinese government.   Publicly, the United States government has taken a muted stance on the dispute. Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative in Washington, noted in a statement that the Chinese first planned to apply the rules to all technology purchases, but later scaled them back to apply only to purchases by local, provincial and national governments.   ''We were pleased with that decision,'' her statement said. ''Since then, the U.S. has continued to ask China to follow global norms in this area, and we are continuing those discussions.''  "
"A Silent Attack, but Not a Subtle One","SAN FRANCISCO AS in real warfare, even the most carefully aimed weapon in computer warfare leaves collateral damage. The Stuxnet worm was no different. The most striking aspect of the fast-spreading malicious computer program -- which has turned up in industrial programs around the world and which Iran said had appeared in the computers of workers in its nuclear project -- may not have been how sophisticated it was, but rather how sloppy its creators were in letting a specifically aimed attack scatter randomly around the globe. The malware was so skillfully designed that computer security specialists who have examined it were almost certain it had been created by a government and is a prime example of clandestine digital warfare. While there have been suspicions of other government uses of computer worms and viruses, Stuxnet is the first to go after industrial systems. But unlike those other attacks, this bit of malware did not stay invisible.  If Stuxnet is the latest example of what a government organization can do, it contains some glaring shortcomings. The program was splattered on thousands of computer systems around the world, and much of its impact has been on those systems, rather than on what appears to have been its intended target, Iranian equipment. Computer security specialists are also puzzled by why it was created to spread so widely. Global alarm over the deadly computer worm has come many months after the program was suspected of stealthily entering an Iranian nuclear enrichment plant, perhaps carried on a U.S.B. memory drive containing the malware. Computer security specialists have speculated that once inside the factory and within the software that controls equipment, the worm reprogrammed centrifuges made by a specific company, Siemens, to make them fail in a way that would be virtually undetectable. Whether the program achieved its goal is not known. Much speculation about the target has focused on the Iran nuclear plant at Natanz. In mid-July the Wikileaks Web site reported that it had learned of a serious nuclear accident at the plant. But international nuclear inspectors say no evidence of one exists. The timing is intriguing because a time stamp found in the Stuxnet program says it was created in January, suggesting that any digital attack took place long before it was identified and began to attract global attention. The head of the Bushehr nuclear plant in Iran said Sunday that the worm had affected only the personal computers of staff members, Reuters reported. Western nations say they do not believe Bushehr is being used to develop nuclear weapons. Citing the state-run newspaper Iran Daily, Reuters reported that Iran's telecommunications minister, Reza Taghipour, said the worm had not penetrated or caused ''serious damage to government systems.'' Siemens has said that the worm was found in only 15 plants around the world using its equipment and that no factory's operations were affected. But now the malware not only is detectable, but also is continuing to spread through computer systems around the world through the Internet. It is also raising fear of dangerous proliferation. Stuxnet has laid bare significant vulnerabilities in industrial control systems. The program is being examined for clues not only by the world's computer security companies, but also by intelligence agencies and countless hackers. ''Proliferation is a real problem, and no country is prepared to deal with it,'' said Melissa Hathaway, a former United States national cybersecurity coordinator. The widespread availability of the attack techniques revealed by the software has set off alarms among industrial control specialists, she said: ''All of these guys are scared to death. We have about 90 days to fix this before some hacker begins using it.'' The ability of Stuxnet to infiltrate these systems will ''require a complete reassessment'' of security systems and processes, starting with federal technology standards and nuclear regulations, said Joe Weiss, a specialist in the security of industrial control systems who is managing partner at Applied Control Solutions in Cupertino, Calif. One big question is why its creators let the software spread widely, giving up many of its secrets in the process. One possibility is that they simply did not care. Their government may have been so eager to stop the Iranian nuclear program that the urgency of the attack trumped the tradecraft techniques that traditionally do not leave fingerprints, digital or otherwise. While much has been made in the news media of the sophistication of Stuxnet, it is likely that there have been many other attacks of similar or even greater sophistication by intelligence agencies from many countries in the past. What sets this one apart is that it became highly visible. Security specialists contrast Stuxnet with an intrusion discovered in the Greek cellphone network in March 2005. It also displayed a level of skill that only the intelligence agency of some foreign power would have. A two-year investigation by the Greek government found an extremely sophisticated Trojan horse program that had been hidden by someone who was able to modify and then insert 29 secret programs into each of four telephone switching computers. The spy system came apart only when a software upgrade provided by the manufacturer led to some text messages, sent from the system of another cellphone operator, being undelivered. The level of skill needed to pull off the operation and the targets strongly indicated that the culprit was a government. An even more remarkable set of events surrounded the 2007 Israeli Air Force attack on what was suspected of being a Syrian nuclear reactor under construction. Accounts of the event initially indicated that sophisticated jamming technology had been used to blind the radar so Israeli aircraft went unnoticed. In May 2008, however, a report in an American technical publication, IEEE Spectrum, cited a European industry source as raising the possibility that the Israelis had used a built-in kill switch to shut down the radar. A former member of the United States intelligence community said that the attack had been the work of Israel's equivalent of America's National Security Agency, known as Unit 8200. But if the attack was based on a worm or a virus, there was never a smoking gun like Stuxnet.  "
Iran Says It Arrested Suspects Linked to a Computer Worm,"TEHRAN -- Iran has arrested an unspecified number of ''nuclear spies'' in connection with a damaging worm that has infected computers in its nuclear program, the intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi, said Saturday.  Mr. Moslehi also told the semiofficial Mehr news agency that the ministry had achieved ''complete mastery'' over government computer systems and was able to counter any cyberattacks by ''enemy spy services.'' Iran confirmed last week that the Stuxnet worm, a malicious self-replicating program that attacks computers that control industrial plants, had infected computers in its nuclear operations. Officials said it had been found in personal computers at the Bushehr nuclear plant, a power generator that is not believed to be part of a weapons program, and that it had not caused ''serious damage'' to government systems. While the origins of the worm remain obscure, many computer security experts believe it was created by a government with the intent of sabotaging Iran's nuclear program, which Western countries believe is aimed at creating a nuclear weapon. The United States and Israel have cyberwarfare programs and both countries have sought to undermine Iran's nuclear enrichment program, but neither has commented on the Stuxnet worm. Iran has portrayed the worm as a cyberattack by Western powers and Israel intended to derail the country's nuclear program, which the government says is for peaceful purposes. ''All of the destructive activities perpetrated by the oppressors in cyberspace will be discovered quickly and means of combating these plans will be implemented,'' Mr. Moslehi said. ''The intelligence Ministry is aware of a range of activities being carried out against the Islamic Republic by enemy spy services.'' He provided no further details on the arrests, which could not be independently verified. Hamid Alipour, an official at the state-run Iran Information Technology company, has said that the worm is spreading. ''This is not a stable virus,'' he said last week. ''By the time we started to combat it three new variants had been distributed.'' He said his company hoped to eliminate it within ''one to two months.''  "
Facebook And Privacy Clash Again,"For many users of Facebook, the world's largest social network, it was just the latest in a string of frustrations.   On Wednesday, users discovered a glitch that gave them access to supposedly private information in the accounts of their Facebook friends, like chat conversations.   Not long before, Facebook had introduced changes that essentially forced users to choose between making information about their interests available to anyone or removing it altogether.   Although Facebook quickly moved to close the security hole on Wednesday, the breach heightened a feeling among many users that it was becoming hard to trust the service to protect their personal information.   ''Facebook has become more scary than fun,'' said Jeffrey P. Ament, 35, a government contractor who lives in Rockville, Md.    Mr. Ament said he was so fed up with Facebook that he deleted his account this week after three years of using the service. ''Every week there seems to be a new privacy update or change, and I just can't keep up with it.''   Facebook said it did not think the security hole, which was open a few hours, would have a lasting impact on the company's reputation.   ''For a service that has grown as dramatically as we have grown, that now assists with more than 400 million people sharing billions of pieces of content with their friends and the institutions they care about, we think our track record for security and safety is unrivaled,'' said Elliot Schrage, the company's vice president for public policy. ''Are we perfect? Of course not.''   Facebook is increasingly finding itself at the center of a tense discussion over privacy and how personal data is used by the Web sites that collect it, said James E. Katz, a professor of communications at Rutgers University.   ''It's clear that we keep discovering new boundaries of privacy that are possible to push and just as quickly breached,'' Mr. Katz said.   Social networking experts and analysts wonder whether Facebook is pushing the envelope in a way that could damage its reputation over time. The privacy mishap on Wednesday did not help matters.   ''While this breach appears to be relatively small, it's inopportunely timed,'' said Augie Ray, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''It threatens to undermine what Facebook hopes to achieve with its network over the next few years, because users have to ask whether it is a platform worthy of their trust.''   Over the last few months, Facebook has introduced changes that encourage users to make their photos and other information accessible to anyone on the Internet. Last month its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, unveiled plans to begin sharing users' information with some outside Web sites, and Facebook began prompting users to link information in their profile pages, like their hobbies and hometowns, in a way that makes that information public.   That last change prompted the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group, to file a complaint on Wednesday with the Federal Trade Commission.   ''Facebook continues to manipulate the privacy settings of users and its own privacy policy so that it can take personal information provided by users for a limited purpose and make it widely available for commercial purposes,'' Marc Rotenberg, the group's executive director, said in a letter to the commission.   The extent of the discontent among users is hard to quantify, but one measure is a group created on Facebook to protest the recent changes, which has attracted more than 2.2 million members.   Mr. Schrage said that the company was aware that some users were not happy with the changes, but that the overall response had been positive.   Part of the reason Facebook's recent changes are upsetting users is that, in contrast to a service like Twitter, most people signed up for Facebook with the understanding that their information would be available only to an approved circle of friends, said Danah Boyd, a social media researcher at Microsoft and a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society.   ''Facebook started out with a strong promise of privacy,'' she said. ''You had to be at a university or some network to sign up. That's part of how it competed with other social networks, by being the anti-MySpace.''   As the company has changed its approach to privacy, it has introduced new ways for users to adjust their privacy settings. But these tools have grown increasingly convoluted, leaving many users frustrated and unsure of what information is available to whom. They say a site that they joined for the sake of friends and fun has started to feel too much like work.   ''At this point, I have no idea how many times I've changed my settings,'' said Lauren Snead, a 24-year-old student in Murfreesboro, Tenn. ''I've done it so many times. I'm tired of logging in one day and seeing everything is different and trying to understand what it means.''   In addition, many users are not even aware of the privacy settings, Ms. Boyd said. A recent survey from Consumer Reports found that 23 percent of Facebook users either did not know the site offered privacy controls or chose not to use them.   Mr. Schrage said the company was working to clear up confusion about the settings.   Many frustrated users may not give up on the site because it has become a vital form of communication. Facebook continues to add users at a rapid clip, doubling in size in the last year.   ''I'm not going to quit Facebook, because it's so ingrained in the culture,'' said Ryan Scannell, a 26-year-old food scientist in Chicago. ''Facebook is not a private place, I don't expect it to be. But at the same time, I'd like to control what's accessible to strangers and what's accessible to family and friends.''   There are financial motives behind the company's moves. One of the ways Facebook makes money with its free service is by customizing the selection of advertisements shown to individual users. The more information that users put into their profiles, the more the company can make from such focused ads.   In addition, analysts say Facebook may be eyeing the lucrative market for online search, figuring that its users will be more likely to turn to their friends for advice and information than the wider Web. That opens up more opportunities for advertisers.   ''They're heating up in their battle against Google,'' said Sean Sullivan, a security adviser at the Internet security firm F-Secure who analyzes social networks. ''If I'm looking for a day care for my 6-year-old, I'm going to put that in my status message, not do a Google search.''   Mr. Schrage of Facebook said the controversy over the site's changes was indicative of a larger shift online.   ''Facebook has been made the center of attention around a really important issue of how technology is changing the conception of privacy, control and sharing,'' he said. ''People are uneasy about it, but as they start to see the benefits and advantages of it, they start to see the value of the experiences.'' Correction: May 10, 2010, Monday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about Facebook users' privacy concerns referred incorrectly to the type of information the site uses to customize advertising for individual users. It uses both public and private information on the user's profile page, not public information alone.  "
Far-Ranging Support for Google's China Move,"Google's surprising decision this week to abandon cooperation with Chinese government censors -- and, possibly, its four-year effort to do business here -- is galvanizing an unusually broad coalition of foreigners who hope for a fresh chance to rein in the conduct of an emerging great power.   Most of those forces -- from the American right and left, the business and technology communities and human-rights advocacy groups -- are united by a belief that their concerns over China's human-rights and free-speech constraints have been buried in a rush to online profit. Some of them have been dismayed by the conciliatory approach toward Beijing taken by the Obama administration, which counts Google's leadership among its most prominent political supporters. Others claim that the problems that prompted Google's stance are symptoms of a serious decline in China's business climate under an increasingly conservative leadership. But it is far from clear that this movement will succeed in prodding either the Chinese government or other companies who still dream of a vast market. Google, which said it would stop cooperating with Chinese censors after uncovering Chinese hackers' efforts to penetrate its computers and steal information on human-rights activists, has officially remained on the sidelines of this movement.     In recent weeks, however, it has quietly taken some steps that in retrospect seem aimed squarely at addressing the attacks. In December, a Google senior vice president, Jonathan Rosenberg, issued an online manifesto that placed Google's business and ethical interests squarely behind open information, and against censorship.   ''There are forces aligned against the open Internet -- governments who control access, companies who fight in their own self-interests to preserve the status quo,'' he wrote. ''They are powerful, and if they succeed we will find ourselves inhabiting an Internet of fragmentation, stagnation, higher prices, and less competition.''   More pointedly, a Google engineer's blog announced this week that the company's popular Gmail service, which was a target of the Chinese hackers, will henceforth employ extra encryption by default.   Those who hope to use Google's stance as a wedge to pressure China argue that its refusal to cooperate with Chinese censors will prove a watershed.   ''Good for Google for naming the elephant in the room,'' one Beijing entrepreneur, an American with a deep knowledge of China's Internet, said in an interview on Thursday. That person, like many others interviewed, declined to be identified for fear that the Chinese government would retaliate. ''Who else in the world has moral authority against China? Who else? Only Google, and they just used it. They just shot their bullet.''   Jonathan Zittrain, a Harvard law professor and a founder of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, said that Google's action had raised the ethical bar for foreign investors across China. ''I think every major outside firm is clearly going to have to do a reality check with itself in the wake of the Google announcement,'' he said.    But the early reaction to Google's announcement suggests otherwise. Microsoft, whose Bing search engine has entered the Chinese market, has shown no public inclination to change its business here. Apple's iTunes service still forbids Chinese users from downloading certain applications that refer to the Dalai Lama and the Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer.    ''Your everyday investor in China is not concerned with these problems, especially when they're selling tractors, cars and airplanes,'' said Stephen A. Orlins, the president of the National Committee on United States-China Relations. ''I think they'll wait to see what the Chinese government's role in this really is.''   Even some Internet experts are skeptical that Google's stand will galvanize a broader effort to liberalize China's free-speech or human rights policies. A number of blogs argue that Google already faced a dim future in China, where its search engine was a distant second to the home-grown Baidu service, and that threatening to leave the market was more a public-relations move than a moral crusade.   ''I don't think you'll see a giant ripple effect,'' said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an information technology research and consulting firm in Beijing. ''It is possible that if Microsoft does nothing after Google does, this will reflect poorly on them.''   But then, ''you can justify a lot of things if the pot of gold is big enough,'' he added.   By Google's standards, the money in China is not yet big. Perhaps 50 million Internet users rely on Google, less than half the number of regular Baidu users, and the advertising that Google sells on its site is proportionately smaller.   Still, surveys show that Google's users are the cream of China's Web-surfing class -- more educated, wealthier and better informed than others. Users also rated Google superior to Baidu in finding Web pages, according to a survey by China IntelliConsulting Group -- perhaps because Google censors fewer Web sites than do most Chinese search engines.   Google's supporters say they hope that the company's public repudiation of censorship will reignite a free-speech debate that has seriously diminished since coverage of China business news began to rival that of its political developments.    The broad constituency of Google supporters may bolster their cause. Since its announcement, Google has won praise from The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page and from the generally left-leaning advocacy group Human Rights Watch.    In the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House and an ardent Democrat, called Google's actions ''an example to businesses and governments,'' while the New Jersey Republican Chris Smith demanded legislation to prevent American technology firms from working with foreign nations that conduct Internet surveillance of their own citizens.   Outside government, some advocates are offering their own suggestions to raise the free-speech issue more broadly. In interviews, two American entrepreneurs working in China said that civil-liberties supporters should consider pressuring major investors like pensions funds and university endowments to renounce their investment in Chinese companies that engage in repression or theft of intellectual property.   Many investment advisors routinely offer baskets of stocks that include Chinese companies that violate not just American laws on the theft of intellectual property, but Chinese laws as well, one Internet expert said. Although China has agreed to World Trade Organization rules barring the theft of such property, Internet companies here routinely stream American and other movies free over their Web sites, without apparent consequences.   Others suggested that Google employees, who are routinely allowed to spend one in five workdays on the project of their choice, devote their time to devising ways to subvert Chinese censorship of the Internet. A popular Twitter post advocated that Google, Facebook and Twitter -- three American services subject to comprehensive censorship here -- sponsor the American pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, defending an open society against the closed version being offered by China's leaders.   Would those gambits work? One Internet industry analyst, who also declined to be named, had his doubts. The major effect of Google's departure from Beijing, he said, would be to free 700 trained technology experts to work for a Chinese competitor.   ''Ultimately,'' he said, ''I just don't think that they care that much.''  "
Wall St. Programmer Guilty of Code Theft,"8:16 p.m. Updated The case that put a spotlight on the world of ultra-fast, computer-driven trading of stocks has ended in a conviction. Sergey Aleynikov, a 40-year-old former Goldman Sachs programmer, was found guilty on Friday by a federal jury in Manhattan of stealing proprietary source code from the bank's high-frequency trading platform. He was convicted on two counts - theft of trade secrets and transportation of stolen property - and faces up to 10 years in prison. Mr. Aleynikov's arrest in 2009 drew attention to a business that had been little known outside Wall Street - high-frequency trading, which uses complex computer algorithms to make lightning-fast trades to exploit tiny discrepancies in price. Such trading has become an increasingly important source of revenue for Wall Street firms and hedge funds, and those companies fiercely protect the code underpinning their trading strategies.  During the two-week trial, Judge Denise L. Cote closed the courtroom to the public several times to protect Goldman's proprietary source code. Yet several details emerged about the firm's high-frequency trading business, including that the unit accounted for about $300 million in revenue last year, less than 1 percent of Goldman's total revenue of $45 billion. The verdict is a victory for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the case and has recently raised its profile with its aggressive pursuit of corporate crime. It is also a victory for the Justice Department more broadly, which has made the prosecution of high-tech crime and intellectual property theft a priority. ''As today's guilty verdict demonstrates, we will use the full force of the federal law to prosecute those who steal valuable and proprietary information from their employers, whether those firms are on Wall Street or Main Street,'' Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. Until 18 months ago, Mr. Aleynikov was living the American dream. He came to the United States from Russia in 1990 with expertise in computer programming. His services were in demand at Goldman, which paid him $400,000 a year to write code for its high-frequency trading business, making him one of the bank's highest-paid programmers. He was recruited away from Goldman by Teza Technologies, a fledgling firm founded by an executive from the Citadel Investment Group, a giant Chicago hedge fund. Teza offered to pay about triple his Goldman salary. During his last three days at Goldman, Mr. Aleynikov uploaded source code to a server in Germany that allowed him to do an end around the company's security systems. After discovering that he had stolen code, Goldman reported him to federal authorities. On the evening of July 3, 2009, six agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation met Mr. Aleynikov as he landed at Newark International airport and arrested him. There was no dispute that Mr. Aleynikov had violated Goldman's confidentiality agreements when he uploaded portions of the bank's trading code to a server in Germany. The case, then, boiled down to this: Did Mr. Aleynikov intend to steal Goldman's proprietary source code to benefit his new employer? Kevin Marino, Mr. Aleynikov's lawyer, mounted a defense that tried to draw the distinction that while his client foolishly breached Goldman's confidentiality agreements, he did not commit a crime. Mr. Aleynikov acknowledged uploading code but told the F.B.I. that he never intended to steal Goldman's proprietary information. Instead, he merely wanted to take some publicly available open-source code with him on the way out the door. Mr. Marino portrayed his client as a humble and hard-working Russian who came to the United States with $300 in his pocket. Mr. Aleynikov, who is separated from his wife, lives in New Jersey and has three young children. Mr. Marino ridiculed the notion that Mr. Aleynikov was taking Goldman's ''secret sauce algorithms'' and somehow hurting the banking giant. ''There's not a law in the land that makes it a crime to use of collect or download open-source code,'' said Mr. Marino during the trial. ''I will dispute to my death that violating a Goldman Sachs confidentiality provision is a federal crime.'' Federal prosecutors depicted Mr. Aleynikov as a brazen crook who was ''meticulous, deliberate and clever'' in filching thousands of files and hundreds of thousands of lines of code from Goldman. He sought to use that code, prosecutors argued, as the building blocks to create a hedge fund trading platform at Teza. The government's strategy was to play to the jury's basic sense of right and wrong. ''This is a case about theft and greed,'' said Joseph Facciponti, the lead prosecutor, in his opening statement. The government made much of Mr. Aleynikov's deleting and encrypting various files after he took them from Goldman's servers. ''Like a good thief, he covered his tracks, brushing aside his digital footprint,'' Rebecca Rohr, a prosecutor, said in her closing remarks. After receiving the case Thursday afternoon, the jury deliberated for three hours Friday morning. Mr. Aleynikov sat stoically as Judge Cote read the verdict. A family friend comforted Mr. Aleynikov's mother, who had watched the trial each day from the spectators' gallery. Both Mr Aleynikov and Mr. Marino, his lawyer, declined to comment. All 12 of the jurors declined to speak about the case. Before dismissing the panel, Judge Cote warned them that if they were going to speak about the case, they must not discuss anything related to Goldman's code. Mr. Aleynikov remains free on bail but because he holds dual United States and Russian citizenship, the judge placed him under home confinement and electronic monitoring until his sentencing, which is set for March 18. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Warrant Is Issued for Landis in French Data Hacking Case,"The United States cyclist Floyd Landis was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs, but the fallout from his doping case has lingered.     Thomas Cassuto, a French judge, issued an arrest warrant for Landis last month, in connection with a computer hacking case, said Astrid Granoux, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office in Nanterre, a suburb of Paris, which is handling the matter.   ''That means he would be arrested if he came to France,'' Granoux said Monday, adding that the warrant had not been distributed outside of French territory.   Landis, who raced for the Ouch Pro Cycling Team last year, parted ways with the team last fall. He could not be reached for comment Monday.   Cassuto is seeking to question Landis about the data hacking that occurred in the fall of 2006 at the Chatenay-Malabry antidoping lab, which is the facility that conducted the tests on Landis's urine samples from the 2006 Tour.    A very public dispute between Landis and the lab's officials was the crux of Landis's defense in his doping case, which ended in his being barred from the sport for two years. Landis and his defense team had alleged that the lab's testing procedures were sloppy, so its test results could not be trusted.   Pierre Bordry, the lab's director, said a security breach of the facility's computers occurred because hackers wanted to obtain data to discredit its scientists. He said that some of the stolen data had been altered to make it seem as if the lab had made errors.   In November 2006, lab officials filed a formal complaint saying that its computer data had been stolen and used in Landis's defense. That confidential data was also sent to other labs and news media, officials said. A subsequent search of the lab's computers turned up a Trojan horse, which is a program that allowed an outsider to remotely download files.   Investigators concluded that the program could have originated from an e-mail message sent to the lab from a computer using the same Internet protocol address as Arnie Baker, Landis's coach.    Landis and Baker, who continue to insist that Landis did not use performance-enhancing drugs to win the Tour, deny being involved in the computer hacking.  "
Loophole May Have Aided Theft of Classified Data,"WASHINGTON -- The soldier accused of downloading a huge trove of secret data from military computers in Iraq appears to have exploited a loophole in Defense Department security to copy thousands of  files onto compact discs over a six-month period. In at least one instance, according to those familiar with the inquiry, the soldier smuggled highly classified data out of his intelligence unit on a disc disguised as a music CD by Lady Gaga.   Criminal charges were filed this week against the soldier, Pfc. Bradley E. Manning, 22, who was accused of downloading more than 150,000 diplomatic cables, as well as secret videos and a PowerPoint presentation. Since his arrest in May, with initial accounts blaming him for leaking video of a deadly American helicopter attack in Baghdad in 2007, officials have sought to determine how he could have removed voluminous amounts of secret data without being caught.     A Defense Department directive from November 2008 prohibits the use of small thumb drives or larger external memory devices on any of the estimated seven million computers operated by the Pentagon and armed services. The order was issued to forestall the accidental infection of national security computer networks by viruses -- and the intentional removal of classified information.   Defense Department computers have their portals disabled to prevent the use of external memory devices that are ubiquitous in homes, offices and schools, officials said. A recent amendment to the order allows the rare use of thumb drives, but only with official approval as required by a current mission.   But the Pentagon directive and the amendment did not ban the use of compact-disc devices, which are built into many computers and therefore not included in the prohibition against the use of external memory devices.    According to Pentagon officials and one former hacker who has communicated with Private Manning, he appears to have taken compact discs that can accept text, video and other data files into an intelligence center in the desert of eastern Iraq to copy and remove the classified information.   He was able to avoid detection not because he kept a poker face, they said, but apparently because he hummed and lip-synched to Lady Gaga songs to make it appear that he was using the classified computer's CD player to listen to music.   Adrian Lamo, a well-known former hacker, had traded electronic messages in which Private Manning described his unhappiness with the Army -- and, Mr. Lamo said, his activities downloading classified data.   Mr. Lamo said Private Manning described how he had used compact discs capable of storing data, but tucked inside recognizable music CD cases, ''to bring the data out of the secure room.''   ''He indicated he disguised one as a Lady Gaga CD,'' Mr. Lamo said Thursday in a telephone interview. ''He said he lip-synched to blend in.''   The four pages of official charges against Private Manning accuse him of downloading and removing the classified data from last November to May. The charges say he also loaded unauthorized software onto a computer linked to the military's classified computer network, called the SIPR-Net. The charges do not explain the significance of that action, nor how it might have aided his alleged effort to download classified files.   In downloading more than 150,000 diplomatic cables, the charges state, Private Manning did ''intentionally exceed his authorized access on'' the SIPR-Net. This statement appears to be at least a partial explanation of how a soldier assigned to an Army brigade outpost in eastern Iraq was able to gain access to classified diplomatic cables on a variety of unrelated subjects.   At a Pentagon news conference on Thursday, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said they would reserve judgment on whether to order a sweeping review of security measures until it was determined whether the actions of which Private Manning is accused represent a broader problem.   ''What this illustrates is the incredible amount of trust we place in even our most junior men and women in uniform,'' Mr. Gates said. ''We have over two million men and women in uniform, and I believe we should always err on the side of trusting them because virtually all of them -- not 100 percent, but nearly 100 percent -- give us reasons every single day to continue trusting them.''   Pentagon officials said they expected investigators to review the actions of Private Manning's supervisors to determine whether enforcement of security rules was lax in a remote outpost where soldiers are assigned to duty at computers virtually around the clock.   Another line of inquiry is expected to look at whether digital red flags were raised, or should have been raised, by Private Manning's actions, including the accusation that he spent time downloading information from classified databases not directly related to the mission of his unit, the Second Brigade of the 10th Mountain Division, based at Contingency Operating Station Hammer east of Baghdad.

2 Big Hotel Chains Settle a Theft Suit,"A bitter legal dispute between two of the world's largest hotel chains has come to an end. Hilton Worldwide and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide have reached a settlement over claims that Hilton executives stole confidential documents related to Starwood's successful W chain, according to documents filed on Wednesday in federal court in White Plains, N.Y.  The settlement includes a substantial payment by Hilton to Starwood, according to a source with direct knowledge of the pact. It subjects Hilton to an injunction, approved by a federal judge, that prohibits the hotel chain from starting any new ''lifestyle'' hotels for two years, a blow for a company that had made this a major growth initiative. Hilton will also hire two court-appointed monitors - effectively corporate baby-sitters - who will oversee the hotel chain's compliance with the settlement. A federal grand jury in Manhattan continues to investigate whether Hilton and its former executives should face criminal charges in connection to the claims, according to the court filing. ''Hilton Worldwide regrets the circumstances surrounding the dispute with Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide and is pleased to bring an end to this prolonged litigation,'' Christopher J. Nassetta, Hilton's chief executive officer, said in a statement. ''Given the facts, we had no choice but to stand up and protect our brands on behalf of our investors, associates, owners and customers,'' Frits van Paasschen, Starwood's chief executive, said in a statement. ''This settlement reinforces this protection and restores a level playing field for fair competition.'' In April 2009, Starwood sued Hilton and two of its executives, Ross Klein and Amar Lalvani, accusing them of stealing more than 100,000 documents containing Starwood's ''most competitively sensitive information.'' ''This is the clearest imaginable case of corporate espionage, theft of trade secrets, unfair competition and computer fraud,'' the lawsuit said. Mr. Klein and Mr. Lalvani were former Starwood executives poached by Hilton to develop its own luxury hotel brand - called Denizen - to compete with the W chain. With great fanfare, Hilton had announced its new brand just a month before Hilton's lawsuit, which halted the Denizen rollout. Hilton, the world's largest hotel chain, is owned by private equity firm Blackstone Group. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Clinton Makes Case for Internet Freedom as a Plank of American Foreign Policy,"Declaring that an attack on one nation's computer networks ''can be an attack on all,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton issued a warning on Thursday that the United States would defend itself from cyberattacks, though she left unclear the means of response.   In a sweeping, pointed address that dealt with the Internet as a force for both liberation and repression, Mrs. Clinton said: ''Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy, our government and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber-attacks should face consequences and international condemnation.''    Her speech was the first in which a senior American official had articulated a vision for making Internet freedom a plank of American foreign policy. While the details remained sketchy, her remarks could have far-reaching consequences, given the confrontation between Google and the Chinese government over the company's assertion that its networks had been subject to a sophisticated attack that originated in mainland China.   Mrs. Clinton called for China to investigate Google's accusation and be open about its findings. She said that the United States supported Google in publicly defying the Chinese government's requirement that it censor the contents of its Chinese-language search engine.     ''Censorship should not be in any way accepted by any company from anywhere,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''American companies need to take a principled stand. This needs to be part of our national brand.''   This month Google announced that it was ''no longer willing to continue censoring'' search results for its Chinese users, pointing to breaches of Gmail accounts held by human rights activists in China. Several other companies had also been targets of hacking, the company found. Google has avoided placing direct blame on the government in Beijing, which has sought to describe the situation as strictly a business dispute.   The Obama administration has been similarly cautious. Last week, a senior administration official said the United States would issue a ''demarche'' -- a diplomatic move often used to lodge a protest -- against China in the coming days. An official said Thursday that the administration would hold off  to see whether the Chinese responded to Mrs. Clinton's call for an explanation of the Google allegations.   The administration's dealings with China are further complicated by the American debt held by the Chinese government and issues like climate change, on which the United States is seeking its cooperation. Though Mrs. Clinton said the administration would air its differences with Beijing, she said it would be in the context of a ''positive, cooperative, and comprehensive relationship'' -- a clause added to her speech at the last minute.   Mrs. Clinton also identified Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Tunisia, Vietnam and Uzbekistan as countries that constrain Internet freedom or persecute those who use the Web to circulate unpopular ideas. She pointed to an Egyptian blogger, Bassem Samir, who was in the audience at the Newseum in Washington for Mrs. Clinton's speech and had been imprisoned by Egyptian authorities.   Human rights groups applauded the speech, though some questioned how the United States would enforce the warnings.   Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, said the United States should treat China's forced censorship as an unfair trade practice, which could be confronted through the World Trade Organization or raised in future trade negotiations.    Still, Mr. Malinowski said: ''I really thought this was groundbreaking. She showed no hesitation in naming countries, including U.S. allies, for suppressing speech on the Internet. She made a very strong case for connecting Internet freedom to core American national security interests.''   As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton has elevated the role of the Internet and digital technology in American diplomacy. She named Alec Ross, a technology entrepreneur who advised the campaign of President Obama, as her senior adviser for innovation.    Mr. Ross has assembled a team that is pursuing programs like  a social network for young people in Pakistan and a service that lets people in Mexico file electronic reports on drug-related activity.   Mrs. Clinton announced a new $15 million effort to help more young people, women and citizens groups in other countries communicate on the Web. None of the proposals she mentioned focused on China or Iran, and the financing is relatively modest.    For Cameran Ashraf, 29, an Iranian-American information technology worker who has helped Iranian protesters circumvent government filtering of their messages, Mrs. Clinton's tone was enough. ''I didn't expect such strong, forceful language,'' he said. ''I was beyond pleased.''  "
China Issues Sharp Rebuke to U.S. Calls for an Investigation on Google Attacks,"China delivered a bristling response on Monday to the United States' demand that it investigate recent attacks on American computers from Chinese soil, saying that any suggestion that it conducted or condoned the hackers' intrusions was ''groundless and aims to denigrate China.''    The comment, in a published interview with a government spokesman, was part of a broadside in China's state-run news media on Monday that cast the United States as a cyberhegemonist, trying to dominate the global information flow by meddling in Chinese Internet policies.     Interviews and news articles placed in major state newspapers and on prominent Web sites underscored the chill in public exchanges between the governments since Jan. 12, when Google threatened to leave China unless Beijing stopped censoring its search results.    Google issued the ultimatum after discovering efforts by still-unidentified Chinese hackers to steal valuable corporate software code and break into the Google mailboxes of Chinese human-rights activists. Dozens of other American computers were also targets of the attack, Google has said.    China's reaction to the issue, at first muted,  has been caustic since Friday, a day after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called for Beijing to conduct a ''transparent'' inquiry into the attack. Mrs. Clinton also singled out China's Internet censorship as a threat to the free flow of information.    The Chinese government's comments come atop months of increasingly stringent limits on what average Chinese citizens can view on the Internet, and increasingly strict programs to monitor those who try to view unapproved content.    From blocking or closing down thousands of blogs and social-networking sites to accusing the United States of seeking information hegemony, the government has made it clear that the control of information has become even more of a central priority than in years past, according to David Bandurski, an analyst and author at the Hong Kong-based China Media Project, who spoke in a telephone interview on Monday.    ''The C.C.P. media worldview is that you have China versus a hostile West in this global war for public opinion,'' he said, referring to the China Communist Party. China's paradox, he said, is that while Beijing accuses the United States of ''information imperialism,'' its own policies seek to shut out dissenting voices -- including those of many of its own citizens -- and to make the Beijing government's view of the world China's dominant voice.    Monday's fusillade by the Chinese not only dismissed Mrs. Clinton's statements, but also depicted the United States as cyberspace's villain and China as its unwilling victim.    Zhou Yonglin, the deputy operations chief of China's National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team, was quoted as saying that China was the world's largest target for hackers, with more than 262,000 Internet addresses  under assault last year, and that the greatest share of attacks -- one in six -- originated in the United States.    Mr. Zhou also questioned Google's claim that attacks on its computers had been traced to Chinese soil, saying that other American companies had sought his agency's help after previous attacks, but that it ''has not been alerted to any specific report on the issue submitted by Google.''    ''We have been hoping that Google will contact us so that we could have details on this issue and provide them help if necessary,'' he said in the interview, which was conducted by the Chinese state news agency Xinhua.    Separately, an unidentified spokesman for the State Council Information Office defended as ''totally correct'' China's censorship of Internet sites that the government deems harmful. ''We are resolutely against those who make a issue of things without referring to actual facts by needlessly accusing China, ignoring Chinese laws and interfering in Chinese internal politics,'' the spokesman told Xinhua.    The State Council, the rough equivalent of the American government's cabinet, is among the most powerful Chinese governing bodies.    The sharpest language, however, came from the Communist Party-backed Global Times, which frequently criticizes American policy. The newspaper quoted a Chinese analyst as calling Google's complaint ''a U.S. government-initiated strategy with covert political intentions.''    ''As the global landscape is undergoing profound irreversible shifts, the calculated free-Internet scheme is just one step of a U.S. tactic to preserve its hegemonic domination,'' Yan Xuetong, who heads the Institute of International Studies at Beijing's Tsinghua University, said in the article.    A separate article noted that the United States Congress expanded the power of security agencies to monitor Americans' e-mail and Internet activities in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, and it accused Mrs. Clinton of preaching a double standard by criticizing China's limitations on Internet freedoms.  "
Survey of Executives Finds a Growing Fear of Cyberattacks,"A survey of 600 computing and computer-security executives in 14 countries suggests that attacks on the Internet pose a growing threat to the energy and communication systems that underlie modern society.    The findings, issued Thursday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the computer-security company McAfee, echoed alarms raised this month by Google after it experienced a wave of cyberattacks. ''One of the striking things we determined is that half of the respondents believe they have already been attacked by sophisticated government intruders,'' said the study's director, Stewart A. Baker. ''It tells us that this is a serious problem right now.''    More than half of the executives called their own nation's laws inadequate for deterring cyberattacks. Half identified the United States as one of the three most vulnerable countries; the others were China and Russia.   Moreover, the United States was identified most frequently as a potential source of cyberattacks.    ''When they were asked which country 'you worry is of greatest concern in the context of network attacks against your country/sector,' 36 percent named the United States and 33 percent China -- more than any other country on a list of six,'' the report said.   China's security measures also came in for praise from the executives.   ''It was striking how much of an outlier China is on a number of measures,'' said Mr. Baker, a Washington lawyer who formerly served as assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security and as general counsel for the National Security Agency. ''They have confidence in their government, and they are adopting security measures at a higher rate than other countries.''   The report focuses on ''critical infrastructure'' -- essential networks and services that include the financial system, transmission lines for gas and electricity, water supply, and voice- and data-communication networks. At the heart of these systems are networks known as Scada systems, which are the basis for manufacturing, power generation, refining and other basic operations in advanced economies. (The acronym stands for supervisory control and data acquisition.)   The increasing use of Internet-based networks ''creates unique and troubling vulnerabilities,'' the report says. In the past, the data used by such industrial systems was largely carried on proprietary networks that were often better insulated from the outside world.    The advantage of the Internet lies largely in the lower cost of developing systems because of the low cost of commodity products. But the report's authors stopped short of calling for a complete separation between those systems and the open Internet.   ''Remote access to control systems poses a huge danger,'' said Phyllis Schneck, McAfee's vice president for threat intelligence. ''We must either protect it appropriately or move it to more private networks and not use the open Internet.''   The report found considerable pessimism among the executives, whose responses were anonymous.    ''Remarkably, two-fifths of these I.T. executives expected a major cybersecurity incident (one causing an outage of 'at least 24 hours, loss of life or ... failure of a company') in their sector within the next year,'' the report said. ''All but 20 percent expected such an incident within five years. This pessimism was particularly marked in the countries already experiencing the highest levels of serious attacks.''  "
Google Closes Search Service Based In China,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Just over two months after threatening to leave China because of censorship and intrusions from hackers, Google on Monday closed its Internet search service there and began directing users in that country to its uncensored search engine in Hong Kong.   While the decision to route mainland Chinese users to Hong Kong is an attempt by Google to skirt censorship requirements without running afoul of Chinese laws, it appears to have angered officials in China, setting the stage for a possible escalation of the conflict, which may include blocking the Hong Kong search service in mainland China.   The state-controlled Xinhua news agency quoted an unnamed official with the State Council Information Office describing Google's move as ''totally wrong.''   ''Google has violated its written promise it made when entering the Chinese market by stopping filtering its searching service and blaming China in insinuation for alleged hacker attacks,'' the official said.    The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that the government will handle the Google case ''according to the law,'' Reuters reported.  The ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, said at a regular briefing in Beijing that Google's move was an isolated act by a commercial company, and that it should not affect China-U.S. ties ''unless politicized'' by others.   Google declined to comment on its talks with Chinese authorities, but said that it was under the impression that its move would be seen as a viable compromise.   ''We got reasonable indications that this was O.K.,'' Sergey Brin, a Google founder and its president of technology, said. ''We can't be completely confident.''   Google's retreat from China, for now, is only partial. In a blog post, Google said it would retain much of its existing operations in China, including its research and development team and its local sales force. While the China search engine, google.cn, has stopped working, Google will continue to operate online maps and music services in China.   Google's move represents a powerful rejection of Beijing's censorship but also a risky ploy in which Google, a global technology powerhouse, will essentially turn its back on the world's largest Internet market, with nearly 400 million Web users.   ''Figuring out how to make good on our promise to stop censoring search on google.cn has been hard,'' David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, wrote in the blog post. ''The Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a nonnegotiable legal requirement.''   Mr. Drummond said that Google's search engine based in Hong Kong would provide mainland users results in the simplified Chinese characters used on the mainland and that he believed it was ''entirely legal.''   ''We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision,'' Mr. Drummond said, ''though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services.'' Some Western analysts say Chinese regulators could retaliate against Google by blocking its Hong Kong or American search engines entirely, just as it blocks YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.   Google's decision to scale back operations in China ends a nearly four-year bet that Google's search engine in China, even if censored, would help bring more information to Chinese citizens and loosen the government's controls on the Web.   Instead, specialists say, Chinese authorities have tightened their grip on the Internet in recent years. In January, Google said it would no longer cooperate with government censors after hackers based in China stole some of the company's source code and even broke into the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights advocates.   ''It is certainly a historic moment,'' said Xiao Qiang of the China Internet project at the University of California, Berkeley. ''The Internet was seen as a catalyst for China being more integrated into the world. The fact that Google cannot exist in China clearly indicates that China's path as a rising power is going in a direction different from what the world expected and what many Chinese were hoping for.''   While other multinational companies are not expected to follow suit, some Western executives say Google's decision is a symbol of a worsening business climate in China for foreign corporations and perhaps an indication that the Chinese government is favoring home-grown companies. Despite its size and reputation for innovation, Google trails its main Chinese rival, Baidu.com, which was modeled on Google, with 33 percent market share to Baidu's 63 percent.   The decision to shut down google.cn will have a limited financial impact on Google, which is based in Mountain View, Calif. China accounted for a small fraction of Google's $23.6 billion in global revenue last year. Ads that once appeared on google.cn will now appear on Google's Hong Kong site. Still, abandoning a direct presence in the largest Internet search market in the world could have long-term repercussions and thwart Google's global ambitions, analysts say.   Government officials in Beijing have sharpened their attacks on Google in recent weeks. China experts say it may be some time before the confrontation is resolved.   ''This has become a war of ideas between the American company moralizing about Internet censorship and the Chinese government having its own views on the matter,'' said Emily Parker, a senior fellow at the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society.   In China, many students and professionals said they feared they were about to lose access to Google's vast resources.   In January, when Google first threatened to leave China, many young people placed wreaths at the company headquarters in Beijing as a sign of mourning.   The attacks were aimed at Google and more than 30 other American companies. While Google did not say the attacks were sponsored by the government, the company said it had enough information about the attacks to justify its threat to leave China.   People, inside and outside of Google, investigating the attacks have since traced them to two universities in China: Shanghai Jiao Tong University and  Lanxiang Vocational School.  The schools and the government have denied any involvement.   After serving Chinese users through its search engine based in the United States, Google decided to enter the Chinese market in 2006 with a local search engine under an arrangement with the government that required it to purge search results on banned topics. But since then, Google has struggled to comply with Chinese censorship rules and failed to gain significant market share from Baidu.com.   Google is not the first American Internet company to stumble in China. Nearly every major American brand has arrived with high hopes only to be stymied by government rules or fierce competition from Chinese rivals.   After struggling to compete, Yahoo sold its Chinese operations to Alibaba Group, a local company; eBay and Amazon never gained traction; and Microsoft's MSN instant messaging service badly trails that of Tencent.   Google's departure could present an opportunity for Baidu, whose stock has soared since the confrontation between Google and China began. It could also give a chance to Microsoft, a perennial underdog in Internet search, to make inroads in the Chinese market. Microsoft's search engine, Bing, has a very small share of the market.  "
STATE'S SECRETS DAY 7; Vast Hacking by a China Fearful of the Web,"As China ratcheted up the pressure on Google to censor its Internet searches last year, the American Embassy sent a secret cable to Washington detailing one reason top Chinese leaders had become so obsessed with the Internet search company: they were Googling themselves. The May 18, 2009, cable, titled ''Google China Paying Price for Resisting Censorship,'' quoted a well-placed source as saying that Li Changchun, a member of China's top ruling body, the Politburo Standing Committee, and the country's senior propaganda official, was taken aback to discover that he could conduct Chinese-language searches on Google's main international Web site. When Mr. Li typed his name into the search engine at google.com, he found ''results critical of him.'' That cable from American diplomats was one of many made public by WikiLeaks that portray China's leadership as nearly obsessed with the threat posed by the Internet to their grip on power -- and, the reverse, by the opportunities it offered them, through hacking, to obtain secrets stored in computers of its rivals, especially the United States.  Extensive hacking operations suspected of originating in China, including one leveled at Google, are a central theme in the cables. The operations began earlier and were aimed at a wider array of American government and military data than generally known, including on the computers of United States diplomats involved in climate change talks with China. One cable, dated early this year, quoted a Chinese person with family connections to the elite as saying that Mr. Li himself directed an attack on Google's servers in the United States, though that claim has been called into question. In an interview with The New York Times, the person cited in the cable said that Mr. Li personally oversaw a campaign against Google's operations in China but the person did not know who directed the hacking attack. The cables catalog the heavy pressure that was placed on Google to comply with local censorship laws, as well as Google's willingness to comply -- up to a point. That coercion began building years before the company finally decided to pull its search engine out of China last spring in the wake of the successful hacking attack on its home servers, which yielded Chinese dissidents' e-mail accounts as well as Google's proprietary source code. The demands on Google went well beyond removing material on subjects like the Dalai Lama or the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Chinese officials also put pressure on the United States government to censor the Google Earth satellite imaging service by lowering the resolution of images of Chinese government facilities, warning that Washington could be held responsible if terrorists used that information to attack government or military facilities, the cables show. An American diplomat replied that Google was a private company and that he would report the request to Washington but that he had no sense about how the government would act. Yet despite the hints of paranoia that appear in some cables, there are also clear signs that Chinese leaders do not consider the Internet an unstoppable force for openness and democracy, as some Americans believe. In fact, this spring, around the time of the Google pullout, China's State Council Information Office delivered a triumphant report to the leadership on its work to regulate traffic online, according to a crucial Chinese contact cited by the State Department in a cable in early 2010, when contacted directly by The Times. The message delivered by the office, the person said, was that ''in the past, a lot of officials worried that the Web could not be controlled.'' ''But through the Google incident and other increased controls and surveillance, like real-name registration, they reached a conclusion: the Web is fundamentally controllable,'' the person said. That confidence may also reflect what the cables show are repeated and often successful hacking attacks from China on the United States government, private enterprises and Western allies that began by 2002, several years before such intrusions were widely reported in the United States. At least one previously unreported attack in 2008, code-named Byzantine Candor by American investigators, yielded more than 50 megabytes of e-mails and a complete list of user names and passwords from an American government agency, a Nov. 3, 2008, cable revealed for the first time. Precisely how these hacking attacks are coordinated is not clear. Many appear to rely on Chinese freelancers and an irregular army of ''patriotic hackers'' who operate with the support of civilian or military authorities, but not directly under their day-to-day control, the cables and interviews suggest. But the cables also appear to contain some suppositions by Chinese and Americans passed along by diplomats. For example, the cable dated earlier this year referring to the hacking attack on Google said: ''A well-placed contact claims that the Chinese government coordinated the recent intrusions of Google systems. According to our contact, the closely held operations were directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.'' The cable goes on to quote this person as saying that the hacking of Google ''had been coordinated out of the State Council Information Office with the oversight'' of Mr. Li and another Politburo member, Zhou Yongkang.'' Mr. Zhou is China's top security official. But the person cited in the cable gave a divergent account. He detailed a campaign to press Google coordinated by the Propaganda Department's director, Liu Yunshan. Mr. Li and Mr. Zhou issued approvals in several instances, he said, but he had no direct knowledge linking them to the hacking attack aimed at securing commercial secrets or dissidents' e-mail accounts -- considered the purview of security officials. Still, the cables provide a patchwork of detail about cyberattacks that American officials believe originated in China with either the assistance or knowledge of the Chinese military. For example, in 2008 Chinese intruders based in Shanghai and linked to the People's Liberation Army used a computer document labeled ''salary increase -- survey and forecast'' as bait as part of the sophisticated intrusion scheme that yielded more than 50 megabytes of e-mails and a complete list of user names and passwords from a United States government agency that was not identified. The cables indicate that the American government has been fighting a pitched battle with intruders who have been clearly identified as using Chinese-language keyboards and physically located in China. In most cases the intruders took great pains to conceal their identities, but occasionally they let their guard down. In one case described in the documents, investigators tracked one of the intruders who was surfing the Web in Taiwan ''for personal use.'' In June 2009 during climate change talks between the United States and China, the secretary of state's office sent a secret cable warning about e-mail ''spear phishing'' attacks directed at five State Department employees in the Division of Ocean Affairs of the Office of the Special Envoy for Climate Change. The messages, which purport to come from a National Journal columnist, had the subject line ''China and Climate Change.'' The e-mail contained a PDF file that was intended to install a malicious software program known as Poison Ivy, which was meant to give an intruder complete control of the victim's computer. That attack failed. The cables also reveal that a surveillance system dubbed Ghostnet that stole information from the computers used by the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and South Asian governments and was uncovered in 2009 was linked to a second broad series of break-ins into American government computers code-named Byzantine Hades. Government investigators were able to make a ''tenuous connection'' between those break-ins and the People's Liberation Army. The documents also reveal that in 2008 German intelligence briefed American officials on similar attacks beginning in 2006 against the German government, including military, economic, science and technology, commercial, diplomatic, and research and development targets. The Germans described the attacks as preceding events like the German government's meetings with the Chinese government. Even as such attacks were occurring, Google made a corporate decision in 2006, controversial even within the company, to establish a domestic Chinese version of its search engine, called google.cn. In doing so, it agreed to comply with China's censorship laws. But despite that concession, Chinese officials were never comfortable with Google, the cables and interviews show. The Chinese claimed that Google Earth, the company's satellite mapping software, offered detailed ''images of China's military, nuclear, space, energy and other sensitive government agency installations'' that would be an asset to terrorists. A cable sent on Nov. 7, 2006, reported that Liu Jieyi, an assistant minister of foreign affairs, warned the American Embassy in Beijing that there would be ''grave consequences'' if terrorists exploited the imagery. A year later, another cable pointed out that Google searches for politically delicate terms would sometimes be automatically redirected to Baidu, the Chinese company that was Google's main competitor in China. Baidu is known for scrubbing its own search engine of results that might be unwelcome to government censors. Google conducted numerous negotiations with officials in the State Council Information Office and other departments involved in censorship, propaganda and media licensing, the cables show. The May 18, 2009, cable that revealed pressure on the company by Mr. Li, the propaganda chief, said Google had taken some measures ''to try and placate the government.'' The cable also noted that Google had asked the American government to intervene with China on its behalf. But Chinese officials became alarmed that Google still did less than its Chinese rivals to remove material Chinese officials considered offensive. Such material included information about Chinese dissidents and human rights issues, but also about central and provincial Chinese leaders and their children -- considered an especially taboo topic, interviews with people quoted in the cables reveal. Mr. Li, after apparently searching for information online on himself and his children, was reported to have stepped up pressure on Google. He also took steps to punish Google commercially, according to the May 18 cable. The propaganda chief ordered three big state-owned Chinese telecommunications companies to stop doing business with Google. Mr. Li also demanded that Google executives remove any link between its sanitized Chinese Web site and its main international one, which he deemed ''an illegal site,'' the cable said. Google ultimately stopped complying with repeated censorship requests. It stopped offering a censored version of its search engine in China earlier this year, citing both the hacking attacks and its unwillingness to continue obeying censorship orders.

State Dept. Daily Is Window on a Jittery Planet,"WASHINGTON -- In Tunisia, a man was spotted sitting in a cafe, watching the road to the American ambassador's residence, before driving away in a gray Volkswagen. In Nigeria, extremists, possibly including a ''well-trained'' operative just arrived from Chad, were believed to be ''planning a massive terrorist attack.'' And Persian-language computer hacking sites had posted dangerous ''Trojan horse'' programs, suggesting how Iranian agents might attack the United States.  Those were just three of dozens of threats reported in a single issue of a publication with a limited subscriber list: The Diplomatic Security Daily, a classified roundup of potential horrors facing American diplomats or citizens anywhere in the world. A look at one issue, from June 29, 2009, gives a feeling for the nerve-racking atmosphere in which State Department officers routinely operate. The Diplomatic Security Daily is classified ''secret/noforn,'' a label that prohibits sharing it even with foreign allies, and it goes to American embassies and other outposts to alert them of possible threats. Some 14 issues of The Daily were included in a quarter-million diplomatic cables obtained by The New York Times. The June 29, 2009, issue is a window on the government's round-the-clock struggle to assess rumors, often vague, about terrorists, assassins, kidnappers, hackers and others who might single out Americans. Few of the threats materialize, but the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security sorts and shares the steady flow of reports. One case involves intelligence reports that ''militants attached to Pakistan's Mumtaz Group'' were scheming to kidnap Americans and Britons in Pakistan, conceivably in Peshawar's University Town neighborhood. But was the danger real? The Mumtaz Group, the report says, may be linked to a dead operative of Al Qaeda who used that nom de guerre. (In fact, The Daily reports in a rare touch of black humor, the alias Mumtaz is ''arguably inauspicious,'' since at least three Qaeda members who used it are now dead.) The threatened kidnappings might be linked to another militant known as Imran, an Uzbek connected to a fatal attack on an American contractor in 2008. Someone named Imran had reportedly just been captured by Pakistani intelligence -- but American intelligence could not be certain it was the same man, The Daily said in its frustratingly inconclusive report. One striking aspect of the security warnings sent to embassies is how many involve cyber threats. The June 29, 2009, issue, in addition to mentioning the Persian hacker sites, discussed at length Chinese companies and government agencies specializing in computer security, implying that they might pose a hazard. Such companies had ''recruited Chinese hackers,'' including Lin Yong, known as Lion, to support research projects on attacking computer networks, The Daily reported. There is a strong possibility that China ''is harvesting the talents of its private sector in order to bolster offensive and defensive'' cyberoperations, the report said.  "
Morrison Says Story Of Fatherhood Is Hoax,"An announcement this week that Van Morrison, 64, had become a father again was a hoax posted by hackers on his Web site, according to a statement issued on Thursday in Mr. Morrison's name and reported by Agence France-Presse. The initial announcement on his Web site (vanmorrison.com) said that he was the proud father of a new son, George Ivan Morrison III. It added that the baby was ''the spitting image of his daddy'' and a dual citizen of Britain and the United States.   On Thursday a statement issued on Mr. Morrison's behalf by the public relations company Fleishman-Hillard International said that the reports were ''completely and utterly without foundation,'' and that he had asked his management ''to carry out an immediate investigation into a hacking attack which took place on my Web site on Dec. 29th last.'' The first announcement said the child was born to Mr. Morrison and Gigi Lee, who was identified as his wife and manager. But an executive at Fleishman-Hillard, John Saunders, said in an interview with the Irish state radio network that Mr. Morrison had told him that the story was ''completely false,'' and that he had not heard of Gigi Lee. Mr. Morrison's statement added, ''For the avoidance of all doubt and in the interests of clarity, I am very happily married to Michelle Morrison, with whom I have two wonderful children.''  "
Putting a Private Detective in Your Laptop,"CORRECTION APPENDED Baruch Sienna figured his teenage son's laptop was gone forever. During a party in Israel, a thief had taken his MacBook, and there were no witnesses.   ''The police were very unhelpful,'' Mr. Sienna said, speaking from Jerusalem. ''They said, 'You'll never see your laptop again.' '' But the son was fortunate that his father had installed Undercover, an antitheft program, on his computer. He remotely activated the software, which grabbed screen shots of the thief's online activities, while the Mac's built-in camera shot pictures of him. After eight months of activity on the Mac, the software had given police enough information to identify the thief and put the MacBook back in Mr. Sienna's hands.    For the very reason you like to carry laptops, iPads, e-book readers and smartphones -- they are lightweight and portable -- they are easy to steal or misplace. The 2009 Computer Security Institute Computer Crime and Security Survey found that 42 percent of respondents had lost a laptop or other portable device to a thief in the last year. According to a study by the Ponemon Institute, 12,000 laptops are lost each week in American airports. Most people assume they are gone for good; only a third of those turned in to the airports' lost-and-found departments are reclaimed.   You can keep an eye on your devices and not leave them visible and unattended, but they might best be protected with some software. A number of good programs are available for laptops, phones and tablets. Many will try to locate the computer when it is connected to the Internet. Others log keystrokes, take snapshots of Web pages visited, monitor e-mail being written and even take a picture of the user with the device's built-in Webcam.   In addition, some software can lock down the computer and display on-screen messages letting the user (who may not be the thief) know the device has been stolen and where to return it.   All antitheft manufacturers claim recovery rates in the 90 percent range. None of the companies contacted could document this, and some recoveries may be incidental to the presence of the antitheft software.   Adeona   Created by faculty and students at the University of Washington, Adeona reports the Internet address that the laptop is using, takes photos of the user (in the Mac version only) and provides information on the user's current wireless access point.   Adeona is open-source software, so others can add their own features. While the software is available free for Linux, Mac and Windows, the university does not recommend its use until further testing is completed.   GadgetTrak   Available for Mac and Windows PCs, with versions for BlackBerrys, iPhones and Windows Mobile phones, all priced at $24.95 a year with multiyear discounts available, GadgetTrak takes a photo of the user with the computer's Webcam, either every 30 minutes or whenever the computer is awakened from sleep. Pictures, along with location data gleaned from Skyhook, which triangulates cellphone tower locations and GPS data, are sent to the user's Flickr account (and for security, not to GadgetTrak itself); the user can create a map of the laptop's location.   While ActiveTrak, the maker, says the tracking is accurate down to 10 meters, in one of my tests the computer was hundreds of yards away on an adjacent street. (In another, it determined my exact address.)   Laptop Cop   ''We record everything,'' said Tom Bilyeu, the chief marketing officer of Awareness Technologies, the maker of Laptop Cop. That includes every keystroke, user name and password, and all Web sites.   Laptop Cop ($49.95 a year or $99.95 for three years; Windows only, with mobile versions scheduled in four months) also gives its customers the ability to selectively lock out, delete and retrieve data. As a result, even if the laptop is not recoverable, one's data often is.   As with other programs, users can also send commands to make messages appear on the screen, such as, ''Give me my laptop back, you crook, or you're going to jail.'' (That is probably the last step you want to take. A warning will most likely encourage the thief to stay off the Internet to avoid being found.)   LoJack for Laptops   One of the best-selling antitheft packages, with 1.2 million users in 51 countries, LoJack for Laptops ($39.99 to $59.99; Macs and PCs, plus corporate smartphones) monitors a device's activities once a laptop is reported stolen. When Absolute Software, the company that licenses the LoJack name from the maker of auto-theft tracking devices, gathers enough information to identify the thief, it notifies the local police.   Unlike its competitors, Absolute Software does not release any specific information to the device's owner, who pays a minimum of $40 a year for its services. Rather, one of its 40 former police officers on staff report their findings to local authorities.   That was fine for James Butler, a New Jersey limo driver whose laptop was stolen from his car while he was picking up customers in Manhattan. (A month after the theft, Mr. Butler's laptop was returned. It had been sold on the Internet to an innocent person in Boston.)   ''It makes sense to have the company deal with it,'' Mr. Butler said. ''You don't know what you're walking into; someone could have other stolen merchandise as well.''   Undercover   Available for Macs and iPhones, Undercover takes pictures of a laptop's user every time the device is turned on. Once the machine is connected to the Internet, it uploads those photos, as well as screen shots of a user's activity, every six minutes. The laptop's location is also noted using Skyhook technology, and all the information is sent to the laptop's rightful owner, who can pass the information on to the local police.   Undercover captures e-mail and Web sites visited, allowing the machine to be tracked. Customers have retrieved their laptops after watching thieves send e-mail, log on to their own Facebook pages and even edit their resumes, said Peter Schols, owner of the parent company, Orbicule. Orbicule charges a one-time $49 fee for one device and $59 for a five-PC site license.   When looking for antitheft applications for smartphones, do not expect the same capabilities as found in their much more expensive laptop cousins. Police are not likely to make the retrieval of a smartphone a priority.   Orbicule's iPad and iPhone software ($4.99) tracks the device's location. GadgetTrak's BlackBerry and Windows Mobile apps ($24.95) remotely lock and delete personal data, as well as track the phone's location. Its iPhone version (free, because of its limited abilities) tricks a user into opening a fake browser, which relays the phone's location to its rightful owner.   There is one effective step anyone can take to secure a portable device's content: password-protect your machine. But if you use the antitheft software, set up a nonpassword-protected guest account. You will safeguard your data while also making it easy for thieves to keep using your computer and unwittingly be tracked.  "
Hackers Give Web Companies a Test of Free Speech,"A hacking free-for-all has exploded on the Web, and Facebook and Twitter are stuck in the middle. On Wednesday, anonymous hackers took aim at companies perceived to have harmed WikiLeaks after its release of a flood of confidential diplomatic documents. MasterCard, Visa and PayPal, which had cut off people's ability to donate money to WikiLeaks, were hit by attacks that tried to block access to the companies' Web sites and services. To organize their efforts, the hackers have turned to sites like Facebook and Twitter. That has drawn these Web giants into the fray and created a precarious situation for them.  Both Facebook and Twitter -- but particularly Twitter -- have received praise in recent years as outlets for free speech. Governments trying to control the flow of information have found it difficult to block people from voicing their concerns or setting up meetings through the sites. At the same time, both Facebook and Twitter have corporate aspirations that hinge on their ability to serve as ad platforms for other companies. This leaves them with tough public relations and business decisions around how they should handle situations as politically charged as the WikiLeaks developments. Some internet experts say the situation highlights the complexities of free speech issues on the Internet, as grassroots Web companies evolve and take central control over what their users can make public. Clay Shirky, who studies the Internet and teaches at New York University, said that although the Web is the new public sphere, it is actually ''a corporate sphere that tolerates public speech.'' Marcia Hofmann, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said, ''Any Internet user who cares about free speech or has a controversial or unpopular message should be concerned about the fact that intermediaries might not let them express it.'' She added, ''Your free speech rights are only as strong as the weakest intermediary.'' The problem came into relief on Wednesday, through an effort called Operation Payback, organized by a group calling itself Anonymous. The group spent much of the day posting notes on Facebook and Twitter that told followers which companies to single out and that documented hacking successes. But Facebook banned one of the group's pages, saying that using the site to organize hacking attacks like that violated its terms of use. The group went on Twitter to complain. A Facebook spokesman issued a statement saying that the company was ''sensitive to content that includes pornography, bullying, hate speech, and threats of violence'' and would ''take action on content that we find or that's reported to us that promotes unlawful activity.'' In an interview Wednesday morning, Joe Sullivan, Facebook's chief security officer, addressed WikiLeaks's own presence on the site. He said the company had not received any official requests to disable pages or accounts associated with the WikiLeaks organization. Facebook generally resists requests by governments or advocacy groups to take down material if that content is not illegal or does not violate Facebook's terms of service, which prohibit attacks on individuals or incitements to violence. ''Facebook is a place where people come to talk about all sorts of things, including controversial topics,'' Mr. Sullivan said. It was not clear whether anyone had asked Facebook to take down the Operation Payback page. Twitter allowed the Operation Payback account to stay active most of Wednesday. But the group's account was disabled late in the day, after it posted a link to a file that provided thousands of consumer credit card numbers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. A Twitter spokesman declined to discuss the details of the situation. ''We don't comment about the specific actions we take around user accounts,'' he said. The company is not overly concerned about hackers' attacking Twitter's site, he said, explaining that it faces security issues all the time and has technology to deal with the situation. Twitter is in a particularly delicate situation because its founders have celebrated their service's role in political protest and free speech. They have not been shy about trying to capitalize on the good will engendered by playing that role. WikiLeaks's own Twitter account remains active, and it is the group's main channel for reaching supporters and the media. Last week, Amazon.com fell into a similar position when it decided to stop storing files for WikiLeaks. Advocates of WikiLeaks complained that Amazon.com was bowing to political pressure to cut the organization from its Web services. An Amazon.com spokesman said the company was simply banning an organization that had violated its terms of service by trying to distribute documents it did not own. The last week has given rise to a hacking war in which groups have blocked access to WikiLeaks's Web sites by bombarding them with requests. And now the WikiLeaks supporters have responded in kind, flying the freedom of speech banner as the motivation for their actions.  "
Cyberspying Fears Help Fuel China's Drive to Curb Internet,"Deep inside a Chinese military engineering institute in September 2008, a researcher took a break from his duties and decided -- against official policy -- to check his private e-mail messages. Among the new arrivals was an electronic holiday greeting card that purported to be from a state defense office.   The researcher clicked on the card to open it. Within minutes, secretly implanted computer code enabled an unnamed foreign intelligence agency to tap into the databases of the institute in the city of Luoyang in central China and spirit away top-secret information on Chinese submarines.   So reported Global Times, a Communist Party-backed newspaper with a nationalist bent, in a little-noticed December article. The paper described the episode as ''a major security breach'' and quoted one government official who complained that such attacks were ''ubiquitous'' in China.    The information could not be independently confirmed, and such leaks in the Chinese news media often serve the propaganda or lobbying goals of government officials.   Nonetheless, the story is one sign that while much of the rest of the world frets about Chinese cyberspying abroad, China is increasingly alarmed about the threat that the Internet poses to its security and political stability.   In the view of both political analysts and technology experts here and in the United States, China's attempts to tighten its grip on Internet use are driven in part by the conviction that the West -- and particularly the United States -- is wielding communications innovations from malware to Twitter to weaken it militarily and to stir dissent internally.   ''The United States has already done it, many times,'' said Song Xiaojun, one of the authors of ''Unhappy China,'' a 2009 book advocating a muscular Chinese foreign policy, which the party's propaganda department is said to promote. He cited the so-called color revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia as examples. ''It is not really regime change, directly,'' he said. ''It is more like they use the Internet to sow chaos.''   State media have vented those concerns more vociferously since Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton last month criticized China for censorship and called for an investigation of Google's assertion that its databases had been the target of a sophisticated attack from China. ''China wants to make clear that it too is under serious attack from spies on the Internet,'' said Cheng Gang, author of the Global Times article.   Despite China's robust technological abilities, its cyberdefenses are almost certainly more porous than those of the United States, American experts say. To cite one glaring example, even Chinese government computers are frequently equipped with pirated software from Microsoft, they say. That means many users miss out on security upgrades, available to paying users, that fix security breaches exploited by hackers.   Cybersecurity is a growing concern for most governments. While the United States probably has tighter defenses than China, for example, experts say it relies more heavily on computers to run its infrastructure and so is more vulnerable to an attack.   But for China, worries about how foreign forces might employ the Internet and other communications advances to unseat the Communist Party are a salient factor in the government's 15-year effort to control those technologies. Chinese leaders are constantly trying to balance the economic and social benefits of online freedoms and open communications against the desire to preserve social stability and prevent organized political opposition.   A distinct shift in favor of more comprehensive controls began nearly two years ago and hardened over the past six months, analysts say.    New policies are intended to replace foreign hardware and software with homegrown systems that can be more easily controlled and protected. Officials are also expanding the reach and resources of state-controlled media outlets so they dominate Chinese cyberspace with their blogs, videos and news. At the same time, the government is beefing up its security apparatus. Officials have justified stronger measures by citing various internal threats that they say escalated online. Among them: the March 2008 riots in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa; reported attempts to disrupt the August 2008 Olympic Games and the amassing of more than 10,000 signatures supporting a petition for human rights and democratic freedoms, an example of how democracy advocates could organize online.   Especially alarming to officials, analysts say, was the role of the Internet in ethnic riots last July that left nearly 200 people dead and more than 1,700 injured -- the worst ethnic violence in recent Chinese history. Government reports asserted that terrorists, separatists and religious extremists from within and outside the country used the Internet to recruit Uighur youth to travel to Urumqi, the capital of western China's Xinjiang region, to attack ethnic Han citizens.   In August, security and propaganda officials briefed China's ruling Politburo on their view of how the Xinjiang riots developed, according to one media executive with high-level government ties. The executive spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution for discussing delicate political topics.    China's leaders also reviewed how Iranian antigovernment activists used Twitter and other new communication tools to organize large street demonstrations against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over the summer. He said Chinese leaders saw the Iranian protests as an example of how the United States could use the new forms of online communication in a fashion that could one day be turned against China.    ''How did the unrest after the Iranian elections come about?'' People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, asked in a Jan. 24 editorial. ''It was because online warfare launched by America, via YouTube video and Twitter micro-blogging, spread rumors, created splits, stirred up and sowed discord.''   Since the unrest in Iran and Xinjiang, Chinese leaders accelerated a raft of new initiatives, including closing thousands of Web sites, tightening censorship of text messages for lewd or ''unhealthy'' content and planning to converge China's Internet, phone and state television networks. They are also carefully cultivating homegrown alternatives to foreign computer technologies and foreign-based Web sites like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, all of which Chinese censors now block. The government says it needs the new controls to fight pornography, piracy and other illegal activity.   In November, nearly 300 government officials and technicians gathered in Beijing for a seminar that stressed China's vulnerability in cyberspace.   ''It is a long-existing reality that the West is stronger than us in terms of information security,'' said the seminar training manual, posted on the Web site of the Ministry of Public Security.     ''Most of the key technology and products in the information security sphere are held in the hands of Western countries, which leaves China's important information systems exposed to a bigger chance of being attacked and controlled by hostile forces,'' the manual said.   The risks of dependence on foreign-made software became clear in 2008 after Microsoft deployed a new antipiracy program aimed at detecting and discouraging unauthorized users of its Windows operating system. In China, where an estimated four-fifths of computer software is pirated, the program caused millions of computer screens to go dark every hour and led to a public outcry.    New government procurement rules require state buyers to give preference to Chinese-made computers and communication products, among other supplies and services. But James Mulvenon, director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis, a Washington-based consulting firm, said such orders were typically ignored.   James A. Lewis, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based research group, said China was caught between contradictory goals. The authorities want to keep using superior Western software so they can engage in espionage and defend themselves against foreign infiltration. ''But at the same time they want to use indigenous software, which is not up to par,'' he said.   But China is pushing hard to catch up. Mr. Mulvenon describes China as ''absolutely the world leader'' in development of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) -- the successor to the current Internet.    Some suggest China aims to develop a more autonomous system equipped with stronger firewalls and filters. China's leaders ''have always had the ambition to develop the capability of one big domestic Intranet that they could manage more easily, if need be,'' one Communist Party newspaper editor said. But others suggest China is merely trying, like other nations, to respond to the reality that the existing IPv4 global Internet, in which the United States commands a disproportionate share of addresses, will soon run out of space.   The clearest evidence of China's determination to wield greater control was the virtual communications blackout imposed over Xinjiang for six months after the July riots. Nineteen million residents in a region more than twice as big as Texas were deprived of text-messaging service, international phone calls and Internet access to all but a few government-controlled Web sites. The damage to tourism and business, not to mention the disruption to everyday life, was significant.   Hu Yong, a Beijing-based media expert, said the government was no longer as worried as it once was about the economic impact of electronic communication controls.   ''Now that is more secondary to their concerns about political and social stability,'' he said.  "
Report Suggests Problems With Iran's Nuclear Effort,"Atomic inspectors reported Tuesday that Iran mysteriously stopped feeding uranium into thousands of centrifuges at its main enrichment plant this month, and independent experts suggested that the computer worm suspected of being aimed at Iran's nuclear program had caused the spinning machines to break down. Iran vehemently denied that assertion, and the experts said they had no proof that the unexplained shutdown resulted from the so-called Stuxnet worm -- a malicious program detected this year on computers, primarily in Iran but also in India, Indonesia and other countries.  Cyberattackers ''tried to infiltrate our country's nuclear sites'' beginning a year ago, Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the country's atomic program, told an Iranian news agency on Tuesday. But he added that ''the country's young experts stopped the virus exactly at those points that enemies intended to infiltrate.'' Recently, Western experts dissecting the computer worm reported that it was precisely fabricated in a way that could send nuclear centrifuges wildly out of control. The report on Tuesday from the International Atomic Energy Agency said that its inspectors, when visiting the sprawling main enrichment plant at Natanz, in the Iranian desert, on Nov. 16, found that engineers had stopped feeding uranium into the long rows of centrifuges. Six days later, Iran said it had restarted the process. The report alluded to another sign of possible trouble with the machines. The agency's inspectors said Iran had assigned 4,816 centrifuges to the process of enrichment at its main plant -- 1,044 more than they identified nearly three months ago and close to last year's high of 4,920 machines. But the figures they provided showed that production efficiency had decreased. Despite more than 1,000 additional machines, Iran was able to add only 837 pounds of enriched uranium to the overall supply produced at the main plant. That represents an increase of 14 percent. In the previous reporting period, the inspectors described an increase of 829 pounds, or a rise of 15 percent. In other words, the plant's output had remained roughly the same despite Iran's putting many more resources into the job. ''The efficiency is down,'' said a European nuclear expert familiar with the report of the atomic inspectors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity. David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a private group in Washington that tracks nuclear proliferation, said in an interview that the new disclosures made incapacitation from the Stuxnet worm ''sound more credible.'' American officials have not claimed responsibility for the worm, but they do say the Obama administration has stepped up a broad covert program, inherited from the Bush administration, to undermine Iran's nuclear program. Starting in 2006, the United Nations Security Council has repeatedly called on Iran to halt its rush for uranium enrichment and has punished the nation with four rounds of sanctions for its refusal. Iran insists that its nuclear work is peaceful, while the West fears it has built enrichment factories and is enriching uranium to make fuel for atomic bombs. The report also said that Tehran, extending a rebuff that began more than two years ago, had once again refused to answer questions about possible military work by its nuclear program. The inspectors said the agency had provided Iran in late October with a list of outstanding questions about documents and other material that appeared to be studies involving nuclear weapons, which Iran has repeatedly dismissed as forgeries. The questions centered on safety arrangements, project management related to nuclear explosives, ''details of the manufacture of components for high explosives initiation systems'' and experiments involving subatomic particles that can act as nuclear triggers. The questions to Iranian officials, according to the report, stressed resolving ''all of the issues which have given rise to concerns about the possible military dimensions.'' The report added that the atomic agency ''remains concerned about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed nuclear related activities,'' including ''development of a nuclear payload for a missile.''

F.C.C. Chairman and Facebook,"Facebook scam artists have closed out 2009 by snagging a prominent victim: Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.   On Thursday around 10:30 a.m., Mr. Genachowski sent his Facebook friends this puzzling message: ''Adam got me started making money with this.'' It was followed by a link to a Web page that is no longer active. The message blitz indicated that Mr. Genachowski's account had been taken over by a malicious program that was using it to send out spam.    By Thursday afternoon, Mr. Genachowski's Facebook profile was no longer visible on the site. A Facebook spokesman, Larry Yu, said the company learned of the problem on Thursday morning and suspended the account, as it routinely does in such cases. An F.C.C. spokeswoman declined to comment.   The chairman is by no means alone in getting inadvertently embroiled in social networking scams that can be embarrassing. I wrote about such scams in December, noting that the humiliation sown by these attacks is usually just a byproduct of spammer efforts to get people to click on various links.   It's not clear how Mr. Genachowski's Facebook account was compromised; perhaps he or a family member clicked on a malicious link, allowing his account to be taken over.    Facebook later issued a statement, which indicated that if Mr. Genachowski, above, wanted to continue to use Facebook, he would have to get some education about the safe use of this particular form of communication. ''To combat these threats, however, we need users' help, too,'' the statement read. ''You can protect yourself by never clicking on strange links, even if they've been sent by friends, and by being wary of sites that ask you to download or upgrade software.''   BRAD STONE   COMMENTDear Facebook: When the chairman of the F.C.C. gets his account compromised, it is probably not wise to school the man on how to use the Internet. Just a thought. -- Seth, New York City, Dec. 31  "
Britain Warned Businesses Of Threat of Chinese Spying,"British business executives dealing with China were given a formal warning more than a year ago by Britain's security service, MI5, that Chinese intelligence agencies were engaged in a wide-ranging effort to hack into British companies' computers and to blackmail British businesspeople over sexual relationships and other improprieties, according to people familiar with the MI5 document.   The warning, in a 14-page document titled ''The Threat from Chinese Espionage,'' was prepared in 2008 by MI5's Center for the Protection of National Infrastructure, and distributed in what security officials described as a ''restricted'' form to hundreds of British banks and other financial institutions and businesses. The document followed public warnings from senior MI5 officials that China posed ''one of the most significant espionage threats'' to Britain.    Details of the document were confirmed Sunday by two people familiar with its contents, who both spoke on an anonymous basis because of the sensitivity of the subject. The document's existence was first reported in the British newspaper The Sunday Times.   Last month, Google announced that it was considering ending its operations in China after a ''sophisticated and targeted'' cyberattack that it said aimed primarily to gain access to the e-mail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Google said it was no longer willing to cooperate with China in what amounted to censorship of its search engine, which Google had operated in a way that prevented millions of Chinese from reaching Web sites deemed hostile by Beijing.   Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has called on China to investigate the cyberattacks, and said that companies like Google should refuse to support ''politically motivated censorship.'' Without acknowledging any government involvement in the attacks, China has responded by saying that Internet companies like Google are welcome to do business in China ''according to the law.'' A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that ''Chinese law proscribes any form of hacking activity.''   But a starkly different picture emerges from the document circulated by MI5, Britain's domestic security service. The Sunday Times account, quoting from the document, said that officers from the People's Liberation Army and the Ministry of Public Security had approached British businesspeople at trade fairs and exhibitions with offers of ''gifts'' that included cameras and computer memory sticks that were found to contain bugs that provided the Chinese with remote access to the recipients' computers.   ''There have been cases where these 'gifts' have contained Trojan devices and other types of malware,'' the document said, according to The Sunday Times. The accuracy of the paper's citations from the document was verified by the two people contacted by The New York Times who said they had seen the document.   The MI5 report described how China's computer hacking campaign had attacked British defense, energy, communications and manufacturing companies, as well as public relations companies and international law firms. The document explicitly warned British executives dealing with China against so-called honey trap methods in which it said the Chinese tried to cultivate personal relationships, ''often using lavish hospitality and flattery,'' either within China or abroad.    ''Chinese intelligence services have also been known to exploit vulnerabilities such as sexual relationships and illegal activities to pressurize individuals to cooperate with them,'' it warned. ''Hotel rooms in major Chinese cities such as Beijing and Shanghai which have been frequented by foreigners are likely to be bugged. Hotel rooms have been searched while the occupants are out of the room.''   Britain's powerful Joint Intelligence Committee, responsible for analyzing and coordinating policy between MI5 and MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service that is responsible for Britain's foreign intelligence activities, warned last year that China's growing sophistication in cyberespionage could enable it to shut down critical services, including power, food and water supplies.  "
Worm in Iran Was Perfect for Sabotaging Nuclear Centrifuges,"Experts dissecting the computer worm suspected of being aimed at Iran's nuclear program have determined that it was precisely calibrated in a way that could send nuclear centrifuges wildly out of control. Their conclusion, while not definitive, begins to clear some of the fog around the Stuxnet worm, a malicious program detected earlier this year on computers, primarily in Iran but also India, Indonesia and other countries. The paternity of the worm is still in dispute, but in recent weeks officials from Israel have broken into wide smiles when asked whether Israel was behind the attack, or knew who was. American officials have suggested it originated abroad.  The new forensic work narrows the range of targets and deciphers the worm's plan of attack. Computer analysts say Stuxnet does its damage by making quick changes in the rotational speed of motors, shifting them rapidly up and down. Changing the speed ''sabotages the normal operation of the industrial control process,'' Eric Chien, a researcher at the computer security company Symantec, wrote in a blog post. Those fluctuations, nuclear analysts said in response to the report, are a recipe for disaster among the thousands of centrifuges spinning in Iran to enrich uranium, which can fuel reactors or bombs. Rapid changes can cause them to blow apart. Reports issued by international inspectors reveal that Iran has experienced many problems keeping its centrifuges running, with hundreds removed from active service since summer 2009. ''We don't see direct confirmation'' that the attack was meant to slow Iran's nuclear work, David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a private group in Washington that tracks nuclear proliferation, said in an interview Thursday. ''But it sure is a plausible interpretation of the available facts.'' Intelligence officials have said they believe that a series of covert programs are responsible for at least some of that decline. So when Iran reported earlier this year that it was battling the Stuxnet worm, many experts immediately suspected that it was a state-sponsored cyberattack. Until last week, analysts had said only that Stuxnet was designed to infect certain kinds of Siemens equipment used in a wide variety of industrial sites around the world. But a study released Friday by Mr. Chien, Nicolas Falliere and Liam O. Murchu at Symantec, concluded that the program's real target was to take over frequency converters, a type of power supply that changes its output frequency to control the speed of a motor. The worm's code was found to attack converters made by two companies, Fararo Paya in Iran and Vacon in Finland. A separate study conducted by the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that finding, a senior government official said in an interview on Thursday. Then, on Wednesday, Mr. Albright and a colleague, Andrea Stricker, released a report saying that when the worm ramped up the frequency of the electrical current supplying the centrifuges, they would spin faster and faster. The worm eventually makes the current hit 1,410 Hertz, or cycles per second -- just enough, they reported, to send the centrifuges flying apart. In a spooky flourish, Mr. Albright said in the interview, the worm ends the attack with a command to restore the current to the perfect operating frequency for the centrifuges -- which, by that time, would presumably be destroyed. ''It's striking how close it is to the standard value,'' he said. The computer analysis, his Wednesday report concluded, ''makes a legitimate case that Stuxnet could indeed disrupt or destroy'' Iranian centrifuge plants. The latest evidence does not prove Iran was the target, and there have been no confirmed reports of industrial damage linked to Stuxnet. Converters are used to control a number of different machines, including lathes, saws and turbines, and they can be found in gas pipelines and chemical plants. But converters are also essential for nuclear centrifuges. On Wednesday, the chief of the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity center in Virginia, Sean McGurk, told a Senate committee that the worm was a ''game changer'' because of the skill with which it was composed and the care with which it was geared toward attacking specific types of equipment. Meanwhile, the search for other clues in the Stuxnet program continues -- and so do the theories about its origins. Ralph Langner, a German expert in industrial control systems who has examined the program and who was the first to suggest that the Stuxnet worm may have been aimed at Iran, noted in late September that a file inside the code was named ''Myrtus.'' That could be read as an allusion to Esther, and he and others speculated it was a reference to the Book of Esther, the Old Testament tale in which the Jews pre-empt a Persian plot to destroy them. Writing on his Web site last week, Mr. Langner noted that a number of the data modules inside the program contained the date ''Sept. 24, 2001,'' clearly long before the program was written. He wrote that he believed the date was a message from the authors of the program, but did not know what it might mean. Last month, researchers at Symantec also speculated that a string of numbers found in the program -- 19790509 -- while seeming random, might actually be significant. They speculated that it might refer to May 9, 1979, the day that Jewish-Iranian businessman Habib Elghanian was executed in Iran after being convicted of spying for Israel. Interpreting what the clues might mean is a fascinating exercise for computer experts and conspiracy theorists, but it could also be a way to mislead investigators. Indeed, according to one investigator, the creation date of the data modules might instead suggest that the original attack code in Stuxnet was written long before the program was actually distributed. According to Tom Parker, a computer security specialist at Securicon LLC, a security consulting firm based in Washington, the Stuxnet payload appeared to have been written by a team of highly skilled programmers, while the ''dropper'' program that delivered the program reflected an amateur level of expertise. He said the fact that Stuxnet was detected and had spread widely in a number of countries was an indicator that it was a failed operation. ''The end target is going to be able to know they were the target, and the attacker won't be able to use this technique again,'' he said.  "
Bank Revises Number Affected by Data Theft,"PARIS -- HSBC said on Thursday that the theft of Swiss client data at the heart of a recent tax dispute with France was much larger than it earlier acknowledged.    The revelation was the latest in a fight over tax evasion that has strained relations between Switzerland and its neighbors.   The theft, carried out about three years ago by a former employee of HSBC's private banking unit, involved about 24,000 accounts, the bank said. They included about 15,000 existing clients who had accounts with the bank in Switzerland before October 2006, as well as 9,000 closed accounts, HSBC said.   The private banking unit, which has about 100,000 clients, said last year that encrypted data pertaining to no more than 10 clients had been stolen.   ''The bank does not believe that the stolen data has or will allow any third party to access any client account,'' HSBC said, adding that no data was  compromised for any of its branches outside Switzerland.   Nonetheless, the breach has created the possibility that governments will find ways to use the data to pursue tax cheats, just as officials in Germany have turned to a set of stolen computer files bought from an unknown person to encourage tax evaders there to come clean.   In August, the French budget minister, Eric Woerth, said he had a list of 3,000 Swiss accounts that he was pursuing for suspected tax evasion. It later emerged that the French authorities had gotten at least some of that data from the HSBC files, creating a diplomatic conflict with Switzerland, which argued that the data had been stolen.   The French agreed in January to hand over a copy of the data after Switzerland held up implementation of a tax treaty, and France agreed not to use the data to pursue requests for assistance from the Swiss authorities. But the French authorities said that they would continue to use the data for investigations in France.   HSBC sought on Thursday to assure its clients that the data obtained by the French authorities would not be used to investigate their accounts in Switzerland.   Officials at the French Finance Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.  "
Hackers With Enigmatic Motives Vex Companies,"The world of hackers can be roughly divided into three groups. ''Black hats'' break into corporate computer systems for fun and profit, taking credit card numbers and e-mail addresses to sell and trade with other hackers, while the ''white hats'' help companies stop their disruptive counterparts. But it is the third group, the ''gray hats,'' that are the most vexing for companies. These hackers play it any number of ways, which can leave a company vulnerable to lost assets as well as a tarnished reputation as security breaches are exposed. (The terms are a nod to westerns, with the villain wearing a black hat and the hero a white one.)  These gray-hat hackers surreptitiously break into corporate computers to find security weaknesses. They then choose whether to notify the company and stay silent until the hole has been patched or embarrass the company by exposing the problem. The debate among all of these groups over the best course of action has never been settled and will be an undercurrent at the Def Con 18 hackers conference starting Friday in Las Vegas. For companies, the best strategy for finding software flaws is just as unsettled. Facebook encourages its employees to try to hack the company site. Some companies encourage outsiders to break in. For example, Mint.com, a personal finance Web site owned by Intuit, enlists hackers to test its security once a quarter. Others just wish the hackers would simply go away, as AT&T did after a group discovered a loophole on the company's Web site in June that exposed 114,000 e-mail addresses and cellular identification numbers for owners of the iPad 3G. ''Some will say that the public is better off if we just tell everyone,'' said Dean Turner, director of Symantec's antivirus security response teams. Some companies, he points out, prefer to turn hackers from the dark side by fixing the problem and giving them public credit. Salesforce, Facebook, PayPal and Microsoft have notices on their sites encouraging researchers to find flaws in their systems. If the hackers adhere to a set of rules, the companies pledge not to initiate legal action. And the companies promise to work with the hackers to fix the problem and give them the appropriate credit for finding the flaw. Mike Reavey, director of Microsoft's Security Response Center, says Microsoft wants the researchers to report flaws without fear of repercussions. ''We take security very seriously; our focus is to put customer safety first,'' Mr. Reavey said. ''We realize we can't do this alone, which is why we want to partner with the research community.'' Dino A. Dai Zovi, a prominent white hat computer security expert at Trail of Bits, a New York security firm, said he liked to work with companies. ''If you find something new not only are you protecting people that use a system, but there's the excitement and thrill of finding something new that no one else knows about,'' Mr. Dai Zovi said. He is also motivated by the money available to the bug hunters, as they are also known. In 2006 he won $10,000 at a major white hat competition sponsored by Tipping Point, a security company, by breaking into an Apple laptop through a vulnerability in the Safari Web browser and video player. Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox Web browser, and Google both announced last week that they would begin paying for new bug discoveries, too. Gray hats may bask in the recognition, but some can also seek to make money from an exploit. One of the gray hats, a security researcher based in Singapore who would not share his real name and goes by the online pseudonym The Grugq, chooses not to tell companies about the bugs he finds, he said via instant message. Telling Microsoft about a loophole earns only a ''gold star,'' The Grugq said. Hackers can sell or trade the flaws they uncover in what is called the bug market, until the company plugs the hole and renders it worthless. ''The people actively using the bugs get very upset when they die,'' wrote The Grugq. Some bugs can sell for as much as $75,000 online. Credit card numbers were once the main product traded. Jeff Moss, who organizes conferences for hackers, says more gray hats are tempted to gain access to systems as the value of security holes increases. ''There's a vulnerability marketplace that has been steadily increasing,'' he said. ''The cost of e-mail addresses is worth more money now than it was 10 years ago, and there's a big demand for fresh vulnerabilities and information.'' Some companies want to lead the gray-hat hackers toward the white-hat camp. Other companies, including AT&T, are still wrestling with the distinctions between security researchers trying to help and those gray hats with murky motives. AT&T would not comment on its policy for dealing with gray-hat hackers. Chris Paget, the co-founder and professed chief hacker of H4rdw4re, a phone and hardware security company, said it seemed that AT&T was attacking researchers instead of working with them. ''I think there's a good case to be made that AT&T just isn't used to dealing with this kind of situation,'' he said. ''A lot of companies aren't.'' Mr. Moss, known online as The Dark Tangent, said the involvement of the F.B.I. in the iPad 3G case had given some researchers reason to reconsider disclosing online holes. ''It's a wait and see effect in the community right now,'' Mr. Moss said. The threat of legal action is not the only reason hackers are taking stock. ''There's a lot of money to be made in identify theft, credit card numbers and e-mail lists,'' Mr. Dai Zovi said. ''White hats are sick of giving away information; they want to be paid for the work now too.''  "
H.P. Is Said to Be Near Deal For Security Software Maker,"Hewlett-Packard is close to a deal to buy ArcSight, a maker of security software, for about $1.5 billion, a person briefed on the matter said on Sunday, as the computing giant continues its recent buying spree.  The deal could be announced as soon as Monday, this person said, cautioning that talks were ongoing and might still fall apart. As it seeks to resume business after the contentious departure of its former chief executive, Mark V. Hurd, H.P. again has shown little timidity about paying up for acquisitions. At $1.5 billion, the potential deal would represent a 25 percent premium over ArcSight's market value of $1.2 billion on Friday. The company has sought to show that it is back to business as usual after the ouster of Mr. Hurd over violations of its business conduct code, which involved the hiring of an actress-turned-marketer. Mr. Hurd has since moved to a major rival, Oracle, as a co-president, prompting a lawsuit by H.P. alleging that the executive is breaking confidentiality clauses in his contract. A deal would come only two weeks after H.P. defeated Dell in a heated bidding war for 3Par, a data storage company. H.P. ultimately agreed to pay about $2 billion for 3Par, well above the $1.15 billion Dell initially offered for the company. H.P. and its rivals have been eager to grow beyond the low-margin business of assembling and selling computers. (While serving as H.P.'s chief executive, Mr. Hurd oversaw deals like the $13.9 billion purchase of Electronic Data Systems to help the company build a business to compete with offerings from companies like I.B.M.) Winning 3Par gave H.P. an expanded presence in the increasingly popular world of cloud computing, which depends on access to copious amounts of data storage. Buying ArcSight would bolster H.P.'s security and network offerings. The company makes products that help governments and businesses monitor their data networks for suspicious activity. ArcSight, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported $181.4 million in revenue and $28.4 million in net income for its most recent fiscal year. The company, founded in 2000, has 512 employees. It counts more than 1,000 customers around the world, including Verizon and the Securities and Exchange Commission. News of the potential deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal online.

Hackers Attack Sites Considered WikiLeaks Foes,"LONDON -- In a campaign that had some declaring the start of a ''cyberwar,'' hundreds of Internet activists mounted retaliatory attacks on Wednesday on the Web sites of multinational companies and other organizations they deemed hostile to the WikiLeaks antisecrecy organization and its jailed founder, Julian Assange. Within 12 hours of a British judge's decision on Tuesday to deny Mr. Assange bail in a Swedish extradition case, attacks on the Web sites of WikiLeaks's ''enemies,'' as defined by the organization's impassioned supporters around the world, caused several corporate Web sites to become inaccessible or slow down markedly.  Targets of the attacks, in which activists overwhelmed the sites with traffic, included the Web site of MasterCard, which had stopped processing donations for WikiLeaks; Amazon.com, which revoked the use of its computer servers; and PayPal, which stopped accepting donations for Mr. Assange's group. Visa.com was also affected by the attacks, as were the Web sites of the Swedish prosecutor's office and the lawyer representing the two women whose allegations of sexual misconduct are the basis of Sweden's extradition bid. The Internet assaults underlined the growing reach of self-described ''cyberanarchists,'' antigovernment and anticorporate activists who have made an icon of Mr. Assange, a 39-year-old Australian. The speed and range of the attacks also appeared to show the resilience of the backing among computer activists for Mr. Assange, who has appeared increasingly isolated in recent months amid the furor stoked by WikiLeaks's Web site posting of hundreds of thousands of secret Pentagon documents on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr. Assange has come under renewed attack in the past two weeks for posting the first tranche of a trove of 250,000 secret State Department cables that have exposed American diplomats' frank assessments of relations with many countries, forcing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to express regret to world leaders and raising fears that they and other sources would become more reticent. The New York Times and four other news organizations last week began publishing articles based on the archive of cables made available to them. In recent months, some of Mr. Assange's closest associates in WikiLeaks abandoned him, calling him autocratic and capricious and accusing him of reneging on WikiLeaks's original pledge of impartiality to launch a concerted attack on the United States. He has been simultaneously fighting a remote battle with the Swedish prosecutors, who have sought his extradition for questioning on accusations of ''rape, sexual molestation and forceful coercion'' made by the Swedish women. Mr. Assange has denied any wrongdoing in the cases. American officials have repeatedly said that they are reviewing possible criminal charges against Mr. Assange, a step that could lead to a bid to extradite him to the United States and confront him with having to fight for his freedom on two fronts. The cyberattacks in Mr. Assange's defense appear to have been coordinated by Anonymous, a loosely affiliated group of activist computer hackers who have singled out other groups before, including the Church of Scientology. Last weekend, members of Anonymous vowed in two online manifestos to take revenge on any organization that lined up against WikiLeaks. Anonymous claimed responsibility for the MasterCard attack in Web messages and, according to one activist associated with the group, conducted waves of attacks on other companies during the day. The group said the actions were part of an effort called Operation Payback, which began as a way of punishing companies that attempted to stop Internet file-sharing and movie downloads. The activist, Gregg Housh, who disavows a personal role in any illegal online activity, said that 1,500 supporters had been in online forums and chat rooms organizing the mass ''denial of service'' attacks. His account was confirmed by Jose Nazario, a senior security researcher at Arbor Networks, a Chelmsford, Mass., firm that tracks malicious activity on computer networks. Most of the corporations whose sites were targeted did not explain why they severed ties with WikiLeaks. But PayPal issued statements saying its decision was based on ''a violation'' of its policy on promoting illegal activities. Almost all the corporate Web sites that were attacked appeared to be operating normally later on Wednesday, suggesting that any economic impact was limited. But the sense of an Internet war was reinforced when Netcraft, a British Internet monitoring firm, reported that the Web site being used by the hackers to distribute denial-of-service software had been suspended by a Dutch hosting firm, Leaseweb. A sense of the belligerent mood among activists was given when one contributor to a forum the group uses, WhyWeProtest.net, wrote of the attacks: ''The war is on. And everyone ought to spend some time thinking about it, discussing it with others, preparing yourselves so you know how to act if something compels you to make a decision. Be very careful not to err on the side of inaction.'' Mr. Housh acknowledged that there had been online talk among the hackers of a possible Internet campaign against the two women who have been Mr. Assange's accusers in the Swedish case, but he said that ''a lot of people don't want to be involved.'' A Web search showed new blog posts in recent days in which the two women, identified by the Swedish prosecutors only as Ms. A. and Ms. W., were named, but it was not clear whether there was any link to Anonymous. The women have said that consensual sexual encounters with Mr. Assange became nonconsensual when condoms were no longer in use. The cyberattacks on corporations Wednesday were seen by many supporters as a counterstrike against the United States. Mr. Assange's online supporters have widely condemned the Obama administration as the unseen hand coordinating efforts to choke off WikiLeaks by denying it financing and suppressing its network of computer servers. Mr. Housh described Mr. Assange in an interview as ''a political prisoner,'' a common view among WikiLeaks supporters who have joined Mr. Assange in condemning the sexual abuse accusations as part of an American-inspired ''smear campaign.'' Another activist used the analogy of the civil rights struggle for the cyberattacks. ''Are they disrupting business?'' a contributor using the name Moryath wrote in a comment on the slashdot.org technology Web site. ''Perhaps, but no worse than the lunch counter sit-ins did.''  "
A Strong Password Isn't the Strongest Security,"Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University. E-mail: stross@nytimes.com MAKE your password strong, with a unique jumble of letters, numbers and punctuation marks. But memorize it -- never write it down. And, oh yes, change it every few months. These instructions are supposed to protect us. But they don't. Some computer security experts are advancing the heretical thought that passwords might not need to be ''strong,'' or changed constantly. They say onerous requirements for passwords have given us a false sense of protection against potential attacks. In fact, they say, we aren't paying enough attention to more potent threats.  Here's one threat to keep you awake at night: Keylogging software, which is deposited on a PC by a virus, records all keystrokes -- including the strongest passwords you can concoct -- and then sends it surreptitiously to a remote location. ''Keeping a keylogger off your machine is about a trillion times more important than the strength of any one of your passwords,'' says Cormac Herley, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research who specializes in security-related topics. He said antivirus software could detect and block many kinds of keyloggers, but ''there's no guarantee that it gets everything.'' After investigating password requirements in a variety of settings, Mr. Herley is critical not of users but of system administrators who aren't paying enough attention to the inconvenience of making people comply with arcane rules. ''It is not users who need to be better educated on the risks of various attacks, but the security community,'' he said at a meeting of security professionals, the New Security Paradigms Workshop, at Queen's College in Oxford, England. ''Security advice simply offers a bad cost-benefit tradeoff to users.'' One might guess that heavily trafficked Web sites -- especially those that provide access to users' financial information -- would have requirements for strong passwords. But it turns out that password policies of many such sites are among the most relaxed. These sites don't publicly discuss security breaches, but Mr. Herley said it ''isn't plausible'' that these sites would use such policies if their users weren't adequately protected from attacks by those who do not know the password. Mr. Herley, working with Dinei Florencio, also at Microsoft Research, looked at the password policies of 75 Web sites. At the Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, held in July in Redmond, Wash., they reported that the sites that allowed relatively weak passwords were busy commercial destinations, including PayPal, Amazon.com and Fidelity Investments. The sites that insisted on very complex passwords were mostly government and university sites. What accounts for the difference? They suggest that ''when the voices that advocate for usability are absent or weak, security measures become needlessly restrictive.'' Donald A. Norman, a co-founder of the Nielsen Norman Group, a design consulting firm in Fremont, Calif., makes a similar case. In ''When Security Gets in the Way,'' an essay published last year, he noted the password rules of Northwestern University, where he then taught. It was a daunting list of 15 requirements. He said unreasonable rules can end up rendering a system less secure: users end up writing down passwords and storing them in places that can be readily discovered. ''These requirements keep out the good guys without deterring the bad guys,'' he said. Northwestern has reduced its password requirements to eight, but they still constitute a challenging maze. For example, the password can't have more than four sequential characters from the previous seven passwords, and a new password is required every 120 days. By contrast, Amazon has only one requirement: that the password be at least six characters. That's it. And hold on to it as long as you like. A short password wouldn't work well if an attacker could try every possible combination in quick succession. But as Mr. Herley and Mr. Florencio note, commercial sites can block ''brute-force attacks'' by locking an account after a given number of failed log-in attempts. ''If an account is locked for 24 hours after three unsuccessful attempts,'' they write, ''a six-digit PIN can withstand 100 years of sustained attack.'' Roger A. Safian, a senior data security analyst at Northwestern, says that unlike Amazon, the university is unfortunately vulnerable to brute-force attacks in that it doesn't lock out accounts after failed log-ins. The reason, he says, is that anyone could use a lockout policy to try logging in to a victim's account, ''knowing that you won't succeed, but also knowing that the victim won't be able to use the account, either.'' (Such thoughts may occur to a student facing an unwelcome exam, who could block a professor from preparations.) VERY short passwords, taken directly from the dictionary, would be permitted in a password system that Mr. Herley and Stuart Schechter at Microsoft Research developed with Michael Mitzenmacher at Harvard. At the Usenix Workshop on Hot Topics in Security conference, held last month in Washington, the three suggested that Web sites with tens or hundreds of millions of users, could let users choose any password they liked -- as long as only a tiny percentage selected the same one. That would render a list of most often used passwords useless: by limiting a single password to, say, 100 users among 10 million, the odds of an attacker getting lucky on one attempt per account are astronomically long, Mr. Herley explained in a conversation last month. Mr. Herley said the proposed system hadn't been tested and that users might become frustrated in trying to select a password that was no longer available. But he said he believed an anything-is-permitted password system would be welcomed by users sick of being told, ''Eat your broccoli; a strong password is good for security.'' Screen Language,   Deciphered Q.I'm shopping around for a laptop, but get confused at the different type of L.C.D. screens offered. For example, I have a choice of C.C.F.L. or LED -- what does that even mean?   A. The two technologies in question here, C.C.F.L. (cold cathode fluorescent lamp) and LED (light-emitting diode) are two different ways to provide a backlight for the laptop's screen.    Of these two, C.C.F.L. is the older and cheaper method and may be the default display option from some manufacturers. C.C.F.L. backlight has some drawbacks, however. It consumes relatively more power and also contains mercury, which makes the technology less friendly to the environment.   In comparison, a typical LED backlight uses less power and does not contain mercury. Choosing an LED backlight may make the computer more expensive by $20 or more, but it's a ''greener'' machine. Some laptop makers have phased out C.C.F.L. altogether.   Depending on the manufacturer, other display options may include selecting a glossy or a matte finish. People who like intense, vibrant colors for viewing videos and photos often favor glossy displays. Matte screens show less glare (and fingerprints), but also generally have less contrast and color depth than glossy screens.   Screens advertised as ''high nit'' are brighter than standard displays and are made for highly lighted or outdoor work areas where monitors tend to get washed out. A nit is a unit of measurement used to describe screen brightness; one nit equals one candela per square meter and the more nits, the brighter the display.   Protecting   Digital Archives   Q.I'm scanning hundreds of personal documents, and some include credit card and Social Security numbers and other confidential information. What is the best way to safeguard the files from hackers? I've read a little that password-protected zip files could be used.   A. It is possible to put protected documents in a compressed archive (zip) file by requiring a password to open the archive. Microsoft, for instance, has instructions for Windows XP users at support.microsoft.com/kb/306531.    But for all the guides you can find for adding passwords to zip files, you can also find many guides to cracking them open (eHow has an example at bit.ly/7aFPnS). So this may not be the most secure way to protect the files.   Depending on your operating system, you may have other options. Mac OS X has a program called FileVault for encrypting your Home folder (bit.ly/1DxPc0). Some high-end versions of Windows have a file-encryption feature or a drive-encryption tool called BitLocker (the difference is explained at bit.ly/7LRwFN).    For deeply personal files that are scanned primarily to make digital archive copies, you may want to consider not storing them on the main computer, but on an external hard drive that can be encrypted itself with programs like PGP (pgp.com) or the free TrueCrypt (truecrypt.org). Make sure your computer has an active firewall and other security software and unplug the drive when you are not using those files.

Hacker With Ink on Back and Big Chip on Shoulder; Movie Review | 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo',"Tattoos and body piercings must be pretty far-out stuff in Sweden, the land of midnight sun, icy blondes and enough twisted thinking to plump up three best-selling mystery novels. From the way that most people look at the inked, pierced form of Lisbeth Salander, the main attraction in the movie adaptation of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" the first book in Stieg Larsson's so-called Millennium Trilogy, you might even think that our girl had a swastika stamped on her forehead rather than a few modest rings hooked through her nose - you know, like a cow ready for market or, given the murderous milieu, slaughter.   Salander, as she's usually called in the books, is a devil doll par excellence, and maybe if David Fincher makes good on the vaporous rumors wafting around about the inevitable American adaptation, she might one day make an equally delectable film character too. Weighing in at 90 pounds of rage on the page and a hair heavier and less fierce on the screen, where she's played by Noomi Rapace, Salander embodies a host of au courant fantasies. She's a geek girl for starters, a computer hacker who would have downloaded this flick before it even hit theaters, and whose fetish wear and shiny boots suggest that she's into BDSM, as they say in bondage, discipline and sadomasochism circles.   More seductive to some, Salander is also a victim turned avenger, who, rather than taking her traumatic past out on herself in classic female style, say, by cutting, externalizes her rage. She doesn't take anything lying down, including sex and violence. She's the top dog in bed as well as in the streets, where she follows the creed that it's better to die on your feet than on your knees. From one angle, she looks like a consummate cool chick of the sort routinely conjured up by the science-fiction visionary William Gibson, whose dream girl in his novel ""Pattern Recognition,"" with her singular talents, black clothes and sleek, tousled ""anime hair, rendered hi-rez,"" could easily describe Salander.  There's more to Salander, however, than goth threads and ornamentation, and much of what makes  Mr. Larsson's first book worth the long haul (almost 600 pages in paperback) are the revelations about her spiky, unsettling, satisfyingly not-nice personality, which her creator, who died before the trilogy's publication, peels as deliberately as an onion. She's a less disquieting presence in the movie (a protracted 152 minutes), which was competently, sometimes ploddingly directed by Niels Arden Oplev and written by Rasmus Heisterberg and Nikolaj Arcel. Though Ms. Rapace is a fine professional scowler, with cheekbones that thrust like knives and a pout that's mostly pucker, she tends to register as an intriguing idea instead of a thoroughly realized character. She more or less looks the part that the filmmakers don't let her fully play.  Maybe they were too busy trying to get - and keep - Mr. Larsson's heavily plotted story in gear. A journalist who crusaded against right-wing extremism, he crammed a fearsome amount - love, sex, historical traumas, even an iBook plug - into ""Dragon Tattoo,"" his first novel. As in the book, Salander shares narrative pride of place in the movie with a journalist, Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist, adequate and sympathetic), who, after losing a highly publicized libel case to a corporate titan, is hired by a semi-retired captain of industry, Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube), an  octogenarian who wants to know how and why his favorite niece, Harriet, disappeared decades earlier. Vanger suspects one of his creepy-crawly relatives, some of whom were active Nazis during World War II.   To retrofit ""Dragon Tattoo"" for the screen, the writers have ditched plot details and characters even as they've lifted crucial material from its sequel, ""The Girl Who Played With Fire."" These incendiary visuals, borrowed from Salander's childhood, make the glib case for why she's such a head case. But the flashbacks are so visually and thematically blunt that they upstage the narrative's interesting parallels and disturb its political undertow: Salander and Blomkvist initially occupy separate story lines that seem to converge only because she's hired to spy on him. Along the way, each runs a gantlet of patriarchal violence (personal, social, capitalist), a trail of horrors that ends in a pile of bodies. Each is also a victim of that violence, which gives the story a political edge, keeping it from pure psychodrama.  ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" was originally published as ""Men Who Hate Women,"" which apparently wasn't sexy enough for English-language bookshelves. The title change certainly spices things up, no matter how commonplace body art is,  at least outside of Stockholm, and it   plays down its overarching theme, which the movie only does further. Just as significant is the substitution in the title of ""girl"" for ""women,"" a categorical displacement (and diminution) that also shifts the emphasis from the crime (and criminals) and places it on Salander's slender back.  It's an attractive back in the movie, as is the tattoo adorning it, even if, like all the prettily photographed winter landscapes, the dragon covers up something the filmmakers seem loath to reveal and simultaneously eager to exploit.  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO Opens on Friday  in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington.  Directed by Niels Arden Oplev; written by Rasmus Heisterberg and Nikolaj Arcel, based on the novel by Stieg Larsson; director of photography, Eric Kress; edited by Anne Osterud and Jannus Billeskov Jansen; music by Jacob Groth; production designer, Niels Sejer; costumes by Cilla Rorby; produced by Soren Staermose; released by Music Box Films.

GOOGLE MAY END VENTURE IN CHINA OVER CENSORSHIP,"This article was reported by Andrew Jacobs, Miguel Helft and John Markoff and written by Mr. Jacobs.   BEIJING -- Google said Tuesday that it would stop cooperating with Chinese Internet censorship and consider shutting down its operations in the country altogether, citing assaults from hackers on its computer systems and China's attempts to ''limit free speech on the Web.''   The move, if followed through, would be  a highly unusual rebuke of China by one of the largest and most admired technology companies, which had for years coveted China's 300 million Web users.    Since arriving here in 2006 under an arrangement with the government that purged its Chinese search results of banned topics, Google has come under fire for abetting a system that increasingly restricts what  citizens can read online.    Google linked its decision to sophisticated cyberattacks on its computer systems that it suspected originated in China and that were aimed, at least in part, at the Gmail user accounts of Chinese human rights activists.    Those attacks, which Google said took place last week, were directed at  some 34 companies or entities, most of them in Silicon Valley, California, according to people with knowledge of Google's investigation into the matter. The attackers may have succeeded in penetrating elaborate computer security systems and obtaining crucial corporate data and software source codes, though Google said it did not itself suffer losses of that kind.   While the scope of the hacking and the motivations and identities of the hackers remained uncertain, Google's response  amounted to  an unambiguous repudiation of its own five-year courtship of the vast China market, which most major multinational companies consider crucial to their growth prospects. It is also likely to enrage the Chinese authorities, who deny that they censor the Internet and are accustomed to having major foreign companies adapt their practices to Chinese norms.   The company said it would try to negotiate a new arrangement to provide uncensored results on its search site, google.cn. But that is a highly unlikely prospect in a country that has the most sweeping Web filtering system in the world. Google said it would otherwise cease to run google.cn and would consider shutting its offices in China, where it employs some 700 people, many of them highly compensated software engineers, and has an estimated $300 million in annual revenue.   Google executives declined to discuss in detail their reasons for overturning their China strategy. But despite a costly investment, the company has a much smaller share of the search market here than it does in other major markets, commanding only about one in three searches by Chinese. The leader in  searches, Baidu, is a Chinese-run company that enjoys a close relationship with the  government.   Google executives have privately fretted for years that the company's decision to censor the search results  on google.cn, to filter out topics banned by Chinese censors, was out of sync with the company's official motto, ''Don't be evil.''   ''We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all,'' David Drummond,  senior vice president for corporate development and the chief legal officer, said in a statement.    Wenqi Gao, a spokesman for the Chinese Consulate in New York, said he did not see any problems with google.cn. ''I want to reaffirm that China is committed to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign companies in our country,'' he said in a phone interview.   In China, search requests that include words like  ''Tiananmen Square massacre'' or ''Dalai Lama'' come up blank. In recent months, the government has also blocked YouTube, Google's video-sharing service.    While Google's business in China is now small, analysts say that the country could soon become one of the most lucrative Internet and mobile markets, and a withdrawal  would significantly reduce  Google's  long-term growth.   ''The consequences of not playing the China market could be very big for any company, but particularly for an Internet company that makes its money from advertising,'' said David B. Yoffie, a  Harvard Business School professor. Mr. Yoffie said  advertising played an even bigger role in the Internet in China than it did in the United States. At the time of its arrival, the company said that it believed that the benefits of its presence in China outweighed the downside of being forced to censor some search results here, as it would provide more information and openness to Chinese citizens. The company, however, has repeatedly said that it would  monitor restrictions in China.   Google's announcement Tuesday drew praise from free speech and human rights advocates, many of whom had criticized the company in the past over its decision to enter the Chinese market despite censorship requirements.   ''I think it's both the right move and a brilliant one,'' said Jonathan Zittrain, a legal scholar at Harvard's  Berkman Center for Internet  and Society.     Rebecca MacKinnon, a fellow at the Open Space Institute and an expert on the Chinese Internet, said that Google had endured repeated harassment in recent months and that by having operations in China it potentially risked the security of its users in China. She said many Chinese dissidents used Gmail because its servers are hosted overseas and that it offered extra encryption.   ''Unless they turn themselves into a Chinese company, Google could not win,'' she said. ''The company has clearly put its foot down and said enough is enough.''   In the past year, Google has been increasingly constricted by the Chinese government. In June, after briefly blocking access nationwide to its main search engine and other services like Gmail, the government forced the company to disable a function that lets the search engine suggest terms. At the time, the government said it was simply seeking to remove pornographic material from the company's search engine results.    Some company executives suggested then that the campaign was a concerted effort to stain  Google's image. Since its entry into China, the company has steadily lost market share to Baidu.    Google called the attacks highly sophisticated. In the past, such electronic intrusions have either exploited the practice of ''phishing,'' to persuade unsuspecting users to allow  their computers to be compromised, or exploited vulnerabilities in software programs permitting the attacks to gain control of systems remotely. Once they have taken over a target computer, it is possible to search for specific documents.    People familiar with the investigation into the attacks said they were aimed at source code repositories at high-tech companies. Source code is the original programmer's instructions used to develop software programs and can provide both economic advantages as well as insight into potential security vulnerabilities.   In its public statement Google pointed to a United States government report prepared by the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission in  October and an investigation by Canadian researchers that revealed a vast electronic spying operation last March.   The Canadian researchers discovered that digital documents had been stolen via the Internet from hundreds of government and private organizations around the world from computer systems based in China.

Google in China,"Google has taken a bold stand by saying that it would stop cooperating with China's online censorship and may pull out of the country entirely. Google had many reasons to reconsider its presence, but the discovery that it was a victim of a cyberattack aimed at Chinese human rights activists added a powerful one. There are limits to the price an American company should be willing to pay for access to 300 million Web users.    When Google took its Web site to China in early 2006, it argued that the positive benefit of giving the Chinese people more open access to the Internet outweighed the negative. But Google said that it would monitor the situation, including what restrictions were imposed upon its delivery of information.   The government's policies proved to be deeply troubling. In China, search requests on Google for terms that offend the government, such as ''Tiananmen Square massacre,'' do not work. YouTube, the company's user-generated video site, has repeatedly been blocked.   Things have not gotten better. The recently discovered cyberattacks aimed at Google's computers, and those of other companies, are particularly disturbing. A prime purpose appears to have been to hack into the Gmail user accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Google says it has discovered that the accounts of dozens of Gmail users who advocate for human rights in China have been accessed, apparently by deceptive software or other improper means.   Google's policies have not always won plaudits. Authors have had to battle to preserve their copyrights in the face of Google's ambitious plans to digitize books -- including in China.    The company has not resolved questions about protecting users' privacy and has shown an anticompetitive bent with acquisitions like DoubleClick and AdMob. But it has often stood up to censorship, particularly on YouTube.   Google's defiance of China is winning praise from human rights groups and open-Internet advocates. The Center for Democracy and Technology said, ''No company should be forced to operate under government threat to its core values or to the rights and safety of its users.''   If Google pulls out of China, the biggest losers would be the Chinese people. Google's search engine provides access to vast stores of knowledge. The Chinese government, which heavily censored the news that Google was protesting its censorship, does not appear to realize that the whole nation would suffer.    The Internet is one of the great driving forces in global progress. Entrepreneurs, scientists and artists who have the most access to it will be in the best position to invent the future.   "
Chinese Site Criticizes Investor for Its Google Support,"In an unusual move, the Alibaba Group of China on Saturday  criticized Yahoo, one of its largest shareholders, for siding with Google after a cyber attack on that company.   John Spelich, a spokesman for Alibaba, said executives at the company were angry because Yahoo, which owns 40 percent of the Chinese Internet company, appeared to follow Google in suggesting the Chinese government was behind the cyberattacks.   Alibaba's statement reads: ''Alibaba Group has communicated to Yahoo! that Yahoo's statement that it is 'aligned' with the position Google took last week was reckless given the lack of facts in evidence. Alibaba doesn't share this view.''    On Wednesday, Yahoo issued a statement supporting its Internet rival.   ''We condemn any attempts to infiltrate company networks to obtain user information,'' Yahoo said in its statement. ''We stand aligned with Google that these kinds of attacks are deeply disturbing and strongly believe that the violation of user privacy is something that we as Internet pioneers must all oppose.''   Yahoo is one of the companies that was targeted in the attacks, according to several people with knowledge of the situation. The company has declined to confirm that it was  a victim.   The people with knowledge of the situation said that Google contacted Yahoo about the attacks before it publicized them. Google executives were dismayed that other companies were unwilling to publicly acknowledge the attacks, and they were particularly frustrated by Yahoo's silence, one person said.   Tensions between Alibaba and Yahoo have surfaced in the last year. Carol Bartz, the chief executive of Yahoo, has reportedly told Alibaba executives that Yahoo was not happy about how Alibaba handled the Yahoo Internet portal and brand in China. In September, Yahoo cashed out its investment in Alibaba.com, the publicly traded e-commerce site which is partially owned by Alibaba Group.   Yahoo's statement on the attacks did not mention of the Chinese government playing a role in the attacks. But Google's statement earlier this week suggested the Chinese government may have orchestrated the attacks in order to get hold of information stored in the e-mail accounts of Chinese dissidents or human rights activists.   Because of those attacks Google has said it has grown increasingly worried about Beijing's restrictions on its operations in China and has threatened to pull out.   The statement was a stunning rebuke of the Chinese government and a rare instance of a multinational corporation challenging the leadership in a country that is becoming an increasingly important marketplace.   Alibaba called the Yahoo statement premature and 'reckless' because Google had not released any proof to support its announcement. A spokesman for Yahoo, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., could not be reached for comment.    Alibaba, one of China's best-known technology companies, operates a series of popular Web sites, including Alibaba.com, Taobao.com and Yahoo China. The company, which is based in Hangzhou, is led by Jack Ma, a former English teacher who has transformed himself into one of the country's wealthiest and most admired entrepreneurs.   Mr. Ma is a celebrity here because of his success in forcing Ebay to retreat from the Chinese market, and taking over Yahoo's China operations after they lost significant market share.   Yahoo paid Alibaba $1 billion and gave Alibaba control of Yahoo China in exchange for a 40 percent stake in the Chinese company. Yahoo China continues to struggle here, but Yahoo's investment in Alibaba has paid off. Alibaba.com, a unit of Alibaba, went public in 2007 with a huge stock offering in Hong Kong and is now valued at $12.5 billion.  "
Hackers Who Leave No Trace,"The crown jewels of Google, Cisco Systems or any other technology company are the millions of lines of programming instructions, known as source code, that make its products run.   If hackers could steal those key instructions and copy them, they could easily dull the company's competitive edge in the marketplace. More insidiously, if attackers were able to make subtle, undetected changes to that code, they could essentially give themselves secret access to everything the company and its customers did with the software.   The fear of someone building such a back door, known as a Trojan horse, and using it to conduct continual spying is why companies and security experts were so alarmed by Google's disclosure last week that hackers based in China had stolen some of its intellectual property and had conducted similar assaults on more than two dozen other companies.    ''Originally we were saying, 'Well, whoever got it has the secret sauce to Google and some 30 other California companies, and they can replicate it,' '' said Rick Howard, director of security intelligence at VeriSign iDefense, which helped Google investigate the Chinese attacks. ''But some of the more devious folks in our outfit were saying, 'Well, they could also insert their own code -- and they probably have.' ''   For example, a foreign intelligence agency might find it extremely useful to know who was asking particular questions of Google's search engine.    Security researchers took particular interest in the fact that the Silicon Valley company Adobe Systems was one of the companies hit by the recent wave of attacks.    Computer users around the globe have Adobe's Acrobat or Reader software sitting on their machines to create or read documents, and Adobe's Flash technology is widely used to present multimedia content on the Web and mobile phones.    ''Acrobat is installed on about 95 percent of the machines in the world, and there have been a lot of vulnerabilities found in Flash,'' said Jeff Moss, a security expert who sits on the Homeland Security Advisory Council. ''If you can find a vulnerability in one of these products, you're golden.''   Products from Microsoft, including Windows, Office and Internet Explorer, have long been favored targets for hackers because so many people use them. But McAfee, a leading software security firm, predicts that Adobe's software will become the top target this year, as Microsoft has improved its products after years of attacks and Adobe's software has become ubiquitous.   Adobe said it was still investigating the attacks but so far had no evidence that any sensitive information had been compromised.    Brad Arkin, the director of product security at Adobe, said the company generally expected to face increasing attention from hackers given the growing popularity of its products. But he added that the company employed industry-leading practices to respond to threats. ''The security of our customers will always be a critical priority for Adobe,'' he said.   Given the complexity of today's software programs, which are typically written by teams of hundreds or thousands of engineers, it is virtually impossible to be perfectly confident in the security of any program, and tampering could very well go undetected.   Companies are understandably reluctant to discuss their security failures. But one notable episode shows just how damaging the secret tampering with source code can be.   Before the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, an unidentified hacker inserted secret programs into four telephone switching computers operated by the Vodafone Group, the world's largest cellphone carrier. The programs created a clandestine tapping system that allowed unknown snoops to eavesdrop on cellphone calls and track the location of about 100 prominent Greek citizens, including then-Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis, military officials, the mayor of Athens, activists and journalists.    The infiltration was uncovered in a government investigation after a Vodafone engineer was found dead in 2005 under suspicious circumstances.   Although the recent round of attacks against Google and other companies appears to have come from China, the threat is not limited to that country, according to computer security researchers. A host of nations, private corporations and even bands of rogue programmers are capable of covertly tunneling into information systems.   ''Our conventional military dominance drives our adversaries to cheat, lie and steal,'' said James Gosler, a fellow at Sandia National Laboratories and a visiting scientist at the National Security Agency,  in a speech last year to Pentagon employees. ''The offensive technical capability to play this game is well within the reach of the principal adversaries of the United States. In fact, one could argue that some of our adversaries are better at this game than we are.'' Over the years, Chinese attackers have shown the most interest in military and technology-related assets, leaving assaults on financial systems to hackers in Russia and Eastern European countries.    A look at the source code of software at a company like Adobe or Cisco can help attackers  find new ways to burrow into products before the companies can fix errors in their software. In addition, the hackers can gain insights into how to insert their own code into the software so that they can have ready access to machines down the road. ''One of the U.S. government's biggest worries is that the attackers will place that source code back into products,'' said George Kurtz, the chief technology officer at McAfee.    For example, the widespread appearance of counterfeit Cisco routers, which direct traffic on computer networks, has become a major concern in recent years.   Cisco is required by law to include technology in its networking products that allows investigators to tap the hardware for information. The fear is that a country like China could sell counterfeit routers containing slightly modified software that would allow hackers to dial into the systems. ''That could provide the perfect over-the-shoulder view of everything coming out of a network,'' Mr. Moss said.    A Cisco spokesman, Terry Alberstein, said that the company had extensively tested counterfeit Cisco routers. ''We have not found a single instance of software or hardware that was modified to make them more vulnerable to security threats,'' he said.   Alan Paller, director of research at the SANS Institute, a security education organization, said American technology companies had gotten better about protecting their most prized intellectual property by creating more complex systems for viewing and changing source code. Such systems can keep a detailed account of what tweaks have been made to a software product.   But such security can be  undermined by employees who open malicious files sent to them in e-mail, said Mr. Kurtz. ''One of the greatest vulnerabilities remains the people element,'' he added.  "
Television Is Not Free and Does Not Want to Be,"The proliferation of ''free'' media on the Internet seems to have convinced an entire generation that the old hacker slogan from a quarter-century ago, ''information wants to be free,'' can be an organizing principle for the information economy of the future.   Google brings us abundant ''free'' content while raking in billions from the ads alongside their search results. The Pirate Bay delivers ''free'' music and movies to teenagers while living off the revenue from banner ads. But then there is television. One of the oldest free mediums, it has something to teach us about free information: It can be expensive. And, perhaps, we would be better off if we were allowed to pay for it.    The TV spats of the past few weeks -- between Cablevision and the Walt Disney Company over payments for ABC, and between Time Warner and the News Corporation over Fox -- suggest that the future lies in the opposite direction from free.    The most recent tussle was over Disney's demand that Cablevision pay something between 50 cents and $1 per subscriber per month, according to news reports, to pipe ABC to Cablevision's three million subscribers in the New York metropolitan region.    Historically, cable companies have not had to pay for broadcast channels. They compensated broadcasters by buying access to sister networks. Cablevision says it pays Disney $200 million a year for about a dozen channels, including ESPN and the Disney Channel.   On Sunday, as talks hit an impasse, Disney cut ABC's signal from Cablevision for almost 21 hours, including 14 minutes of the Oscars -- the second-highest ranked program on TV by ratings after the Super Bowl. The signal was restored by a tentative, undisclosed deal.    If I were a Cablevision subscriber, I would probably want to pay. Compared with some of the other costs of free TV, $1 a month doesn't seem too expensive. In fact, for the right broadcast, I would pay even more.   Americans watch 153 hours of TV a month, on average, according to a Nielsen survey. On prime time, ABC has a 9 percent share. At $1 a month, a rough, back-of-the-envelope estimate (assuming families watch TV together) would suggest Disney wants, at most, 7 cents an hour from the average Cablevision subscriber to watch its shows.   Compare that with today's price of TV. Cablevision's basic ''family cable'' package costs $55.95 a month, which works out at most to 37 cents an hour per home. That is cheap compared with the real price we pay for television: 18 minutes out of every hour that we are expected to spend watching ads. Those 18 minutes are much more valuable to me and you than they are to ABC.   A study in 2009 estimated that advertisers paid about $230,000 for a 30-second spot on ABC's ''Desperate Housewives.'' That amounts to 79 cents an hour for each of the 10.6 million homes plugged into the show on Sunday nights. But if average hourly wages are $22.05 an hour, 18 minutes of the average workers' time are worth $6.60.    Imagine a world in which information isn't free. Your TV set is fitted with a coin slot -- or a PayPal account. Wouldn't you rather pay 79 cents for an hourlong show to get rid of the ads? Even the 50 or so national commercials on the Oscars, for which ABC reportedly charged up to $1.5 million per spot, amount to about $1.80 for each of the 41.3 million viewers.    While we're at it, why not add 37 cents and ditch the family cable bundle and its dozens of unwatched networks? We could even throw in 7 more cents for Disney. It seems to be a better deal than $55.95 a month, plus 18 minutes an hour.    Technology might move us inevitably in this direction. Broadcast TV networks are badgering cable systems for money because falling ad revenues are forcing them to find new sources of income. Digital video recorders that offer customers the ability to strip out commercials could hasten the trend.    If we're lucky, we'll get a world in which TV is not free, but we will only pay for it when we want to watch it.   "
Google Calls for Action on Web Limits,"A top Google executive on Wednesday called for rules to put pressure on governments that filter the Internet, saying the practice was hindering international trade.   Alan Davidson, director of public policy for Google, told a joint Congressional panel that the United States should consider withholding development aid for countries that restrict certain Web sites. He said censorship had become more than a human rights issue and was hurting profit for foreign companies that rely on the Internet to reach customers.   ''The growing problem for Internet censorship is not isolated to one country or one region,'' Mr. Davidson told the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. ''No single company and no single industry can tackle Internet censorship on its own.''     The fallout from China's restrictive Internet policies widened on Wednesday when officials from Go Daddy Group, an Internet services company, told the commission that the company would halt registration of Chinese domain names.    Christine Jones, general counsel of Go Daddy, said the company was concerned about privacy after Chinese officials requested photo identification and signatures of its customers. For the first time, she said, Go Daddy had been asked to retroactively obtain documentation for individuals who had registered a domain name.   ''We're concerned about the chilling effect,'' Ms. Jones said. ''We made the decision that we didn't want to act as an agent of the Chinese government.''   Ms. Jones described a chaotic scene for Internet companies in China. She said attacks from hackers were rampant, fraudulent payments were common, and spammers worked without fear of punishment from the government.     Representative David Wu, Democrat of Oregon, said he thought more companies would follow the example of Go Daddy and Google and cut back operations in China. ''Pretty soon you have a cascade going,'' Mr. Wu said. ''There is a difference between compliance and complicity.''   More than 40 countries actively censor the Internet currently, Mr. Davidson said, and 25 governments have blocked Google over the last several years. Mr. Davidson suggested asking countries to pledge to keep sites unfiltered in international trade agreements.    On Monday, Google closed its Internet search service in China and began directing users in that country to its uncensored search engine in Hong Kong. So far, Mr. Davidson said, the company had noticed ''intermittent'' censorship of the Hong Kong site. Despite the restrictions, the company plans to maintain a sales team in mainland China, he said.   Google's decision to leave China was prompted in part by a series of attacks by hackers last year, which raised broader concerns about the flow of information in the country. The Chinese government has disputed that it was the source of the attacks, which focused on e-mail accounts of human rights advocates.    Mr. Davidson said Google would consider returning to the Chinese market if the government there removed its restrictions. But he acknowledged that there would likely be a ''hard road ahead'' because neither side is willing to cede ground.   ''It's going to take a lot of work to combat that censorship,'' he said.   In a statement to the commission, Chinese officials defended their policies, saying, ''foreign companies need to abide by Chinese laws and regulations when they operate in China.''    ''The Chinese government encourages the development and popularization of the Internet and is committed to the opening up of the Internet,'' the statement said.   The panel included members of the Senate and House and Obama administration officials. It was chaired by Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, and Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan.   ''Information is not to be feared, and ideas are not enemies to be crushed,'' Mr. Dorgan said in opening remarks. ''The truth is China too often wants a one-way relationship with the world.''  "
Chasing Pirates: Inside Microsoft's War Room,"AS the sun rose over the mountains circling Los Reyes, a town in the Mexican state of Michoacan, one morning in March 2009, a caravan of more than 300 heavily armed law enforcement agents set out on a raid. All but the lead vehicle turned off their headlights to evade lookouts, called ''falcons,'' who work for La Familia Michoacana, the brutal Mexican cartel that controls the drug trade. This time, the police weren't hunting for a secret stash of drugs, guns or money. Instead, they looked to crack down on La Familia's growing counterfeit software ring. The police reached the house undetected, barreled in and found rooms crammed with about 50 machines used to copy CDs and make counterfeit versions of software like Microsoft Office and Xbox video games. They arrested three men on the spot, who were later released while the authorities investigate the case. ''The entire operation was very complicated and risky,'' says a person close to the investigation, who demanded anonymity out of fear for his life.  The raid added to a body of evidence confirming La Familia's expansion into counterfeit software as a low-risk, high-profit complement to drugs, bribery and kidnapping. The group even stamps the disks it produces with ''FMM,'' which stands for Familia Morelia Michoacana, right alongside the original brand of various software makers. The cartel distributes the software through thousands of kiosks, markets and stores in the region and demands that sales workers meet weekly quotas, this person says, describing the operation as a ''form of extortion'' on locals. The arrival of organized criminal syndicates to the software piracy scene has escalated worries at companies like Microsoft, Symantec and Adobe. Groups in China, South America and Eastern Europe appear to have supply chains and sales networks rivaling those of legitimate businesses, says David Finn, Microsoft's anti-piracy chief. Sometimes they sell exact copies of products, but often peddle tainted software that opens the door to other electronic crime. ''As long as intellectual property is the lifeblood of this company, we have to go protect it,'' Mr. Finn says. Microsoft has adopted a hard-line stance against counterfeiting. It has set up a sophisticated anti-piracy operation that dwarfs those of other software makers; the staff includes dozens of former government intelligence agents from the United States, Europe and Asia, who use a host of ''CSI''-like forensic technology tools for finding and convicting criminals. But the hunt for pirates carries with it a cost to Microsoft's reputation. The company's profit from Windows and Office remains the envy of the technology industry, and critics contend that Microsoft simply charges too much for them. In countries like India, where Microsoft encourages local police officers to conduct raids, the company can come off as a bully willing to go after its own business partners if they occasionally peddle counterfeit software to people who struggle to afford the real thing. ''It is better for the Indian government to focus on educating its children rather than making sure royalties go back to Microsoft,'' says Eben Moglen, a law professor at Columbia Law School and a leading advocate of free software. Mr. Finn argues that Microsoft has no choice but to be aggressive in its fight, saying its immense network of resellers and partners can't make a living in areas flush with counterfeit software. He says consumers and businesses are being coaxed into buying counterfeit products that either don't work or do serious harm by clearing the way for various types of electronic fraud. And, crucially, the counterfeit software cuts into Microsoft's potential profit. A software industry trade group estimated the value of unlicensed software for all companies at $51.4 billion last year. The most vociferous critics of Microsoft and the overall proprietary software industry describe the anti-piracy crusade as a sophisticated dog-and-pony show. They say the software makers tolerate a certain level of piracy because they would rather have people use their products -- even if counterfeit -- than pick up lower-cost alternatives. At the same time, the critics say, the software companies conduct periodic raids to remind customers and partners that playing by the rules makes sense. ''It has always been in Microsoft's interests for software to be available at two different prices -- expensive for the people that can afford it and inexpensive for those that can't,'' Mr. Moglen says. ''At the end of the day, if you're a monopolist, you have to tolerate a large number of copies you don't get paid for just to keep everyone hooked.'' Microsoft has demonstrated a rare ability to elicit the cooperation of law enforcement officials to go after software counterfeiters and to secure convictions -- not only in India and Mexico, but also in China, Brazil, Colombia, Belize and Russia. Countries like Malaysia, Chile and Peru have set up intellectual-property protection squads that rely on Microsoft's training and expertise to deal with software cases. As Mr. Moglen sees it, these efforts underscore a certain level of desperation on the part of American companies and the economy of ideas on which they have come to rely. ''This is the postindustrial United States,'' he says. ''We will make other governments around the world go around enforcing rights primarily held by Americans. This is a very important part of American thinking around how the country will make its living in the 21st century.'' MICROSOFT'S pursuit of software counterfeiters begins in Dublin, at one of the company's 10 crime labs. Donal Keating, a physicist who leads Microsoft's forensics work, has turned the lab into an anti-piracy playpen full of microscopes and other equipment used to analyze software disks. Flat-screen monitors show data about counterfeit sales, and evidence bags almost overflow with nearly flawless Windows and Office fakes. Mr. Keating serves as the CD manufacturing whiz on what amounts to Microsoft's version of the A-Team, clad in business-casual attire. The undercover operative of this group is Peter Anaman, a lawyer who was born in Ghana and educated in England; he taught hand-to-hand combat to soldiers during a stint in the French army and then taught himself how to write software. Mr. Anaman has applied his software skills and training to explore a shift in piracy from groups that make CDs to those that offer downloads online. Through three online personas -- two female and one male -- Mr. Anaman chats with and sometimes befriends hackers in Russia and Eastern Europe who use stolen credit card numbers to set up hundreds of Web sites and offer products from Microsoft, Adobe and Symantec. ''It is part of gathering human intelligence and tracking relationships,'' Mr. Anaman says. Through an artificial intelligence system, Microsoft scans the Web for suspicious, popular links and then sends takedown requests to Web service providers, providing evidence of questionable activity. ''The Web sites look professional,'' he says. ''And some of them even offer customer support through call centers in India.'' The counterfeiters, however, have automated systems that replace links that Microsoft deep-sixes. So the company has turned up the dial on its link-removal machine. ''We used to remove 10,000 links a month,'' Mr. Anaman says. ''Now, we're removing 800,000 links a month.'' He describes the groups behind these sites as ''part of the dark Web,'' saying they have links to huge spam, virus and fraud networks. Microsoft's tests of software on some popular sites have shown that 35 percent of the counterfeit software contained harmful code. Anthony Delaney, who started at Microsoft 25 years ago -- driving a forklift to move boxes of its products for shipment -- has worked his way up to become its piracy data guru. On one of the flat screens, Mr. Delaney brings up a world map that lets users zoom into a city just as they would if hunting for directions online. But instead of highlighting landmarks and popular stores, the map illuminates Microsoft's retail partners. Hover a mouse over a shop in San Francisco, for example, and you can see how much software it sells, how often Office is sold in tandem with Windows, the failure rate for authentication codes and how many cease-and-desist letters have gone to suspicious sellers in the area. According to the map, the area within a 50-mile radius of New York City accounted for more than 200 ''actions'' last year, including 165 cease-and-desist warning letters to companies suspected of selling pirated software. ''We can see that only 5 percent of your sales have Office attached to Windows,'' Mr. Delaney says. ''If that's below the average for the area, we may go have a chat or conduct a test purchase.'' This rather eclectic bunch is joined by about 75 other people, including former agents of the I.R.S., F.B.I., Secret Service and Interpol, and former prosecutors -- all of whom work under Mr. Finn. A former assistant United States attorney in New York, Mr. Finn directs this squad from a Paris office. He says Microsoft spends ''north of $10 million'' a year on its intelligence-gathering operations and an estimated $200 million on developing anti-piracy technology. Mr. Finn talks at length about Microsoft's need to refine the industry's equivalent of fingerprinting, DNA testing and ballistics through CD and download forensics that can prove a software fake came from a particular factory or person. And his eyes widen as he thinks about advancing this technology to the point that Microsoft can emphasize the piracy issue directly to customers. ''Imagine the day when a consumer finds a link that says, 'Click here if you would like a forensic examination of your disk,' '' Mr. Finn says. ''You put the disk in, the computer reads it and suddenly you see a map of everywhere that counterfeit has been seen all over the world. If people see it in a graphic and visual way, I think they are more likely to help.'' THE software thieves monitored by Microsoft come in various shapes and sizes. College students, grandmothers and others have been found selling cheap, copied versions of software like Windows, Office, Adobe's Photoshop and Symantec's security software on eBay and other shopping Web sites. And people unwilling to pay for discounted software, meanwhile, can find free versions of popular products online that offer downloads to all manner of copyrighted material. Microsoft's investigators, however, spend much of their time examining how large-scale counterfeiters produce copies at factories and then distribute their wares around the globe. The biggest counterfeit software bust in history occurred in July 2007 in southern China. The Public Security Bureau there and the F.B.I. found a warehouse where workers assembled disks, authentication materials and manuals and prepared them for shipping. All told, investigators found $2 billion worth of counterfeit Microsoft software, including 19 versions of products in 11 languages. Software produced by this syndicate turned up in 36 countries on six continents. As one means of trying to tell the genuine article from a fake, Microsoft embeds about an inch of a special type of thread in each ''certificate of authenticity'' sticker found on boxes of software and computers. The investigators spotted dozens of spools of counterfeit thread -- 81 miles worth -- at the Chinese warehouse. Microsoft has found that operations of this scale tend to include all the trappings of legitimate businesses. Workers spend years building up contacts at software resellers around the globe, offering them discounted versions of software. Then they take the orders and send them off via shipping services, Mr. Keating says. Many Microsoft products make users enter an activation code to register the software and have it work properly. The syndicates trade in stolen versions of these codes as well, and sometimes set up their own online authentication systems to give people the feeling they have a legitimate product. Groups in Russia and Eastern Europe, with various cybercrime operations in play, now use money gained from credit card fraud schemes to buy activation codes. About a decade ago, only a few companies had the expertise or the $10 million needed to buy machines that could press CDs and DVDs. Today, someone can spend about $100,000 to buy second-hand pressing gear, says Patrick Corbett, the managing director at a CD plant owned by Arvato Digital Services, which produces Microsoft's retail software in Europe. ''Just five years ago, there were five sites in China that supplied the whole country,'' Mr. Corbett says. ''Now these machines are commonplace.'' A prized object in the factory is the stamper, the master copy of a software product that takes great precision to produce. From a single stamper, Arvato can make tens of thousands of copies on large, rapid-fire presses. Crucially for Mr. Keating, each press leaves distinct identifying markers on the disks. He spends much of his time running CDs through a glowing, briefcase-size machine -- and needs about six minutes to scan a disk and find patterns. Then he compares those markings against a database he has built of CD pressing machines worldwide. This system allows Microsoft to follow the spread of CDs from factories like the ones in China. The company conducts test purchases of software -- online and in stores -- and receives copies from some of the 300,000 people who have complained about running into counterfeits over the last four years. Microsoft keeps tight controls over its partners that produce CDs. But counterfeiters get around these measures by stealing stampers and presses, presenting factories with fake paperwork from Microsoft or printing in a factory when it isn't doing official business -- a practice known in the industry as producing ''cabbage.'' To make life harder for the counterfeiters, Microsoft plants messages in the security thread that goes into the authenticity stickers, plays tricks with lettering on its boxes and embosses a holographic film into a layer of lacquer on the CDs. To the untrained eye, the counterfeit software in Microsoft's labs appears to be exact replicas, right down to the boxes. Chinese counterfeiters mimic the built-in hologram simply by placing a holographic sticker across the entire surface of a CD; then they use other machines to erase some of the unique identifiers found at microscopic levels. Such tactics have pushed Microsoft to create a new type of digital fingerprinting technology that scans a disk's software code for special defects. The same techniques allow Microsoft to find malicious code that may have been injected in its products. THE grand question surrounding Microsoft's anti-piracy razzle-dazzle is whether it's worth the cost. The piracy problems tend to run highest in regions where there is less money to pay for Microsoft's products. Backers of free software like the Linux operating system take aim at these areas, and Microsoft also faces growing competition from Google, which gives away its Office rival to consumers and sells a business version at prices far below what Microsoft typically receives. ''We love Microsoft's heavy-handedness,'' says Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation, a nonprofit organization. ''We want 100 percent of the people using Windows to pay for it, because in those places where you have a lot of pirated use of Windows, we don't have any cost advantage.'' Microsoft's critics portray its behavior as reactionary, saying the company is trying to protect old business models as new devices and services arrive. ''If people are going to steal something, we sure as hell want them to steal our stuff,'' says Michael Simon, the chief executive of LogMeIn, a company whose software is used in smartphones and tablets. ''When you have a saturated market like Microsoft and have no growth in these devices, then it might be different.'' The anti-piracy tactics employed by Microsoft rub many people in the software industry the wrong way as well. The Business Software Alliance, which is financed in part by Microsoft and conducts audits and investigations on its behalf, spends about $50 million a year going after counterfeiters and offers rewards to people who report the use of pirated software in their companies. The alliance also finances the oft-cited annual study performed by the research firm IDC that comes up with a dollar amount tied to piracy losses. Robert J. Scott, a lawyer at Scott & Scott in Dallas, contends like many others that the alliance's figure is too high and that the group draws imprecise conclusions about the purchases that people would have made if they weren't pirating software. ''I don't put much stock in those reports,'' says Mr. Scott, who advises businesses being audited by the alliance and other software companies. The alliance defends its numbers, and Mr. Finn at Microsoft says the group's figures are accurate. He plays down the central accusation that Microsoft would face less of a piracy threat if it just lowered prices. ''We have seen no connection between piracy rates and price,'' he says, citing the company's own pricing experiments. ''I think it's a canard.'' Meanwhile, Microsoft-sponsored raids and customer audits sometimes have a public relations fallout. Two years ago in India, Microsoft hired Anup Kumar, a 10-year veteran of the Central Bureau of Investigation, in part to teach the company how to push software piracy cases through the local bureaucracy. When raids followed, many local software sellers chided the government in the local press, saying it bowed to Microsoft's will. And, last month, Microsoft altered its policies in Russia after a spate of incidents in which local security services seized computers of advocacy groups and opposition newspapers, using the pursuit of stolen software as justification. Microsoft said it would provide a blanket software license for advocacy groups and media outlets, and offer legal aid to such groups caught up in software inquiries. The protection of intellectual property has become a high-stakes political game where countries that do Microsoft's bidding expect some kind of return on their effort, according to Joseph Menn, author of ''Fatal System Error: The Hunt for the New Crime Lords Who Are Bringing Down the Internet.'' ''It's part of the geopolitical process,'' he said, ''and Microsoft has a level of clout that a lot of other folks don't in Washington and in other countries.'' Mr. Finn argues that Microsoft's anti-piracy efforts and training of law enforcement are a benefit to countries that want to build out their tech sectors and show they value intellectual property. ''Intellectual property is a critical engine of economic growth,'' Mr. Finn says. ''That's not just for large companies, but also for small businesses and entire countries. We work with governments that are realizing this is in their best interests.'' Miguel Helft contributed reporting.  "
The Hacker Who Went Into The Cold,"James Verini is a writer in New York. This is his first article for the magazine. One night in July 2003, a little before midnight, a plainclothes N.Y.P.D. detective, investigating a series of car thefts in upper Manhattan, followed a suspicious-looking young man with long, stringy hair and a nose ring into the A.T.M. lobby of a bank. Pretending to use one of the machines, the detective watched as the man pulled a debit card from his pocket and withdrew hundreds of dollars in cash. Then he pulled out another card and did the same thing. Then another, and another. The guy wasn't stealing cars, but the detective figured he was stealing something.  Indeed, the young man was in the act of ''cashing out,'' as he would later admit. He had programmed a stack of blank debit cards with stolen card numbers and was withdrawing as much cash as he could from each account. He was doing this just before 12 a.m., because that's when daily withdrawal limits end, and a ''casher'' can double his take with another withdrawal a few minutes later. To throw off anyone who might later look at surveillance footage, the young man was wearing a woman's wig and a costume-jewelry nose ring. The detective asked his name, and though the man went by many aliases on the Internet -- sometimes he was cumbajohny, sometimes segvec, but his favorite was soupnazi -- he politely told the truth. ''Albert Gonzalez,'' he said. After Gonzalez was arrested, word quickly made its way to the New Jersey U.S. attorney's office in Newark, which, along with agents from the Secret Service's Electronic Crimes Task Force, had been investigating credit- and debit-card fraud involving cashers in the area, without much luck. Gonzalez was debriefed and soon found to be a rare catch. Not only did he have data on millions of card accounts stored on the computer back in his New Jersey apartment, but he also had a knack for patiently explaining his expertise in online card fraud. As one former Secret Service agent told me, Gonzalez was extremely intelligent. ''He knew computers. He knew fraud. He was good.'' Gonzalez, law-enforcement officials would discover, was more than just a casher. He was a moderator and rising star on Shadowcrew.com, an archetypal criminal cyberbazaar that sprang up during the Internet-commerce boom in the early 2000s. Its users trafficked in databases of stolen card accounts and devices like magnetic strip-encoders and card-embossers; they posted tips on vulnerable banks and stores and effective e-mail scams. Created by a part-time student in Arizona and a former mortgage broker in New Jersey, Shadowcrew had hundreds of members across the United States, Europe and Asia. It was, as one federal prosecutor put it to me, ''an eBay, Monster.com and MySpace for cybercrime.'' After a couple of interviews, Gonzalez agreed to help the government so he could avoid prosecution. ''I was 22 years old and scared,'' he'd tell me later. ''When you have a Secret Service agent in your apartment telling you you'll go away for 20 years, you'll do anything.'' He was also good-natured and helpful. ''He was very respectable, very nice, very calm, very well spoken,'' says the Secret Service agent who would come to know Gonzalez best, Agent Michael (a nickname derived from his real name). ''In the beginning, he was quiet and reserved, but then he started opening up. He started to trust us.'' The agents won his trust in part by paying for his living expenses while they brought him to their side and by waiting for Gonzalez to work through his withdrawal. An intermittent drug addict, Gonzalez had been taking cocaine and modafinil, an antinarcoleptic, to keep awake during his long hours at the computer. To decompress, he liked Ecstasy and ketamine. At first, a different agent told me, ''he was extremely thin; he smoked a lot, his clothes were disheveled. Over time, he gained weight, started cutting his hair shorter and shaving every day. It was having a good effect on his health.'' The agent went on to say: ''He could be very disarming, if you let your guard down. I was well aware that I was dealing with a master of social engineering and deception. But I never got the impression he was trying to deceive us.'' Gonzalez's gift for deception, however, is precisely what made him one of the most valuable cybercrime informants the government has ever had. After his help enabled officials to indict more than a dozen members of Shadowcrew, Gonzalez's minders at the Secret Service urged him to move back to his hometown, Miami, for his own safety. (It was not hard for Shadowcrew users to figure out that the one significant figure among their ranks who hadn't been arrested was probably the unnamed informant in court documents.) After aiding another investigation, he became a paid informant in the Secret Service field office in Miami in early 2006. Agent Michael was transferred to Miami, and he worked with Gonzalez on a series of investigations on which Gonzalez did such a good job that the agency asked him to speak at seminars and conferences. ''I shook the hand of the head of the Secret Service,'' Gonzalez told me. ''I gave a presentation to him.'' As far as the agency knew, that's all he was doing. ''It seemed he was trying to do the right thing,'' Agent Michael said. He wasn't. Over the course of several years, during much of which he worked for the government, Gonzalez and his crew of hackers and other affiliates gained access to roughly 180 million payment-card accounts from the customer databases of some of the most well known corporations in America: OfficeMax, BJ's Wholesale Club, Dave & Buster's restaurants, the T. J. Maxx and Marshalls clothing chains. They hacked into Target, Barnes & Noble, JCPenney, Sports Authority, Boston Market and 7-Eleven's bank-machine network. In the words of the chief prosecutor in Gonzalez's case, ''The sheer extent of the human victimization caused by Gonzalez and his organization is unparalleled.'' At his sentencing hearing in March, where he received two concurrent 20-year terms, the longest sentence ever handed down to an American for computer crimes, the judge said, ''What I found most devastating was the fact that you two-timed the government agency that you were cooperating with, and you were essentially like a double agent.'' IN APRIL, I visited Gonzalez at the Wyatt Detention Center in Central Falls, R.I., situated by a river and a pleasant place as jails go. Once muscular and tan, Gonzalez, who turned 27 and 28 behind bars, was pallid and thin. His khaki uniform hung on him baggily, and his eyes were bloodshot behind wire-rim glasses. Occasionally a mischievous smile played on his face; otherwise, he looked through the wire-glass partition with a sympathetic but inscrutably intense stare. He didn't want to talk about his crimes at first, so in a soft voice he told me about his ex-girlfriend, who had stopped visiting him (''I can't blame her''), about what he'd been reading (''Stalingrad,'' by Antony Beevor; ''Into Thin Air,'' by Jon Krakauer; essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson), about his thoughts on recent high-profile computer breaches in the news. The public's ignorance about his chosen criminal field baffled him. He had become a fan of National Public Radio at Wyatt, and had recently listened to a discussion of hackers on ''Fresh Air.'' (''Terry Gross is a great host,'' he wrote me earlier in a letter, but ''these authors and co-authors can't possibly be making decent earnings. Are they?'') He talked about his childhood and family. His father, Alberto Sr., is a landscaper who as a young man left Cuba on a raft and was picked up by a Coast Guard cutter in the Florida straits. He and Albert share a birthday with Gonzalez's 5-year-old nephew, ''whom I love more than anyone in this world,'' Gonzalez said. His nephew's mother, Maria, Gonzalez's sister and only sibling, ''always learned by listening to our parents' advice.'' He didn't. Gonzalez bought his first PC, with his own money, when he was 12. He took an interest in computer security after it was infected with a downloaded virus. ''We had to call the technician who sold it to us, and he came over,'' he said in one letter. ''I had all these questions for him: 'How do I defend myself from this? Why would someone do this?' '' He got over his indignation easily enough, and by the time he was 14 had hacked into NASA, which resulted in a visit by F.B.I. agents to his South Miami high school. Undeterred, Gonzalez formed a cooperative of ''black hats'' -- curiosity-driven hackers with an antiauthoritarian bent -- and acquired a reputation. He gave an interview to the online magazine ZDNet under his new screen name, soupnazi: ''Defacing a site to me is showing the admins [and] government . . . that go to the site that we own them,'' he said. On the side he was also purchasing clothing and CDs online with stolen credit-card numbers. He ordered the merchandise delivered to empty houses in Miami, and then had a friend drive him to pick it up during lunch period. By the time he dropped out of Miami Dade College during his freshman year, Gonzalez had taught himself, by reading software manuals, how to hack into Internet service providers for free broadband. He discovered he could go further than that and co-opted the log-ins and passwords of managers and executives. ''On their computers would always be a huge stash of good information, network diagrams, write ups,'' he said, audibly enthralled at the memory. ''I would learn about the system architecture. It was as if I was an employee.'' Gonzalez's closest friend, Stephen Watt, who is now serving a two-year prison sentence for coding a software program that helped Gonzalez steal card data, describes Gonzalez as having ''a Sherlock Holmes quality to him that is bounded only by his formal education.'' Like the other hackers who would go on to form the inner circle of Gonzalez's criminal organization, Watt met Gonzalez when both were teenagers, on EFnet, an Internet relay chat network frequented by black hats. Watt and Gonzalez interacted strictly online for a year, though each lived in South Florida. Once they began spending time together, in Florida and New York, Watt, who is 27, noticed that Gonzalez's talents as an online criminal carried over into his life away from the computer. ''He could spot wedding rings at 50 yards. He could spot a Patek Philippe at 50 yards. He would have been a world-class interrogator. He was very good at figuring out when people were lying.'' Like many hackers, Gonzalez moved easily between the licit and illicit sides of computer security. Before his first arrest, in the A.T.M. lobby, Gonzalez made his way from Miami to the Northeast after he hacked into a New Jersey-based Internet company and then persuaded it to hire him to its security team. The transition from fraudster to informant was not too different. After he agreed in 2003 to become an informant, Gonzalez helped the Justice Department and the Secret Service build, over the course of a year, an ingenious trap for Shadowcrew. Called Operation Firewall, it was run out of a makeshift office in an Army repair garage in Jersey City. Gonzalez was its linchpin. Through him, the government came to, in hacker lingo, own Shadowcrew, as undercover buyers infiltrated the network and traced its users around the world; eventually, officials even managed to transfer the site onto a server controlled by the Secret Service. Meanwhile, Gonzalez patiently worked his way up the Shadowcrew ranks. He persuaded its users to communicate through a virtual private network, or VPN, a secure channel that sends encrypted messages between computers, that he introduced onto the site. This VPN, designed by the Secret Service, came with a special feature: a court-ordered wiretap. Gonzalez worked alongside the agents, sometimes all day and into the night, for months on end. Most called him Albert. A couple of them who especially liked him called him Soup, after his old screen-name soupnazi. ''Spending this much time with an informant this deeply into a cybercrime conspiracy -- it was a totally new experience for all of us,'' one Justice Department prosecutor says. ''It was kind of a bonding experience. He and the agents developed over time a very close bond. They worked well together.'' On Oct. 26, 2004, Gonzalez was taken to Washington and installed in the Operation Firewall command center at Secret Service headquarters. He corralled the Shadowcrew targets into a chat session. At 9 p.m., agents began knocking down doors. By midnight, 28 people across eight states and six countries had been arrested, most of them mere feet from their computers. Nineteen were eventually indicted. It was by some estimates the most successful cybercrime case the government had ever carried out. ''I did find the investigation exciting,'' Gonzalez told me of turning against Shadowcrew. ''The intellectual element. Unmasking them, figuring out their identities. Looking back, it was kind of easy, though. When someone trusts you, they let their guard down.'' He did say, however, that he ''actually had a bad conscience'' about it. ''I had a moral dilemma, unlike most informants.'' On another occasion, when he was discussing the same subject, Gonzalez wrote to me in a letter, ''This distinction is very important . . . my loyalty has always been to the black-hat community.'' Those captured by the government with his help are less interested in this distinction. ''Shadowcrew was not a forum of thugs,'' a member who occasionally laundered money for Gonzalez told me. This casher served two years in prison thanks to Operation Firewall. ''He was a coward who betrayed us all, and I suppose if you believe in karma, he got what he deserved in the end.'' Before being arrested, Gonzalez had actually vouched for this casher to the higher-ups at Shadowcrew. He had gone out of his way to help many members, according to the federal prosecutor in New Jersey, Scott Christie, who worked with him on Operation Firewall. Christie says that based on their exchanges when Gonzalez was being recruited as an informant, Gonzalez seemed to be ''less interested in money than in building up Shadowcrew.'' He ''gave back to the members in the way of education and personal benefit. Unlike other cybercriminals, he wasn't just out for gain.'' Indeed, no one I spoke with compared him to a gangster or a mercenary -- preferred honorifics among hackers -- but several likened him to a brilliant executive. ''In the U.S., we have two kinds of powerful, successful business leaders. We have people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, who are the most sophisticated of electronic technicians and programmers,'' says Steve Heymann, the Massachusetts assistant U.S. attorney who, in the spring of 2010, secured a combined 38 years of prison time for Gonzalez and his co-conspirators for their corporate breaches. ''Then we have others, like the C.E.O.'s of AT&T or General Electric, who are extremely good in their area but also know when to go to others for expertise and how to build powerful organizations by using those others. Gonzalez fits into that second category.'' BY THE TIME Gonzalez returned to Miami after Operation Firewall, in late 2004, he was already exploring the vulnerability of corporate wireless networks. Just as data security had been an afterthought for many businesses in their rush to get online in the 1990s, creating opportunities for the likes of Shadowcrew, many firms had taken no precautions as they eagerly adopted WiFi in the early 2000s. Gonzalez was especially intrigued by the possibilities of a technique known as ''war driving'': hackers would sit in cars or vans in the parking lots of big-box stores with laptops and high-power radio antennae and burrow through companies' vulnerable WiFi networks. Adepts could get into a billion-dollar multinational's servers in minutes. Gonzalez reconnected with an old friend from EFnet, Christopher Scott, who was willing to do grunt work. Scott began cruising the commercial stretches of Route 1 in Miami, looking for war-driving targets. His experiments at BJ's Wholesale Club and DSW met with success. He stole about 400,000 card accounts from the former, a million from the latter. He described the breaches and passed card numbers to Gonzalez. The following summer, Scott parked outside a pair of Marshalls stores. He enlisted the help of Jonathan James, a minor celebrity among Miami black hats for being the first American juvenile ever incarcerated for computer crimes. (At 15, he hacked into the Department of Defense; he lived under house arrest for six months.) Scott cracked the Marshalls WiFi network, and he and James started navigating the system: they co-opted log-ins and passwords and got Gonzalez into the network; they made their way into the corporate servers at the Framingham, Mass., headquarters of Marshalls' parent company, TJX; they located the servers that housed old card transactions from stores. Scott set up a VPN -- the system Gonzalez and the Secret Service used to ensnare Shadowcrew -- so they could move in and out of TJX and install software without detection. When Gonzalez found that so many of the card numbers they were getting were expired, he had Stephen Watt develop a ''sniffer'' program to seek out, capture and store recent transactions. Once the collection of data reached a certain size, the program was designed to automatically close, then encrypt, compress and forward the card data to Gonzalez's computer, just as you might send someone an e-mail with a zip file attached. Steadily, patiently, they siphoned the material from the TJX servers. ''The experienced ones take their time and slowly bleed the data out,'' a Secret Service analyst says. By the end of 2006, Gonzalez, Scott and James had information linked to more than 40 million cards. It wasn't a novel caper, but they executed it better than anyone else had. Using similar methods, they hacked into OfficeMax, Barnes & Noble, Target, Sports Authority and Boston Market, and probably many other companies that never detected a breach or notified the authorities. Scott bought a six-foot-tall radio antenna, and he and James rented hotel rooms near stores for the tougher jobs. In many cases, the data were simply there for the taking, unencrypted, unprotected. ''For a long time, probably too long a time, computer security was something that was just dollars and cents off the bottom line -- it doesn't bring in money,'' Heymann told me when I asked why war-driving hackers were able to steal data so easily. ''At the same time, in these cases, companies were beginning to warehouse vast amounts of information'' far more swiftly than they were coming to understand the vulnerabilities of their systems. A result was what he called ''a primeval muck that creates a period when dramatic, costly attacks can get at vast amounts of resources.'' At the same time that Gonzalez was stealing all this bank-card data, he was assembling an international syndicate. His favored fence was a Ukrainian, Maksym Yastremskiy, who would sell sets of card numbers to buyers across the Americas, Europe and Asia and split the proceeds with him. Gonzalez hired another EFnet friend, Jonathan Williams, to cash out at A.T.M.'s across the country, and a friend of Watt's in New York would pick up the shipments of cash in bulk sent by Williams and Yastremskiy. Watt's friend would then wire the money to Miami or send it to a post-office box there set up by James through a proxy. Gonzalez established dummy companies in Europe, and to collect payment and launder money he opened e-gold and WebMoney accounts, which were not strictly regulated (e-gold has since gone out of business). He also rented servers in Latvia, Ukraine, the Netherlands and elsewhere to store the card data and the software he was using for the breaches. Finally, he joined up with two Eastern European hackers who were onto something visionary. Known to him only by their screen names, Annex and Grig, they were colluding to break into American card-payment processors -- the very cash arteries of the retail economy. ''I've been asking myself, why did I do it?'' Gonzalez told me over the phone from prison recently. ''At first I did it for monetary reasons. The service's salary wasn't enough, and I needed the money. By then I'd already created the snowball and had to keep doing it. I wanted to quit but couldn't.'' He claims his intentions were partly admirable. He genuinely wanted to help out Patrick Toey, a close friend and hacker who would later do much of the more sophisticated legwork involved in Gonzalez's hacking into corporate networks. Unlike Gonzalez and Watt, Toey, who is 25, had a rough upbringing. After dropping out of high school, he supported his mother and his younger brother and sister by hacking. Gonzalez invited Toey to live in his condominium in Miami, rent-free. Gonzalez owned it, but he enjoyed living at home with his parents more. He says he loved his mother's cooking and playing with his nephew, and he could more easily launder money through his parents' home-equity line of credit that way. Gonzalez relished the intellectual challenges of cybercrime too. He is not a gifted programmer -- according to Watt and Toey, in fact, he can barely write simple code -- but by all accounts he can understand systems and fillet them with singular grace. I often got the impression that this was computer crime's main appeal for Gonzalez. But he also liked stealing. ''Whatever morality I should have been feeling was trumped by the thrill,'' he told me. And he liked spending. Partly but not entirely in jest, he took to referring to his scheme as Operation Get Rich or Die Tryin', after the 50 Cent album and movie. Gonzalez would not discuss with me just how rich he got, but he certainly was seeing profits in the millions of dollars. Little of that found its way to Toey, however, and probably none to Watt. For himself, Gonzalez bought, in addition to the condo, a new BMW 330i. He often stayed in luxury hotel suites in Miami on a whim. He took frequent trips to New York, where he and Watt -- who worked by day in the I.T. department of Morgan Stanley and later developed securities-trading software and moonlighted as a nightclub promoter -- spent thousands on hotels, restaurants, clubs and drugs. Lots of drugs. ''I don't know when he slept,'' Agent Michael says, referring to Gonzalez's lifestyle during the time they worked together. It seems clear now that Gonzalez didn't mind betraying people. What would come to anger the Secret Service most is that he used information from their investigations to enrich himself. ''He would be working for the service during the day, and then come home and talk to me, and I'd be selling dumps for him,'' Toey told me, referring to databases of stolen card information. Gonzalez sold dumps to hackers who he knew were under investigation, in effect setting them up. In the case of one Miami suspect being investigated by the service, Toey told me: ''We basically ripped [him] off and sold him databases that were all dead and expired. They came from a company where a breach was being investigated by the service. He got caught with the database, and it looked like he'd done it.'' Toey and Gonzalez then split the profits. (Gonzalez confirmed this account of events.) When I asked Toey how he felt about using information from government investigations to betray other hackers, including black hats, he said: ''I didn't like it at all that he did it. But at the same time, I don't know any of those people.'' He added, ''More money for us.'' Agent Michael investigated the Miami suspect, but he did not know until I told him that Gonzalez had set the man up. ''It doesn't surprise me,'' he said. ''Looking back, we knew what he wanted us to know. . . . He was leading a double life within a double life.'' BY THE SPRING of 2007, Gonzalez was tired of working for the Secret Service. ''He wasn't showing up on time,'' according to Agent Michael, who began talking with other agents about cutting Gonzalez loose. ''He didn't want to be there.'' He was also tired of war driving. He wanted a new challenge. He found one in a promising technique called SQL injection. SQL (usually pronounced ''sequel'') stands for Structured Query Language, the programming language that enables most commercial Web sites to interact with their associated databases. When you log on to the Web site of a clothing store to buy a sweater, for example, the site sends your commands in SQL back to the databases where the images and descriptions of clothing are stored. The requested information is returned in SQL, and then translated into words, so you can find the sweater you want. But there is a vulnerability here: such databases in a company's servers often exist in proximity to other all-too-accessible databases with more sensitive information -- like your credit-card number. SQL is the lingua franca of online commerce. A hacker who learns to manipulate it can penetrate a company with frightening dependability. And he doesn't need to be anywhere near a store or a company's headquarters to do so. Since SQL injections go through a Web site, they can be done from anywhere. Gonzalez urged Watt and Toey to experiment with SQL. Watt wasn't interested. ''I had objections to what he was doing on a moral level -- and on top of that, I took an intellectual exception,'' Watt says. ''If Albert said we were going to go after the Church of Scientology or Blackwater, I would have dove in headfirst.'' Toey, however, said he felt he owed Gonzalez. He began poking around on the sites of businesses that seemed vulnerable -- or for which he had a philosophical distaste. ''I just didn't like what they did,'' he said of the clothing chain Forever 21. The clothes were poorly made, he said, and the employees poorly paid. ''It's just everything I hate about this country in one store.'' Under the assault of Toey's expertise and contempt, Forever 21 didn't stand a chance. ''I went to their Web site, and I looked at their shopping-cart software, and within five minutes, I found a problem,'' he said, with his customary concision. ''Within 10 minutes we were on their computers and were able to execute commands freely. From there we leveraged access until we were the domain administrators. Then I passed it over to Albert.'' What came next was the truly inspired step. Gonzalez focused on TJX in part because it stored old transactions, but he found that many of the cards were expired. He needed a way to get to cards right after customers used them. It was possible, he learned, to breach the point-of-sale terminals at stores, the machines on checkout counters through which you swipe your card at the supermarket, the gas station, the department store -- just about anywhere you buy something. Gonzalez and Toey took reconnaissance trips to stores around Miami to look at the brands and makes of their terminals. He downloaded schematics and software manuals. Earlier, Jonathan Williams visited an OfficeMax near Los Angeles, loosened a terminal at a checkout counter and walked out of the store with it. Hackers working with an Estonian contact of Gonzalez's hacked into the Maryland-based Micros Systems, the largest maker of point-of-sale systems, and stole software and a list of employee log-ins and passwords, which they sent to Gonzalez. Now once Toey got him into a system, Gonzalez no longer had to sift through databases for the valuable stuff. Instead, he could go straight to the servers that processed the cards coming from the terminals, in the milliseconds before that information was sent to banks for approval. He tried this on JCPenney, the clothing chain Wet Seal and the Hannaford Brothers grocery chain, in the last instance compromising more than four million cards. His Estonian contact used the technique on Dave & Buster's. ''Every time a card was swiped, it would be logged into our file,'' Toey says. ''There was nothing anyone could do about it.'' When they pieced together how Gonzalez organized these heists later, federal prosecutors had to admire his ingenuity. ''It's like driving to the building next to the bank to tunnel into the bank,'' Seth Kosto, an assistant U.S. attorney in New Jersey who worked on the case, told me. When I asked how Gonzalez rated among criminal hackers, he replied: ''As a leader? Unparalleled. Unparalleled in his ability to coordinate contacts and continents and expertise. Unparalleled in that he didn't just get a hack done -- he got a hack done, he got the exfiltration of the data done, he got the laundering of the funds done. He was a five-tool player.'' Gonzalez and Toey were returning from a trip to Toys ''R'' Us to check out its terminals one afternoon in the spring of 2008 when a sports car with tinted windows pulled up behind them at a red light. Gonzalez became suspicious and turned into a bus lane. The sports car followed. When the light turned green, Gonzalez didn't move. The car didn't move. After waiting for minutes, in a static game of chicken, car horns blaring, Gonzalez suddenly accelerated into oncoming traffic before doing a U-turn and turning into an alley. The pursuing car flew by, Gonzalez pulled out behind him, sped up alongside the car and peered inside. Gonzalez and Toey made out a police light on the dashboard. It was a surveillance car. Gonzalez had by that point stopped working as an informant, according to the service. Instructions had come down to the Miami field office to start tailing him. Maybe the most valuable cybercrime informant it had ever employed, the key to Operation Firewall, was now being investigated. And the Secret Service wasn't alone: the F.B.I. was looking into a wireless intrusion at Target's headquarters that originated at one of its Miami stores. The store, the bureau discovered, was in the line of sight of Gonzalez's condo, in ideal range for a war-driving antenna. But Gonzalez wasn't worried. He was certain he'd covered all his tracks. KIM PERETTI KNOWS Gonzalez as well as almost anyone in the government. She has worked with him. She has also prosecuted him -- though Peretti does not come across as a federal prosecutor. Younger in appearance than her 40 years, she grew up in Wisconsin and is girlish, even bubbly, in person, apt to express frustration with phrases like ''Oh, sugar!'' Peretti was hired to the Justice Department's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section shortly after 9/11. Peretti made a point of getting to know the agents in the Secret Service's Electronic Crimes Task Force because she knew that they were, like her, eager to make a name in going after cybercriminals. She lobbied to be assigned to Operation Firewall, and in 2003 she was. When I met Peretti at a restaurant near her new office in McLean, Va. -- she left the government in May to take a job at PriceWaterhouseCoopers -- she was wearing a blue skirt suit and designer glasses. ''She's got the whole Sarah Palin eyewear thing going on,'' Gonzalez had written to me in a letter, by way of explaining that it wasn't at all unpleasant being investigated by her. But their relationship goes back further than that. Much of what Peretti knows about cybercrime she learned from working with Gonzalez. ''Albert was an educator,'' she said, describing their experience on Operation Firewall. ''We in law enforcement had never encountered anything like'' him. ''We had to learn the language, we had to learn the characters, their goals, their techniques. Albert taught us all of that.'' They worked as well together as any investigative team she has been a part of, she said. When we met, Peretti brought with her a poster-size screen shot of Shadowcrew's homepage as it appeared the day after the raids. Secret Service technicians had defaced it with a photograph of a shirtless, tattooed tough slouching in a jail cell. The text said, ''Contact your local United States Secret Service field office . . . before we contact you!'' By the time she was 35, thanks to Operation Firewall and Gonzalez, Peretti was the Justice Department's chief prosecutor of cybercrime in Washington. But in 2005, even as she was litigating the Shadowcrew case, she encountered a new cybercrime wave unlike anything that had come before. ''The service keeps calling me, saying, 'We've got another company that contacted us,' '' she said. ''The volume was getting bigger and bigger. There was just an explosion.'' In the days before Christmas 2006, the Justice Department and Stephen Heymann, the assistant U.S. attorney in Massachusetts, received a series of frantic calls from TJX's attorneys. The company had been contacted by a credit-card company, because a rapidly growing number of cards used at Marshalls and T. J. Maxx stores seemed to have been stolen. TJX had examined its Framingham, Mass., servers, and what it found was catastrophic. According to its own account, for about a year and a half, cards for ''somewhere between approximately half to substantially all of the transactions at U.S., Puerto Rican and Canadian stores'' were believed stolen. It was the biggest theft of card data in U.S. history, and there wasn't a lead in sight. ''At that point we had quite literally the entire world as possible suspects,'' Heymann told me in May, when we met in his office in the federal court building overlooking Boston Harbor. With his father, Philip, a deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration, Heymann teaches courses on criminal law at Harvard Law School. He had been deputy chief of the Massachusetts U.S. attorney's criminal division and then set up one of the first computer-crime units in the country, so he was well versed in the comparative challenges. ''If you've got a murder scene, there's blood, there's fingerprints. If you have a hacker going into a company, the critical information can be lost the moment the connection is broken. The size of the networks might be so large and so confusing that they're very hard to understand and search. The people involved may only be known by screen names. Figuring that out is very different from figuring out who Tony the Squirrel is,'' he said. Heymann had never seen anything like the TJX breach. Then, in 2007, attorneys for Dave & Buster's called the Secret Service. That company, too, had been breached, but this was different. The thieves had managed to access its point-of-sale system. By that summer, Peretti and Heymann had huge amounts of data, lots of potential leads and no clue as to whom they were chasing. ''For the first six to nine months, it was tiring, exhaustive, thorough,'' Heymann told me. ''I'd like to tell you it was also brilliant and incisive and led to the key lead, but it wasn't.'' They were in desperate need of a break. They finally got one, courtesy of Peretti's old friends at the Secret Service. For two years, it turned out, an undercover agent in its San Diego office had been buying card dumps from Maksym Yastremskiy, Gonzalez's fence. The agent traveled to Thailand and Dubai to meet with the Ukrainian, and in Dubai he furtively copied the hard drive in Yastremskiy's laptop. Technicians at the Secret Service combed through it and discovered, to their joy, that Yastremskiy was a meticulous record keeper. He had saved and catalogued all of his customer lists and instant messages for years. In the logs, they found a chat partner who appeared to be Yastremskiy's biggest provider of stolen card data. But all they had for the person was an I.M. registration number -- no personal information. In July 2007, Yastremskiy was arrested in a nightclub in Turkey, and the Secret Service turned up a useful lead. The anonymous provider had asked Yastremskiy to arrange a fake passport. One of the provider's cashers had been arrested, and he wanted to get his man out of the United States. The only problem: he didn't say where the casher had been arrested. So agents phoned every police station and district attorney's office around the country that had made a similar arrest or brought a similar case. After weeks of these calls, their search led them to a prison cell in North Carolina, where Jonathan Williams was being held. He had been arrested with $200,000 in cash -- much of which had been intended for Gonzalez -- and 80 blank debit cards; the local authorities hadn't linked him to a larger criminal group, and they couldn't have known about Gonzalez. The Secret Service agents plugged in a thumb drive in Williams's possession at the time of his arrest and found a file that contained a photograph of Gonzalez, a credit report on him and the address of Gonzalez's sister, Maria, in Miami. (He was also arrested with a Glock 9-millimeter pistol and two barrels for the gun, one threaded to fit a silencer.) The file was ''a safety precaution, in case [Gonzalez] tried to inform on me,'' Williams told me from prison in June. Officials then traced packages Williams had sent to the post-office box in Miami. This led the Secret Service to Jonathan James. They pulled James's police records and found that in 2005 he was arrested by a Palmetto Bay, Fla., police officer who found him in the parking lot of a retail store in the middle of the night. The officer didn't know why James and his companion, a man named Christopher Scott, were sitting in a car with laptops and a giant radio antenna, but she suspected they weren't playing World of Warcraft. The real eureka moment came when Secret Service technicians finally got the I.M. registration information for whoever was providing Yastremskiy with bank-card data. There was no address or name, but there was an e-mail address: soupnazi@efnet.ru It was a dead giveaway to anyone who knew Gonzalez. Peretti remembers vividly the afternoon in December 2007 when agents called her and told her to come to their office. They sat her down and showed her the e-mail address. ''And they looked at me,'' Peretti said. ''They've got 10 agents looking at me. Three minutes passed by, I was sitting there like a dull person. And then I was like, 'Oh, my God!' '' Gonzalez knew the Secret Service was investigating Yastremskiy, but he continued to move databases through him. When I asked Gonzalez why, he said, ''I never thought he would leave Ukraine.'' The country has no extradition policy with the U.S. But Yastremskiy did leave. ''It wasn't until he got busted,'' Gonzalez told me, that he realized his mistake. Operation Get Rich or Die Tryin' unraveled fast. Christopher Scott's home and Gonzalez's condo were raided simultaneously. Agents seized Scott, along with nine computers and 78 marijuana plants; in Gonzalez's place they found various designer drugs and a half-asleep Patrick Toey. Toey was flown to Boston to testify before a grand jury. He directed Heymann and Peretti to the e-gold and WebMoney accounts and to servers located abroad. The servers eventually led them to Watt, who returned to his Greenwich Village apartment to find agents and a battering ram awaiting him. The Gonzalezes' home was raided, but Albert was not there. Peretti knew that if they didn't find him soon, he would disappear. ''Albert had said during Firewall how afraid he was of spending any time in prison,'' she said. ''I knew he'd be gone the next day.'' They found him at 7 in the morning on May 7, 2008, when agents rushed into his suite at the National Hotel in Miami Beach. With him were a Croatian woman, two laptops and $22,000. Over time, he started talking. Months later, he led Secret Service agents to a barrel containing $1.2 million buried in his parents' backyard. Attorney General Michael Mukasey himself held a news conference in August 2008 to announce the indictment. ''So far as we know, this is the single largest and most complex identity-theft case ever charged in this country,'' he told reporters. Gonzalez's attorney assured him the government's case was weak. Electronic evidence often didn't hold up, he said. That was before attorneys for Heartland Payment Systems Inc., in Princeton, N.J., called Peretti in early January 2009. One of the largest card-payment processors in the country, Heartland, which services about a quarter of a million businesses, had been hacked. But not just hacked -- owned in a way no company had ever been owned. As Peretti would soon learn from Gonzalez, he had helped the two Eastern European hackers, Annex and Grig, slip into Heartland via SQL injection. By the time Heartland realized something was wrong, the heist was too immense to be believed: data from 130 million transactions had been exposed. Indictments were brought against Gonzalez in New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts (where the cases were eventually consolidated). At a loss for anything else to say, Gonzalez's attorney told a reporter: ''He's really not a bad guy. He just got way in over his head.'' On May 18, 2008, Jonathan James shot himself in the head. He left a suicide note saying he was convinced the government would try to pin Gonzalez's crimes on him because of the notoriety James had gained as a teenage hacker. AT HIS SENTENCING in March, Gonzalez, who pleaded guilty to all charges, sat almost motionless. As far as I saw, he didn't once look back at the gallery in the federal courtroom in Boston, where his mother sat stoically while his father wept into a handkerchief as Gonzalez's sister consoled him. Nor did he glance at Heymann, as he told the court that Gonzalez had committed the worst computer crimes ever prosecuted; nor at Peretti, nor his old colleagues from the Secret Service, who also sat in the gallery. Gonzalez just leaned forward and peered straight ahead at the judge, as though -- the set of his head was unmistakable -- staring intensely at a computer. He spoke just once, a few sentences at the end. ''I blame nobody but myself,'' he said. ''I'm guilty of not only exploiting computer networks but exploiting personal relationships, particularly one that I had with a certain government agency who believed in me. This agency not only believed in me but gave me a second start in life, and I completely threw that away.'' Accounting for time served and good behavior, Gonzalez is expected to get out of prison in 2025. In May, Toey began a five-year sentence, and Scott started a seven-year sentence. Yastremskiy was given 30 years in a Turkish prison, a fate apparently so grim he's lobbying to be extradited to the U.S. so he can be imprisoned here. Watt, who maintains that he was never fully aware of what Gonzalez wanted to use his software for, and who refused to give information on Gonzalez to the grand jury or prosecutors, was sentenced to two years. According to Attorney General Eric Holder, who last month presented an award to Peretti and the prosecutors and Secret Service agents who brought Gonzalez down, Gonzalez cost TJX, Heartland and the other victimized companies more than $400 million in reimbursements and forensic and legal fees. At last count, at least 500 banks were affected by the Heartland breach. But the extent of the damage is unknown. ''The majority of the stuff I hacked was never brought into public light,'' Toey told me. One of the imprisoned hackers told me there ''were major chains and big hacks that would dwarf TJX. I'm just waiting for them to indict us for the rest of them.'' Online fraud is still rampant in the United States, but statistics show a major drop in 2009 from previous years, when Gonzalez was active. The company line at the Justice Department and the Secret Service is that informants go bad all the time, and that there was nothing special about Gonzalez's case. As Peretti put it, ''You certainly feel anger'' -- but ''you're not doing your job if you fall into the trap of thinking the criminal you're working with is your best friend.'' The agent in charge of the Criminal Investigative Division at the Secret Service told me: ''It's unfortunate. We try to take measures. But it does happen. You need to deal with criminals to get other criminals. Albert was a criminal.'' Heymann lauds how the Secret Service handled things. ''When you find out one of your informants has committed a crime,'' he said, ''you can hide the fact, which unfortunately does happen from time to time. You can play it down -- soft-pedal it, try to make it go away. Or you can do what I think the Secret Service very impressively did here, which is to go full bore.'' He said that after Gonzalez became a suspect, ''the size of the investigation, the amount of assets, all increased significantly. That reflects enormous integrity.'' But Gonzalez did have friends in the government, and there is no question some of them feel deeply betrayed. Agent Michael was the most candid with me about this: ''I put a lot of time and effort into trying to keep him on the straight and narrow and show him what his worth could be outside of that world, keep him part of the team. And he knows that, and he knew what good he could have done with his talent.'' He continued, ''We work with a million informants, but for me it was really tough with him.'' After his sentencing, Gonzalez was transferred from Wyatt to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn (before ultimately ending up in a prison in Michigan). Situated between a loud stretch of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and Gowanus Bay, M.D.C. is brutal, even for a prison. Populated by hardened offenders, it is among the last places a nonviolent government informant would want to be. ''The place is terrible,'' Agent Michael said. ''But you know what? When you burn both ends of the candle, that's what you get.'' Even Gonzalez was impressed by the government's indifference to his comfort. He says he always knew it would stick it to him somehow, ''but I never thought it would be this badly.'' ''I've been asking myself a lot why didn't I ever feel this way while I was doing it,'' Gonzalez told me, when I spoke with him in June. An inmate at M.D.C. who didn't like informants had recently threatened to kill him, he said. It was his 29th birthday, and the 5th birthday of his nephew. Gonzalez's sister wanted to bring her son to New York to visit, but Gonzalez told her not to. ''I didn't want him to get scared, seeing me in here,'' he told me. Instead, Gonzalez was spending the day reading a biography of Warren Buffett. I asked him how he felt when he thought about people like Agent Michael and Peretti. ''They're part of the betrayals,'' he said. During the legal proceedings, the court ordered Gonzalez to undergo a psychological evaluation. ''He identified with his computer,'' the report reads. ''It is hard, if not impossible, even at the present for Mr. Gonzalez to conceptualize human growth, development and evolution, other than in the language of building a machine.'' As we spoke, Gonzalez recalled how he first became obsessed with computers as a child. ''I remember so many times having arguments with my mother when she'd try to take the computer power cord from me, or she'd find me up at 6 a.m. on the computer when I had to be at school at 7:30. Or when I'd be out with [my girlfriend] and not paying any attention to her because I'd be thinking about what I could do online.'' He reflected on his days with Shadowcrew, and on his decision to help the government. ''I should have just done my time in 2003,'' he said. ''I should have manned up and did it. I would be getting out about now.''  "
U.S. Shuts Web Sites in Its Battle to Stop Online Piracy,"In what appears to be the latest phase of a far-reaching federal crackdown on online piracy of music and movies, the Web addresses of a number of sites that facilitate illegal file-sharing were seized this week by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a division of the Department of Homeland Security. By Friday morning, visiting the addresses of a handful of sites that either hosted unauthorized copies of films and music or allowed users to search for them elsewhere on the Internet produced a notice that said, in part: ''This domain name has been seized by ICE -- Homeland Security Investigations, pursuant to a seizure warrant issued by a United States District Court.''  In taking over the sites' domain names, or Web addresses, the government effectively redirected any visitors to its own takedown notice. ''ICE office of Homeland Security Investigations executed court-ordered seizure warrants against a number of domain names,'' said Cori W. Bassett, a spokeswoman for ICE, in a statement. ''As this is an ongoing investigation, there are no additional details available at this time.'' Among the domains seized were torrent-finder.com and those of three sites that specialized in music: onsmash.com, rapgodfathers.com and dajaz1.com. TorrentFreak, a news blog about BitTorrent -- a file-sharing system that has tended to elude the authorities because it is decentralized -- said that at least 70 other addresses had been seized, most belonging to sites related to counterfeit clothing, DVDs and other goods. On Friday, torrent users were already discussing new sites that had popped up to serve them. The takedown notices are similar to those that went up on nine sites in June as part of an initiative against Internet counterfeiting and piracy that the agency called Operation in Our Sites. In announcing that operation, John T. Morton, the assistant secretary of ICE, and representatives of the Motion Picture Association of America called it a long-term effort against online piracy, and said that suspected criminals would be pursued anywhere in the world. ''American business is under assault from counterfeiters and pirates every day, seven days a week,'' Mr. Morton said. ''Criminals are stealing American ideas and products and distributing them over the Internet.'' Ms. Bassett would not comment on whether the latest raids were part of Operation in Our Sites, and a spokesman for the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the major recording labels, declined to answer questions. The new seizures also come as a new bill, the Combating Online Infringements and Counterfeits Act, is making its way through Congress. The bill, which was approved by a Senate committee last week, would allow the government to shut down sites that are ''dedicated to infringing activities.'' Critics have said the law is too broad, and could affect sites that have nothing to do with file-sharing; the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online civil liberties group, has called it ''an Internet censorship bill.'' Waleed A. GadElKareem, who operated Torrent Finder from Egypt, said his site was shut down on Thursday without any notice. ''My Web site does not even host any torrents or direct-link to them,'' Mr. GadElKareem wrote in an e-mail, adding that he only links to other sites. ''I am sure something is wrong!'' He added that his server was up and running at a different address.  "
A Range of Options for a Victim's Parents,"When a child becomes entangled in an online conflict, parents understandably feel stricken. But they do not need to panic, experts say. Increasingly, parents have options, ranging from giving their child emotional support to contacting schools and the police, as well as Web sites and service providers, most of whom are tightening their processes to handle complaints.  The first rule is ''Do no harm,'' said Parry Aftab, a cyberbully prevention expert. ''Give them a hug and make sure they feel comfortable and safe. Their greatest concern is that you're going to make a 'mama drama,' call homeland security, make it worse.'' Rather than becoming distracted by the technology, parents should remember they are dealing with adolescents, said Anne Collier, a director of ConnectSafely.org. ''There's always another side of the story,'' she said, ''and maybe many, because of the number of kids involved. This is about getting the emotions settled down so you can get to the facts. The 'sleep on it' rule was never more important.'' In figuring out a pragmatic response, Ms. Aftab said, parents have to determine their child's level of threat. A nasty swipe? Consider ignoring it. At the very least, tell children not to respond online, because retaliatory exchanges can escalate rapidly. Remind them that because people tend to be more harsh online than in person, the sender may not have intended to have inflicted such pain. Ms. Aftab tells parents they can block the sender's phone number, Google their child to see if a bully is posting online attacks, and set up a Google alert for the child's name. Ms. Aftab's site, Stopcyberbullying.org, and an August article in The New York Times, ''Some Ways to Thwart an Online Bully,'' gives pointers for how to report abuses to social networking sites and Internet service providers. Additionally, Commonsensemedia.org, a parenting and media site, urges parents not to delete offending text messages, which must be preserved as evidence. If the conflict includes a threat of harm, parents should contact the police. Another choice would be the school resource officer, typically a school-based police officer trained to address juvenile offenses. Often the officer's warning is sufficient to stop the abuse. Because the cyberbully is almost always someone the child knows at school, said Stephen Balkam, chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute, parents should contact a school counselor or principal. ''Then it comes down how enlightened your school is,'' he said. ''They're playing catch-up as fast as everyone else.'' JAN HOFFMAN  "
"With Help From Internet Pirates, Hundreds of Copies of WikiLeaks Site Appear","LONDON -- The battle lines between supporters of the whistle-blowing Web site WikiLeaks and its detractors began to form on Sunday, as supporters erected numerous copies of the site on the Internet and the United States put pressure on Switzerland not to offer a haven to the site's founder, Julian Assange. Since several major Internet companies cut off services to WikiLeaks in recent days, activists have created hundreds of mirror sites, Web sites that host exact copies of another site's content, making censorship difficult.  The collective Anonymous, an informal but notorious group of hackers and activists, also declared war on Sunday against enemies of Mr. Assange, calling on supporters to attack sites companies that do not support WikiLeaks and to spread the leaked material online. Meanwhile, the American ambassador to Switzerland, Donald S. Beyer Jr., responded to signs that Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks might seek refuge in that country, warning in the weekly magazine NZZ am Sonntag that the Swiss ''should very carefully consider whether to provide shelter to someone who is on the run from the law.'' Since the release of classified diplomatic cables a week ago, from a batch of more than 250,000 obtained by WikiLeaks, the Web site has been bombarded by cyberattacks and abandoned by Internet companies like PayPal, an online payment service that had accepted donations for the site, and Amazon, which had rented it server space. WikiLeaks said that PayPal had ''surrendered to U.S. government pressure,'' but the government has not acknowledged involvement in efforts to try to disable the site. On Friday, WikiLeaks sought refuge in a diffuse web of financial and Internet infrastructure spread across Europe, particularly in Switzerland. It moved to wikileaks.ch, a domain registered to the Swiss Pirate Party, a political organization that shares many of Mr. Assange's aims. A Swiss-Icelandic company, Datacell, will process donations instead of PayPal, and the WikiLeaks site shows that Mr. Assange is accepting direct donations into a Swiss bank account held with the financial arm of the Swiss postal service. But that solace may be short lived: a spokesman for the financial arm of Swiss Post, Marc Andrey, also told NZZ am Sonntag on Sunday that it was ''reviewing'' its relationship with Mr. Assange subject to proof that he has Swiss residency, owns property or does business in the country. A message seeking comment from Mr. Assange's British lawyer was not immediately returned. The Internet group Anonymous, which in the past has taken on targets as diverse as the Church of Scientology and Iran, disseminated a seven-point manifesto via Twitter and other social networking sites pledging to ''kick back for Julian.'' Gregg Housh, a prominent member of the group, said by telephone from Boston that an orchestrated effort was under way to attack companies that have refused to support WikiLeaks and to post multiple copies of the leaked material. The Anonymous manifesto singled out PayPal, which cut off ties with WikiLeaks for ''a violation'' of its policy on promoting illegal activities, a company statement said. ''The reason is amazingly simple,'' Mr. Housh said of the campaign. ''We all believe that information should be free, and the Internet should be free.'' By late Sunday, there were at least 208 WikiLeaks mirror sites up and running. ''Cut us down,'' said a message on the WikiLeaks Twitter feed on Sunday, ''and the stronger we become.''  "
Hackers Disrupt Web Sites Published by Gawker Media,"Web sites belonging to Gawker Media abruptly stopped publishing new material on Sunday after mischief-making hackers gained access to the company's servers. People who had accounts on the flagship Gawker, Gizmodo, Jezebel and the company's other Web sites were told to change their passwords because, it said in a statement, ''our user databases appear to have been compromised.'' Working anonymously, the hackers indicated that they had found more than 1.3 million user names and passwords, though it was unclear whether all of the data had been decrypted.  The hackers published the passwords of some Gawker staff members and mockingly identified thousands of users who had listed their password as ''password.'' ''We're deeply embarrassed by this breach,'' Gawker said in a statement that was posted across its suite of Web sites on Sunday afternoon. The incident was a black eye for Gawker, an eight-year-old digital media company founded by Nick Denton that has grown up in New York. The company has long been a pioneer, setting and then resetting standards for blogging and online publishing, and of late it has been preparing a broad redesign of its Web sites. Gawker's Web sites run on a homegrown content management system, and some of the source code for that system was leaked by the hackers on Sunday. The hackers, who worked under the name ''Gnosis,'' published an article on Gawker that contained a link to the code. Gawker Media became aware of the hacking attempt on Saturday, and staff scrambled to figure out how much virtual damage had been done. On Sunday afternoon, publishing came to a halt, apparently because the company was resetting the passwords for its dozens of writers and editors. On Twitter, one of the bloggers for Jezebel wrote, ''I'd write a post about how we've been hacked and can't publish, but we've been hacked and can't publish.'' The hackers suggested they had chosen Gawker out of spite. They said Gawker writers had been critical of the online message board 4chan, a chaotic group that mounts attacks on Web sites and individuals. An affiliated group, Anonymous, gained attention last week for apparently taking down Web sites like MasterCard's in a show of support for WikiLeaks, the organization that facilitated the release of secret State Department cables. The Gawker hackers wrote in a document on Sunday afternoon, ''You would think a site that likes to mock people, such as Gawker, would have better security and actually have a clue what they are doing. But as we've proven, those who think they are beyond our reach aren't as safe as they would like to think!'' The hackers also seemed to want to impart a lesson about the user names and passwords that are a common part of business on the Web. Before listing the accounts of thousands of people who used the word ''password'' as their password, the hackers wrote, ''Maybe naming and shaming you all will encourge you all to use better passwords in the future? Probably not.''  "
Hackers Attack Ahmadinejad's Web site,"Updated | 10:10 a.m. On Monday night in San Francisco an information technology consultant named Austin Heap reported on his blog that the official Web site of Iran's president, Ahmadinejad.ir, had been attacked by hackers.  Mr. Heap, who has been active in the effort to provide Iranians with tools to circumvent Internet censorship this year, wrote that ""someone seems to have had their way with Ahmadinejad's web servers."" Although the Web site appears to be down now, Mr. Heap wrote that, for several hours, people trying to access it were redirected to a page which contained the following message: Dear God, In 2009 you took my favorite singer - Michael Jackson, my favorite actress - Farrah Fawcett, my favorite actor - Patrick Swayze, my favorite voice - Neda.Please, please, don't forget my favorite politician - Ahmadinejad and my favorite dictator - Khameneiin the year 2010. Thank you. A screen shot of the Web page with that message is available on Mr. Heap's blog (click on the first illustration there for an enlarged view of it). In a later update, Mr. Heap wrote that the site was subsequently inaccessible, and speculated that it was ""either intentionally pulled or ... is simply being overloaded since so many people are looking to grab a peek at the hack.""  The apparent attack comes three weeks after a group calling itself the ""Iranian Cyber Army"" launched an attack that briefly redirected users of Twitter to a site that displayed a message that seemed to support Iran's government. That message read, in part: U.S.A. Think They Controlling And Managing Internet By Their Access, But They Don't, We Control And Manage Internet By Our Power. Mr. Heap founded the Censorship Research Center and explained on its Web site that the group's technological activism was motivated by a desire to help Iranians use the Web despite the efforts of Iran's government to prevent them from doing so: We believe everyone, everywhere should be able to freely communicate, and we began work that would guarantee this right for the people of Iran. The system we designed, ""Haystack,"" provides completely uncensored access. There are no more Facebook blocks, no more government warning pages when trying to read BBC news-just unfiltered Internet. It's an improvement to the state of the art in anti-censorship technology. It's a necessary one too: Iran's filtering is quite advanced, and it's one of two nations to censor the Internet using domestic hardware and software. (The other is China.) Imagine a postal service that opens each piece of mail and uses machine learning algorithms to detect subversive correspondence. That's Iranian digital censorship. This kind of filtering is called ""deep packet inspection."" It allows the government to block, read, and even change messages sent over the Internet, including emails and tweets. Iran purchased equipment from Western companies like Nokia for this censorship, and is rapidly deploying homegrown equivalents over which it can exert more control. Iran's filtering capabilities allow it to intercept and even change online communications - emails, voice calls, even tweets. Still, we were able to identify weaknesses in Iran's approach and develop countermeasures. On Tuesday, Iran's state-run Press TV reported that the country's intelligence ministry has barred citizens from cooperating with a list of 60 European and American foundations it blames for orchestrating the protests that followed last June's disputed presidential election in Iran. The ministry also claimed that media organizations like the BBC and Voice of America that have broadcast video uploaded to the Web showing demonstrations back into Iran via satellite are doing so as part of a plot to overthrow Iran's government.

"The Credibility of Climate Science, Cont.","There is an intense debate under way among climate change scientists over how to rebuild public confidence in their work after the damaging disclosures in hundreds of hacked e-mail messages from a British climate research center and the more recent revelations of errors in the latest United Nations report on climate change.  An article in The New York Times today captures the broad outlines of the debate and reflects the views of some of the main players. But there are many other voices worth listening to, scientists who are concerned not just about the credibility of climate research, but also about the wider question of the role of science in modern society. Here are a couple. Sheila Jasanoff, professor of science and public policy at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard, says that climate scientists face two significant challenges: to produce and communicate the best information about climatic changes, and to build public trust. The trust part, she says, does not necessarily flow from the quality of the science, as many scientists hope or believe. The entire modern scientific enterprise, she argues, requires the lay public to place faith in strangers, to have confidence in the experts who understand specialized knowledge that untrained citizens do not share. The public must also believe that those experts - the scientific priesthood - are not conspiring to dupe them.  ""It's not just a function of information, but an ongoing relationship with the public, a willingness to show why you should be believed,"" Professor Jasanoff said. Another scientist, Judith A. Curry, a professor in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, suggests that climate scientists might rehabilitate their image and improve their work by embracing the so-called open source movement. She advocates publishing more scientific papers on the Internet, posting all the relevant data and methodology, forcing authors to defend their work outside of the closed fraternity of climate scientists. (Here is her blog post on the subject; the Dot Earth blog looked recently at her approach and other moves toward more openness in climate research.) Professor Curry says the recent flaps over the purloined e-mail and the mistakes in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report have been an ""absolute fiasco"" for the climate science community. In her view, it is only by directly engaging critics, on the Internet and elsewhere, that scientists can begin to rebuild the faith that Professor Jasanoff says has been breached. ""A lot of the issue with the bloggers is they feel they get disrespected by mainstream climate community and some have something to offer technically,"" Professor Curry said in an interview. ""But they just get lumped into denier, oil-funded cranks."" She urged climate scientists to post relevant papers on the Internet and then hang around for a few hours taking questions from critics or contrarians. ""It would go a long way to educating the public and giving our critics the respect they want,"" she said.  "
U.S. Soldier Arrested in Wikileaks Inquiry After Tip From Former Hacker,"Wired's Threat Level blog reported late Sunday that ""an Army intelligence analyst who boasted of giving classified U.S. combat video and hundreds of thousands of classified State Department records to whistleblower site Wikileaks,"" was arrested by the Pentagon. The leaked video, which was filmed in Baghdad in 2007 during an operation that killed civilians, including two Reuters journalists, was published online by Wikileaks in April. Kevin Poulsen and Kim Zetter of Threat Level wrote: Specialist Bradley Manning, 22, of Potomac, Md., was stationed at Forward Operating Base Hammer, 40 miles east of Baghdad, where he was arrested nearly two weeks ago by the Army's Criminal Investigation Division. A family member says he's being held in custody in Kuwait and has not been formally charged. Manning was turned in late last month by a former computer hacker with whom he spoke online. In the course of their chats, Manning took credit for leaking a headline-making video of a helicopter attack that Wikileaks posted online in April. According to Wired, ""Manning came to the attention of the F.B.I. and Army investigators after he contacted former hacker Adrian Lamo late last month over instant messenger and e-mail."" Comments posted on the Wikileaks Twitter feed on Monday warned journalists not to trust Mr. Lamo or Mr. Poulsen, but also said: We are investigating the claims, if true, sources should be reminded to ONLY SPEAK TO WIKILEAKS. We never collect personal information on our sources, so we are are unable as yet to confirm the Manning story. Allegations in Wired that we have been sent 260,000 classified U.S. embassy cables are, as far as we can tell, incorrect. If Brad Manning, 22, is the ""Collateral Murder"" & Garani massacre whistleblower then, without doubt, he's a national hero. NPR's news blog, The Two-Way, posted this statement from the Pentagon within the past hour: United States Division-Center is currently conducting a joint investigation of Specialist Bradley Manning, 22, of Potomac, Md., who is deployed with Second Brigade 10th Mountain Division, in Baghdad, Iraq. He was placed in pretrial confinement for allegedly releasing classified information and is currently confined in Kuwait. The Department of Defense takes the management of classified information very seriously because it affects our national security, the lives of our soldiers, and our operations abroad. The results of the investigation will be released upon completion of the investigation.   "
Report Says 9 Million Books Pirated Online,"A study by a company that helps track pirated digital books  estimates that there were 9 million illegal downloads of copyrighted books in the final months of last year. Attributor, which works for publishers including Hachette Book Group and John Wiley & Sons, scanned 25 Web sites that offer readers downloadable content, looking for 913 titles across categories ranging from business and investing to fiction. It found, for example, that illegal copies of ''Freakonomics,'' by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, were downloaded 1,082 times and  ''Angels & Demons,'' by Dan Brown, 7,951 times. The study did not track any titles published by the company's clients, which would exclude the oft-pirated ''Twilight'' series published by Hachette.  Rich Pearson, general manager of Attributor, said although not every pirated copy represented a lost sale, the potential loss to the publishing industry could be as high as $3 billion.  Some analysts doubted that piracy was as big a problem for the book industry as the study suggested. Mike Shatzkin, chief executive of Idea Logical Company, a book industry consultant, said many people who might illegally download an e-book would never have bought it in the first place.   "
A Plan in Britain to Block Sites Offering Pirated Music,"To the consternation of Internet companies and civil liberties groups, lawmakers in Britain are seeking to punish those who illegally copy music.   The British proposal is  set to be taken up by the House of Commons on Monday. Under an amendment to the bill in the House of Lords this month, courts would be empowered to order Internet service providers to block access to Web sites that provide pirated movies, music and other media content.    Supporters of the amendment say it would finally give copyright holders the tools to tackle the piracy problem at the supply and demand levels, after more than a decade of largely futile efforts. But critics of the bill say it raises the threat of censorship on the Internet, and could undermine the development of Britain's digital economy.   Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, which campaigns against restrictions on the Internet, said the bill contained unusually broad scope for abuse. Individuals or companies, he said, may try to use it to suppress any Web content they find objectionable, under the pretext of protecting their copyright.    The British government says a tougher approach on piracy could provide hundreds of millions of dollars for the ''creative industries,'' which account for more than 6 percent of British economic output. But critics say the enforcement proposals would be expensive to enforce and would generate little new revenue.   Britain is not the only country considering tougher measures to fight piracy. Lawmakers in Spain have proposed a measure that, like the British proposal, could require Internet service providers to block access to certain sites.    South Korea recently approved a so-called three-strikes system, under which pirates who ignore two warnings to stop illegal downloads face the loss of their Internet connections. And France has also approved a measure that would give the government the right to cut off the connections of persistent violators.   British libel laws, which put the burden of proof on the defendant, are already employed in this way by wealthy plaintiffs, critics say; rather than mount expensive defenses, bloggers and others accused of libel often back down and withdraw their allegations.   Lilian  Edwards, a professor of Internet law at the University of Sheffield, wrote on her blog that the measure could be employed by media companies to try to block online video services like YouTube, which sometimes contain clips of copyrighted material.   Geoff Taylor, chief executive of BPI, a trade group for British recording companies, said the proposal to block Web sites  was not aimed at the likes of YouTube but at sites like the Pirate Bay, whose founders were convicted  of criminal copyright violations by a court in Sweden last year.   ''We are not talking about threats to freedom of expression,'' he said. ''We are talking about massive taking of people's creative works.''  "
NATO Is Urged to Define Self-Defense Beyond Its Borders,"PARIS -- NATO must be willing to fight and operate far from its borders to defend its members in a new world of terrorism, piracy and cyberattacks, according to a proposed strategy for the alliance released Monday.   The proposal, ''NATO 2020,'' also urges the alliance to restore credibility to its pledge of collective security, which it said was a prerequisite for efforts farther afield.    ''NATO must be versatile and efficient enough to operate far from home,'' former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who led a team of experts in writing the report, said at a news conference in Brussels. ''In order to sustain the political will for operations outside its area, NATO must see that all its members are reassured about the security of their home territories.''    One of the main purposes of the new strategy, NATO officials said, is to recommit the alliance to its core mission of collective self-defense, known as Article 5 of its original charter.   But the report also says that the alliance must not fail in its current battle against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, which NATO forces entered in collective defense of the United States after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.    ''In today's world we may have to go beyond our borders to defend our borders,'' said Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the alliance's secretary general. ''I can mention Afghanistan as a case in point.''   Already this year, 200 NATO soldiers have died in Afghanistan, according to the Web site iCasualties.org, which tracks military fatalities, compared with 119 in the same period last year.   The report, commissioned by NATO, is meant to provide the guidelines for a new strategic concept to replace the one NATO adopted in 1999. Mr. Rasmussen will refine the guidelines and present them to the 28 member governments for comments, with the aim of adopting a new strategy at the organization's summit meeting in Lisbon in November.   In a post-1999 world of terrorism, nuclear proliferation and the spread of missiles to more aggressive countries and even nonstate actors, like Hezbollah and Hamas, and threats to the security of energy supplies and the Internet, the alliance must reform to remain relevant, the report said. It added, ''Although NATO is busier than it has ever been, its value is less obvious to many than in the past.''   The report also urges the alliance to improve its ties and security cooperation with Moscow, working together on areas of mutual interest like missile defense, counterterrorism, maritime security and the fight against narcotics. ''NATO should pursue a policy of engagement with Russia, while reassuring all allies that their security and interests will be defended,'' the report said.   With Iran believed to be working to develop a nuclear weapon and ballistic missiles, partnership with Russia on missile defense makes sense, the report said. ''Missile defense is most effective when it is a joint enterprise, and cooperation between the alliance and its partners, especially Russia,  is highly desirable,'' it said.   The panel urged NATO to maintain a nuclear deterrent ''at the minimum level required by the prevailing security environment,'' rejecting arguments by some European governments that American battlefield nuclear weapons be removed from the continent.   In a time of tight budgets, the panel said, members should spend more efficiently and do more to buy weapons jointly and to pool resources, like military transport planes. In 2008, only five NATO members met a target of spending a minimum of 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense; one of them, Greece, is in deep difficulty over its debts.   The report also suggests that the alliance be ready to intervene in humanitarian disasters,  in cases of genocide, large-scale violations of human rights and the chaos of failed states.   A separate report, published this month by the Center for European Reform in London, says NATO needs to address the security concerns of newer members in central and eastern Europe.    As a gesture of nonaggression aimed at Russia, the alliance has done little planning on how it might defend newer member states like Poland and the Baltic countries from a Russian attack, whether military, naval or through the Internet. Some eastern European officials fear a Georgia-like local or regional conflict, where existing antagonisms could be manipulated.   ''Some of the allies worry that NATO would not be able to come to their defense in a crisis,'' said Tomas Valasek, one of the authors of the London report, who also was a civilian adviser to Ms. Albright's group.   ''If they feel secure at home,'' the report says, ''they will have less need to invest in equipment needed for self-defense and have more reasons to buy the hardware needed for far-off missions such as Afghanistan.'' And fewer reasons, the report says, to fear Russia and oppose a new NATO relationship with Moscow.  "
Vindication for French Official,"PARIS -- Floyd Landis's admission that he systematically broke the rules governing doping came as vindication to Pierre Bordry, the president of the antidoping agency whose findings resulted in Landis's being stripped of victory in the 2006 Tour de France.    Landis's unsuccessful campaign to overturn his test results and discredit Bordry's organization was public and bitter -- and even led to a warrant being issued in February for Landis's arrest in a case involving computer hacking at the lab.   Bordry sounded a triumphal note Thursday, saying Landis's decision to come clean -- in e-mail messages sent to various cycling organization officials -- was a result of the pressure the French authorities had brought to bear on him.   ''It's due to the determination of our agency against the doping and hacking,'' Bordry said. ''He was anxious of being arrested if he came to France.''   ''We know some cyclists use doping to win competitions, we can't catch every one,'' Bordry added, noting that the battle to catch cheats required a never-ending effort to keep up with new doping techniques.   ''We put big pressure on the cyclists. I don't know how many are doing it. I hope it's a minority.''   Landis, who tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone after the 2006 race, has been under investigation since November of that year in connection with the computer hacking. Bordry charged in a criminal complaint at the time that confidential documents related to Landis's drug tests had been stolen and sent to the news media and other labs, apparently in an effort to discredit the lab's handling of test samples.   Investigators concluded that one such e-mail message was sent from a computer with the same Internet protocol address used by Arnie Baker, Landis's coach at the time.   No evidence has surfaced to connect Landis or Baker to the hacking, and both have vigorously denied any involvement.   The arrest warrants are valid only in France, meaning the two men face arrest if they go there. Neither Landis nor Baker answered a summons last spring for a court hearing.   Judge Thomas Cassuto, who is handling the case, has since finished his inquiry and handed the dossier to Philippe Courroye, the prosecutor in the case. He is expected to offer an opinion in the next few months as to whether the case should proceed to trial, Astrid Granoux, a spokeswoman for Courroye, said Thursday.  "
Online Deals: Scams or Steals?,"TRAVEL writers often suggest that readers sign up for e-mail alerts from airlines, hotels and car rental  companies advertising tempting discounts and deals.   But that advice should come with an important caveat: once those e-mail messages start arriving, it can be difficult to know  a bargain from a tease: that hotel room advertised for less than a night at the movies could end up costing as much as a monthly car payment once you click through to actually  book it.   On any given day, my inbox might include a coupon for ''up to'' 40 percent off a hotel room,  car rental rates ''from'' $8.95 per day, discounts valid at ''participating locations'' and sale fares ''subject to availability.'' After going down the rabbit hole many times attempting (and failing) to take advantage of these deals, I decided to test about a dozen promotions that I received during a recent week to see how often I could snag the promised deal.     The unscientific results -- though often disappointing -- were better than I expected: I was able to get close enough to the advertised discount or sale to feel satisfied about half the time. Here's what I learned about  how to increase your odds of actually booking a sale price, or at least avoid wasting time with dubious come-ons.   Act Fast   There are two time restrictions that can affect your ability to land a deal: sale prices that must be booked by a specific date (which is usually listed, if buried in fine print) and offers that involve limited inventory (which is not always clear). Cynical bargain hunters suspect that super-low fares  apply only to one seat on a single flight, but some companies are starting to reveal the amount of inventory they make available for each offer.     For instance, when JetBlue uses Twitter to tweet its ''cheeps'' -- sale fares on a particular route -- the text reads ''25 seats avail or til 6 pm EDT.'' Translation: sale price good until 6 p.m. or until those 25 seats are gone.   JetBlue's Web page provides more details and even keeps track of how much time is left before the deal expires.   But even if no time limit is listed with an offer, assume that sale rates disappear quickly  --  sometimes within hours.    ''As a sale ages, it's very likely that those deals are no longer available at the prices advertised,'' said Anne Banas, executive editor for SmarterTravel.com.  That site's  newsletters alert subscribers about travel industry sales, and generally make it clear when travelers need to book.   Check Date Restrictions   Most sales apply to a limited number of travel dates, but companies can be sneaky about disclosing this information. Often, you have to scroll through tiny text at the bottom of the page to find these dates, if they're listed at all. That causes one of the biggest frustrations travelers encounter with online  deals -- searching different dates and coming up with higher prices than advertised, with no way to know which dates qualify for the sale.   So I was pleasantly surprised to click on an E-Saver fare in an e-mail message from US Airways and be linked to a calendar marking the days the reduced fare was available. Even better, the $108 fare I selected (one way from Chicago to Bermuda) could be booked on a total of 21 days in June, with similar availability for the return flight. My only complaint: the $107 worth of taxes and fees took the round-trip total to $323,  and US Airways didn't itemize those charges before asking for my credit card. In an  era of hidden travel fees, customers deserve to see that breakdown.   Still, when advertising sales, other companies should follow this calendar model, or at least rethink the eye-straining way they present their terms and conditions to allow readers to clearly find crucial details like ''available dates.''    Ben Popken, co-managing editor of Consumerist.com, which publishes customer gripes, said shrouding this information is rampant among all retailers, and maybe worse online.    ''These are all just different tactics marketers use to lure you into paying more than you intend,'' he said. ''Maybe it's more profitable, but it's deceptive.''   Be Wary of Vague Agency Offers   In my test, I noticed that specific deals, like a sale at a single hotel, were more likely to deliver on the advertised price than   a more comprehensive package, such as a three-day stay at a certain city. Also, deals that came directly from airlines, hotels or car rental companies were more reliable than those from travel agencies.   For instance, I received an e-mail message from Alamo promising I could ''Own the weekend from $15 a day.'' The fine print revealed that the offer was good for weekend car rentals at ''participating'' airport locations through May 24. I was sure that wouldn't include any New York area airports, where cars are generally much more expensive, but --  surprise! --  Newark Liberty airport qualified for the deal, as did airports in Los Angeles, Detroit and Boston. The only city I checked that did not qualify was Atlanta.    On the other hand, a message from Hotwire advertising an $8.95-a-day car rental rate at Los Angeles  International airport took me to a page where the rate was actually $10.95 a day, for a week in early June determined by Hotwire. When I chose three alternate options the daily rate ranged from $14.95 to $20.95.   I had a similar experience with Hotwire's package trips: an e-mail message advertising a $451-a-person three-night trip to Las Vegas to stay at the Wynn Las Vegas took me to a page with no mention of the Wynn. When I ultimately found the hotel, the price jumped to $547 a person and was packaged  with ridiculously inconvenient flight times: an arrival  Sunday night at 11:05 p.m. and a departure Wednesday morning at 7 a.m.   -- with a connection each way.   I'm not the only person to complain about this experience, and Hotwire, which declined to comment for this article, is not the only agency that frustrates customers with teaser offers that lead to higher prices.   David Seaman, a New York City blogger who publishes personal finance advice at CreditCardOutlaw.com, clicked on a link at an e-mail portal  in March promising ''Last-minute Las Vegas deals: 4-star hotels from only $39!'' He said that the link took him to a travel agency site showing 3-  and 2.5-star hotels, starting at $87 a night. The  sticker shock was compounded when he added flights for two people, which raised the price to $2,217.    ''I think sensational ads are definitely nothing new online,'' Mr. Seaman said, adding that he expected travel sellers to adhere to higher standards, especially given the importance of trust in an industry that already has an image problem. His plea to advertisers: ''Just be honest.''  "
"Army Leak Suspect Is Turned In, by Ex-Hacker","WASHINGTON -- It was only last month that a 22-year-old Army intelligence analyst in Iraq, Specialist Bradley Manning, reached out to a former computer hacker who apparently seemed like a kindred soul.   In a single intense week in late May, Specialist Manning and the former hacker, Adrian Lamo, traded instant messages about what Mr. Lamo described as Specialist Manning's personal troubles with the military.   But over the course of those exchanges, Mr. Lamo said in a telephone interview on Monday, Specialist Manning also took credit for leaking a classified, explosive video of an American helicopter attack in Baghdad that left 12 people dead, including two employees of the Reuters news agency, which the Web site Wikileaks.org posted in April.   There was more: Specialist Manning also claimed he gave Wikileaks 260,000 classified United States diplomatic cables and video of a United States airstrike in Afghanistan that killed 97 civilians last year, Mr. Lamo said. ''He was just grabbing information from where he could get it and trying to leak it.''    So the former renegade, who in 2004 pleaded guilty to hacking into the internal computer system of The New York Times, did something he had not expected when Specialist Manning first contacted him: He turned him in.   On Monday, the Department of Defense announced that Specialist Manning, of Potomac, Md., had been arrested and was under investigation. A three-paragraph statement said that Specialist Manning, who is deployed with the Second Brigade, 10th Mountain Division in Baghdad, was in pretrial confinement in Kuwait ''for allegedly releasing classified information.''   It is unclear whether Mr. Lamo is the main source against Mr. Manning, or if the military has developed other evidence. The Pentagon would not discuss the investigation.   Specialist Manning's family members could not be reached for comment, but Wired's Threat Level blog, which broke the news of the arrest and Mr. Lamo's role in it, reported that his father, Brian Manning of Oklahoma, was shocked.   ''I was in the military for five years,'' Wired quoted Mr. Manning as saying. ''I had a secret clearance, and I never divulged any information in 30 years since I got out about what I did. And Brad has always been very, very tight at adhering to the rules. Even talking to him after boot camp and stuff, he kept everything so close that he didn't open up to anything.''   Mr. Manning told Wired that his son ''is a good kid. Never been in trouble. Never been on drugs, alcohol, nothing.''   The leak of the helicopter video, which Wikileaks titled ''Collateral Murder,'' caused serious consternation at the Pentagon, where senior officials are increasingly concerned about technology that makes it easier to anonymously post documents, photographs and videos online. In April, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates criticized the helicopter video as a portrayal of war as seen ''through a soda straw.''   But opponents of the Iraq war have said that the video provided irrefutable evidence of a military blunder, and that it should not have been classified.   The episode also drew wide attention to Wikileaks, a once-fringe Web site that aims to bring to light secret information about governments and corporations. It was founded three years ago by Julian Assange, an Australian activist and journalist, and has published documents about toxic dumping in Africa, protocols from Guantanamo Bay and e-mail messages from Sarah Palin's personal account.   In the interview on Monday, Mr. Lamo said he had contacted the Army about Specialist Manning's instant messages because he was worried that disclosure of the information would put people's lives in danger. He said that Army investigators were particularly concerned about one sensitive piece of information that Specialist Manning possessed that Mr. Lamo would not discuss in more detail.   ''I thought to myself, 'What if somebody dies because this information is leaked?' '' he said.   So far, Wikileaks has not posted any video of the American airstrike in Afghanistan, although it claims to have it. That video, like the helicopter video, is said to be encrypted, meaning it is protected by a secret code. Working over months, Wikileaks said it was able to decrypt the helicopter video; Mr. Lamo said Monday that he understood that Wikileaks had not yet decrypted the Afghanistan attack video.   In Twitter messages on Monday, Wikileaks denounced both Mr. Lamo and Kevin Poulsen, a co-author of the lengthy Wired Threat Level blog post, as ''notorious felons, informers & manipulators'' and said that ''journalists should take care.'' Wikileaks also said that reports that the Web site had been sent 260,000 classified embassy cables ''are, as far as we can tell, incorrect.''   Mr. Lamo, reached at his parents' home in Carmichael, Calif., said that he turned over copies of his chat logs with Specialist Manning to Army investigators, and that they included much personal information that could give clues to Specialist Manning's motives, should he indeed turn out to be the leaker.   Asked to specify what he saw as Specialist Manning's motives, Mr. Lamo replied: ''Ideology. I think he was dissatisfied with certain military policies and he wanted to adversely affect U.S. foreign policy.'' Mr. Lamo would not provide more details. ''It's a personal matter for him, and I do not think it was one his family would want aired in the national media,'' he said.   Mr. Lamo, 29, said he had expressed concern to Specialist Manning during the course of their exchanges. ''I told him he would be in a world of hurt if he was found out,'' he said. ''In retrospect I wish I had tried to talk to him more.''   Mr. Lamo said he had promised the F.B.I. he would testify against the specialist. ''I'll keep my word, but I won't do it happily,'' he said. ''I hope that his parents can forgive me. I'm sorry about what happened to their boy. But I was backed into a corner ethically.''   In Twitter messages on Monday, Mr. Lamo continued the theme. ''I outed Brad Manning as an alleged leaker out of duty,'' he said in one. ''I would never (and have never) outed an Ordinary Decent Criminal. There's a difference.''   In another Twitter message, Mr. Lamo said: ''I know what it's like to be 22, scared, and in shackles too. I've been there. I hope none of you ever have to make a choice like this.''   After Mr. Lamo pleaded guilty to hacking into The New York Times -- he had also hacked into Yahoo, WorldCom and Microsoft -- he was sentenced to six months of house arrest at his parents' home and two years of probation. He said in the interview that he saw a difference in the level of wrong of hacking into The Times, which he acknowledged was illegal but did not, he said, compromise national security.   By Mr. Lamo's account, Specialist Manning reached out to him on May 20, after an article on Wired's Threat Level blog described Mr. Lamo's struggles with Asperger's disorder and his history as a hacker.   "
Ex-Hacker Who Accused Suspect Of Army Leak Is Still Talking,"FOR weeks now, the United States military has been holding an Army intelligence analyst, Bradley Manning, in connection with the release of classified materials to the whistle-blower Web site Wikileaks. He is suspected of being the source of the 2007 video of an Apache helicopter killing 12 civilians in Iraq, including two Reuters journalists. More ominously, he is feared to have leaked 260,000 secret diplomatic cables.   The case broke open when a prominent figure in the hacking world, Adrian Lamo, handed over to the authorities chat logs in which, Mr. Lamo said, Specialist Manning admits to having given the video to Wikileaks.    Those conversations date to late May. Specialist Manning has been under arrest since at least early June and has not uttered a peep publicly. When the Department of Defense announced the arrest, it said that Specialist Manning was in pretrial confinement in Kuwait ''for allegedly releasing classified information.'' Mr. Lamo, on the other hand, has been talking ever since.   There he is on his frequently updated Twitter feed, describing his daily thoughts and activities. In self-published press releases, he explains his actions, or, as one puts it, ''Adrian Lamo Clarifies Role in Bradley Manning Wikileaks Arrest.''   More comprehensively, Mr. Lamo has had his Web site redirect to Formspring.me, where he answers questions posed by strangers. Typical colloquies: ''How does it feel to be the no-1 snitch in US?'' Answer: ''We're #1! We're #1! We're #1!''   Or ''You realize that you have condemned Manning to death, right?'' Answer: ''Kid'll probably get six months.''   Or, more sympathetically, ''U have done the right thing.'' Answer: ''I believe this to be true.''   It was to be expected that the controversial video, published with the title ''Collateral Murder,'' would sustain an online rumor mill, debating society and newsroom, often all at the same time.   Perhaps more surprising is that this online chatter has continued even as this story has changed from an analysis of a video of killings in Iraq -- worthy or not of the label ''Collateral Murder'' -- to the potential prosecution of a soldier on serious charges.   In addition to Mr. Lamo's multipronged online strategy, there is Wikileaks, which used its Twitter feed to comment on reports that Specialist Manning had been arrested. The usual face of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, largely disappeared from public view from early June until recently.   That feed stayed silent on the question on everyone's mind -- did he or didn't he? After all, if Wikileaks cleared Specialist Manning, it would be undercutting its central claim: that those who give it information are ensured that they will remain anonymous.   Instead, Wikileaks used Twitter to attack the reporting on the story.   Initially, it accused the reporter who broke the story for Wired News, Kevin Poulsen, of having a ''notorious'' connection with Mr. Lamo and expressed its anger with him.   It also mentioned that Mr. Poulsen was convicted for hacking, as was Mr. Lamo -- in Mr. Lamo's case in 2004 when he pleaded guilty to hacking into the internal computer system of The New York Times.  The two have a reporting history that extends more than a decade. And on Wikipedia of all places, there is a photo of Mr. Poulsen, Mr. Lamo and Kevin Mitnick, a well-known ex-hacker, smiling together.   Naturally, Mr. Poulsen used Twitter to respond ''Woah. Wikileaks is calling me an informer and manipulator. (They call me a felon, too, but that part's true).'' But later his tone turned less jocular: ''Sometimes Wikileaks seems more like Nixon than Ellsberg.''   In an interview, Mr. Poulsen said he had no relationship with Mr. Lamo other than reporter/subject, and that he had been a hacker but stopped long ago.  ''When I was hacking, Adrian was barely out of diapers,'' he said.   Mr. Poulsen said he wondered what Wikileaks would have had him do  --  keep secret that a soldier was being held on accusations that he had leaked? The arrest is what made the story news, Mr. Poulsen said, adding that ''myself and Wired in general are not in the business of printing other journalists' sources.'' When pressed, he conceded that he considered Wikileaks to be ''a journalistic organization.''   The Wikileaks accusations against Wired caught the eye of Glenn Greenwald, a former constitutional lawyer who now blogs at Salon. In his blog, Mr. Greenwald analyzed the accusations and, as is his style, showed all his work  --  including e-mail correspondence with Mr. Poulsen and a telephone interview with Mr. Lamo.   Ultimately, Mr. Greenwald concluded, in his headline, that the case was ''strange and consequential.''  After reading the thousands of words Mr. Greenwald published on the case, what happened -- how Mr. Lamo came to know Specialist Manning, among other things -- was still not clear.   Mr. Greenwald ended by saying that because of the importance of Wikileaks' function as a check on ''powerful factions and imposing transparency,'' the topic ''merits substantial scrutiny, along with genuine skepticism to understand what happened.''   And though the online proliferation of comments about the Manning case can be overwhelming, Mr. Greenwald said he preferred this condition to the opposite: ''On the whole, it is extremely healthy because it makes things a lot more transparent.''   Ever in search of the last word, Mr. Lamo last Monday posted a note on the Wikipedia article about the Manning case, saying it was biased. The note was quickly taken down, and Mr. Lamo dropped the subject.   Representatives of the Army were contacted by e-mail and asked to comment on the arrest of Specialist Manning, but did  not reply.   At the same time that the case has been exhaustively examined online, few traditional, that is, offline, outlets have taken up the Manning prosecution as a test of First Amendment principles, a challenge to the free flow of information needed by the public trying to evaluate the conduct of the war in Iraq. ''This is an incredible instance of something that happens online, happens via the online transfer of information, and maybe it never got offline,'' said Lisa Lynch, an assistant professor of journalism at Concordia University in Montreal, who has been studying Wikileaks almost since its creation in 2006. ''Maybe it got contained there.''  "
A Soldier's Path Toward a Leak Investigation,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- He spent part of his childhood with his father in the arid plains of central Oklahoma, where classmates made fun of him for being a geek. He spent another part with his mother in a small, remote corner of southwest Wales, where classmates made fun of him for being gay. Then he joined the Army, where, friends said, his social life was defined by the need to conceal his sexuality under ''don't ask, don't tell'' and he wasted brainpower fetching coffee for officers. But it was around two years ago, when Pfc. Bradley Manning came here to visit a man he had fallen in love with, that he finally seemed to have found a place where he fit in, part of a social circle that included politically motivated computer hackers and his boyfriend, a self-described drag queen. So when his military career seemed headed nowhere good, Private Manning, 22, turned increasingly to those friends for moral support.  And now some of those friends say they wonder whether his desperation for acceptance -- or delusions of grandeur -- may have led him to disclose the largest trove of government secrets since the Pentagon Papers. ''I would always try to make clear to Brad that he had a promising future ahead of him,'' said Daniel J. Clark, one of those Cambridge friends. ''But when you're young and you're in his situation, it's hard to tell yourself things are going to get better, especially in Brad's case, because in his past, things didn't always get better.'' Blond and barely grown up, Private Manning worked as an intelligence analyst and was based east of Baghdad. He is suspected of disclosing more than 150,000 diplomatic cables, more than 90,000 intelligence reports on the war in Afghanistan and one video of a military helicopter attack -- all of it classified. Most of the information was given to WikiLeaks.org, which posted the war reports after sharing them with three publications, including The New York Times. WikiLeaks has defended the disclosure, saying transparency is essential to democracy. The Pentagon has denounced the leaks, saying they put American soldiers and their Afghan allies in grave danger. And while that dispute rages on, with the Pentagon having recently demanded that WikiLeaks remove all secret documents from the Internet and hand over any undisclosed materials in its files, Private Manning is being held in solitary confinement at Quantico, Va., under suicide watch. Private Manning's military-appointed lawyer, Maj. Thomas F. Hurley, declined an interview request. Much remains unknown about his journey there from Crescent, Okla., the small town where he was born. But interviews with people who know him, along with e-mail exchanges between him and Adrian Lamo, the computer hacker who turned him in, offer some insights into Private Manning's early years, why he joined the Army and how he came to be so troubled, especially in recent months. ''I've been isolated so long,'' Private Manning wrote in May to Mr. Lamo, who turned the chat logs over to the authorities and the news media. ''But events kept forcing me to figure out ways to survive.'' Survival was something Private Manning began learning as a young child in Crescent. His father, Brian Manning, was also a soldier and spent a lot of time away from home, former neighbors recalled. His mother, Susan Manning, struggled to cope with the culture shock of having moved to the United States from her native Wales, the neighbors said. One neighbor, Jacqueline Radford, recalled that when students at Private Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she sent additional food or money to make sure he had something to eat. ''I've always tried to be supportive of him because of his home life,'' Ms. Radford said. ''I know it was bad, to where he was left to his own, had to fend for himself.'' At school, Bradley Manning was clearly different from most of his peers. He preferred hacking computer games rather than playing them, former neighbors said. And they said he seemed opinionated beyond his years about politics, religion, and even about keeping religion out of politics. In his Bible Belt hometown that he once mockingly wrote in an e-mail had ''more pews than people,'' Private Manning refused to recite the parts of the Pledge of Allegiance that referred to God or do homework assignments that involved the Scriptures. And if a teacher challenged his views, former classmates said, he was quick to push back. ''He would get upset, slam books on the desk if people wouldn't listen to him or understand his point of view,'' said Chera Moore, who attended elementary and junior high school with him. ''He would get really mad, and the teacher would say, 'O.K., Bradley, get out.' '' It was something he would hear a lot throughout his life. After Private Manning's parents divorced, he moved with his mother to Haverfordwest, Wales, her hometown, and began a new chapter of isolation. Haverfordwest is several times bigger than Crescent. It is also centuries older, with traditions that run much deeper. A bustling market town, it offered a pace of life that was significantly faster. Former students at his school there, Tasker Milward, remembered Private Manning being teased for all sort of reasons. His American accent. His love of Dr Pepper. The amount of time he spent huddled before a computer. And then, students began to suspect he was gay. Sometimes, former classmates said, he reacted to the teasing by idly boasting about stealing other students' girlfriends. At other times, he openly flirted with boys. Often, with only the slightest provocation, he would launch into fits of rage. ''It was probably the worst experience anybody could go through,'' said Rowan John, a former classmate who was openly gay in high school. ''Being different like me, or Bradley, in the middle of nowhere is like going back in time to the Dark Ages.'' But life ahead did not immediately brighten for Private Manning. After his troubled high school years, his mother sent him back to Oklahoma to live with his father and his older sister. He was hired and quickly fired from a small software company, where his employer, Kord Campbell, recalled him as clean-cut and highly intelligent with an almost innate sense for programming, as well as the personality of a bull in a china shop. Then his father found out he was gay and kicked him out of the house, friends said. Mr. Clark, the Cambridge friend, said Private Manning told him he lived out of his car briefly while he worked in a series of minimum-wage retail jobs. He enlisted in the Army in 2007, to try to give his life some direction and to help to pay for college, friends said. He was granted a security clearance and trained as an intelligence analyst at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., before being assigned to the Second Brigade 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, N.Y. Before being deployed to Iraq, Private Manning met Tyler Watkins, who described himself on his blog as a classical musician, singer and drag queen. A friend said the two had little in common, but Private Manning fell head over heels. Mr. Watkins, who did not respond to interview requests for this article, was a student at Brandeis University. On trips to visit him here in Cambridge, Private Manning got to know many in Mr. Watkins' wide network of friends, including some who were part of this university town's tight-knit hacker community. Friends said Private Manning found the atmosphere here to be everything the Army was not: openly accepting of his geeky side, his liberal political opinions, his relationship with Mr. Watkins and his ambition to do something that would get attention. Although hacking has come to mean a lot of different things, at its core, those who do it say, is the philosophy that information should be free and accessible to all. And Private Manning had access to some of the most secret information on the planet. Meanwhile, his military career was anything but stellar. He had been reprimanded twice, including once for assaulting an officer. He wrote in e-mails that he felt ''regularly ignored'' by his superiors ''except when I had something essential, then it was back to 'Bring me coffee, then sweep the floor.' '' And it seems the more isolated he felt in the military -- he wore custom dog tags that said ''Humanist,'' and friends said he kept a toy fairy wand on his desk in Iraq -- the more he clung to his hacker friends. According to Wired magazine, Private Manning told Mr. Watkins last January that he had gotten his hands on a secret video showing a military helicopter attack that killed two Reuters photographers and one Iraqi civilian. In a computer chat with Mr. Lamo, Private Manning said he gave the video to WikiLeaks in February. Then, after WikiLeaks released it in April, Private Manning hounded Mr. Watkins about whether there had been any public reaction. ''That was one of his major concerns once he'd done this,'' Mr. Watkins told Wired. ''Was it really going to make a difference?'' In his computer chats with Mr. Lamo, Private Manning described how he downloaded the video and lip-synched to Lady Gaga as he copied hundreds of thousand of diplomatic cables. ''Hillary Clinton and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack,'' he boasted. But even as he professed a perhaps inflated sense of purpose, he called himself ''emotionally fractured'' and a ''wreck'' and said he was ''self-medicating like crazy.'' And as he faces the possibility of a lifetime in prison, some of Private Manning's remarks now seem somewhat prophetic. ''I wouldn't mind going to prison for the rest of my life, or being executed so much,'' he wrote, ''if it wasn't for the possibility of having pictures of me plastered all over the world press.''  "
China Will Require ID for Cellphone Numbers; Noncompliance Means No Service,"BEIJING -- The Chinese government on Wednesday began to require cellphone users to furnish identification when buying SIM cards, a move officials cast as an effort to rein in burgeoning cellphone spam, pornography and fraud schemes. The requirement, which has been in the works for years, is not unlike rules in many developed nations that ask users to present credit card data or other proof of identification to buy cellphone numbers. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that about 40 percent of China's 800 million cellphone users were currently unidentified. Those users will be ordered to furnish identification by 2013 or lose their service, according to The Global Times, a state-run newspaper. A government center that deals with cellphone complaints said that the average Chinese cellphone user received a dozen spam messages a week, and that three of every four users received messages that involved fraud, China Daily, another state newspaper, reported Wednesday.  Some analysts, however, questioned whether the new requirement would substantially reduce illicit messages. Instead, they warned that the regulation potentially gives the government new tools to locate and punish individuals who send cellphone messages that censors deem unacceptable. The Chinese central government has steadily tightened its censorship of the Internet and wireless communications since 2008, blocking increasing numbers of Web sites, social networking services like Facebook and Twitter and, most recently, shutting down microblogs that it regards as subversive. The new regulation will be carried out largely by the three government-controlled companies -- China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom -- that provide cellular service. ''Is China prepared for this?'' David Bandurski, an author and media analyst at the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project, asked in a telephone interview. ''Does it have the legal framework and the institutions in place to guarantee they can do this and still protect the privacy of consumers?'' ''People are basically providing their phone numbers and ID numbers'' to the mobile carriers, he said. ''Those are the two most important pieces of information that most people have.'' In an article posted Wednesday on the China Media Project's Web site, a legal researcher at the government-sponsored Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Zhou Hanhua, expressed doubts that requiring users to register their names with the companies would control spam. The rules, he wrote, would probably initially create a black market in legally registered SIM cards that could be used for spam, and then spur hackers to find ways to circumvent the registration requirement. ''Technology innovation will soon trump the government's control,'' he wrote. Others were less concerned. A professor at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Zeng Jianqiu, said that real-name registration was essential if services now common in other nations, like payment by cellphone, were to become established in China. Privacy ''is a problem that needs to be considered seriously,'' he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ''The regulators and mobile operators also need to find ways to protect personal information. But I think some, like China Mobile and Telecom, are already doing this.'' Under the new policy, convenience stores and street vendors who have been selling anonymous SIM cards were to suspend sales on Wednesday, until they are trained to register their customers. Foreigners will also be required to furnish a passport or other identification when establishing cellphone service.  "
Tech Firms Fight European Limits on Cloud Computing,"BERLIN -- In the world of ideas, cloud computing has the potential to revolutionize the way people work. By bundling the processing power of thousands of computer servers, a company, for example, could allow two employees from different countries who speak different languages to communicate directly by phone, using voice recognition software to process what is being said and translation programs to interpret it into another language. The result, ideally, would be a seamless conversation, without struggle and without the limitations of speaking a foreign language. ''We're not quite there yet, but it's coming,'' Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, a promoter of the technology, said at a gathering of cellphone industry executives after evoking the image at a convention in Barcelona in February.  Such cloud-based breakthroughs face a formidable obstacle in Europe, however: strict privacy laws that place rigid limits on the movement of information beyond the borders of the 27-country European Union. European governments fear that personal information could fall prey to aggressive marketers and cybercriminals once it leaves the jurisdictions of individual members, a concern that may protect consumers but one that hinders the free flow of data essential to cloud computing ''There are restrictions on cloud computing in Europe,'' said Bob Lindsay, privacy director in Europe for Hewlett-Packard, which makes servers and other equipment for cloud data centers. ''This isn't killing the business, but it is slowing its evolution, compared with what is taking place in the United States.'' Cloud computing, which allows companies to tap enormous computing power via the Internet without having to invest in the infrastructure themselves, has grown rapidly in the United States under a legal system that permits the sale and transfer of many forms of private data. For its clients, the lure of cloud computing is the savings made possible by cutting in-house corporate information technology departments and hardware and software purchases. According to the research firm Gartner, global sales of cloud services will rise 17 percent this year, to $68.3 billion from $58.6 billion in 2009. About half of what Gartner defines to be cloud services are, in fact, the computing power involved in the display and tracking of Internet ads. The rest is sales of computing services, mostly to large businesses. Global sales of cloud services are poised nearly to double by 2012, to $102.1 billion, Gartner estimates. But Europe is expected to remain a relatively modest user of cloud services, accounting for only $18 billion this year, or about 26 percent of the global total. By 2012, Gartner estimates, Europe's proportion of global cloud sales will rise to 29 percent, even though the bloc's economy is larger than that of the United States. Facing legal obstacles in Europe, the U.S. businesses with the greatest stake in cloud computing -- primarily Microsoft, Google, H.P. and Oracle -- are lobbying lawmakers to loosen restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Alternatively, some are developing new methods to make cloud computing work within Europe's complicated legal landscape. At the H.P. Labs in Bristol, England, researchers are devising ways to encrypt data before it is sent into a cloud computing center and then decrypt it after it leaves the cloud, thus addressing the privacy concerns of many European governments. Another solution being studied is to give individuals the ability in advance to set the degree of privacy control on each part of their personal information in the cloud by digitally tagging bits of the data. Under this model, a person could make an e-mail address available to marketers, while shielding a phone number and street address from unwanted solicitations. In that aim, H.P. plans to begin testing new software that complies with European privacy laws this year. Called H.P. Privacy Advisor, the software will handle the transfer of data between H.P. offices within Europe as well as to those outside of the Union. ''The benefits and impact of the cloud are so great, and the legislative and technical issues are what they are at the moment,'' said Siani Pearson, one of H.P.'s lead researchers on cloud computing technologies at its laboratory in Bristol. ''But we can make sure that the benefits of the cloud come even within the existing framework.'' In Europe, the legal definition of what constitutes personal data is much broader than it is in the United States, extending to information like names, addresses and phone numbers in phone books. Another obstacle is the European Data Privacy Directive, the main body of European law governing international data transfers, which generally prohibits the movement of E.U. data outside the external borders of the European Union. The European Commission has approved only a handful of other countries to provide cloud computing services -- the United States, Argentina and Canada. Israel and Andorra have applied for approval to be designated as computing centers. Companies that want to process E.U. data in countries that have not been approved-- India and Malaysia are growing hubs for cloud computing data centers -- must negotiate and enter into binding legal agreements with data processors called service level agreements, which ensure that the personal information of E.U. citizens will be handled in accordance with E.U. regulations. But such agreements, while increasingly common, are costly, time-consuming to prepare and difficult to enforce, said Mr. Lindsay, H.P.'s privacy director, who is based in Milton Keynes, England. Backers of cloud computing technology are hoping the European Commission will loosen the rules applying to international data transfers during the review of its data protection directive, which was drafted in 1995, in the early days of the Internet. During the review, which began last year and is not expected to be completed before mid-2011, companies like Microsoft have urged the commission to streamline existing laws on international data transfers. The laws require companies to get the approval of several national data protection regulators for a single data transfer flowing through their jurisdictions. Under this framework, a Microsoft affiliate in Bulgaria, for example, seeking to send Bulgarian consumer data to a cloud center in the United States, might have to apply for and receive approval from regulators in a series of countries along the transmission route, which in this case could include Romania, Hungary, Austria, Germany and the Netherlands. In a letter sent in December 2009, John Vassallo, Microsoft's associate general counsel in Brussels, asked the commission to change the E.U.'s data protection directive to assign varying levels of privacy restrictions to different kinds of data, which could ease the transfer of some personal information, like names and addresses, for commercial marketing purposes if consumers gave their consent. ''As the patchwork of worldwide data protection laws has become increasingly difficult to navigate,'' Mr. Vassallo wrote to the commissioners, ''Microsoft has repeatedly called for a comprehensive, workable global privacy framework that is consistent, flexible, transparent and principles-based.'' Should the commission loosen the bloc's restrictive privacy controls, which is not guaranteed, European businesses, with their own multimillion-euro investments in in-house computer systems, employees and procedures, still might not rush to cloud computing. That is because European businesses, in general, are more reluctant than their U.S. counterparts to abandon their own costly investments in computing infrastructure and experiment with emerging technologies like cloud computing, said Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the Computer Lab at Cambridge University in England. ''European industry is an awful lot sleepier than industry in the United States,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''The tech industry has its center of gravity in the U.S.A. You will tend to find that it is high-tech firms there that are the keenest adopters of new technology.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Film Director Comes to the Defense of a Convicted Internet Pirate,"PARIS -- A Frenchman convicted of copyright theft for illegally downloading thousands of songs on the Internet has found an unlikely patron: a famous film director. Jean-Luc Godard, the 79-year-old director of movies like ''Breathless'' and ''Alphaville,'' has come to the support of James Climent, a photographer who faces a fine of 20,000 euros ($26,520) for violating musical copyrights. Mr. Climent, who lives in Barjac, a picturesque old town of artists and organic farmers in the Gard region of southern France, wants to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The highest French court rejected his last appeal in June, siding with music royalty collection agencies that brought the complaints against Mr. Climent five years ago.  Mr. Climent said Mr. Godard this month donated 1,000 euros to his fund, helping him get him more than halfway toward the 5,000 euros he needs for legal fees and other costs of taking his case to the European Court. While Mr. Godard's views on intellectual property are widely shared on the libertarian fringes of the Internet, they might seem surprising coming from a director who, under French law, retains editorial control over his work and derives financial benefit from it. Yet Mr. Godard, a pioneer of the New Wave of French cinema in the 1960s, whose films skewered the conventions of bourgeois society, clearly still delights in provoking the establishment, even if it could cost him money. Mr. Godard's support for Mr. Climent comes as the debate over file-sharing is growing ever more politically charged in France. Mr. Climent was convicted under longstanding copyright legislation. But now the authorities are ready to begin enforcement of a tough new law, under which the Internet connections of persistent pirates could be suspended. ''Downloading is a citizen's right,'' Mr. Climent said. ''Even if there is only a small chance, there is a chance that a favorable judgment could change the laws across Europe.'' Mr. Godard has yet to comment publicly on Mr. Climent's case, but he laid out the rationale for his opposition to French copyright rules in a recent interview with the cultural magazine Les Inrockuptibles, in which he declared, ''There is no such thing as intellectual property.'' ''Copyright really isn't feasible,'' Mr. Godard said. ''An author has no rights. I have no rights. I have only duties.'' Mr. Godard could not be reached, but an associate, who insisted on anonymity because the director had not authorized him to speak, confirmed the donation. Mr. Godard, the associate said, wanted to make a ''symbolic'' gesture to draw attention to what he described as Mr. Climent's plight. In addition to the money, Mr. Climent said he had received a handwritten note that included a picture of a model sailboat and the valediction, ''Surcouf, Jean-Luc Godard'' -- referring to Robert Surcouf, a maritime pirate of the French Revolutionary era. Mr. Godard's support for Mr. Climent reflects some unusual twists in the debate over piracy in France, where digital sales of media content from authorized, licensed services have been far slower to take hold than in the United States. The conservative government of President Nicolas Sarkozy has championed tough measures to strengthen intellectual property enforcement. His efforts have been fiercely resisted by the opposition Socialists, which poses a bit of a paradox since they are traditionally the party with closer links to the cultural establishment. The centerpiece of Mr. Sarkozy's crackdown on piracy is the so-called graduated response law, under which people who share digital songs, films or other media content could face the suspension of their Internet connections if they ignore repeated warnings to quit. The first e-mailed warnings will be sent to people accused of piracy within days, according to the government agency set up to administer the law. It could be many months, however, until the government's resolve to disconnect people from the Internet is actually tested; more than a year can pass before people accused sharing files will receive their final warning, notifying them that they may be taken to court. To have a chance of a hearing at the high court in Strasbourg, Mr. Climent must file suit there by the end of the year. European high court cases can drag on for years. Nicolas Gallon, Mr. Climent's lawyer, acknowledged that Mr. Climent's chances of victory were slim, given the series of judgments against him in France. ''In all honesty, it will be very difficult,'' said Mr. Gallon, who has previously represented other counterculture figures, like the French anti-globalization campaigner Jose Bove. ''We are not very optimistic. But we have to take this debate as far as we can.''  "
Official to Face Hearing Over Blog Attacks,"An assistant attorney general in Michigan has taken a personal leave of absence and may be disciplined for his online attacks on a gay campus leader at the University of Michigan.  The official, Andrew Shirvell, has drawn national attention -- and calls for his ouster -- because of his attacks through his personal blog on the student, Chris Armstrong, who is believed to be the first openly gay president of the university's student assembly. Mr. Shirvell has called Mr. Armstrong a racist with a ''radical homosexual agenda.'' Mr. Shirvell, will face a disciplinary hearing when he returns to work, a spokesman for the attorney general said Friday. Mr. Armstrong, 21, has filed for a personal protection order against Mr. Shirvell. University officials and students have come together to support Mr. Armstrong. The university has banned Mr. Shirvell from campus, and its president, Mary Sue Coleman, called his behavior reprehensible. ''As a community, we must not and will not accept displays of intolerance,'' Ms. Coleman said in a statement. A Facebook group called We Support Chris Armstrong had more than 10,600 supporters on Friday. The state's attorney general, Mike Cox, said earlier this week that Mr. Shirvell had a right to express his opinions when he was not at work even though his actions were ''offensive.'' But on Friday, Mr. Cox's office said that he decided to call a disciplinary hearing because more issues regarding Mr. Shirvell's conduct had come to light in recent days. The blog, which is called Chris Armstrong Watch, has been made private. In Mr. Armstrong's request for an order of protection, he said that Mr. Shirvell took pictures outside his house at 1:30 a.m. Efforts to reach Mr. Shirvell were unsuccessful, but in an interview on CNN, he said he had ''protested'' outside Mr. Armstrong's home. Mr. Shirvell, who made the point many times during the interview that he was a University of Michigan alum, said that one of his major issues with Mr. Armstrong was his campaign to create ''gender-neutral housing'' on campus where students could live with someone of the same or opposite sex. ''I have no problem with the fact that Chris is a homosexual,'' Mr. Shirvell said in the interview. ''I have a problem with the fact that he is advancing a very radical agenda.'' Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, weighed in via Twitter, saying, ''If I was still attorney general and Andrew Shirvell worked for me, he would have already been fired.'' David Leyton, the Democratic candidate for attorney general, demanded that Mr. Shirvell be fired. Mr. Armstrong, who did not respond to a request for an interview, was an intern this summer with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and in the past with the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund. Denis Dison, communications director at the fund, said that a public official should not be bullying students. ''We are advocating that nobody engage in the type of harassment that he was engaging in,'' Mr. Dison said.  "
"For Hackers, Bait In New Era of Devices","Researchers at Mocana, a security technology company in San Francisco, recently discovered they could hack into a best-selling Internet-ready HDTV model with unsettling ease. They found a hole in the software that helps display Web sites on the TV and leveraged that flaw to control information being sent to the television. They could put up a fake screen for a site like Amazon.com and then request credit card billing details for a purchase. They could also monitor data being sent from the TV to sites. ''Consumer electronics makers as a class seem to be rushing to connect all their products to the Internet,'' said Adrian Turner, Mocana's chief executive. ''I can tell you for a fact that the design teams at these companies have not put enough thought into security.'' Mocana and firms like it sell technology for protecting devices and often try to publicize potential threats. But the Mocana test also illustrates what security experts have long warned: that the arrival of Internet TVs, smartphones and other popular Web-ready gadgets will usher in a new era of threats by presenting easy targets for hackers.  As these devices become more popular, experts say, consumers can expect to run into familiar scams like credit card number thefts as well as new ones that play off features in the products. And because the devices are relatively new, they do not yet have as much protection as more traditional products, like desktop computers, do. ''When it comes to where the majority of computing horsepower resides, you're seeing a shift from the desktop to mobile devices and Web-connected products, and inevitably, that will trigger a change in focus within the hacking community,'' said K. Scott Morrison, the chief technology officer at Layer 7 Technologies, which helps companies manage their business software and infrastructure. ''I really do believe this is the new frontier for the hacking community.'' To combat the threat, security companies have been pushing to develop new protection models. They are promoting items like fingerprint scanners and face recognition on devices, and tools that can disable a device or freeze its data if an attack is reported. But so far, such security measures have largely failed to reach the mainstream. Enrique Salem, the chief executive at Symantec, which makes antivirus software frequently installed on PCs, said it was unlikely that his company would produce the same kind of software for all of the new products. Such software can require a fair amount of computing muscle, which would put too much burden on devices that lack the oomph and battery life of traditional computers. And second, the attacks that Symantec and others have seen on the devices are so new that they will require a fresh approach, he said. ''With something like Android, it's a different type of threat and it functions differently,'' Mr. Salem said. Symantec will focus on fingerprint scanners and other personal identifiers to devices, Mr. Salem said. The company also hopes to use features in the devices to help with protection. For example, if someone logs in to a computer from Florida, but location-tracking data says that the person's phone is in Texas, then an application might ask a security question. Another goal is to let consumers report a possible security problem and get their data locked down or erased remotely until the problem is cleared up. ''You want that ability to wipe the data away if a device is lost,'' Mr. Salem said. The chip maker Intel recently bought Symantec's main security technology rival, McAfee, for $7.7 billion. Intel executives say they plan to build some of McAfee's technology into future chips that will go into mobile phones and other newer devices. Cellphones have been connected to the Web for years, but for much of that time, they tended to have tightly controlled, limited software and other constraints that made it difficult for hackers to do much damage. Attackers continued to find easier targets, and a larger pool of potential victims, by going after PCs running Microsoft Windows and other popular Web software. But these days, smartphones have many more capabilities. And smartphone shipments have hit a critical mass that makes them worth a hacker's while. Also, Apple, Google, Nokia and others are in a race to fill their online mobile software stores applications. These companies have review mechanisms that try to catch malicious software, but the volume of new apps coupled with hackers' wile make it difficult to catch every bad actor. With Android, in particular, Google has fostered a vibrant and chaotic smartphone platform in which companies of various shapes, sizes and standards have rushed out devices and complementary applications. Unlike Apple, Google does not approve applications one by one. Instead, it asks software makers to state what phone functions their applications tap into and to present that information to consumers. People can then decide if they are willing to download the application, and they can post online reviews for the software. A Google spokesman said that the company expected consumers to perform this type of self-policing and added that Google quickly investigated applications that received complaints. Still, there is a Wild West vibe to the smartphone market these days as smaller, unproven manufacturers have followed the likes of Apple, Nokia and Motorola in making smartphones. ''The good smartphones have been pretty well designed,'' said Mr. Morrison of Layer 7 Technologies. ''The problem now is the flood of secondary phones that bring interesting diversity and also open up holes for hackers.'' Security companies have issued repeated warnings that hackers have already started to capitalize on the application stores. The companies also caution that and hackers have discovered fake programs that try steal passwords or make expensive phone calls. Jimmy Shah, a mobile security researcher at McAfee Labs, said the company had run into so-called smishing attacks, a variation on phishing, in which someone is sent a deceptive text message that appears to have come from a bank or a retailer. Often, the message will ask the person to call a customer support line, at which point the attackers try to coax valuable information from the victim. Mr. Morrison said another concern was that hackers would concentrate on trying to run up people's phone bills or find ways to tap into the location-tracking services tied to phones. ''It is like a stalker's dream,'' he said. The flood of Web-enabled devices hitting the market, like the one the Mocana researchers hacked into, may be a more immediate threat. Mr. Turner of Mocana said the maker of that television had left crucial bits of information about its security credentials and those of third parties in an easy-to-reach spot, meaning that a hacker could infiltrate some of the data exchanged between companies providing commerce services for the TV. Mocana has notified the TV maker of the issues and has declined to reveal the company's identity in a bid to thwart hackers. Mr. Turner would say it was one of the five best-selling Web-ready HDTVs. ''The things we found were mistakes that an inexperienced device designer would make when connecting something to the Internet for the first time,'' Mr. Turner said.  "
Experts Warn of a Weak Link in the Security of Web Sites,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Computer security researchers are raising alarms about vulnerabilities in some of the Web's most secure corners: the banking, e-commerce and other sites that use encryption to communicate with their users. Those sites, which are typically identified by a closed lock displayed somewhere in the Web browser, rely on a third-party organization to issue a certificate that guarantees to a user's Web browser that the sites are authentic. But as the number of such third-party ''certificate authorities'' has proliferated into hundreds spread across the world, it has become increasingly difficult to trust that those who issue the certificates are not misusing them to eavesdrop on the activities of Internet users, the security experts say. ''It is becoming one of the weaker links that we have to worry about,'' said Peter Eckersley, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online civil liberties group.  The power to appoint certificate authorities has been delegated by browser makers like Microsoft, Mozilla, Google and Apple to various companies, including Verizon. Those entities, in turn, have certified others, creating a proliferation of trusted ''certificate authorities,'' according to Internet security researchers. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, more than 650 organizations can issue certificates that will be accepted by Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Mozilla's Firefox, the two most popular Web browsers. Some of these organizations are in countries like Russia and China, which are suspected of engaging in widespread surveillance of their citizens. Mr. Eckersley said Exhibit No. 1 of the weak links in the chain is Etisalat, a wireless carrier in the United Arab Emirates that he said was involved in the dispute between the BlackBerry maker, Research In Motion, and that country over encryption. The U.A.E. threatened to discontinue some BlackBerry services because of R.I.M.'s refusal to offer a surveillance back door to its customers' encrypted communications. Mr. Eckersley also said that Etisalat was found to have installed spyware on the handsets of some 100,000 BlackBerry subscribers last year. Research In Motion later issued patches to remove the malicious code. Yet Mr. Eckersley said that Etisalat was one of the ''certificate authorities'' and could misuse its position to eavesdrop on the activities of Internet users. In an open letter signed by Mr. Eckersley, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is asking Verizon, which issued Etisalat's power to certify Web sites, to consider revoking that authority. Verizon declined to comment. Etisalat did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment. Mr. Eckersley wrote that Etisalat could issue fake certificates to itself for scores of Web sites, including google.com, Microsoft.com and Verizon.com, and ''use those certificates to conduct virtually undetectable surveillance and attacks against those sites.'' Etisalat could also eavesdrop on virtual private networks used by corporations to communicate securely around the world, he wrote. ''We believe this situation constitutes an unacceptable security risk to the Internet in general and especially to foreigners who use Etisalat's data services when they travel,'' he wrote, adding that the foundation did not know whether Etisalat had misused its authority yet. Concerns about certificates have been raised before. When Firefox considered granting certificate authority to a Chinese company earlier this year, members of the Firefox community worried that the company might be pressured by the government to eavesdrop, for example, on the Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents. Eventually, Firefox decided to go ahead with the process. Other security experts said that they were concerned about the proliferation of certificate authorities. ''I think it is a really big deal,'' said Stephen Schultze, associate director of the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University. Mr. Schultze said that the problem ''is not a reason to panic and stop doing online banking or e-commerce. But it is a bad enough problem that it should be receiving a lot more attention and we should be trying to fix it.'' Some browser makers, however, suggested that while attacks were possible in theory, the system had worked reasonably well for more than a decade. ''It has proven itself historically to be relatively secure,'' said Johnathan Nightingale, Mozilla's director of Firefox development. Mr. Nightingale said that many e-commerce sites were using a new type of certificate that required extensive verification. If a certificate authority was misusing its power to eavesdrop, he said, a user with technical skills could detect the attack, and the organization's power to issue certificates would be revoked.  "
Shoppers Who Can't Have Secrets,"IT'S called behavioral tracking:   Cameras that can follow you from the minute you enter a store to the moment you hit the checkout counter, recording every T-shirt you touch, every mannequin you ogle, every time you blow your nose or stop to tie your shoelaces.   Web coupons embedded with bar codes that can identify, and alert retailers to, the search terms you used to find them and, in some cases, even your Facebook information and your name.   Mobile marketers that can find you near a store clothing rack, and send ads to your cellphone based on your past preferences and behavior.    To be sure, such retail innovations help companies identify their most profitable client segments, better predict the deals shoppers will pursue, fine-tune customer service down to a person and foster brand loyalty. (My colleagues Stephanie Rosenbloom and Stephanie Clifford have written in detail about the  tracking prowess of store cameras and  Web coupons.)       But these and other  surveillance techniques are also reminders that advances in data collection are far outpacing personal data protection.     Enter the post-privacy society, where we have lost track of how many entities are tracking us. Not to mention what they are doing with our personal information, how they are storing it, whom they might be selling our dossiers to and, yes, how much money they are making from them.   On the way out, consumer advocates say, is that quaint old notion of informed consent, in which a company clearly  notifies you of its policies and gives you the choice of whether to opt in (rather than having  you  opt out once you discover your behavior is  being tracked).   ''How does notice and choice work when you don't even interface with the company that has your data?'' says Jessica Rich,  a deputy director of the bureau of consumer protection at the Federal Trade Commission.   The commission has brought several dozen complaints against companies about  possibly deceptive or unfair data collection and nearly 30 complaints over data security issues. In 2009, the commission proposed new guidelines for Web advertising that is tailored to user behavior.   The problem is, the F.T.C.'s guidelines are merely recommendations. Corporations can choose to follow them -- or not. And the online advertising standards don't apply to off-line techniques like observation in stores.   Mike Zaneis, vice president for public policy at the  Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade association based in Manhattan, says the advertising industry is not generally collecting personally identifiable data.    His group has worked closely with the F.T.C. on industry self-regulation, he says, and is developing new industry standards to alert consumers as they encounter ads based on their online behavior.    In the meantime, Mr. Zaneis says,  consumers can use an industry program if they want to opt out of some behavior-based ads. As for mobile marketing, he says, consumers are always asked if they want to opt in to ads related to their cellphone location.   The larger issue here is not the invasion of any one person's privacy as much as the explosive growth of a collective industry in behavioral information, says Jeff Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group that works to safeguard user privacy.   ''The whole business model is unfettered data collection of all your activities online and off,'' Mr. Chester  says. For example, he says that when consumers opt into cellphone ads, they may not understand that marketers  may link their locations with information from third-party databases. The result, he says, is mobile dossiers  about individual consumers.   As contradictory as it might sound, we need new strategies for transparent consumer surveillance.   In a country where we have a comprehensive federal law -- the Fair Credit Reporting Act -- giving us the right to obtain and correct financial data collected about us,  no general federal statute requires behavioral data marketers to show us our  files, says Ms. Rich of the F.T.C.   So, is the European model, involving independent government agencies called Data Protection Commissions that are charged with safeguarding people's personal information, better than ours?    Europe's privacy commissioners have generally been more forward-looking, examining potential privacy intrusions like biometric tracking, while the F.T.C. is still trying to  understand the magnitude and the implications of  the Web, says Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research group in Washington.    ''The U.S. system with regard to privacy is not working,'' Mr. Rotenberg says.   By early fall, the F.T.C. plans to propose comprehensive new privacy guidelines  intended to provide greater tools for transparency and better consumer control of personal information,  Ms. Rich says.   In the meantime, what if consumers  take a more active interest in who is collecting information about them?   In a recent documentary called ''Erasing David,'' the London-based filmmaker David Bond attempts to disappear from Britain's surveillance grid, hiring experts from the security firm Cerberus to  track him using all the information they can glean about him while he tries to outrun them. In the course of the film, the detectives even obtain a copy of the birth certificate of his daughter, then 18 months old.   But the real shocker is the information Mr. Bond is able to obtain about himself -- by taking advantage of a data protection law in Britain that requires public agencies and private businesses to release a person's data file upon his or her  written request.   In one scene, Mr. Bond receives a phonebook-thick printout from Amazon.com listing everything he ever bought on the site; the addresses of every person to whom he ever sent a gift; and even the products he perused but did not ultimately buy.    He also receives a file from his bank, including a transcript of an irate phone call he once made after the bank lost one of his checks. The transcript noted that he seemed angry and raised his voice.    ''It read like a mini-Stasi file,'' Mr. Bond said when I called him last week. When recorded messages inform us that we may be taped ''for training or quality assurance purposes,'' he reminded me, we should remember that our conversation may end up in our dossiers.   INSPIRED by Mr. Bond's odyssey,  I called some  companies with whom I do business.   A customer service representative at a bookstore chain where I have a discount card told me that the company maintains a list of the amount each member spends on each transaction so that the store can tell people how much money they saved at the end of the year. But a loyalty cardholder is not permitted to obtain his or her own purchase history.   Then I called an online travel agency and asked if I could get copies of my flight history and phone transcripts. I was regretting a disgruntled call I made to the agency a few months ago after being stranded at an airport in a blizzard. The customer care rep said clients couldn't obtain their own transcripts unless it was for legal purposes.   Was I being taped this time, too? They always tape, he said.   "
"In Germany, a Criminal Inquiry Is Opened on Google's Data-Gathering","BERLIN -- Prosecutors in Hamburg opened a criminal investigation of Google on Wednesday over its collecting of private Internet data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks in Germany.    The action in the city-state of Hamburg, where Google's German headquarters is located, could increase pressure on the company to turn over one of the hard drives used in its data-gathering effort, something Google has declined to do thus far.    German data protection officials on Monday set a May 26 deadline for Google to hand over a hard drive from one of the roving vehicles it used to compile its 360-degree Street View photo mapping archive.     The investigation, which will determine whether prosecutors bring criminal charges against Google employees, came in response to a complaint filed Monday by Jens Ferner, a law student from Alsdorf, Germany. Mr. Ferner said he wanted to clarify German law regarding the collection of data from unsecured wireless networks.    ''We are absolutely at an early stage,'' Wilhelm Mollers, a spokesman for the Hamburg prosecutor's office, said in an interview. ''This isn't something that will be wrapped up in two or three weeks. We have to analyze whether there is reason to file criminal charges.''    Under pressure from German privacy regulators, Google said Friday that it had inadvertently collected 600 gigabytes of data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks around the world as it assembled its Street View archive. Google said the data, which it has described as snippets of Web sites and the contents of personal e-mail messages, was collected as a result of a programming error. The company has offered to destroy the data, in conjunction with regulators.    Kay Oberbeck, a Google spokesman in Hamburg, said Wednesday that ''as we have said since we made our announcement last week, we are working with the relevant authorities to answer their questions and concerns.''    Google so far has not agreed to turn over one of its hard drives to German authorities for inspection. Under German law, a conviction for illegal data-gathering carries a two-year prison sentence or a fine.    Mr. Mollers said it was too early to say whether prosecutors would ask Google for one of the hard drives as part of the criminal investigation.    Johannes Caspar, the Hamburg data protection supervisor who made the original request to Google to inspect one of the hard drives, said he met  Wednesday with Google executives to discuss Street View and the improperly obtained data.    Mr. Caspar said the Google representatives did not commit to supplying one of the hard drives by the deadline next Wednesday. ''But they assured me that we would have an answer to our request by then,'' Mr. Caspar said in an interview. ''It can be that this separate criminal investigation may increase their readiness to meet our request. I don't know.''    While accepted in Britain and France, Street View has encountered resistance in Germany and Switzerland, where privacy laws are stricter than in the rest of Europe and opposition to the 360-degree photo archive has been growing.    F.T.C. Query on Google   WASHINGTON (Reuters)  --  Two lawmakers who are co-chairmen of  the Congressional Privacy Caucus asked the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday  if Google broke the law in collecting Wi-Fi and other Internet data while taking photographs for its Street View product.   Representatives Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, and Edward Markey,  Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote to the F.T.C. chairman to ask if the agency was looking into the data collection, which Google has said was ''a mistake.''   Google said on Friday that its fleet of cars responsible for photographing streets around the world had for several years collected personal information sent by consumers over wireless networks.   Mr. Barton and Mr. Markey asked the F.T.C. how the data had been  collected and stored, and who had access to it. They also asked if the data collection had violated a reasonable expectation of privacy and if the practice had been deceptive or illegal.   The F.T.C. confirmed receipt of the letter, but had no immediate comment.   "
Europe Says Search Firms Are Violating Data Rules,"BERLIN -- European Union officials on Wednesday said Google, Microsoft and Yahoo had violated rules  by keeping data on individual computer users for too long.    A group of 27  European national privacy chiefs said it would also ask the United States Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether the data retention practices of the three companies violated American law.    In a letter sent Wednesday, the advisory panel to the European Commission asked the three companies to appoint outside auditors to verify that their practices of rendering individual data anonymous truly eliminated all links to individuals.     Under European Union data protection rules, search engines are required to sever all traceable links to individual computer users completely and irrevocably after six months.    European data protection officials have been urging the search engines since 2007 to shorten the time they retain information on computer users. In response, the engines have cut retention periods from 18 months, but the moves are still not enough to satisfy the regulators.    Of the three companies, Microsoft, which operates the Bing search engine, has said it would  comply with the commission's request to render data from individuals anonymous after six months, but it still plans to retain software cookies and other session identifiers for 18 months.    Google retains data for nine months, and Yahoo has said it will remove part of a computer's unique identification number, the Internet protocol address, after 90 days but reserved the right to recreate individual logs at the request of law enforcement authorities.    In its letter to the three companies, the panel of privacy chiefs, called the Article 29 Working Party, said all three methods were insufficient and violated European Union data protection rules.    The data in question includes all types of information that a computer user enters into a search engine field, which is then collected to build a personal profile of preferences that can help search engines direct ads more narrowly to individuals.    Search engines say they need to keep the data longer to make the search process more efficient and relevant.    In its letter, the European group singled out Google, the global search leader, which has about 80 percent of the European search market, according to comScore, a research firm.    ''Considering Google's dominant position in almost every E.U. member state, with a market share of up to 95 percent in some national search engine markets, the company has a significant role in European citizens' daily lives,'' the European panel wrote. ''The company's apparent lack of focus in data retention is concerning.''    A Google spokesman, Al Verney, said the company had not yet received the letter from the panel, but he said that the group apparently had asked questions of all major search engines, not just Google.    ''Google was the first search engine to reduce the time it stores search logs,'' and the first to make them anonymous, Mr. Verney said.     ''We develop our policies,'' he added, ''based on what provides the best experience for users both in terms of respect for their privacy and the quality and security of our services. Our current retention policy represents the most responsible balance between these two important concerns.''    In a related privacy issue, Google balked at a German government regulator's request to surrender Internet data it had improperly collected from unsecured wireless networks there, saying the company needed more time to resolve legal issues.   ''As granting access to payload data creates legal challenges in Germany which we need to review, we are continuing to discuss the appropriate legal and logistical process for making the data available,'' said Peter Barron, a Google spokesman in London. ''We hope, given more time, to be able to resolve this difficult issue.''   The data protection supervisor in Hamburg, Johannes Caspar, had given Google until midnight Wednesday in Germany to surrender the data or risk unspecified sanctions. Mr. Caspar was not immediately available for comment.   Google collected the data over unsecured Wi-Fi networks while compiling its Street View photo map archive.   "
Stage Set for Showdown on Online Privacy,"WASHINGTON -- After ''do not call'' lists became popular, more than 90 percent of people who signed up reported fewer annoying telemarketing calls. Now, privacy advocates are pushing for a similar ''do not track'' feature that would let Internet users tell Web sites to stop surreptitiously tracking their online habits and collecting clues about age, salary, health, location and leisure activities. That proposal and other ideas to protect online privacy are setting up a confrontation among Internet companies, federal regulators, the Obama administration and Congress over how strict any new rules should be. In the next few weeks, both the Federal Trade Commission and the Commerce Department are planning to release independent, and possibly conflicting, reports about online privacy.  Top Commerce officials have indicated that the department favors letting the industry regulate itself, building on the common practice of user agreements where companies post their privacy policies online or consumers check a box agreeing to abide by them. Top trade commission officials, however, have indicated they are exploring a stricter standard, one that requires a ''do not track'' option on a Web site or browser similar to the ''do not call'' lists. The two agencies have even tangled over which will release its report first, a decision that could set the tone for the clash to follow. People close to the talks say that, at least for now, the Commerce Department has been given the nod, provided it can complete its report soon. Consumer advocates worry that the competing agendas of economic policy makers in the Obama administration, who want uniform international standards, and federal regulators, who are trying to balance consumer protection and commercial rights, will neglect the interests of people most affected by the privacy policies. ''I hope they realize that what is good for consumers is ultimately good for business,'' said Susan Grant, director of consumer protection at the Consumer Federation of America. In addition, the major online companies have the reports in their sights, worried over a raft of potential new regulations. They would prefer that the industry continue to police itself. ''Targeted ads are helpful and ad competition is helpful,'' said Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, which owns the online advertising exchange DoubleClick. In a conversation last week at The New York Times, Mr. Schmidt said that the explosion in online consumer monitoring was increasing friction about how strict the privacy limits should be. And, he added, ''it's going to get a lot worse.'' The White House, meanwhile, has broader goals. It set up its own interagency panel that will look at how to protect consumers while also making United States companies more competitive internationally. It also wants to ensure that any restrictions do not impede law enforcement and national security efforts. Congress also is expected to intervene, and this may be one area where there is bipartisan cooperation. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the trade commission and privacy issues, will soon have a Republican at its head, but members of both parties in the House and Senate have recently called on companies to account for intrusions or breaches of consumer privacy. Which agency or group leads the debate could go a long way toward determining the result. ''There is going to be a lot of confusion over the competing proposals and which version Congress and the American people should pay attention to,'' said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer advocacy group. ''We especially fear a policy that is designed to advance the competitive positions of U.S. companies and will undermine new pro-consumer protections at the F.T.C.'' Officially, Commerce Department and trade commission officials say they see the two reports as complementary. The commission will most likely address ''privacy by design,'' or how privacy features may be built into browsers or Web sites. It will also encourage greater transparency about when data is being collected and how it will be used, and the need for clearly worded privacy or user notices. The Commerce Department will focus on global and domestic privacy laws, and will have a broad perspective on privacy issues, officials say. In an address last month at a meeting of privacy commissioners in Jerusalem, Lawrence E. Strickling, an assistant Commerce secretary, said he believed in ''a strong role for voluntary but enforceable codes of conduct.'' Jon Leibowitz, the trade commission's chairman, told Congress in July that the commission was exploring a stronger standard -- whether to propose a ''do not track'' feature. Julie Brill, an F.T.C. commissioner, said she would personally favor such a mechanism. According to Lee Tien, a senior attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a ''do not track'' system most likely would be built into a Web browser or function as a plug-in. It would send a signal telling a Web site and the content providers and advertisers that the user did not want to be tracked. That would differ from current browser settings, which can prevent the placement of cookies on a computer. ''It's a policy complication, not a technological complication,'' Mr. Tien said. Marketers hate the idea. ''You simply can't just turn off tracking,'' said Mike Zaneis, a vice president at the Interactive Advertising Bureau. ''That's the way interconnected systems talk to each other.'' Such a mechanism, he added, would be ''troubling and difficult to implement at a technology level.'' Consumer advocates worry that the Commerce Department will look more after businesses than after consumers, perhaps undermining the ability of the trade commission to enforce the rules, whatever they turn out to be. The Commerce Department announced its intention to conduct its own privacy study in April, roughly six months after the trade commission began its project, leaving consumer advocates thinking that the two bureaucracies didn't see eye to eye. ''The Commerce Department has never been a consumer advocacy agency,'' said Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the United States Public Interest Research Group. ''They generally take the view of protecting special interests.'' Commerce Department officials say they have planned to address privacy rights since the 2008 presidential campaign. ''In the 1990s, the Commerce Department had an extremely prominent role in developing what we think of as Internet policy, and we are reinvigorating that historical role,'' said Marc Berejka, a senior policy adviser there. David C. Vladeck, the director of the bureau of consumer protection at the F.T.C., said the agency would keep its focus on enforcing the law. ''Because we have the franchise on policy enforcement, we will undoubtedly retain a leading voice on privacy policy,'' Mr. Vladeck said. While both agencies say they will propose strengthening privacy protections, the Obama administration is also worried about the prospect of tougher international privacy standards. Last week, the European Commissioncalled for stronger Internet privacy protections and for an overhaul of the European Union's privacy rules to address social networking and targeted ads. European nations can also draft their own standards.  "
Reducing the Anxiety of Paying Online,"Last year, 92 million people bought things online using  credit cards, debit cards and services like PayPal and Google Checkout. Millions of others paid bills and wired money electronically from bank accounts with just a few clicks.   Despite the apparent popularity of all these services, they still cause nagging anxiety for many of us.   We wonder, how secure are these payment systems? Will I be out the money if someone steals my account numbers and goes on a wild shopping spree or bleeds my savings dry?    Deciding which online payment method to use would seem to be a simple matter of picking whichever offers higher security. But the wise consumer also weighs the legal protections in the case of theft: the best security and the lowest liability don't necessarily go together.     Here's the lowdown on the risks associated with the most popular ways to pay online:   CREDIT CARDS After you hear some of the horror stories, using a credit card online may seem as risky as Russian roulette. Crooks can and frequently do capture card numbers by sneaking malware onto home computers or by tricking people into revealing numbers in ''phishing'' schemes in which people unwittingly type in the numbers on fake sites. Some thieves  hack shopping sites.    There are a few precautions everyone should take. First, look for signs of quality security  at sites you use, like logos, or seals, from security providers like VeriSign and McAfee, said Aleksandr Yampolskiy, director of security at the luxury shopping site Gilt Groupe. To check that a seal is legitimate, click on it to make sure it takes you to the verification page of the security service.    Also make sure that  ''https'' appears in the address bar, because that indicates that digital transmissions from the site are being encrypted, Mr. Yampolskiy said.    Security seals, however, are just a starting point, not a guarantee a site is secure. They affirm only that it has met specific criteria set by that security service. And the lack of a seal doesn't necessarily mean a site is risky. So use common sense when deciding which merchants to do business with. For instance, it isn't wise to shop at a site you reached by clicking on a spam e-mail. If you're suspicious of a site, run its name through a search engine and see if there are complaints from other shoppers.   SSL encryption, which is indicated by the ''s'' in ''https'' in the address bar and a padlock icon in the lower right-hand corner of the browser,  is your best insurance against theft of your data while it's being transmitted.    Sending your personal data across a network is a key moment of vulnerability, said Robert Zigweid, a senior security consultant at IOActive, which helps companies secure their sites and networks. Responsible sites will automatically use ''https'' on pages where sensitive information is sent and received.    If you get a pop-up or other warning that something is wrong with a site's SSL certificate,  ''back away,'' said Tim Callan, vice president at VeriSign. Professional, well-put-together sites do not tend to have certificates that are expired or have other problems.    And since shady sites can use encryption, too, also check the address bar for a bit of green or the site owner's name written in green. (Recent versions of major browsers all now use green in some way to indicate the existence of another layer of security called an extended validation SSL certificate). It indicates that the site you're visiting has been vetted and belongs to a legitimate company; it is not a phishing site. You will certainly see green on larger e-commerce sites and on bank sites.   None of this encryption will help you if you're infected with malware known as a keylogger. It captures your keystrokes and images from your screen and then sends them to hackers. Your only real line of defense is to use security software and install all the updates from that software and all the other software you use.   Password-management software can also help. This stores your login information and, typically, the personal data used in Web forms in an encrypted place on your computer. You can then enter this sensitive data onto Web site forms without retyping it.   Now that you are frightened enough, here's the good news about online payments: There is little to worry about using credit cards online, because the risk of loss from unauthorized charges, by law, is almost nil.    ''The strongest protections are when you pay by credit card,'' says Carole Reynolds, a senior lawyer at the Federal Trade Commission. Under the  Truth in Lending Act, consumers' maximum liability for unauthorized use of their credit card is only $50, and when a card is used online, it's zero.    If you report fraud quickly, banks will typically reverse the charges rapidly and without much fuss, though in these tight times banks are scrutinizing fraud claims more closely, says Avivah Litan, a payment-fraud expert at research firm Gartner.    For extra protection against having your card number stolen, consider using one-time credit card numbers for online purchases, which you can often set up with your card provider.   DEBIT CARDS Using debit cards online is a bit riskier. These transactions, which draw directly from your bank account, are subject to a different federal law, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. This law provides considerable protection from liability, but the level of protection diminishes as time passes.    If you report unauthorized charges on a debit card within two business days of discovering the problem, your liability is limited to $50 offline and zero for online transactions, Ms. Reynolds says. If you neglect to do that, but report the loss within 60 days of the date your bank sent the statement listing the bogus transactions, your liability is capped at $500 for offline transactions and remains zero online. If you miss those deadlines, however, you could end up in a bigger mess. Ms. Reynolds warned that your liability could be unlimited.  (See a related blog post at nyti.ms/6VEItV for other information.)    PAYMENT SERVICES AND BILL PAYMENT Shopping online using services like PayPal, Google Checkout and BillMeLater offer some useful additional security because you entrust your sensitive account information to one company and not to every online store you may buy something from. This can be a good idea, especially if you frequently buy from little-known merchants that may not have top-notch Web defenses.    But Ms. Litan warns that if your PayPal account is used fraudulently, it may be harder to get your money back than if you use a credit card.    For those who pay bills online, note that, like debit cards, online bank accounts -- savings, checking and other personal ''asset accounts'' -- are covered by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, so your responsibility for unauthorized transactions is limited depending on when you discover and report fraud.    So even if your computer becomes infected with a malicious program and thieves are able to steal your password and plunder your bank account, you will get your money back if you catch it quickly. Ms. Litan says it's a good idea to set up automatic bill payments with your bank, as opposed to individual billers like the gas company or the day care provider, because banks and their payment processors are generally better at protecting data than merchants.

BlackBerry's Maker Resists Pressure From Mideast Governments,"A top executive of Research In Motion, the Canadian company that makes BlackBerry smartphones, said on Tuesday that his company would not give in to pressure from foreign governments to provide access to its customers' messages. That pressure increased on Tuesday as Saudi Arabia ordered local cellphone providers to halt BlackBerry service, saying it failed to meet the country's regulatory requirements. Mike Lazaridis, founder and co-chief executive of R.I.M, said in an interview that allowing governments to monitor messages shuttling across the BlackBerry network could endanger the company's relationships with its customers, which include major companies and law enforcement agencies.  ''We're not going to compromise that,'' Mr. Lazaridis said. ''That's what's made BlackBerry the No. 1 solution worldwide.'' Similarly, the United Arab Emirates announced on Sunday that it would block BlackBerry e-mail and text-messaging services beginning in October. Several governments have cited national security concerns in demanding that R.I.M. open up its system. Like the Emirates, Saudi Arabia has expressed concern about BlackBerry's highly encrypted data service, which makes it difficult to monitor communications. The suspension in Saudi Arabia is to take effect this month, according to the state-owned Saudi Press Agency. Mr. Lazaridis denied reports that the company had already granted special concessions to the governments of countries like India and China, which have large numbers of BlackBerry owners. ''That's absolutely ridiculous and patently false,'' he said. Mr. Lazaridis said the encryption that was causing alarm among foreign governments was used for many other purposes, including e-commerce transactions, teleconferencing and electronic money transfers. ''If you were to ban strong encryption, you would shut down corporations, business, commerce, banking and the Internet,'' he said. ''Effectively, you'd shut it all down. That's not likely going to happen.'' Mr. Lazaridis expressed sympathy for the concerns of the Persian Gulf nations. ''I am very empathetic to their concerns and what they go through,'' Mr. Lazaridis said. ''But every country goes through these things. We have to be prepared for the ramifications of the decisions we make.'' R.I.M. issued a statement Tuesday that was intended to reassure customers, saying that ''customers of the BlackBerry enterprise solution can maintain confidence in the integrity of the security architecture without fear of compromise.'' Jonathan Zittrain, a professor of law and computer science at Harvard and co-founder of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, said the statement appeared to address only the products that the company sold to corporate customers, not those it sells directly to consumers. Corporate customers tend to be of less concern to governments, he said, because criminals or terrorists are less likely to engage in illegal activities from corporate e-mail systems, and because governments can go directly to those corporations to obtain employees' information. ''This doesn't put the main question to rest,'' Professor Zittrain said. ''It doesn't explain under what circumstances would the average BlackBerry user have his communications exposed.'' A spokeswoman for R.I.M. said the company would not elaborate on its statement. Mr. Lazaridis spoke after a press conference in Manhattan at which executives from AT&T and R.I.M. introduced the BlackBerry Torch 9800, the company's first phone with both a touch screen and a slide-out keyboard. The Torch, which costs $199 with a two-year data plan, will be sold exclusively for AT&T's network beginning Aug. 12. It has a 5-megapixel camera with a flash and runs a new version of R.I.M.'s mobile operating system called BlackBerry 6. Don Lindsay, vice president for user experience at R.I.M., pointed out the phone's new software features, which include a redesigned home screen, improved support for multimedia and applications and a better Web browser. ''It's not about bringing something new to BlackBerry but improving what we do best,'' he said. Research In Motion has a lot riding on the release of the Torch. The company has been losing market share and mindshare to Apple and Google as more users clamor for the iPhone and smartphones powered by Android, Google's mobile operating system. For R.I.M., this competition has increased the importance of markets in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. A report released on Monday by Nielsen said sales of R.I.M. devices to new subscribers in the United States were slowing, and that 29 percent of BlackBerry users had considered switching to the iPhone. Another report from the research firm Canalys said that in the second quarter, Android sales were up nearly 900 percent from a year ago, claiming 34 percent of the market in the United States. By comparison, Research In Motion had 32 percent, and Apple staked out 21.7 percent of the market. A year ago, R.I.M.'s share was 45 percent.  "
Cyberwar Chief Calls for Secure Computer Network,"FORT MEADE, Md. -- The new commander of the military's cyberwarfare operations is advocating the creation of a separate, secure computer network to protect civilian government agencies and critical industries like the nation's power grid against attacks mounted over the Internet. The officer, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, suggested that such a heavily restricted network would allow the government to impose greater protections for the nation's vital, official on-line operations. General Alexander labeled the new network ''a secure zone, a protected zone.'' Others have nicknamed it ''dot-secure.''  It would provide to essential networks like those that tie together the banking, aviation, and public utility systems the kind of protection that the military has built around secret military and diplomatic communications networks -- although even these are not completely invulnerable. For years, experts have warned of the risks of Internet attacks on civilian networks. An article published a few months ago by the National Academy of Engineering said that ''cyber systems are the 'weakest link' in the electricity system,'' and that ''security must be designed into the system from the start, not glued on as an afterthought.'' General Alexander, an Army officer who leads the military's new Cyber Command, did not explain just where the fence should be built between the conventional Internet and his proposed secure zone, or how the gates would be opened to allow appropriate access to information they need every day. General Alexander said the White House hopes to complete a policy review on cyber issues in time for Congress to debate updated or new legislation when it convenes in January. General Alexander's new command is responsible for defending Defense Department computer networks and, if directed by the president, carrying out computer-network attacks overseas. But the military is broadly prohibited from engaging in law enforcement operations on American soil without a presidential order, so the command's potential role in assisting the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Department of Energy in the event of a major attack inside the United States has not been set down in law or policy. ''There is a real probability that in the future, this country will get hit with a destructive attack, and we need to be ready for it,'' General Alexander said in a roundtable with reporters at the National Cryptologic Museum here at Fort Meade in advance of his Congressional testimony on Thursday morning. ''I believe this is one of the most critical problems our country faces,'' he said. ''We need to get that right. I think we have to have a discussion about roles and responsibilities: What's the role of Cyber Command? What's the role of the 'intel' community? What's the role of the rest of the Defense Department? What's the role of D.H.S.? And how do you make that team work? That's going to take time.'' Some critics have questioned whether the Defense Department can step up protection of vital computer networks without crashing against the public's ability to live and work with confidence on the Internet. General Alexander said, ''We can protect civil liberties and privacy and still do our mission. We've got to do that.'' Speaking of the civilian networks that are at risk, he said: ''If one of those destructive attacks comes right now, I'm focused on the Defense Department. What are the responsibilities -- and I think this is part of the discussion -- for the power grid, for financial networks, for other critical infrastructure? How do you protect the country when it comes to that kind of attack, and who is responsible for it?'' As General Alexander prepared for his testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, the ranking Republican on the panel, Howard P. McKeon of California, noted the Pentagon's progress in expanding its cyber capabilities. But he said that ''many questions remain as to how Cyber Command will meet such a broad mandate'' given the clear ''vulnerabilities in cyberspace.'' The committee chairman, Rep. Ike Skelton, Democrat of Missouri, said that ''cyberspace is an environment where distinctions and divisions between public and private, government and commercial, military and nonmilitary are blurred.'' He said that it is important ''that we engage in this discussion in a very direct way and include the public.''  "
Report Looks at How China Meddled With the Internet,"An annual report to Congress touched off a round of speculation Wednesday about the motives of a small Chinese Internet service provider that briefly rerouted as much as 15 percent of the world's Web traffic on two occasions last spring. The report, by the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, noted that the service provider, IDC China Telecommunication, broadcast inaccurate Web traffic routes for about 18 minutes on April 8. That information was then retransmitted by China's state-owned China Telecommunications, effectively forcing data from the United States and other countries to pass through Chinese computer servers. A similar episode in March drew less attention.  The report said the move affected data traveling over both the government and military networks of the United States, including information from the Senate, the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the secretary of defense's office, NASA, the Department of Commerce and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as from many American companies. The incidents, which were widely reported when they occurred, were never explained, although Chinese engineering managers said that the routing errors were accidental. The commission said it had no evidence that the misdirection was intentional. ''Evidence related to this incident does not clearly indicate whether it was perpetrated intentionally and, if so, to what ends,'' it said in the report. ''However, computer security researchers have noted that the capability could enable severe malicious activities.'' The 12-member commission was established in 2000 to submit an annual report to Congress on the national security implications of the United States' economic relationship with China. American computer network engineers who met with Chinese technicians visiting the United States at the time said they did not believe that the Chinese had given them a full description of what had happened. While sensitive data such as e-mails and commercial transactions are generally encrypted before being transmitted, the Chinese government holds a copy of an encryption master key, and there was speculation that China might have used it to break the encryption on some of the misdirected Internet traffic. There was also speculation that the rerouting might have been a test of a cyberweapon that could be used to disrupt the Internet during a crisis or a war. There has been no evidence presented to support either theory, and Chinese technical experts rejected the suggestion that the routing changes were intentional. ''The Web information flow is controlled by the U.S., while China just holds a branch line of the global traffic,'' Lu Benfu, director of the Internet Development Research Center at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said on the Web site of Global Times, a state-run newspaper. ''So this kind of accusation is technically unfeasible.''  "
Scotland Yard Move Stirs Questions on Phone-Hacking Case,"LONDON -- Scotland Yard said Friday that it had sent a new file on allegations of phone hacking by the newspaper The News of the World to the Crown Prosecution Service, which reviews police files for possible criminal prosecutions. The newspaper, one of Britain's most highly circulated publications, is owned by News International, part of Rupert Murdoch's global media empire.  The prosecution service issued a terse statement saying, ''We will consider the file, and advise the police in due course.'' Legal experts said it was impossible to say whether Scotland Yard's action in forwarding the file was a routine administrative measure or a likely preliminary to criminal charges. The development came eight days after Scotland Yard investigators questioned Andy Coulson, a spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron. Mr. Coulson was editor of The News of the World in 2006, when the newspaper's royal correspondent and a private investigator were arrested and jailed for involvement in accessing cellphone messages meant for members of Queen Elizabeth II's family. The case was reopened by Scotland Yard in September after The New York Times Magazine published an article outlining how the phone hacking at the London tabloid was more extensive than The News of the World had admitted. The article quoted former employees of the paper as saying that the hacking, though illegal, had been condoned and encouraged by Mr. Coulson and other senior editors. The case has heavy political overtones in Britain, where Mr. Murdoch has broad influence because of his media holdings, which include The Times of London, The Sunday Times and Sky Broadcasting, in addition to The News of the World. With Mr. Coulson now at the heart of Mr. Cameron's government as media director at 10 Downing Street, the political ramifications have been intensified. Mr. Coulson has said repeatedly that he had no knowledge of the hacking. Scotland Yard officers have also interviewed Sean Hoare, a former reporter for The News of the World, who was quoted in The Times article as saying that Mr. Coulson knew of the hacking. The News of the World dismissed those statements as unreliable, saying it had dismissed him over problems with drinking and drugs. Scotland Yard detectives interviewed Mr. Hoare under criminal caution, meaning that any statement he made could be used against him in a possible prosecution, his lawyer said in a statement. Mr. Coulson, however, was not questioned by the police under criminal caution, according to news reports here.  "
British Panel Condemns Media Group in Phone Hacking Case,"LONDON -- A parliamentary committee on Wednesday accused News International of having exhibited ''collective amnesia'' in an inquiry about how its News of the World tabloid hacked into the telephones of members of the royal family, celebrities and other public figures.    ''We have repeatedly encountered an unwillingness to provide the detailed information that we sought, claims of ignorance or lack of recall, and deliberate obfuscation,'' the panel, known as the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said in a report.    News International, the main British subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which also publishes The Times of London and the tabloid The Sun, condemned the report as biased and said the committee was following a ''party-political agenda.''    The report, ''Press Standards, Privacy and Libel,'' is a broad examination of issues relating to the way the British news media operate. But it reserves a large chunk of opprobrium for executives from The News of the World and News International, many of whom gave evidence as the committee sought to investigate the hacking charges.    The inquiry stemmed from an episode in 2007 in which Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, and Clive Goodman, the royal correspondent for The News of the World, were convicted  of unlawfully intercepting messages from  a number of people's telephones. Victims  included aides to the royal family, the model Elle MacPherson, the publicist Max Clifford and the Liberal Democratic politician Simon Hughes.   In July, the liberal-leaning newspaper The Guardian, an avowed enemy of News International, published an article asserting that the phone hacking had gone far beyond what The News of the World had admitted to and could have extended to thousands of other people.    The Guardian also disclosed that News International had paid $1.6 million to three people, including Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, who had sued after their phones were hacked into.    Testifying before the committee, News International officials said that the hacking operation had not been approved by the paper's management, was the fault of a rogue reporter -- Mr. Goodman -- and was limited in scope. But the committee's report said it was ''inconceivable'' that Mr. Goodman had acted alone and expressed frustration at being unable to get straight answers from the paper's executives.    ''It is likely that the number of victims of illegal phone-hacking by Glenn Mulcaire will never be known,'' the report said. ''Nevertheless, there is no doubt that there were a significant number of people whose voice messages were intercepted, most of whom would appear to have been of little interest to the royal correspondent of The News of the World.''   The episode reflects badly on the methods of the British news media, the report said. ''We strongly condemn this behavior, which reinforces the widely held impression that the press generally regard themselves as unaccountable and that News International in particular has sought to conceal the truth,'' it said.    News International condemned the report as the work of lawmakers who were ''resorting to innuendo, unwarranted inference and exaggeration.''    "
"In Britain, Labour Politicians Call for a Second Look at a Phone Scandal","LONDON -- Senior opposition politicians are calling on the government to respond to renewed accusations that Downing Street's chief communications officer, Andy Coulson, encouraged reporters to illegally intercept messages from the cellphones of public figures when he was editor of The News of the World. At the same time, a number of people whose phone messages may have been intercepted by The News of the World during Mr. Coulson's tenure are accusing the Metropolitan Police of failing to fully examine all the evidence in its criminal investigation in 2006 and 2007. Lord Prescott, a Labour politician who was the deputy prime minister under Tony Blair and who has been named as one of hundreds of people whose phones may have been hacked, said the police had never provided him with a sufficient explanation of what happened. ''I have been far from satisfied with the Metropolitan Police's procedure in dealing with my requests to uncover the truth about this case,'' Lord Prescott told The Observer newspaper. It was only after ''repeated requests,'' he said, that he learned that he might have been a victim of phone hacking. If the police continued to fail to be forthcoming, he said, he would seek a judicial inquiry into their handling of the matter.  Alan Johnson, a Labour member of Parliament and a former home secretary, announced that he would review the Home Office papers relating to the case to see whether the matter should be brought to the Inspectorate of Constabulary, which monitors the police. His recommendation would then go to the current home secretary, Theresa May. Lord Prescott was responding to an article published by The New York Times Magazine online Wednesday and in print Sunday about the scandal. In 2007, The News of the World's royal editor, Clive Goodman, and an investigator employed by The News of the World, Glenn Mulcaire, were jailed after pleading guilty to having illegally intercepted voice mail messages of Prince William and Prince Harry and their chief royal aides. Mr. Coulson, who was appointed editor of The News of the World in 2003, said that he had no knowledge of the hacking and that it was an isolated case, but resigned from the paper in January 2007 nonetheless. Last year, The Guardian newspaper printed an article saying that hundreds of people might have been singled out by The News of the World and providing details about some of them, including Gordon Taylor, former chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, who reached a settlement of $:700,000 with The News of the World over the hacking of his cellphone. The Times Magazine article provided new details, quoting a former reporter, Sean Hoare, and a unnamed former editor at The News of the World as saying that Mr. Coulson was fully aware of the hacking. In an interview with BBC Radio 4 last week, Mr. Hoare called Mr. Coulson's statement to a parliamentary committee denying that he knew about the phone hacking in his newsroom ''a lie.'' More than a dozen reporters and editors formerly with The News of the World, interviewed for The Times article said their employer had fostered a culture of recklessness in which reporters were encouraged to use any means to get exclusive stories. The article also quoted senior Metropolitan Police officials saying that the police had failed to fully investigate The News of the World's phone hacking in part because of Scotland Yard's close ties to editors at the paper and executives at its parent company, News International. Over the weekend, Tessa Jowell, a former Labour cabinet minister who is still a Parliament member, said that the police had told her that her phone messages had been intercepted at least 28 times while she was in the government. And The Independent on Sunday reported that Lord Mandelson, another senior Labour politician, also had his messages intercepted. John Yates, the assistant commissioner of the Met, said in a statement Sunday that the police would consider reopening the criminal inquiry if fresh evidence of wrongdoing emerges and would consult prosecutors about whether further inquiry was appropriate. Mr. Yates said the police had asked The Times for material it collected during its reporting of the magazine story, including notes from its interviews with Mr. Hoare. Bill Keller, the executive editor of The Times, said, ''Scotland Yard has declined our repeated requests for interviews and refused to release information we requested months ago under the British freedom of information law. After our story was published, Scotland Yard expressed renewed interest in the case and asked us to provide interview materials and notes; we declined, as we would with any such request from police. Our story speaks for itself and makes clear that the police already have evidence that they have chosen not to pursue.'' Tom Watson, a Labour member of Parliament and a member of the parliamentary committee that investigated the phone hacking, wrote a letter to the Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson, saying ''the historic continued and mishandling of this affair is beginning to bring your force, and hence our democracy, into disrepute.'' For its part, the British government said it considers the matter closed and will not investigate Mr. Coulson, who was hired as the Conservative Party's chief spokesman in May 2007 after his resignation from The News of the World. A spokesman at 10 Downing Street said last week that Mr. Coulson ''totally and utterly'' denied knowing about phone hacking while he served as editor. Alan Duncan, the international development minister, appeared on television on Saturday night on behalf of the government, accusing the Labour Party of acting for purely political reasons. Speaking of senior Labour leaders who have called for a new investigation, Mr. Duncan said: ''The Labour Party -- in a concerted campaign through Ed Miliband, Lord Prescott and Alan Johnson -- have piled in to attack Andy Coulson about something that happened years ago in order to try to attack the government.'' Meanwhile, The News of the World denied the Times's allegations and accused it of publishing the magazine article in an effort to discredit a newspaper belonging to a ''rival group'' -- that is, the media empire of Rupert Murdoch. Mr. Murdoch is the chairman of News Corporation, whose many media holdings include The News of the World, The Times of London and The Wall Street Journal. Five people whose phones were hacked have filed lawsuits this summer against News of the World's parent company and Mr. Mulcaire. And a growing number of public figures who believe their phone messages may have also been intercepted but who feel the police did not do enough to investigate say they intend to sue The News of the World. Others, including Brian Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner with the Metropolitan Police, say they intend to seek a judicial review of the police's handling of the criminal investigation. An application for that review is expected to be filed later this week. Senior Labour leaders also said they intended this week to seek a new inquiry by the standards and privileges committee in the House of Commons. The publication of the Times Magazine article has starkly exposed the fault lines in the media and political landscape in Britain. Papers supporting the government -- including The Times of London and The Sun, both Murdoch-owned -- have devoted little space to the new accusations. But media outlets critical of the government, including The Guardian, The Independent and the BBC -- which itself is in a bitter feud with Mr. Murdoch's company, which has extensive television holdings in Britain -- have covered The Times's article, and the subsequent calls for new investigations, extensively. In an editorial, The Financial Times said that there should be an independent review of The New York Times's accusation that ''the police may have dropped a valid investigation.'' The Financial Times also called on Prime Minister David Cameron to investigate the matter. ''Was he not reckless to have employed Mr. Coulson, given the murkiness of the allegations surrounding The News of the World?'' the paper asked.  "
Labour Politicians Assail Government Over Phone Scandal,"LONDON -- Labour members of Parliament attacked the government on Monday, saying it should demand that the Metropolitan Police answer new questions about whether legislators' phone messages had been illegally intercepted by The News of the World. But the home secretary, Theresa May, responded to a series of angry opposition questions in the House of Commons by saying that ''it is for the Metropolitan Police, on an operational matter, to decide what the right course of action is.'' Meanwhile, pressure continued to build on Andy Coulson, the government's director of communications. Mr. Coulson was editor of The News of the World in 2007 when its royal editor, Clive Goodman, and an investigator it had hired, Glenn Mulcaire, pleaded guilty to illegally intercepting, or hacking, the telephone messages of chief aides to Prince William and Prince Harry.  Mr. Coulson resigned in the wake of the scandal. But he claimed that it was an isolated incident and that he had known nothing about the phone hacking. He was hired as the Conservative Party's chief spokesman soon afterward. But recent evidence has cast doubt on Mr. Coulson's claims. An article in The New York Times Magazine on Sunday quoted a former reporter, Sean Hoare, and an unnamed former editor as saying that Mr. Coulson had known about and encouraged the hacking. More than a dozen reporters and editors currently or formerly with The News of the World described an aggressive newsroom culture in which reporters were encouraged to use any means possible to get stories. The police responded by saying that they would consider the new material in the article in The Times before deciding whether to go forward with a further investigation. The article also quoted senior Metropolitan Police officials as saying that the police had failed to fully investigate The News of the World at the time because of Scotland Yard's close ties to editors at the paper and executives at its parent company, News International. Mr. Coulson was not interviewed by the police in their initial investigation, in 2006, but he said on Wednesday that he would be happy to speak to them now. The government has said that it stands by him and believes his assertion that he had done nothing wrong. He has proved a lightning rod for Labour members of Parliament seeking to attack the government. Members of the Liberal Democratic Party, too, were highly critical of Mr. Coulson when they were in opposition -- before they joined the government as part of a coalition with the Conservatives. Alan Johnson, a former home secretary and now Labour's chief home-affairs spokesman, reminded the House of Commons on Monday that Chris Huhne, now a member of the cabinet, said before last spring's election that he found it ''extraordinary'' that the Conservatives had hired Mr. Coulson, ''who, at best, was responsible for a newspaper that was out of control and, at worst, was personally implicated in criminal activity.'' Mr. Johnson was one of a large number of Labour members of Parliament who demanded further investigation into the handling of the matter by Mr. Coulson and by the police. Hundreds of public figures, including celebrities, sports stars and politicians, may have had their phone messages intercepted, but only a small number of them were ever notified by the police. Chris Bryant, a Labour member of Parliament, called on the government to demand that the police tell all the potential victims that they may have been singled out, and in what way. Mr. Bryant said that he had been forced to write to the Metropolitan Police himself in an effort to find out if he was ''a person of interest to Mr. Mulcaire.'' The police said that he had been, and advised him to call his cellphone company, which informed him ''that my phone had indeed been interfered with,'' Mr. Bryant said. But rather than pursuing the matter, the authorities let it drop and ''have done nothing about it,'' he said.  "
Covering Murdoch and Company,"E-mail: public@nytimes.com THE NEW YORK TIMES masquerading as a tabloid -- it was more than enough to draw me into the story, I'll admit. The Sept. 5 Sunday Magazine cover blared, ''TABLOID HACK ATTACK!'' amid funny little color balloons offering tantalizing subheads: ''BRIT ROYALS' CELL MESSAGES REVEALED!'' and ''How a LONDON PAPER LISTENED in on the PRIVATE VOICE MAIL messages OF THE RICH and FAMOUS'' and more. Inside, in a serious and lengthy article that belied the ALIENS-ABDUCTED-ME! art treatment, a respected team of Times reporters laid out a compelling account of how The News of the World, a tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch, illegally hacked into voice mail, and how Scotland Yard failed to get to the bottom of it. Bill Akass, the managing editor of The News of the World, has cried foul on numerous counts, chief among them that The Times's story was a thinly veiled attack on Mr. Murdoch, whose media empire also includes a major Times rival: The Wall Street Journal.  I will detail Mr. Akass's complaint, The Times's response and my own assessment. But it's worth noting first that this tempest isn't confined to a teapot. Since publication of The Times's article two weeks ago, the controversy over phone-hacking in Britain has been reignited, resulting in two new parliamentary investigations of the matter and an intense political fight that threatens to dislodge Prime Minister David Cameron's top communications aide, Andy Coulson. Mr. Coulson was editor of The News of the World when this story first broke more than four years ago, and, in the initial fallout, he resigned. Since then, he has rallied and taken up duties in the Murdoch-backed Cameron government. The politics threaten to derail two important Murdoch objectives. He is seeking to acquire the remaining interest in the satellite TV firm BSkyB (he now owns nearly 40 percent), a transaction his adversaries want the government to block. And his camp has long lobbied to clip the wings of the BBC, the government-financed competitor, whose budget the Cameron government is poised to cut. Some media analysts in Britain believe that if Mr. Murdoch can gain complete control of subscription-based BSkyB, he will be able to bundle television and newspaper subscription offers and further consolidate his dominant share of Britain's news media. Then he would have the holy grail in his hands: a new business model for media. In other words, if The Times's article was a guided hit, it has landed with devastating accuracy and impact. Mr. Akass of The News of the World said that's exactly what it was. ''It stretches credulity to believe the decision to devote such resources to investigate an old story was an impartial act, uninfluenced by competitive rivalry,'' he said. Underlying his accusation is the heated competition between The Times and The Journal, which under Mr. Murdoch has redrawn its coverage scheme to take aim at more of The Times's audience. Besides his complaint about competitive bias, Mr. Akass found serious fault with the credibility of the story's sourcing. He said The Times based its piece almost entirely on anonymous sources, ''whose credibility, seniority, motives or qualifications we are therefore prevented from challenging.'' He added that only one named source ''claimed direct knowledge of wrongdoing, as opposed to hearsay or supposition. This is pretty thin evidence on which to hang a 6,000-word investigation.'' Finally, Mr. Akass pointed to others in the British press who, like him, regard ''Hack Attack'' as just a rehash of a four-year-old story. So what does The Times say? Bill Keller, executive editor, said The Times learned during the reporting stages that The News of the World believed the project was ''tainted'' because of the business rivalry. He rejected the argument that The Times should recuse itself from doing such stories, or that its competitors should do likewise. News of the World editors, he said, ''made clear that this dubious argument would be the paper's first line of defense, and it probably added another layer of caution to a process that is quite careful under any circumstances,'' Mr. Keller said. ''It was at least in the back of our minds that because Mr. Murdoch has declared war on The New York Times, a story centered on one of his newspapers had to bend over backwards to be seen as fair. In my view, the process was thorough and scrupulous.'' In response to Mr. Akass's complaint about sources, Matt Purdy, the investigations editor, whose department produced the article, said the story was ''built on extensive interviews of both named and unnamed sources, as well as documents.'' ''As we always do, we pushed hard to get people to attach their names to their quotes, and we succeeded in some important instances,'' he added. ''But getting people to speak for attribution was particularly difficult because it entailed journalists talking about potentially criminal acts and police officials talking about their own agency's investigation.'' The story, in my view, did rely heavily on unnamed sources. Roughly two-thirds of the attributions relating to The News of the World were to anonymous individuals or groups. And in the thread of the story dealing with the Scotland Yard investigation, more than 80 percent of the attributions were anonymous. That said, the story was grounded in very strong evidence. One former News of the World reporter, Sean Hoare, was a direct and named witness. Another former reporter, Matt Driscoll, said he witnessed an editor in possession of a soccer star's phone records, albeit records that were obtained by means other than phone-hacking. The Times reported that both of these witnesses had been fired by The News of the World -- information that helped readers make their own judgments about credibility. In addition, Sharon Marshall was another named source who said she witnessed hacking while a reporter at The News of the World. These accounts, when combined with other evidence that was offered, including the findings of a parliamentary committee earlier this year, accumulated very convincingly. So, on substance, I believe The Times's account stood on solid ground. It went beyond a rehash with new sources and a comprehensive treatment. The larger question of whether the story was colored by the rivalry with Mr. Murdoch is more a matter of appearances. Here, the ground gets squishy. I asked several outside experts about it. Nicholas Lemann, dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, felt the story was worthwhile on its own merits. ''It is very hard to argue that because The Times is competing with The Journal that The Times shouldn't do a story that is this good,'' he said. Bob Giles, curator of the Nieman Foundation, thought the article was evenhanded with one exception: the second-to-last paragraph. In it, the narrative segued from The News of the World and Scotland Yard to a discussion of Mr. Murdoch's alliance with the Tories and his goal of weakening the BBC. ''This passage seems gratuitous,'' Mr. Giles said, ''casting Murdoch in an unfavorable light without adding fresh information that advanced readers' understanding of the story.'' Mr. Giles's example illustrates a larger point I subscribe to: that The Times, or any news organization covering a rival so prominently, needs to do it as straightforwardly as possible. Incorporating politics, and dressing the piece in a mock tabloid art treatment, leave room for some to perceive a hidden agenda, and perhaps even quiet glee.

Watching TV on a Tiny Screen,"Q. How do I watch TV , especially sports, on my phone? A. Check with your wireless carrier to see if the company offers its own mobile television package for your phone's make and model. Sprint's Sprint TV or Verizon's V Cast TV services, for example, both carry the ESPN Mobile TV channel, but you should check with your carrier to see what is available in your area and what will work on your particular phone. Adding a TV package to your plan typically costs an extra $10 to $15 a month. If you don't like your carrier's offerings, there are plenty of apps and services for most popular smartphone models. Flo TV (flotv.com) works on a few phones from AT&T and Verizon. MobiTV (mobitv.com) has an application for the iPhone and Android phones from some wireless carriers. Prices start at about $10 a month for either service.  If you want to watch specific sports, the professional leagues have gotten in on the mobile game, too. For football, Verizon has NFL Mobile Live (nfl.com/mobile), while baseball fans can choose one of the MLB.com At Bat apps for various phones at mlb.mlb.com/mobile; the iPhone version offers live streaming games for MLB.TV subscribers. Plenty of other apps let you watch television on your phone, but you may have to shop around to find the one that has all the shows you want to watch -- and that works on your phone. Hulu Plus and Netflix both have free iPhone apps for watching old and new TV programs, but you need to pay a monthly $9 to $10 for the service. Bitbop (bitbop.com) is a similar service for BlackBerry and Android phones. Owners of the Slingbox device, which lets you tap into your home TV system over the Internet, can also use the $30 SlingPlayer Mobile app for Android and iPhone to watch live or recorded television programs. Malware Protection On the Cheap Q. Is it worth paying for antivirus software or are free programs just as good? A. Commercial antivirus software has its advantages. Because many antivirus products are bundled into an overall security suite with a firewall, antispyware, spam filtering and other privacy protections, you typically get more comprehensive coverage for your system. Most major security products offer more frequent automatic updates and technical support as well. If you cannot afford commercial software, there are many free programs that provide basic protection from malicious software.

Parents of Student Who Committed Suicide Tell Rutgers University They May Sue,"The parents of a Rutgers University freshman who committed suicide after his intimate encounter with another man was secretly captured and streamed live on the Internet have filed notices that they may sue the university.  The freshman, Tyler Clementi, jumped off the George Washington Bridge on Sept. 22. His roommate and another student have been charged with criminal counts of invading his privacy, and the case has become a national flash point in the debates over gay rights, bullying and personal privacy in the Internet age. The parents, Joseph and Jane Clementi of Ridgewood, N.J., filed legal notices with the university on Friday, said Paul Mainardi, a lawyer for the family. By law, they must wait six months to file a lawsuit, but they had to give notice within 90 days after the death to preserve their right to sue. The filings were reported on Wednesday by The Home News Tribune of East Brunswick, N.J. Mr. Mainardi said that the notices did not necessarily signal an intention to sue. ''A decision as to whether to file suit against Rutgers University in the future has not been made,'' he said. Tyler Clementi, 18, an accomplished violin player, had been on the Rutgers campus in Piscataway, N.J., for less than a month, prosecutors say, when his roommate, Dharun Ravi, 18, of Plainsboro, N.J., used a camera in his computer to live-stream the dormitory-room encounter between Mr. Clementi and another man. Prosecutors say Mr. Ravi sent a Twitter message urging followers to watch. Mr. Ravi and another Rutgers freshman, Molly Wei, 18, of West Windsor, N.J., were both charged with using ''the camera to view and transmit a live image'' of Mr. Clementi. The two students have since withdrawn from the university; their lawyers have said that they denied the accusations. Prosecutors have said they may press for additional counts that would make the invasion of privacy a hate crime. But on Wednesday, Jim O'Neil, a spokesman for the Middlesex County prosecutor's office, said only that the investigation was continuing. One of the legal notices filed last week, a notice of tort claim, contends that Rutgers ''failed to put in place and/or implement, and enforce, policies and practices that would have prevented or deterred such acts.'' Another notice claims the university broke its agreement with Mr. Clementi to protect him. E. J. Miranda, a spokesman for Rutgers, said the university shared the family's sense of loss and understood that they would question whether an institution or other people were to blame. ''While the university understands the reaction,'' he said, ''the university is not responsible for Tyler Clementi's suicide.'' A day before his death, Mr. Clementi apparently discovered the surveillance and wrote in a blog post that he had complained to a resident adviser. The tort claim lists as damages his pain and suffering, as well as his family's loss of his company and support. No dollar amount is given.  "
States Weigh Inquiry of Google,"Google's headaches over its collection of private data from Wi-Fi networks are intensifying.   Attorneys general from about 30 states are investigating whether Google violated any laws when vehicles used by the company to snap pictures for the Street View service also collected snippets of personal information sent over unsecured wireless networks.    On Thursday, attorneys general from about 30 states participated in a conference call do discuss whether to join forces.   The call was spearheaded by Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's attorney general, who was among the first to open an investigation into the data gathering by Google.   ''Violating legitimate expectations of privacy on the part of both homeowners and business people is an extraordinarily serious issue, and we want all the facts as quickly as possible,'' Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview by phone.   Mr. Blumenthal said the conference call with his counterparts ''was the first step in an effort to cooperate in a possible joint investigation and action. At this point, we are asking questions and frankly some of the answers we received so far have raised additional questions that we have put to the company.''   Last month Google revealed that it had collected private data like e-mails and other communications from unsecured wireless networks. Since then, the company has faced a deluge of civil and criminal investigations from various European countries as well as Australia.    In the United States, the matter has been subject of Congressional inquiries and class action lawsuits in various states.   Google declined to comment on individual investigations or lawsuits. But the company repeated earlier statements that its collection of data from Wi-Fi networks was a mistake but not illegal.   ''This was a mistake, but we don't we believe we did anything illegal,'' said Christine Chen, a Google spokeswoman. ''We're working with the relevant authorities to answer their questions and concerns.''   Mr. Blumenthal said that about 30 states joined the conference call last week, while a number of other states were interested in the issue but unable to participate in the call.   He said the states are discussing whether to pool their resources for an investigation ''without knowing what action, if any, will be taken. The action will depend on what we find.''   On Tuesday, Richard Brodsky, an New York State assemblyman, asked that state to conduct an investigation into whether Google violated criminal laws.   In a letter to Andrew Cuomo, the New York State attorney general who is running for governor, Mr. Brodsky asked for a formal investigation into whether Google violated a number of criminal laws, including a statute barring unauthorized intrusions into computers or computer networks. Mr. Brodsky, who authored that statute, is running for state attorney general.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
General Nominated to Lead Cyberspace War Unit Sees Gaps in Laws,"WASHINGTON -- The Army intelligence officer nominated to lead the Pentagon's new command devoted to warfare in cyberspace has warned Congress that policy directives and legal controls over digital combat are outdated and have failed to keep pace with the military's technical capabilities.   The officer, Lt. Gen. Keith B. Alexander, wrote to members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that computer network warfare was evolving so rapidly that there was a ''mismatch between our technical capabilities to conduct operations and the governing laws and policies.''     As he prepared for a confirmation hearing on Thursday as the first head of the Cyber Command, he pledged that the White House and Pentagon were ''working hard to resolve the mismatch.''   In a 32-page response to questions from senators, General Alexander sketched out the broad battlefield envisioned for the computer warfare command and acknowledged the kind of targets that his new headquarters could be ordered to attack.    The target list included traditional battlefield prizes -- command-and-control systems at military headquarters, air defense networks and weapons systems that require computers to operate.    But he agreed with a question submitted by the Senate that asked whether the target list would include civilian institutions and municipal infrastructure that are essential to state sovereignty and stability, including power grids, banks and financial networks, transportation and telecommunications.   General Alexander promised that the Cyber Command would be sensitive to the ripple effects from this kind of warfare, and would honor the laws of war that govern traditional combat in seeking to limit the impact on civilians.   ''It is difficult for me to conceive of an instance where it would be appropriate to attack a bank or a financial institution, unless perhaps it was being used solely to support enemy military operations,'' he wrote. General Alexander did not note it in his response, but the Bush administration considered exactly that kind of network attack on Iraq's banking system before the invasion of 2003, but rejected the idea, fearing an unintended impact on global financial markets.   The confirmation hearing will be the public's first opportunity to hear General Alexander describe the computer warfare command's proposed objectives and responsibilities -- and what safeguards he will pledge to protect privacy in the United States and to respect the interests of allies and neutral nations.   He is the first chief of the Pentagon's newest global combatant headquarters, and the first whose sole mission is cyberspace.   If confirmed, General Alexander would receive a fourth star and be the first career military intelligence officer to lead a global combatant command. He would, in military jargon, be dual-hatted, a term to describe his role in charge of the Cyber Command while continuing to lead the National Security Agency, which specializes in electronic intelligence, including phone and computer espionage.    The N.S.A.'s role in intercepting international calls to and from the United States since the Sept. 11 attacks, first approved by secret orders from President George W. Bush and largely continued by President Obama with the blessing of Congress, generated intense contention -- and scrutiny by Congress and the courts. Because the agency spies on the computer systems of foreign governments and terrorist groups, General Alexander would, in effect, be put in charge of both finding and, if need be, neutralizing cyberattacks in the making, as well as defending military computer networks.   ''If confirmed, I will operate within applicable laws, policies and authorities,'' General Alexander wrote to the senators. ''I will also identify any gaps in doctrine, policy and law that may prevent national objectives from being fully realized or executed.''   The military is moving into uncharted territory as it seeks to defend national interests and carry out offensive operations inside computer networks, he wrote, with nations of the world not even agreeing on what constitutes a computer attack or the appropriate response.   He wrote that there was no theory of deterrence to guide planning for cyberwarfare similar to strategies that guided nuclear planning in the cold war, and that it remained difficult to assess exactly who carried out an attack over computer networks.   The new Cyber Command was announced last year, and the unusually long delay in scheduling a confirmation hearing for its proposed leader is evidence of the intense behind-the-scenes debate over the command's role, missions, authorities and safeguards.   Another challenge highlighted by General Alexander is the role that the military's Cyber Command would play on American soil, since it has far greater capabilities than the Department of Homeland Security. By tradition and law, the military only operates within the United States if ordered by the president. But a computer network attack on targets in the United States could happen instantaneously and with little warning.   General Alexander reiterated that a presidential order would be required for the Defense Department and the Cyber Command to take the leading role in responding to a computer network attack on American soil.   The world of computer network warfare remains highly secret, and many of General Alexander's answers to the senators were excised from the 32 pages of responses, and placed in a separate classified addendum.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
DEALBOOK ONLINE; CODE CLASH,"Chip East/ReutersSergey Aleynikov, a former programmer for Goldman Sachs, is on trial on charges that he stole trading code from the firm. Is Sergey Aleynikov an evil computer scientist who brazenly stole valuable, closely guarded trading code from Goldman Sachs, his former employer? Or is he a humble Russian immigrant who, upon leaving his programming post at Goldman for a higher-paying job, innocuously took some open-source code with him on his way out the door?  Those dueling depictions were on display on Tuesday in a federal courtroom in Manhattan, where Mr. Aleynikov is on trial on charges that he stole computer source code used in high-frequency trading at Goldman Sachs. The case is expected to shine a spotlight on high-frequency trading, an increasingly important driver of profit at investment banks and hedge funds. The trial is also a test of the boundaries of the Economic Espionage Act, a 15-year-old law that makes it a crime to steal trade secrets. Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Mr. Aleynikov in July 2009 after Goldman reported the suspected theft to authorities. Free on bail since his arrest, the 40-year-old Mr. Aleynikov faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of stealing trade secrets. ''This is a case about greed and theft,'' said Joseph Facciponti, an assistant United States attorney, during the government's opening statement. Mr. Facciponti told the jury that the evidence would show that Mr. Aleynikov knew that making off with crucial parts of Goldman's trading code would help his new employer, Teza Technologies, a new high-frequency trading firm started by a former executive at the Citadel Investment Group, the large Chicago hedge fund. Mr. Aleynikov was ''meticulous, deliberate and clever in how he went about'' stealing Goldman's code, which ''allows the bank to make lightning-fast trades in markets around the world,'' Mr. Facciponti said. The computer programs form the building blocks of high-frequency trading and power an important part of Goldman's business, he said. The prosecutor likened Goldman's protection of its high-frequency trading code to Coca-Cola's guarding of its secret formula for Coke. (What would a trade secrets case be without an allusion to Coke's secret formula?) Kevin Marino, the defense lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov, spent much of his opening statement acknowledging that his client undoubtedly -- and foolishly -- violated Goldman's confidentiality policy in downloading code from the firm's computers. But he repeatedly emphasized that this breach was not a criminal act. ''I will dispute to my death that violating a Goldman Sachs confidentiality provision is a federal crime,'' Mr. Marino said, raising his voice for dramatic effect. Mr. Marino also focused on the issue of intent. He said that in downloading open-source code from the firm's computers, Mr. Aleynikov never intended to harm Goldman's business -- a crucial element of proving that a trade-secrets crime was committed. As far as the proprietary code his client took, Mr. Aleynikov did not intend to steal that from Goldman, he said. Attempting to humanize Mr. Aleynikov, Mr. Marino described a meeting between Mr. Aleynikov and his new employer. During that meeting, in which Mr. Aleynikov is alleged to have shared Goldman's secret code, Mr. Marino said his client was using his computer to play a satire of a Russian folk song about how programmers are married to their jobs and not their wives. ''A little sad, but hardly subversive,'' he said. Mr. Marino got himself into trouble with Judge Denise L. Cote when he twice suggested that this case should be a civil matter and that Goldman could have sued Mr. Aleynikov instead of referring the case to criminal authorities. Visibly upset, Judge Cote interjected both times and instructed the jury to disregard those remarks. At the conclusion of the lawyers' opening statement, the judge reminded the jurors that ''this is a criminal trial'' and the defendant has been accused of violating federal laws. The trial puts mighty Goldman Sachs in the unusual role of victim. A Goldman spokesman and a lawyer from the firm sat in the back row of the spectators' gallery. The spokesman declined to comment on the case, but said the firm would have a representative present for the duration of the trial. The government has requested that portions of the trial, which is expected to last about two weeks, be closed to spectators because of the confidential nature of certain testimony. Judge Cote has said she favors an open courtroom and will consider specific requests from the prosecution as the trial progresses. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
DEALBOOK ONLINE; TRADE SECRETS,"David Boies has had a big week in California. On Monday, he argued in support of same-sex marriage in the state's pitched legal battle over Proposition 8. On Tuesday, a judge awarded his client Jamie McCourt a victory in her divorce war with her former husband over the ownership of the Los Angeles Dodgers. But as those triumphant events unfolded out west, a sanctions motion was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan against his firm, Boies Schiller & Flexner, accusing it of ''egregious misconduct'' and ''gross negligence.''  The court filing was made in a year-old case involving accusations that trade secrets were stolen from University Sports Publications, a company based in Elmont, N.Y., that contracts with college and professional sports teams to sell advertising in their souvenir magazines and yearbooks. The alleged corporate thief? Playmakers Media, a company that does what University Sports does, but does it exclusively for the New York Yankees, a longtime marquee client of Mr. Boies. The Yankees, a former client of University Sports, formed Playmakers in 2007. University Sports sued Playmakers last year, accusing it of stealing its confidential database of historical sales information. For a company in the advertising sales business, such a database is invaluable. Playmakers is accused of stealing the data through a former sales executive at University Sports who joined Playmakers as vice president of sales. The executive, Shane Pitta, is said to have stolen the information using a laptop computer and distributed the data to his new colleagues. After the supposed theft was discovered, University Sports sent Playmakers a letter to preserve the laptop. At that point, University Sports says, Playmakers ''engaged in a systematic campaign of evidence destruction and perjury designed to deceive U.S.P. and the court regarding their misconduct.'' A federal judge, in an opinion this summer denying a Playmakers motion to toss the case, agreed, writing that ample evidence suggested that the employee's laptop ''was intentionally destroyed'' and that a fake one was turned over to University Sports that had no evidence of theft. And here is where Boies Schiller comes in: ''This campaign was made possible by a combination of affirmative intentional misconduct, or at the very least, gross negligence, by defendants' counsel,'' said the sanctions motion, which was filed by University Sports's lawyers at Dewey & LeBoeuf. ''Our position is simply that everyone involved in this undeniable misconduct should be held responsible,'' said Christopher J. Clark, a lawyer for University Sports, which is asking for punitive monetary damages to be assessed against Boies Schiller. What did the firm allegedly do wrong? The motion accuses it of not looking at its client's laptop before turning it over to University Sports and refusing to produce a jump drive on which the stolen data was ultimately retrieved after it had been asked to do so. ''The intentional misconduct and gross negligence of Boies Schiller is demonstrated by their total failure to supervise the discovery process,'' the complaint said. Boies Schiller also tried to get the case dismissed ''in violation of their duty of candor to the court by intentionally lying to the court, or at a minimum, assuming a position of willful ignorance regarding [evidence destruction] and perjury, both of which would have been confirmed by the exercise by Boies Schiller of even minimal due diligence,'' said the motion. A Boies Schiller spokesman said in a statement on Wednesday: ''Boies, Schiller & Flexner did not represent any of the parties in early August 2009, when the alleged loss of data took place, and it no longer represents Shane Pitta, whose computers are at issue. And importantly, as the motion makes clear, the firm collected what it was told was Mr. Pitta's laptop from him and promptly turned it over in pristine condition so that opposing counsel could conduct forensic analysis of it.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
China Indicts Rio Tinto Staff on Bribery Charges,"A Chinese prosecutor handed down indictments on Wednesday against an Australian citizen and three Chinese employees of the British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, charging them with accepting bribes and stealing trade secrets.    The indictments, announced through Xinhua, the state news agency, are the latest development in a case that began last summer when the four employees were detained on suspicion of stealing state secrets and harming China's economic interests. China later backed away from the espionage accusations and instead accused the four of engaging in bribery, stealing trade secrets and damaging the interests of China's state-owned steel makers. Those companies had been in fractious negotiations with Rio Tinto over the skyrocketing price of iron ore, one of Australia's biggest exports.   The prosecutor did not set a trial date, Xinhua said.   The case caused a furor among Western companies in China, raising fears that other executives could be accused of bribery or arrested because of commercial disputes with Chinese companies.   Australian officials were angered because one of the four Rio Tinto employees, Stern Hu -- a Chinese-born, naturalized Australian citizen -- was held for more than a month with no access to a lawyer or family visits and no formal charges.   Now, though, China has given its most detailed account of the charges so far, albeit in a few sentences. According to Xinhua, the four employees, on many occasions, ''requested and received'' a huge amount in bribes from state-owned steel producers. The statement said they had gained trade secrets from Chinese steel companies by ''luring with valuable goods and other illegal methods.''   The prosecutor's office also said the Rio Tinto employees had badly harmed the Chinese steel makers.    Rio Tinto has strongly denied that its employees were engaged in any wrongdoing.   ''We are very concerned about the nature of these charges,'' Sam Walsh, the company's chief executive, said in a statement.   China's announcement suggests that prosecutors are not pressing forward with accusations that the Rio Tinto employees bribed industry officials, something that was said earlier and repeated in articles in the state-run media.   The indictment suggests that steel makers were bribed but does not indicate that the Rio Tinto employees will be charged with paying bribes, only that they accepted bribes as ''nongovernmental officials.''   China's state-controlled iron and steel industry association has been in heated negotiations over iron ore prices with Rio Tinto in recent years, and it has publicly expressed anger that Rio Tinto was not giving Chinese producers what it considered a fair price. Mr. Hu was one of Rio Tinto's leading iron ore negotiators.   Rio Tinto has contended that it negotiated fairly with China and offered a similar price to steel makers in other countries.   China has notified Australia of the indictments, Australia's foreign ministry said Thursday.   ''We continue to emphasize to the Chinese authorities the need for the case to be handled transparently and expeditiously,'' a spokesman for Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said in a statement.  "
Germany Raids Bank Offices in Tax Evasion Inquiry,"BERLIN -- Credit Suisse's offices in Germany were searched Wednesday as part of an investigation into accusations that its employees might have helped clients evade taxes, prosecutors in Dusseldorf said.     About 150 police officers, prosecutors and tax inspectors searched all 13 Credit Suisse offices and branches in Germany, said Johannes Mocken,  a spokesman for the prosecutor's office.    Mr. Mocken said it would take weeks to sift through the files that were seized. The searches were prompted by data contained on a compact disc the authorities recently purchased from an informant, Mr. Mocken said. He said the authorities were looking into the accounts of 1,100 customers of Credit Suisse.    ''Credit Suisse is working in close cooperation with the relevant local authorities,'' said Marc Dosch,  a spokesman for Credit Suisse in Zurich. ''As this concerns an ongoing investigation, we can provide no other comment.''    UBS, the largest Swiss bank, avoided prosecution in the United States last year after admitting that it had helped clients evade taxes from 2000 to 2007. It paid a $780 million fine and agreed to disclose the account details of more than 4,700 clients.    Of all the European Union member states, Germany has taken the toughest stance against tax evaders. German officials have called on the bloc to adopt a strict policy that would pressure Switzerland, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein to give up their banking secrecy systems.    Berlin's position led to serious tensions with Switzerland earlier this year. The Swiss authorities were furious after Wolfgang Schauble,  the German finance minister, agreed in February to pay a Swiss bank employee 2.5 million euros ($3.2 million) for a CD that was said to contain the names of 1,500 Germans with Swiss bank accounts who might have evaded taxes in their own country.    The German authorities also bought a disc containing information on thousands of clients of UBS and Credit Suisse that was offered to the state of Baden-Wurttemberg in February.    A former finance minister, Peer Steinbruck,  also had no qualms about paying for information on German taxpayers with accounts in Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Luxembourg. In 2008, Germany purchased data on potential tax evaders from a banker in Liechtenstein. That caused a diplomatic furor with the Liechtenstein authorities over the stolen data.    One tax evader uncovered by the German investigations was Klaus Zumwinkel,  who was forced to resign as chairman of Deutsche Post as a result. He was given a suspended sentence and fined 1 million euros for evading that amount of taxes by using a trust in Liechtenstein.    Some German politicians have challenged the way the government has obtained the information. The Free Democrats, partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government, have said they are uneasy about buying stolen data. By buying the information, party officials say, the government benefits from a crime, and may encourage more people to steal information.    Last January, a German real estate broker, Elmar Bernhard Schulte,  was awarded 7.3 million euros in damages by a Liechtenstein court. Mr. Schulte's account details were on a disc of data stolen by an employee of a Liechtenstein bank and sold to the German finance ministry in 2008. Mr. Schulte  argued that the bank should have warned him that his account information had been stolen, so he could have settled with the German authorities.  Instead, a German court found Mr. Schulte guilty of tax evasion and fined him 7.5 million euros.   "
New Spy Game: Firms' Secrets Sold Overseas,"Huang Kexue, federal authorities say, is a new kind of spy. For five years, Mr. Huang was a scientist at a Dow Chemical lab in Indiana, studying ways to improve insecticides. But before he was fired in 2008, Mr. Huang began sharing Dow's secrets with Chinese researchers, authorities say, then obtained grants from a state-run foundation in China with the goal of starting a rival business there. Now, Mr. Huang, who was born in China and is a legal United States resident, faces a rare criminal charge -- that he engaged in economic espionage on China's behalf. Law enforcement officials say the kind of spying Mr. Huang is accused of represents a new front in the battle for a global economic edge. As China and other countries broaden their efforts to obtain Western technology, American industries beyond the traditional military and high-tech targets risk having valuable secrets exposed by their own employees, court records show.  Rather than relying on dead drops and secret directions from government handlers, the new trade in business secrets seems much more opportunistic, federal prosecutors say, and occurs in loose, underground markets throughout the world. Prosecutors say it is difficult to prove links to a foreign government, but intelligence officials say China, Russia and Iran are among the countries pushing hardest to obtain the latest technologies. ''In the new global economy, our businesses are increasingly targets for theft,'' said Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's criminal division. ''In order to stay a leader in innovation, we've got to protect these trade secrets.'' Mr. Huang, 45, who says he is not guilty, is being prosecuted under an economic espionage provision in use for only the seventh time. Created by Congress in 1996 to address a shift toward industrial spying after the cold war, the law makes it a crime to steal business trade secrets, like software code and laboratory breakthroughs. The crime rises to espionage if the thefts are carried out to help a foreign government. Economic espionage charges are also pending against Jin Hanjuan, a software engineer for Motorola, who was arrested with a laptop full of company documents while boarding a plane for China, prosecutors said. Over the last year, other charges involving the theft of trade secrets -- a charge less serious than espionage -- have been filed against former engineers from General Motors and Ford who had business ties to China. And scientists at the DuPont Company and Valspar, a Minnesota paint company, recently pleaded guilty to stealing their employer's secrets after taking jobs in China. In two past espionage cases involving American computer companies, defendants said they saw a chance to make money and acted on their own, knowing that the information would be valuable to Chinese companies or agencies. In several cases, Chinese government agencies or scientific institutes provided money to start businesses or research to develop the ideas; that financing is what gave rise to the espionage charges. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, appointed by Congress to study the national security issues arising from America's economic relationship with China, said in a report last year that even in instances without direct involvement by Chinese officials, China's government ''has been a major beneficiary of technology acquired through industrial espionage.'' China has denied that its intelligence services go after American industries. China's Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the subject, but spokesmen for the Chinese foundation and the university that worked with Mr. Huang said they were not aware of any espionage. ''If it's true, we will start our own investigation into it,'' said Chen Yue, a spokesman for the Natural Science Foundation of China, which gave Mr. Huang grants to conduct research there. American officials and corporate trade groups say they fear economic spying will increase as China's quest for Western know-how spreads from military systems to everyday commercial technologies. After focusing for decades on low-cost assembly operations, China ''feels it really needs to turn the corner and become a technology power in its own right,'' said James Mulvenon, the director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis in Washington, which tracks Chinese activities for federal agencies and corporate clients. Mr. Mulvenon said China is trying to woo back thousands of ethnic Chinese scientists who have trained or worked in the United States. ''They basically roll out the red carpet for these guys,'' he said. As economic crimes become easier to commit -- in some cases as simple as downloading data and pressing ''Send'' -- security analysts say some American companies must share the blame for thefts because they do not adequately monitor employees. At Motorola, for example, court records show that Ms. Jin, the software engineer, downloaded company documents during two sick leaves and tapped into the company's computers from China, where, prosecutors say, she met with a company linked to the Chinese military. Ms. Jin, a naturalized United States citizen who was born in China, says she is not guilty, and is awaiting trial in Illinois. Catching and prosecuting wrongdoers is also made difficult by the refusal of some companies to report breaches. ''When you have public companies with their stock values tied to their assets, the last thing they want the buyer of that stock to think is that their assets are compromised,'' said Michael Maloof, the chief technology officer of TriGeo Network Security, a company that provides computer monitoring systems. The first economic espionage case, filed in 2001 against a Japanese scientist, collapsed when Japan refused to extradite him. The six other cases have involved China, and the Justice Department won the first three. In one case, two Silicon Valley engineers admitted to stealing secrets about computer chips, then arranging financing from Chinese government agencies to start business. In another case, a retired Boeing engineer was convicted after a search of his home found documents on United States military and space programs, as well as letters from Chinese aviation officials seeking the data. The Justice Department lost a case involving two California engineers. The government focused on documents showing that the engineers were working with a venture capitalist in China to seek financing for a microchip business from China's 863 program, which supports development of technologies with military applications. But the men were arrested before they filed the grant application. The judge in the case concluded in May that the government had needed to prove that the men had ''intended to confer a benefit'' on China, ''not receive a benefit from it.'' In Mr. Huang's case, according to the indictment, he had received money from the Natural Science Foundation of China, a government organization, to conduct insecticide research. Mr. Huang grew up in China, and has lived in the United States or Canada since 1995. While working for Dow's farm chemicals unit, Dow AgroSciences, he also took a job as a visiting professor at a Chinese university and made eight trips to China, court records show. Besides directing research at the university while at Dow, he later smuggled samples of a bacterial strain from Dow to China in his son's suitcase, the authorities said. Mr. Huang's lawyer, Michael Donahoe, said at a recent hearing that the case was ''hypothetical.'' But Cynthia Ridgeway, an assistant United States attorney, said that with Dow's Chinese patent due to expire in 2012, Mr. Huang had ''the full recipe'' needed to try to take its business to China. Last week, a judge denied Mr. Huang's request for bail. He is awaiting trial in federal custody in Indiana.  "
"Thrills and Traps, Lurking on the Web","To the Editor:   ''Tell-All Generation Keeps Some Things Offline'' (front page, May 9), about social networks, raises real concerns regarding privacy online.   While the ''tell all'' generations are reported to be as concerned with privacy as their older counterparts, they nevertheless continue to naively upload terabytes of information onto social networking sites. And those sites have a vested interest in keeping it that way.   In promoting more disclosure, the social networking industry is ''capturing'' personal information for advertisers and for further data-mining. These efforts are pushing a cultural privacy paradigm shift that will have significant repercussions.    With progressive views on privacy, younger generations will be more likely to put personal, health and financial information online. These disclosures will have more serious and lasting consequences than just a compromising photograph.   Moreover, given the sometimes subtle correlations gleaned from data-mining, it may not be obvious what uploaded information will eventually be the most revealing.   Dov Greenbaum Mark Gerstein Oakland, Calif., May 10, 2010   To the Editor:   It's quite a relief to see that younger people these days are learning to keep information private. I myself have a Facebook account, and I understand that it is sometimes tempting to display all of your information.   But these days, people need to take more and more caution with their computer and Internet use. Hacking and viruses are common, especially on networking sites with millions of users.   Facebook users should be very watchful of what they put online and enable as many privacy settings as possible. Nobody likes to be ''friended'' by a stranger!   Ashley Ko Coto de Caza, Calif., May 10, 2010   To the Editor:   Excuse me, but is this article saying that Facebook fans resent their privacy being compromised? I admit I'm not a Facebook person, as I prefer friends with quality rather than in quantity, so hearing people who bare their every thought online complain about a glitch in confidentiality is pretty funny.   Eleanor Ann Macdonald Joliet, Ill., May 9, 2010   To the Editor:   Re ''Teenage Insults, Scrawled on Web, Not on Walls'' (front page, May 6):   While there is plenty of anecdotal information about the dangers of cyberbullying in your article, I have a more central concern: how should a school deal with the social implications of social networking?   Formspring, in its worst form, legitimizes the idea that it is truly possible to find out what all teenagers want to know -- what people think of them.   Because we are irrational and compulsive teenagers who have been thrust into a cyberworld even more confusing and ambiguous than the tangible one we navigate every day, we forget that there is another person at the other end of the ''post'' button staring at a screen and being hurt by our cruel vents, and that the comments we put on Formspring or any other equivalent site are permanent and public.   Contrary to what a student said in your article, the comments posted on Formspring really do mean something, and have real-life consequences, consequences that walk into the doors of schools every morning. As of now, it seems that no one, administrators and students alike, has any idea of how to handle the fault line between the Internet and daily life in an effective and meaningful way.   Sadie Bergen New York, May 10, 2010   The writer is a junior at Stuyvesant High School.   To the Editor:   It's disheartening to read about Formspring, a new social networking site. Sounds like slam books on steroids, viciousness gone viral.   As an advice columnist for girls, I tell tweens three things:   Listen to friends, not frenemies or enemies.   Try to log off, and do not respond to cyberbullying.   Hang in there; life gets easier after middle school.   Carol Weston New York, May 6, 2010  "
Safran to Buy Most of L-1 in Cash Deal,"PARIS -- Safran, the French aerospace and defense systems company, said Monday that it would spend $1.1 billion to buy most of L-1 Identity Solutions, a United States company that specializes in biometrics, a sector going through some consolidation.  Safran is acquiring the parts of L-1 involved in biometrics, secure identification documents and enterprise access. L-1's intelligence services arm is being sold to BAE Systems for $296 million. Safran will also assume about $100 million in debt from L-1, which is based in Stamford, Conn. Safran has offered L-1 shareholders $12 a share in cash, a premium of 31.2 percent over the stock's recent trades. The French company is financing the transaction from its own cash reserves. The L-1 businesses will be integrated into Morpho, a Safran unit that is already operating in the homeland security sector. The businesses are expected to add to earnings within the year. General Electric owns a 19 percent stake in Morpho. Jean-Paul Herteman, chief executive of Safran, said that the L-1 acquisition would increase revenue from its security business next year to 15 percent of the company's total, close to its 20 percent target. The combined company would have had revenue of about $700 million last year with 2,200 employees in the United States. In another example of consolidation in the sector, 3M announced late last month that it was buying one of L-1's rivals, Cogent, which also makes biometric recognition systems, for $943 million. In 2008, Safran lost to L-1 when it tried to take over Digimarc, a maker of identification systems. Safran is also trying to expand in its other domain, aerospace. In June, another French aerospace company, Zodiac, rejected a merger proposal from Safran. RBC and Societe Generale advised Safran on the transaction, with the law firms Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Kaye Scholer acting as counsel. Goldman Sachs and Stone Key Partners advised L-1, with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom as counsel.  "
LifeLock Settles With F.T.C. Over Charges of Deception,"WASHINGTON -- LifeLock, the company that broadcast its chief executive's Social Security number as part of its claim that it could protect anyone against identity theft, agreed on Tuesday to pay $12 million to settle charges that it misled consumers  about the effectiveness of its service.     The settlement, announced by the Federal Trade Commission and a group of 35 state attorneys general, requires LifeLock to refrain from making further deceptive claims and take more stringent measures to safeguard the personal information that it collects from customers.   Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the trade commission, said that ''several hundred persons, at least,'' who were LifeLock customers had become victims of identity fraud while using the company's service. Customers typically paid $10 a month for the service, he said.   The commission also claimed that the ''fraud alerts'' LifeLock  placed on individuals' credit files protected against only certain types of identity theft, mainly the opening of new accounts, which is the cause of fewer than one in five cases of identity theft.   LifeLock's customers were left vulnerable to misuse of their current accounts, the most common form of the crime. The identities of about eight million Americans are used illegally each year, the officials said.   ''This was a fairly egregious case of deceptive advertising from our perspective,'' Mr. Leibowitz said.   In an interview, Todd Davis, the LifeLock chief executive, said that the company had adopted a new advertising campaign that complied with the trade commission's request. ''We have differing views on what the intent of the message was'' of the earlier ads, Mr. Davis said, adding he believed that the commission's actions ''set a standard for the entire industry to follow.''    Lisa Madigan, the Illinois attorney general, who joined Mr. Leibowitz in announcing the action at a news conference in Chicago, said that while LifeLock did provide some legitimate services, ''most of what they did, you can do on your own and you can do it free.''   The biggest problem with the company's claims, she said, was its guarantee to prevent  identity theft from ever happening. ''There is nothing you can do or you can purchase that is a 100 percent guarantee against identity theft,'' Ms. Madigan said.    Mr. Davis knows the truth of that. After he began broadcasting his Social Security number, dozens of attempts were made to secure credit or identification using the information. At least one attempt succeeded, when a man in Texas secured a $500 payday loan in 2007 using Mr. Davis's Social Security number.  "
A Rapid Security Check Could Be Revived at Airports,"The idea of a monthly subscription service that allows people to jump to the head of airport security lines by submitting to a fingerprint or iris scan may be getting another chance.   The assets of Verified Identity Pass, the start-up that ran the Clear service in 18 airports in the United States and shut down about a year ago in a dispute with creditors, were acquired for $6 million in a federal bankruptcy proceeding on April 16.   The winning bidder, AlClear, is led by two former investment managers and backed in part by Robert V. LaPenta, chief executive of L-1 Identity Solutions, a biometrics company based in Stamford, Conn., that supplied kiosks and other technology to the original Verified Identity Pass.    The new company, to be renamed Clear, will be based in New York. Mr. LaPenta and Michael Chertoff, a former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, will sit on its board.   AlClear acquired the customer database, the brand and the airport kiosks of the old V.I.P., which had more than 160,000 subscribers when it went out of business. But AlClear did not acquire what was perhaps the older company's most important asset: its relationship with airports. Those contracts were voided in bankruptcy court.   The company said it was in advanced discussions with several airports and hoped to open its fast-lane security service this fall. In the next few weeks, it will begin contacting former subscribers and offering them the opportunity to reactivate their memberships.    ''We know customers were left holding the bag,'' said Caryn Seidman-Becker, a co-founder of the new Clear along with Kenneth L. Cornick, a former colleague in Arience Capital Management, a defunct hedge fund. ''We have to rebuild relationships with airports, Washington and with our customers, and make sure we are building long-term partnerships. We want to bring back the service in the highest integrity way.''    Ms. Seidman-Becker said that the fee for the new service would be $179 a year, down from $200, and that subscribers could buy a family plan for an additional $50. A company spokesman said that Clear would purge the personal data -- including fingerprint and iris patterns -- of customers who chose not to reactivate their accounts.   The new Clear may have additional competition. It prevailed in a lengthy bankruptcy proceeding over another group, Henry Inc., run by a San Francisco Bay Area investment banker, Kurtis Fechtmeyer. Mr. Fechtmeyer said his firm planned to move ahead anyway with developing its own airport fast-lane service.   Cogent Systems, a competitor to L-1 Identity Solutions in the market for biometric systems, also has plans to introduce  a national verified-traveler program.    The companies are hopeful that they can make the concept work by reducing costs.   The vision for Clear was laid out soon after the 9/11 attacks by the entrepreneur Steven Brill, the founder of Court TV. Mr. Brill wrote that a private company could solve the problems of long security lines in airports with a smart identification card, backed by biometric tests, that would allow members to pass through special lines at airports.   The company he created, Verified Identity Pass, was the most well-known of several registered-traveler programs. It required people to go through a lengthy enrollment process, give up their personal information, and record  an iris scan and fingerprints. In return, they were able to bypass security lines, accompanied by Clear ''concierges'' who were stationed at airports like Kennedy International.   But V.I.P. became just as well-known for a string of miscues. In 2008, a company laptop containing the personal information of some 33,000 customers was lost for a week at San Francisco International Airport.   After V.I.P. ceased operations last year, some members filed a class-action lawsuit, accusing the company of fraud and of breaching its contracts by not refunding money to subscribers. But those lawsuits were set aside during the bankruptcy process.  "
United Arab Emirates Drops BlackBerry Threat,"HONG KONG -- The United Arab Emirates, one of several countries that have threatened to suspend services for the Blackberry smartphones this year, on Friday backed away from a ban that was to have come into effect on Monday, after reaching an agreement with the popular messaging devices' manufacturer, Research In Motion.  The U.A.E. telecommunications regulator said BlackBerry services were now ''compliant with the U.A.E.'s telecommunications regulatory framework,'' and that all BlackBerry services would continue to operate as normal beyond Monday. It was not clear what, if any, concessions, R.I.M. had made to avert the bans. A representative for R.I.M. in Britain could not be reached immediately for comment on Friday. But the U.A.E. telecommunications authority said that R.I.M., which is based in Canada and is one of the world's largest makers of smartphones, had shown ''positive engagement'' in reaching a compromise. One analyst said the announcement meant that RIM had either consented to share encryption data with U.A.E. officials, which it had previously said was impossible to do, or that U.A.E. regulators had relented, wary of the economic impact of losing Blackberry service in the Emirates. ''Either the U.A.E. allowed RIM to provide the same services, realizing the threats from BlackBerry services are extremely limited, or they have come to some sort of technical agreement -- the most likely outcome -- where RIM would allow the U.A.E. government to have limited access to BlackBerry data by providing an encryption key in extreme circumstances,'' said Shardul Schrimani, an analyst in London at IHS Global Insight, a research firm. If the ban had been imposed, U.A.E. businesses would have instigated a major backlash against the government, Mr. Schrimani said in an interview. The U.A.E., home to the key financial and air transport hub of Dubai, in August had cited security concerns as a reason for threatening a ban on BlackBerry e-mail and Web-browsing services. Governments in Saudi Arabia and India earlier this year expressed security concerns about R.I.M.'s reluctance to provide them with access to its encrypted e-mail traffic -- an information flow that R.I.M., whose success in corporate e-mail is largely built on the security features of its delivery system itself, claims to have no way of decoding. The Saudi government later lifted the threat of a ban, while the authorities in India, one of R.I.M.'s fastest-growing markets, in late August said they would study for two months a proposal by the company to facilitate some access to messages by the Indian law enforcement agencies. Kevin J. O'Brien contributed reporting from Berlin. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
New Claim Of Evidence In Google's China Case,"An American computer security researcher has found what he says he believes is strong evidence of the digital fingerprints of Chinese authors in the software programs used in attacks against Google.    The search engine giant announced last Tuesday that it had experienced a series of Internet break-ins it believed were of Chinese origin. The company's executives did not, however, detail the evidence leading them to the conclusion that the Chinese government was behind the attacks, beyond stating that e-mail accounts of several Chinese human rights activists had been compromised.   In the week since the announcement, several computer security companies have made claims supporting Google's suspicions, but the evidence has remained circumstantial.   Now, by analyzing the software used in the break-ins against Google and dozens of other companies, Joe Stewart, a malware specialist with SecureWorks, a computer security company based in Atlanta, said he  determined the main program used in the attack contained a module based on an unusual algorithm from a Chinese technical paper that has been published exclusively on Chinese-language Web sites.    The malware at the heart of Google attack is described by researchers as a ''Trojan horse'' that is intended to open a back door to a computer on the Internet. The program, called Hydraq by the computer security research community and intended to subvert computers that run different versions of the Windows operating system, was first noticed earlier this year.   Mr. Stewart describes himself as a ''reverse engineer,'' one of a relatively small group of software engineers who disassemble malware codes in an effort to better understand the nature of the attacks that have been introduced by the computer underground, and now possibly by governments as well.   ''If you look at the code in a debugger you see patterns that jump out at you,'' he said. In this case he discovered software code that represented an unusual algorithm, or formula, intended for error-checking transmitted data.   He acknowledged that he could not completely rule out the possibility that the clue had been placed in the program intentionally by programmers from another government intent on framing the Chinese, but he said that was unlikely. ''Occam's Razor suggests that the simplest explanation is probably the best one.''   "
Iran Denies Malware Connection to Nuclear Delay,"TEHRAN -- Iranian officials say a ''small leak'' was the cause of the latest setback to starting up its first nuclear power plant, and that the delay has nothing to do with a malicious computer worm that has infected industrial plants across the country.  The head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, told the state-run IRNA news agency on Monday that engineers had found the leak while the reactor was being washed. The delay has forced Iranian officials to push back plans to bring the nuclear facility at Bushehr online, extending the inauguration to early next year. Mr. Salehi denied that the delay had any connection to the Stuxnet computer worm, which has affected more than 30,000 computers across Iran and has been found on some personal computers of staff members at the plant, located in southern Iran near the Persian Gulf. ''This issue has nothing to do with the virus,'' he said. But even if the malware did not infect control systems at the plant, the delay is yet another setback for a nuclear facility that has been dogged for years by technical problems and foot-dragging by Iran's Russian partners. The Bushehr nuclear power plant was opened with great fanfare in August in the presence of Iranian and Russian nuclear energy officials and domestic and international media. Officials had originally said that the plant would begin to feed Iran's electricity grid by November, but last week Iran delayed its operational date to January without giving an explanation. Iranian officials have maintained that the Bushehr plant, Iran's first nuclear power-generation facility, was unaffected by the Stuxnet worm, which was developed to infiltrate Siemens-designed control systems such as those thought to be installed at Bushehr. On Sunday, a spokesman for Iran's Ministry of Industries and Mines announced that Iranian industrial units had been completely cleansed of the Stuxnet worm, implying that at least some systems had been affected. Iran has portrayed Stuxnet as part of a ''cyberwar'' waged by Western nations. On Saturday, Iran's intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi, announced the capture of an unspecified number of ''nuclear spies'' in connection with attempts to spread the Stuxnet worm. The authors of the attack remain unknown, though computer-security experts suspect that it was designed by a government to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. ''All of the destructive activities perpetrated by the oppressors in cyberspace will be discovered quickly and means of combating these plans will be implemented,'' Mr. Moslehi said, suggesting that the battle against Stuxnet was not yet over.

The Death of the Open Web,"The Web is a teeming commercial city. It's haphazardly planned. Its public spaces are mobbed, and signs of urban decay abound in broken links and abandoned projects. Malware and spam have turned living conditions in many quarters unsafe and unsanitary. Bullies and hucksters roam the streets. An entrenched population of rowdy, polyglot rabble seems to dominate major sites.    People who find the Web distasteful -- ugly, uncivilized -- have nonetheless been forced to live there: it's the place to go for jobs, resources, services, social life, the future. But now, with the purchase of an iPhone or an iPad, there's a way out, an orderly suburb that lets you sample the Web's opportunities without having to mix with the riffraff. This suburb is defined by apps from the glittering App Store: neat, cute homes far from the Web city center, out in pristine Applecrest Estates. In the migration of dissenters from the ''open'' Web to pricey and secluded apps, we're witnessing urban decentralization, suburbanization and the online equivalent of white flight.    The parallels between what happened to cities like Chicago, Detroit and New York in the 20th century and what's happening on the Internet since the introduction of the App Store are striking. Like the great modern American cities, the Web was founded on equal parts opportunism and idealism. Over the years, nerds, students, creeps, outlaws, rebels, moms, fans, church mice, good-time Charlies, middle managers, senior citizens, starlets, presidents and corporate predators all made their home on the Web. In spite of a growing consensus about the dangers of Web vertigo and the importance of curation, there were surprisingly few ''walled gardens'' online -- like the one Facebook purports to (but does not really) represent.   But a kind of virtual redlining is now under way. The Webtropolis is being stratified. Even if, like most people, you still surf the Web on a desktop or laptop, you will have noticed pay walls, invitation-only clubs, subscription programs, privacy settings and other ways of creating tiers of access. All these things make spaces feel ''safe'' -- not only from viruses, instability, unwanted light and sound, unrequested porn, sponsored links and pop-up ads, but also from crude design, wayward and unregistered commenters and the eccentric voices and images that make the Web constantly surprising, challenging and enlightening.    When a wall goes up, the space you have to pay to visit must, to justify the price, be nicer than the free ones. The catchphrase for software developers is ''a better experience.'' Behind pay walls like the ones on Honolulu Civil Beat, the new venture by the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, and Rupert Murdoch's Times of London, production values surge. Cool software greets the paying lady and gentleman; they get concierge service, perks. Web stations with entrance fees are more like boutiques than bazaars.   The far more significant development, however, is that many people are on their way to quitting the open Web entirely. That's what the 50 million or so users of the iPhone and iPad are in position to do. By choosing machines that come to life only when tricked out with apps from the App Store, users of Apple's radical mobile devices increasingly commit themselves to a more remote and inevitably antagonistic relationship with the Web. Apple rigorously vets every app and takes 30 percent of all sales; the free content and energy of the Web does not meet the refined standards set by the App Store. For example, the Weather Channel Max app, which turns the weather into a thrilling interactive movie, offers a superior experience of meteorology to that of Weather.com, which looks like a boring cluttered textbook: white space, columns of fussy bullet points and thumbnail images.   ''The App Store must rank among the most carefully policed software platforms in history,'' the technology writer Steven Johnson recently noted in The Times. Policed why? To maintain the App Store's separateness from the open Web, of course, and to drive up the perceived value of the store's offerings. Perception, after all, is everything: many apps are to the Web as bottled water is to tap -- an inventive and proprietary new way of decanting, packaging and pricing something that could once be had free.   Apps sparkle like sapphires and emeralds for people bored by the junky nondesign of monster sites like Yahoo, Google, Craigslist, eBay, YouTube and PayPal. That sparkle is worth money. Even to the most committed populist there's something rejuvenating about being away from an address bar and ads and links and prompts -- those constant reminders that the Web is an overcrowded and often maddening metropolis and that you're not special there. Confidence that you're not going to get hustled, mobbed or mugged -- that's precious, too.    I see why people fled cities, and I see why they're fleeing the open Web. But I think we may also, one day, regret it.     CITY NUMBERS   On the Net, Apple types may be fleeing the hordes, but in life the young and educated are heading to urban centers. Check out these and other findings by the Brookings Institution at brookings.edu/metro.   WHET YOUR APPETITE   Still don't really know what an app is? Don't buy an iPad yet; watch video reviews of apps free on YouTube. Search ''iPad app reviews'' for funny homemade demos. Don't miss Xeni Jardin's on boingboingvideo.   ALCHEMY   The Elements, a ravishing multimedia periodic-table app based on ''The Elements,'' by Theodore Gray, may blow your mind and teach you chemistry.

"In a Computer Worm, a Possible Biblical Clue","Deep inside the computer worm that some specialists suspect is aimed at slowing Iran's race for a nuclear weapon lies what could be a fleeting reference to the Book of Esther, the Old Testament tale in which the Jews pre-empt a Persian plot to destroy them. That use of the word ''Myrtus'' -- which can be read as an allusion to Esther -- to name a file inside the code is one of several murky clues that have emerged as computer experts try to trace the origin and purpose of the rogue Stuxnet program, which seeks out a specific kind of command module for industrial equipment. Not surprisingly, the Israelis are not saying whether Stuxnet has any connection to the secretive cyberwar unit it has built inside Israel's intelligence service. Nor is the Obama administration, which while talking about cyberdefenses has also rapidly ramped up a broad covert program, inherited from the Bush administration, to undermine Iran's nuclear program. In interviews in several countries, experts in both cyberwar and nuclear enrichment technology say the Stuxnet mystery may never be solved.  There are many competing explanations for myrtus, which could simply signify myrtle, a plant important to many cultures in the region. But some security experts see the reference as a signature allusion to Esther, a clear warning in a mounting technological and psychological battle as Israel and its allies try to breach Tehran's most heavily guarded project. Others doubt the Israelis were involved and say the word could have been inserted as deliberate misinformation, to implicate Israel. ''The Iranians are already paranoid about the fact that some of their scientists have defected and several of their secret nuclear sites have been revealed,'' one former intelligence official who still works on Iran issues said recently. ''Whatever the origin and purpose of Stuxnet, it ramps up the psychological pressure.'' So a calling card in the code could be part of a mind game, or sloppiness or whimsy from the coders. The malicious code has appeared in many countries, notably China, India, Indonesia and Iran. But there are tantalizing hints that Iran's nuclear program was the primary target. Officials in both the United States and Israel have made no secret of the fact that undermining the computer systems that control Iran's huge enrichment plant at Natanz is a high priority. (The Iranians know it, too: They have never let international inspectors into the control room of the plant, the inspectors report, presumably to keep secret what kind of equipment they are using.) The fact that Stuxnet appears designed to attack a certain type of Siemens industrial control computer, used widely to manage oil pipelines, electrical power grids and many kinds of nuclear plants, may be telling. Just last year officials in Dubai seized a large shipment of those controllers -- known as the Simatic S-7 -- after Western intelligence agencies warned that the shipment was bound for Iran and would likely be used in its nuclear program. ''What we were told by many sources,'' said Olli Heinonen, who retired last month as the head of inspections at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, ''was that the Iranian nuclear program was acquiring this kind of equipment.'' Also, starting in the summer of 2009, the Iranians began having tremendous difficulty running their centrifuges, the tall, silvery machines that spin at supersonic speed to enrich uranium -- and which can explode spectacularly if they become unstable. In New York last week, Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, shrugged off suggestions that the country was having trouble keeping its enrichment plants going. Yet something -- perhaps the worm or some other form of sabotage, bad parts or a dearth of skilled technicians -- is indeed slowing Iran's advance. The reports on Iran show a fairly steady drop in the number of centrifuges used to enrich uranium at the main Natanz plant. After reaching a peak of 4,920 machines in May 2009, the numbers declined to 3,772 centrifuges this past August, the most recent reporting period. That is a decline of 23 percent. (At the same time, production of low-enriched uranium has remained fairly constant, indicating the Iranians have learned how to make better use of fewer working machines.) Computer experts say the first versions of the worm appeared as early as 2009 and that the sophisticated version contained an internal time stamp from January of this year. These events add up to a mass of suspicions, not proof. Moreover, the difficulty experts have had in figuring out the origin of Stuxnet points to both the appeal and the danger of computer attacks in a new age of cyberwar. For intelligence agencies they are an almost irresistible weapon, free of fingerprints. Israel has poured huge resources into Unit 8200, its secretive cyberwar operation, and the United States has built its capacity inside the National Security Agency and inside the military, which just opened a Cyber Command. But the near impossibility of figuring out where they came from makes deterrence a huge problem -- and explains why many have warned against the use of cyberweapons. No country, President Obama was warned even before he took office, is more vulnerable to cyberattack than the United States. For now, it is hard to determine if the worm has infected centrifuge controllers at Natanz. While the S-7 industrial controller is used widely in Iran, and many other countries, even Siemens says it does not know where it is being used. Alexander Machowetz, a spokesman in Germany for Siemens, said the company did no business with Iran's nuclear program. ''It could be that there is equipment,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''But we never delivered it to Natanz.'' But Siemens industrial controllers are unregulated commodities that are sold and resold all over the world -- the controllers intercepted in Dubai traveled through China, according to officials familiar with the seizure. Ralph Langner, a German computer security consultant who was the first independent expert to assert that the malware had been ''weaponized'' and designed to attack the Iranian centrifuge array, argues that the Stuxnet worm could have been brought into the Iranian nuclear complex by Russian contractors. ''It would be an absolute no-brainer to leave an infected USB stick near one of these guys,'' he said, ''and there would be more than a 50 percent chance of having him pick it up and infect his computer.'' There are many reasons to suspect Israel's involvement in Stuxnet. Intelligence is the single largest section of its military and the unit devoted to signal, electronic and computer network intelligence, known as Unit 8200, is the largest group within intelligence. Yossi Melman, who covers intelligence for the newspaper Haaretz and is at work on a book about Israeli intelligence over the past decade, said in a telephone interview that he suspected that Israel was involved. He noted that Meir Dagan, head of Mossad, had his term extended last year partly because he was said to be involved in important projects. He added that in the past year Israeli estimates of when Iran will have a nuclear weapon had been extended to 2014. ''They seem to know something, that they have more time than originally thought,'' he said. Then there is the allusion to myrtus -- which may be telling, or may be a red herring. Several of the teams of computer security researchers who have been dissecting the software found a text string that suggests that the attackers named their project Myrtus. The guava fruit is part of the Myrtus family, and one of the code modules is identified as Guava. It was Mr. Langner who first noted that Myrtus is an allusion to the Hebrew word for Esther. The Book of Esther tells the story of a Persian plot against the Jews, who attacked their enemies pre-emptively. ''If you read the Bible you can make a guess,'' said Mr. Langner, in a telephone interview from Germany on Wednesday. Carol Newsom, an Old Testament scholar at Emory University, confirmed the linguistic connection between the plant family and the Old Testament figure, noting that Queen Esther's original name in Hebrew was Hadassah, which is similar to the Hebrew word for myrtle. Perhaps, she said, ''someone was making a learned cross-linguistic wordplay.'' But other Israeli experts said they doubted Israel's involvement. Shai Blitzblau, the technical director and head of the computer warfare laboratory at Maglan, an Israeli company specializing in information security, said he was ''convinced that Israel had nothing to do with Stuxnet.'' ''We did a complete simulation of it and we sliced the code to its deepest level,'' he said. ''We have studied its protocols and functionality. Our two main suspects for this are high-level industrial espionage against Siemens and a kind of academic experiment.'' Mr. Blitzblau noted that the worm hit India, Indonesia and Russia before it hit Iran, though the worm has been found disproportionately in Iranian computers. He also noted that the Stuxnet worm has no code that reports back the results of the infection it creates. Presumably, a good intelligence agency would like to trace its work.  "
Two Koreas Ease Tensions Over Sinking of Ship,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea expressed a desire to keep a joint industrial complex in operation, South Korean officials said Monday, while the South indicated that it might reconsider its decision to revive psychological warfare against the North.   The developments showed that the two Koreas were carefully weighing the option of easing their confrontation, analysts said.  Tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula have deteriorated to their worst point in years after a South Korean warship sank on March 26. South Korea blamed a North Korean torpedo attack for the blast.   ''Neither side can afford to keep building up tensions,'' said Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea specialist at Dongguk University in Seoul. ''Both sides have been raising tensions the way you blow into your balloon, and now they need an excuse for each other to stop blowing so that the balloon won't burst.''   After it formally accused the North on May 20 of having responsibility for the sinking, South Korea cut off nearly all trade with the North and began a diplomatic campaign to bring it before the United Nations Security Council for punishment. The South also vowed to resume psychological warfare against the North, after a six-year hiatus, by rebuilding loudspeakers along the border for propaganda broadcasts and by dropping leaflets over the North using balloons.   If the psychological war resumes, the North has warned that it would shut down a joint industrial complex at the North Korean border town of Kaesong -- the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean ties. The North also warned that it would shoot artillery shells across the border to blast the loudspeakers.   The South would certainly have to respond in kind, officials said, raising the possibility of a major skirmish along a border guarded by nearly two million troops on both sides.   ''We want to continue to develop the Kaesong project,'' the North Korean authorities said in a message delivered through South Korean businessmen at Kaesong on Sunday, according to a senior South Korean government official who briefed reporters Monday on the condition of anonymity.   Meanwhile, Jang Gwang-il, a senior policy maker at the Defense Ministry in Seoul, said that the South Korean military was still reviewing when to send leaflet balloons over the North. His remark was seen as a step back from the military's earlier vow to send the balloons as soon as the weather permitted.   Mr. Jang said that the South would ''make a comprehensive review of the situation'' before deciding whether and when to start launching leaflet balloons or broadcasting propaganda across the border.   The apparent pause in inter-Korean tensions came a day after Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China declined to join South Korea and Japan in publicly condemning North Korea at a three-way weekend summit meeting, instead urging both Koreas to defuse tensions.   On Monday, Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama of Japan told Mr. Wen that he supported Seoul's plans to bring North Korea before the Security Council for sanctions or condemnation, The Associated Press reported. The two countries also agreed to start negotiations over a treaty to develop natural gas resources under the East China Sea, said Osamu Sakashita, a spokesman for the prime minister's office.   South Korea remains determined to force North Korea to apologize and punish those responsible for the sinking, which killed 46 South Korean sailors. The North denies any involvement and warns of war if new sanctions are imposed.    But analysts say that neither Korea can benefit from sustained tensions. Public denouncements of the North may help candidates of President Lee Myung-bak's governing party in local elections in South Korea on Wednesday, but prolonged tensions will hurt its economy, they said.   While most South Koreans condemn the North for the sinking and support Mr. Lee's handling of the crisis so far, many also blame his tough stance toward the North for fueling a military provocation, surveys here show.   The North Korean threat to shut down the border raised some concern in South Korea that hundreds of South Korean workers who commute to Kaesong on a typical workday might be trapped there as hostages.   But South Korean officials say that if Kaesong is closed, North Korea will suffer more than the South. About 43,000 North Koreans would lose some of the best-paying jobs available for workers in the impoverished country, and the resulting discontent could spread out of Kaesong, they argue. The complex also provides the North with $40 million in workers' wages, most of which goes to the government.   The Kaesong complex, where 121 South Korean factories hire cheap North Korean labor, has been both praised as a testament to inter-Korean cooperation and denounced as a source of cash for the North's nuclear weapons program.   Of the several measures the South has taken, the possible resumption of psychological warfare has raised the most hackles in the North, which strives to keep its population isolated from outside news. Last week, the South resumed its ''Voice of Freedom'' radio broadcasts, which do not directly criticize North Korean leaders but promote the capitalist lifestyles of the South.    "
"In Russia-Belarus Information War, Documentary Is the Latest Salvo","MOSCOW -- A new documentary film about the Belarussian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, portrays him as a bumbling tyrant enamored of Hitler and Stalin. He has political opponents killed, journalists silenced and elections rigged in the film, all while keeping his faltering country locked in a Soviet time warp. For years, human rights groups and Western governments have been leveling similar accusations. But the latest salvo against Mr. Lukashenko comes from an unlikely source: Russia's government-controlled television.  The documentary is part of an all-out propaganda war that has erupted between Russia and neighboring Belarus, two former Soviet republics that were once so close they had been on track to reunite. When the documentary, titled ''Godfather,'' was aired last month on Russia's NTV television, it seemed to signal that the marriage was officially off. The mudslinging, which has played out in both countries' government-controlled media in recent weeks, reflects the deepening tensions between them. The latest dispute broke out in June when they tussled over natural gas prices, and continued when Mr. Lukashenko nearly scuttled a planned customs union between his country, Russia and Kazakhstan that had been a pet project of Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's prime minister and pre-eminent leader. For years the Kremlin has supported Mr. Lukashenko, praising elections that independent monitors called rigged, while also ignoring violent crackdowns on the opposition. Moscow bolstered Mr. Lukashenko's government with cheap natural gas and discounted duties on oil, which Belarus refined and resold. Russian subsidies, the moderator in the recent documentary says, ''are the main secret of the Belarussian economic miracle.'' In return, the Kremlin seems to believe that it has received little but headaches. Amid the natural gas pricing dispute in June, Belarus retaliated by briefly cutting off flows into Western Europe. Mr. Lukashenko has also been out of step with Russia's policies in the former Soviet Union. He has given refuge to Kyrgyzstan's former president, Kurmanbek S. Bakiyev, who was ousted in April after bloody riots that Moscow seemed to encourage. He has also failed to follow the Kremlin's lead in recognizing the independence of two separatist Georgian enclaves, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. ''He received a huge amount of money, with which he was in part able to support the economy of Belarus, its economic growth and the well-being of his people, without giving anything in return,'' Vladimir Ryzhkov, a Russian opposition politician, said on Russia's Ekho Moskvy radio last month. ''It seems the Russian leadership decided that that's it.'' Speaking to reporters recently, Mr. Putin played down the significance of the media campaign. ''I do not see any media war. Perhaps this is because I barely read any periodicals and have not been following the electronic media lately,'' Mr. Putin said. He was less ambivalent about Mr. Lukashenko, however: ''When it comes to money or energy supplies, everyone wants to get something from Russia for free, so when they don't they get annoyed.'' The ''Godfather'' documentary voices criticisms typically found in Western human rights reports about Belarus (and Russia, for that matter). It covers the disappearances and killings of Mr. Lukashenko's political opponents over the years and shows video of armored police officers beating antigovernment protesters. Images of Mr. Lukashenko dressed in military uniforms intersperse with footage of him inspecting collective farms. ''Little has changed since the U.S.S.R.,'' the narrator says at one point. Only those with satellite dishes were able to view the program inside Belarus, though it can easily be accessed on YouTube. And in the Soviet tradition of samizdat, people have been recording the film themselves and passing along bootleg copies, said Andrei Sannikov, a Belarussian opposition leader. Mr. Lukashenko, needless to say, was not pleased. He said that he was ''offended'' by the documentary. ''I know who gives these commands, who is governing these processes,'' he said in a statement on his Web site. Shortly after, Belarus fired back, publishing excerpts in one of Belarus's government newspapers from a highly critical report about Mr. Putin, written by Russian opposition figures. ''Savagery has become the norm in Russian society,'' the newspaper wrote in an accompanying commentary. Belarus's government-controlled First Channel also aired an interview with Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who has been vilified by Russia's leaders -- and who has been the target of unflattering Russian documentaries himself. In the interview, Mr. Saakashvili called the Lukashenko documentary hypocritical, noting the prevalence of political killings in Russia. ''This has the smell of a propaganda war,'' Mr. Saakashvili said. Responding to the interview, Boris Gryzlov, Russia's Parliament speaker, called Mr. Saakashvili an ''outlaw'' and suggested that there would be consequences for Belarus. ''Anyone who gives Saakashvili the opportunity to feel like a president, including in another country, is making a decision that could affect relations with Russia,'' he said. Russia's retreating support could certainly bode ill for Mr. Lukashenko in next year's presidential election. Some Russian political analysts have begun to speculate that the media campaign could signal the start of an effort to unseat him. In fact, several Belarussian opposition leaders traveled to Moscow last month, where they met informally with Russian officials, including Russia's finance minister and members of Mr. Putin's United Russia party. Russian soft-power in the form of media campaigns and economic pressure is credited with helping to unseat the Kyrgyz president, Mr. Bakiyev, in April. However, Mr. Lukashenko, who has been in power for 16 years, appears to be on surer footing than his Kyrgyz colleague was. Still, the possibility of gaining Kremlin support has already enchanted some opposition figures in Belarus. ''This is a unique situation when Europe and Russia can agree on the conduct of the Belarussian presidential campaign,'' said Yaroslav Romanchuk, an opposition leader, who said he planned to run for president. ''This is the first time in history.''  "
