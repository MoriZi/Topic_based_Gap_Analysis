"Amid Hacker Attacks, Security Start-Ups Draw Attention","As hacker attacks swell, so do the fortunes of security start-ups.Accel Partners, an early backer of Facebook, announced on Wednesday that it had invested $50 million in Tenable Network Security, a software maker that helps companies identify network security problems. The investment represents the venture capital firm's largest initial investment in an American company. ""We're trying to accelerate in an exploding market,"" said Ping Li, an Accel partner. ""Tenable is a company we've been trying to invest in for a couple of years.""Accel's big bet on Tenable, which was founded in 2002, comes as other venture capital firms plow more and more money into security software start-ups and the broader enterprise market. Last year, the industry invested nearly a billion dollars in technology security start-ups, almost double the amount spent in 2010, according to a MoneyTree report produced by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the National Venture Capital Association and Thomson Reuters. Venture capital investors have also been emboldened by the strong stock performances of several recent enterprise initial public offerings. Those include Imperva, an Accel-backed company that went public last November and remains more than 72 percent above its offering price. In contrast, Facebook -- Accel's better known investment -- is trading at less than half its May offering price. The technology security market is expected to grow in the coming years, as corporations -- in response to highly publicized security breaches -- spend more money on patching up security holes and adjusting to the rise of mobile and cloud computing.""These major black eyes are happening with increasing frequency,"" Mr. Li said. ""And its not just big companies but also smaller companies, too.""Businesses already spend billions of dollars a year on firewalls, applications and antivirus software to keep hackers out of their systems. Yet even the companies that sell these solutions, like Symantec and RSA, cannot always keep out hackers.Part of the problem is that businesses have taken a piecemeal approach to security by using firewalls to keep hackers at bay and antivirus software to weed out malware. But none of these solutions communicate well with each other, a situation hackers readily exploit. When a vulnerability is detected, often it is after trade secrets have been stolen or customer data has already been exposed.Companies are increasingly looking for security solutions that can monitor network traffic and watch for unusual activity in real time. Tenable's software is used by thousands of enterprise and government clients, incuding the Defense Department, Amazon and Apple, to scan and monitor networks for vulnerabilities. The company has about 15,000 paying customers, a roughly 30 to 40 percent increase from last year, according to Jack Huffard, the president and chief operating officer of Tenable. Mr. Huffard said the investment would be used to expand its product line and to expand the business abroad. It also plans to double the size of its staff, now about 200 people, in the next couple of years. "
Technology Companies Confront a Scourge of the Internet,"For all the engineer-poaching and trash-talking going around Silicon Valley these days, there has also been a surprising amount of behind-the-scenes collaboration.For the past 18 months, engineers at PayPal, Google, Facebook, Yahoo, AOL, Microsoft and nine other technology companies have spent their off-hours (and some on-hours) working hand in hand to tackle the problem that plagues them all: e-mail phishing.E-mails about getting little blue pills, problems with your bank account and urgent money requests from stranded ""friends"" in Madrid have transformed in-boxes into cesspools of malicious links. These e-mails can steal passwords, empty out bank accounts, or recruit computers into ""botnets""-networks of computers that have been co-opted by hackers to crash Web sites in some cases, or destroy Iranian centrifuges in others. Over one hundred thousand accounts are hacked each day, according to the Online Trust Alliance.So, a year and a half ago, security experts from the big e-mail providers, financial services firms and e-mail security providers started meeting informally at security industry events, holding bi-weekly conference calls and getting together at least once every few months to confront the e-mail scams.On Monday, the informal working group says it will introduce a new industry standard for e-mail authentication and spam reporting called Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance - or simply, DMARC. The goal is not only to keep malware out of in-boxes, but to also get a better sense of the threat landscape: who's behind e-mails scams, where they lurk, how they spoof and who they target.Among the companies whose employees helped create DMARC, and are now signed up for the initiative: PayPal, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Yahoo, AOL, LinkedIn, American Greetings, Bank of America, Fidelity Investments and e-mail security firms ReturnPath, Agari, eCert, Cloudmark and the Trusted Domain Project.Starting Monday, other companies can adopt the new standard by registering with DMARC.org. Once they sign up, e-mail senders - whether they be a mom-and-pop bakeries or The Gap - will have a way of constantly communicating with the big e-mail providers at Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo and AOL about which e-mails purporting to be from their domains should be allowed into in-boxes, and which should not.DMARC requires that members adopt e-mail authentication policies whereby any e-mail that claims to be from their domain must pass one of two authentication tests. If an e-mail doesn't pass muster, a sender can tell the e-mail providers to quarantine the e-mail or reject it outright. In turn, senders can get real-time reporting on the state of their spoofing problems.They can also request reports from one of the e-mail security providers --  ReturnPath, Agari, eCert, Cloudmark or the Trusted Domain Project --  that detail how many e-mails purporting to be from their domains are sent each day, which Internet addresses they are sent from and, through a third party, send any malicious links back to Web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer) - for blocking.""This is a full-court press by the world's leading companies in consumer security to take on what has been a longstanding vulnerability for the benefit of the entire ecosystem,"" Brett McDowell, a senior security manager at PayPal and chair of DMARC.org, said in an interview last week.While the DMARC standard is new, the technologies involved are not. Two authentication technologies - one called ""Sender Policy Framework"" (SPF) and another called ""DomainKeys Identified Mail"" (DKIM) - have been widely deployed by e-mail senders for years.After a big problem with phishing in 2006, PayPal started reaching out to major e-mail providers to instruct them to block any PayPal e-mails that had not been authenticated either by SPF or DKIM. In 2007, PayPal set up a formal partnership with Yahoo and in 2008 did the same with Gmail.The process was crucial to combat phishing, but impossible to repeat on a larger scale, Mr. McDowell says. It had to be done through tedious, one-off partnerships with each e-mail provider and required lots of meetings and lots of paperwork.Meanwhile, with the exception of PayPal, e-mail receivers were left guessing which e-mail senders used which authentication technologies and had no scientific way of knowing which unauthenticated e-mails were harmful and which were legitimate.""DMARC fills that gap for us,"" says Paul Midgen, an engineer with Microsoft's Hotmail team. ""It basically is a statement by people who publish that record that says 'We authenticate all of our mail and if you ever get e-mail that hasn't been authenticated, here is what you do with it.'""As for the major e-mail senders, whose brands invariably suffer anytime they get spoofed, ""We now have a way of saying: 'This e-mail with this Facebook notification really is from us,'"" says Mike Adkins, a Facebook engineer.""This is not your everyday industry collaboration and innovation launch,"" adds Mr. McDowell. ""This effort covers the vast majority of the world's in-boxes."" "
That Was Fast: Criminals Exploit LinkedIn Breach For Phishing Attacks,"After hackers posted millions of encoded LinkedIn passwords to a Russian hacker site on Wednesday, criminals used news of the breach to trick unsuspecting users into downloading malware that can be used to extract financial gain.Shortly after the breach surfaced, LinkedIn users began receiving e-mails from what, at first glance, looked like LinkedIn. The e-mails asked users to confirm their e-mail address by clicking on an embedded link. But the link took users to scam sites, such as an illegal online pharmaceutical site that sells Viagra and other products.Several security researchers confirmed that the e-mails were scams and advised users to avoid clicking on any links in e-mails from LinkedIn and to only navigate to the site by typing LinkedIn.com directly into their browsers.If users have not already, they should immediately change their LinkedIn passwordand the password to any other site where they might have used the same password.The phishing attack marks the third headache for the professional social network in 24 hours. On Tuesday, security researchers said that a LinkedIn mobile app had been leaking sensitive calendar information to LinkedIn's Web servers without their knowledge. On Wednesday, the breach exposed vulnerabilities in LinkedIn's data security practices, specifically that the social network did not isolate users' credentials on separate, secure machines and failed to ""salt"" passwords by appending random characters to them before encoding them.Rob Rachwald, director of security at Imperva, said the incidents should be a wake-up call to companies to take appropriate security measures.""Not salting passwords and keeping meeting data imply a broader indifference for data security that should make all LinkedIn users think twice about what they post,"" said Mr. Rachwald.

Daily Report: White House Joins Online Privacy Debate,"A consortium of companies responsible for the delivery of nearly 90 percent of online  ads that appear on a user's screen based on browsing and buying habits have agreed to comply when consumers choose to control online tracking.The Obama administration on Wednesday set out a framework for a new privacy code that moves closer to letting consumers use a one-click, one-touch process to tell Internet companies whether they want their online activity tracked, reports Edward Wyattof The New York Times. He writes that although the White House has entered the debate over Internet privacy, much remains to be done before consumers can click on a button in their Web browser to set their privacy standards. Congress will probably have to write legislation governing the collection and use of personal data, officials said, something that is unlikely to occur this year. And the companies that make browsers - Google, Microsoft, Apple and others - will have to agree to the new standards. The Federal Trade Commission, which has already begun monitoring privacy violations, will have the ability to enforce compliance with a code of conduct to be developed by the Commerce Department or with advertising industry guidelines that companies would adopt voluntarily.The Verge, which described the code of conduct as a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, reports that ""the core tenets are transparency, so that you know what data is being kept about you and where, access to that data so that you may correct it, context awareness so that it's used for the intent with which you provided it, and of course, security.""The Washington Postsays that the White House report doesn't ""address privacy on mobile devices - an area that firms are eager to protect from federal regulation."" As Bits reported on Wednesday, Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft agreed to clearly disclose the privacy policies of app developers at their app stores. "
"Losing in Court, and to Laptop Thieves, in a Battle With NASA Over Private Data","In 2007, Robert M. Nelson, an astronomer, and 27 other scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory sued NASA arguing that the space agency's background checks of employees of government contractors were unnecessarily invasive and violated their privacy rights.Privacy advocates chimed in as well, contending that the space agency would not be able to protect the confidential details it was collecting. The scientists took their case all the way to the Supreme Court only to lose last year.This month, Dr. Nelson opened a letter from NASA telling him of a significant data breach that could potentially expose him to identity theft.The very thing he and advocates warned about had occurred. A laptop used by an employee at NASA's headquarters in Washington had been stolen from a car parked on the street on Halloween, the space agency said.Although the laptop itself was password protected, unencrypted files on the laptop contained personal information on about 10,000 NASA employees -- including details like their names, birth dates, Social Security numbers and in some cases, details related to background checks into employees' personal lives.Millions of Americans have received similar data breach notices from employers, government agencies, medical centers, banks and retailers. NASA in particular has been subject to ''numerous cyberattacks'' and computer thefts in recent years, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office, an agency that conducts research for Congress.Even so, Dr. Nelson, who recently retired from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a research facility operated by the California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA, stands out as a glaring example of security lapses involving personal data, privacy advocates say.''To the extent that Robert Nelson looks like millions of other people working for firms employed by the federal government, this would seem to be a real problem,'' said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group which filed a friend-of-the-court brief for Dr. Nelson in the Supreme Court case.In a 2009 report titled ''NASA Needs to Remedy Vulnerabilities in Key Networks,'' the Government Accountability Office noted that the agency had reported 1,120 security incidents in fiscal 2007 and 2008 alone.It also singled out an incident in 2009 in which a NASA center reported the theft of a laptop containing about 3,000 unencrypted files about arms traffic regulations and wind tunnel tests for a supersonic jet.''NASA had not installed full-disk encryption on its laptops at all three centers,'' the report said. ''As a result, sensitive data transmitted through the unclassified network or stored on laptop computers were at an increased risk of being compromised.'' Other federal agencies have had similar problems. In 2006, for example, the Department of Veteran's Affairs reported the theft of an employee laptop and hard drive that contained personal details on about 26.5 million veterans. Last year, the G.A.O. cited the Internal Revenue Service for weaknesses in data control that could ''jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer information.''Also last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission warned its employees that their confidential financial information, like brokerage transactions, might have been compromised because an agency contractor had granted data access to a subcontractor without the S.E.C.'s authorization.On Wednesday, Dr. Nelson, the astronomer, and several other scientists in the NASA case held a news conference in which they asked members of Congress to investigate NASA's data collection practices and the recent data breach.Robert Jacobs, a NASA spokesman, said the agency's data security policy already adequately protected employees and contractors because it required computers to be encrypted before employees took them off agency premises. ''We are talking about a computer that should not have left the building in the first place,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''The data would have been secure had the employee followed policy.''The government argued in the case Dr. Nelson filed that a law called the Privacy Act, which governs data collection by federal agencies, provided the scientists with sufficient protection. The case reached the Supreme Court, which upheld government background checks for employees of contractors. The roots of Dr. Nelson's case against NASA date to 2004 when the Department of Homeland Security, under a directive signed by President George W. Bush, required federal agencies to adopt uniform identification credentials for all civil servants and contract employees. As part of the ID card standardization process, the department recommended agencies institute background checks.Several years later, when NASA announced it intended to start doing background checks at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Dr. Nelson and other scientists there objected.Those security checks could have included inquiries into medical treatment, counseling for drug use, or any ''adverse'' information about employees such as sexual activity or participation in protests, said Dan Stormer, a lawyer representing Dr. Nelson.But Dr. Nelson and other long-term employees of the lab challenged the legality of those checks, arguing that they violated their privacy rights. NASA, they said, had not established a legitimate need for such extensive investigations about low-risk employees like themselves who did not have security clearances or handle confidential information. Dr. Nelson, for example, specializes in solar system science -- concerning, for example, Io, a moon of Jupiter, and Titan, a moon of Saturn -- and publishes his work in scientific journals''It was an invitation to an open-ended fishing expedition,'' Dr. Nelson said of the background checks.In friend of the court briefs for Dr. Nelson, privacy groups cited many data security problems at federal agencies, arguing that there was a risk that NASA was not equipped to protect the confidential details it was collecting about employees and contractors.In 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco temporarily halted the background checks, saying that the case had raised important questions about privacy rights. But last year, the Supreme Court upheld the background investigations of employees of government contractors.Dr. Nelson said he retired from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory last June rather than submit to a background check. He now works as a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute of Tucson.NASA has contracted with ID Experts, a data breach company, to help protect employees whose data was contained on the stolen laptop against identity theft. Mr. Jacobs, the NASA spokesman, said the agency has encrypted almost 80 percent of its laptops and plans to encrypt the rest by Dec. 21. He added that he too received a letter from NASA warning that his personal information might have been compromised by the laptop theft. "
Scientists Make Short Work Of Breaking Security Keys,"For years private companies and government agencies have given their employees a card or token that produces a constantly changing set of numbers. Those devices became the preferred method of securing confidential communications online. No one could have access to the data without a secret key generated by the device.Computer scientists say they have now figured out how to extract that key from a widely used RSA electronic token in as little as 13 minutes. The scientists, who call themselves Team Prosecco, said their experiment can pry open one model of the RSA dongle - the SecurID 800 - as well as similar tools produced by other companies. They published their findings in a research paper to be presented at a cryptography conference in August; the findings were first reported Monday morning by Ars Technica, a technology news site.RSA Security, a division of the data storage company EMC, is one of the largest makers of the security fobs. A spokesman for the company, Kevin Kempskie, said that its own computer scientists were studying the paper to determine ''if this research is valid.''''RSA takes these kinds of research reports seriously,'' Mr. Kempskie said by e-mail. ''If there is a potential serious security vulnerability or threat to our customers, RSA will move quickly to address it.''This is not the first time the security of RSA's tokens has been challenged. In March 2011, RSA announced that hackers had breached its data protection. A few months later, the nation's largest military contractor, Lockheed Martin, said its computer network had been penetrated by thieves exploiting that RSA hack.The RSA data breach was widely publicized, principally because its dongles are used by many Fortune 500 companies and government agencies to give their employees access to their networks from home or while traveling.But long before that, cryptographers repeatedly warned that the standards used by these encryption tools were antiquated and susceptible to attack.''It would be nice if manufacturers paid more heed to what they might see only as theoretical attacks and were more cautious,'' said Chris Peikert, a theoretical cryptographer who teaches computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ''In an ideal world this problematic standard would have been transitioned away from years ago.''One of the reasons this standard has persisted, Mr. Peikert said, is that until now, researchers and manufacturers reckoned that it would take a long time to crack the key - and would therefore be impractical for hackers.The most recent paper changes that calculation. The scientists, almost all of whom are based in research institutes and universities in Europe, said they created another algorithm that allows five kinds of security hardware devices to be cracked, in fairly short periods of time.''The attacks are efficient enough to be practical,'' they wrote in the paper. They also wrote that they hoped the industry would reconsider the sustained use of these security standards.The RSA token took the shortest time to open: 13 minutes. A device made by Siemens took slightly longer: 22 minutes. A third device, made by Gemalto, based in the Netherlands, took 92 minutes.Other security standards are considered to be safer, researchers said, but security companies have been dealing with more urgent matters. ''Cryptography breaks very slowly. It's the molasses of computer science,'' said the security researcher Dan Kaminsky. ''There are many technologies we abstractly know are problematic and we prioritize fixing them less than things that are obviously on fire.''This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

A New Tool in Protecting Online Privacy,"Internet users who want to opt out of having their online behavior tracked by marketers have a couple of relatively easy options. They can change the privacy settings in their browser or click on the privacy icon that many display ads carry.To find out what is really going on under the pages of many Web sites and the third-party ad networks they work with, however, users would have to take a more difficult route - reading the privacy policy for each Web site in detail. Buried deep within the legalese used in many privacy policies is information on how Web publishers collect and handle the data they use to show ads to their visitors.But a new tool being released this week should make things easier. PrivacyChoice, a company that has analyzed and indexed the data in hundreds of privacy policies across the Web, has developed a system to score Web sites on a scale of 0 to 100 based on how a site collects and uses personal data.""For the first time, Web publishers and their users have a way to easily compare privacy practices across the Web,"" said Jim Brock, the founder of PrivacyChoice, in a statement. ""This transparency not only allows people to make smarter decisions about their own data, it also will spur more protective privacy practices by sites and tracking companies, which is long overdue.""The tool measures factors such as whether a Web site shares personal user data with other sites, how long a site retains that data and whether the site confirms that data has been deleted. Users who visit privacyscore.com can search for Web sites they wish to have scored.Users also can download a plug-in for their browsers that, when activated, will show a privacy score at the top of each Web site they visit. "
New Concerns Over Apps for Children,"The developer behind Mobbles, a popular free game app for children, temporarily pulled the product from the Apple App store and Google Play store on Tuesday after learning that it was the subject of a complaint to federal authorities by children's advocates.The app, introduced this year, is an animated, location-based game in which children collect, take care of and trade colorful virtual pets called Mobbles. On Tuesday, the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, claiming that Mobbles' data collection practices violated the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.That law requires an operator of a Web site or online service directed at children under 13 to provide notice of its information collection practices. The operator must also obtain verifiable permission from a parent before collecting or sharing personal information like a child's name, e-mail address or physical address.According to the complaint, the Mobbles app collected personal information from children ""without providing any notice to parents and without even attempting to obtain prior, verifiable parental consent.""In a phone interview on Tuesday, Alexandre Curtelin, co-founder of Mobbles, said that the app did collect users' e-mail addresses and did use their locations for certain game features, but that the app was not directed at those under 13.""We don't ask for the age of the user,"" he said. ""So we cannot target users under 13.""Here's how the app works: The ""Catch a Mobble"" feature determines a user's location and then shows the user a map of the area. If a Mobble is within a 54-yard radius, a user can catch it by tapping on the creature on the screen. The game also offers rewards - like virtual currency it calls ""crystals"" to pay for in-game purchases -- if players provide their e-mail addresses so they can receive a newsletter or if they e-mail their friends about their activities on the game, the complaint said.The complaint said the game did not notify parents that it collected children's locations and e-mail addresses,  nor did it obtain parental permission for collecting such information. According to the complaint, the Mobbles app did not link to a privacy policy explaining the app's data collection practices, and the Mobbles.com Web site did not post a privacy policy.In the complaint, the children's advocates also suggested that the game's design raised safety concerns.""Because children can only catch Mobbles within the green radius, the game encourages the child to wander around the neighborhood to find Mobbles within range,"" the complaint said. Because some Mobbles appear only in the evening, the complaint said, ""the game encourages children to wander around at night to get close enough to catch an out-of-range Mobble.""Mr. Curtelin said that the game did employ users' locations so that it could show them whether a virtual creature was in range but that the company did not store that data.""At no point do we persistently store the data because we don't actually need it,"" Mr. Curtelin said. ""We didn't want to be in the position of being able to track users.""A privacy policy on the site now explains that the game collects user names, e-mail addresses, Facebook IDs and locations from registered users. The policy also says the company does not share that data with or sell it to third parties.By Tuesday afternoon, the Mobbles appwas again available on Google Play --.with a disclaimer stating that the game was not intended for children under 13.The description of the app on Google Play, however, suggests that Mobbles could appeal to younger children.""Mobbles are small and fun creatures living around us!"" it says. ""Catch them in your smartphone and raise them !""Now the site's privacy policy states that Mobbles is not intended for children under 13. Sites intended for older children are not required to comply with the children's online privacy law.""Mobbles does not target children (younger than thirteen years of age) for collection of information online, and no one identified to be under the age of thirteen is permitted to create a profile or use the Services,"" the site says. ""By using the Games, you represent and warrant that you are"" at least thirteen years old.On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission released a study on children's apps in which regulators reported that hundreds of popular apps failed to provide parents with basic information about their data collection practices. The agency declined to name the apps included in its study. "
"An App That Encrypts, Shreds, Hashes and Salts","When it comes to mobile apps and social networks, the devil, increasingly, is in the default settings.Companies have little, if any, incentive to let users opt out of services that siphon their personal data back to the advertisers who pay their bills. Nor do companies have any legal mandate to secure users' personal information with hacker-proof encryption. The responsibility is very much on the user to opt out of services and read through the fine print in privacy policies to understand how their personal data is used, secured and sold.A group of computer security experts want to turn that model on its head with Wickr, a new mobile app that they hope will set a new standard for how personal data is disseminated. Wickr's motto: The Internet is forever. Your private conversations don't need to be. The app, which became available in Apple's iTunes store on Tuesday, lets users transmit texts, photos and videos through secure and anonymous means previously reserved for the likes of the military and intelligence operatives.Text messages, photos and videos sent via Wickr are secured using military-grade encryption and never stored. The service camouflages user names and other identifiable information, such as a phone's identification number, by appending several random digits to each value, then mashing them up with a mathematical algorithm, a process security experts refer to as ""salting"" and ""hashing."" Wickr hashes and salts that information several times and only stores the encoded result.The app gives users the option to set a self-destruct timer for anything they send so that they can control how long a recipient views their videos, photos or texts before it disappears completely.Typically, when someone deletes anything from a phone, metadata from the file remains on the phone's hard drive, where skilled hackers, forensics investigators or law enforcement officials can piece it back together. Wickr's app contains an anti-forensics feature - the mobile equivalent of a paper shredder - that erases deleted files for good by writing over that metadata with gibberish text. The app is the brainchild of a team of security experts who envision it having as much appeal for the tinfoil-hat-wearing crowd as it will for congressmen, hackers, journalists and their sources.Wickr was co-founded by Kara Lynn Coppa, a former defense contractor; Christopher Howell, a former forensics investigator for the State of New Jersey; Robert Statica, a director at the Center for Information Protection at the New Jersey Institute of Technology; and Nico Sell, a security expert and longtime organizer for Defcon, an annual hacker convention.The co-founders snubbed advertising in favor of a ""freemium"" business model. The app offers core services for free, but charges a fee for premium services such as sending files to groups of more than 10 people or dispatching larger files.""Right now, everyone is being tracked and traced in ways they don't understand by numerous governments and corporations,"" Ms. Sell said in an interview. ""Our private communications, by default, should be untraceable. Right now, society functions the other way around.""""There is no reason your pictures, videos and communications should be available on some server, where it can easily be accessed by who-knows-who, or what service, without any control over what people do with it,"" added Mr. Statica.Ms. Sell said one of the reasons she created the app was for her two daughters.""If my daughter wants to post a picture of our dog, Max, on Instagram, she shouldn't have to know to turn the geo-location off,"" Ms. Sell said. ""People have always asked me 'How do I communicate securely and anonymously?' There was never an easy answer, until now.""Wickr is not without loopholes. Even if users time their communication to self-destruct, for instance, a recipient can still grab a screenshot of their phone screen and store the information that way. Ms. Sell said Wickr's team was working on ways to notify a sender if a recipient had captured a screenshot of their dispatch.But, she added, her best advice is: ""Don't send secrets to anyone you don't trust."" "
How to Muddy Your Tracks on the Internet,"Legal and technology researchers estimate that it would take about a month for Internet users to read the privacy policies of all the Web sites they visit in a year. So in the interest of time, here is the deal: You know that dream where you suddenly realize you're stark naked? You're living it whenever you open your browser.There are no secrets online. That emotional e-mail you sent to your ex, the illness you searched for in a fit of hypochondria, those hours spent watching kitten videos (you can take that as a euphemism if the kitten fits) -- can all be gathered to create a defining profile of you.Your information can then be stored, analyzed, indexed and sold as a commodity to data brokers who in turn might sell it to advertisers, employers, health insurers or credit rating agencies. And while it's probably impossible to cloak your online activities fully, you can take steps to do the technological equivalent of throwing on a pair of boxers and a T-shirt. Some of these measures are quite easy and many are free. Of course, the more effort and money you expend, the more concealed you are. The trick is to find the right balance between cost, convenience and privacy.Before you can thwart the snoopers, you have to know who they are. There are hackers hanging around Wi-Fi hot spots, to be sure. But security experts and privacy advocates said more worrisome were Internet service providers, search engine operators, e-mail suppliers and Web site administrators -- particularly if a single entity acts in more than one capacity, like Google, Yahoo, Facebook and AOL. This means they can easily collect and cross-reference your data, that is, match your e-mails with your browsing history, as well as figure out your location and identify all the devices you use to connect to the Internet.''The worst part is they sell this extremely creepy intrusion as a great boon to your life because they can tailor services to your needs,'' said Paul Ohm, an associate professor at the University of Colorado Law School in Boulder who specializes in information privacy and computer crime. ''But do most people want to give that much away? No.''He advised logging off sites like Google and Facebook as soon as practicably possible and not using the same provider for multiple functions if you can help it. ''If you search on Google, maybe you don't want to use Gmail for your e-mail,'' he said.If you do not want the content of your e-mail messages examined or analyzed at all, you may want to consider lesser-known free services like HushMail, RiseUp and Zoho, which promote no-snooping policies. Or register your own domain with an associated e-mail address through services like Hover or BlueHost, which cost $55 to $85 a year. You get not only the company's assurance of privacy but also an address unlike anyone else's, like me@myowndomain.comOr you can forgo trusting others with your e-mail correspondence altogether and set up your own mail server. It is an option that is not just for the paranoid, according to Sam Harrelson, a middle-school teacher and self-described technology aficionado in Ashville, N.C., who switched to using his own mail server this year using a $49.99 OS X Server and $30 SpamSieve software to eliminate junk mail.''The topic of privacy policies and what lies ahead for our digital footprints is especially fascinating and pertinent for me, since I work with 13- and 14-year-olds who are just beginning to dabble with services such as Gmail and all of Google's apps, as well as Facebook, Instagram, social gaming,'' he said. ''I have nothing to hide, but I'm uncomfortable with what we give away.''But even with your own mail server, Google will still have the e-mails you exchange with friends or colleagues with Gmail accounts, said Peter Eckersley of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group in San Francisco. ''You're less exposed,'' he said. ''But you can't totally escape.''Another shrouding tactic is to use the search engine DuckDuckGo, which distinguishes itself with a ''We do not track or bubble you!'' policy. Bubbling is the filtering of search results based on your search history. (Bubbling also means you are less likely to see opposing points of view or be exposed to something fresh and new.)Regardless of which search engine you use, security experts recommend that you turn on your browser's ''private mode,'' usually found under Preferences, Tools or Settings. When this mode is activated, tracking cookies are deleted once you close your browser, which ''essentially wipes clean your history,'' said Jeremiah Grossman, chief technology officer with WhiteHat Security, an online security consulting firm in Santa Clara, Calif.He warned, however, that private mode does nothing to conceal your I.P. address, a unique number that identifies your entry or access point to the Internet. So Web sites may not know your browsing history, but they will probably know who you are and where you are as well as when and how long you viewed their pages.Shielding your I.P. address is possible by connecting to what is called a virtual private network, or V.P.N., such as those offered by WiTopia, PrivateVPN and StrongVPN. These services, whose prices price from $40 to $90 a year, route your data stream to what is called a proxy server, where it is stripped of your I.P. address before it is sent on to its destination. This obscures your identity not only from Web sites but also from your Internet service provider.Moreover, these services encrypt data traveling to and from their servers so it looks like gibberish to anyone who might be monitoring wireless networks in places like coffee shops, airports and hotels.While V.P.N. providers generally have strict privacy policies, Moxie Marlinspike, an independent security researcher and software developer in San Francisco, said, ''It's better to trust the design of the system rather than an organization.'' In that case, there is Tor, a free service with 36 million users that was originally developed to conceal military communications. Tor encrypts your data stream and bounces it through a series of proxy servers so no single entity knows the source of the data or whence it came. The only drawback is that with all that bouncing around, it is very S-L-O-W.Free browser add-ons that increase privacy and yet will not interrupt your work flow include Ghostery and Do Not Track Plus, which prevent Web sites from relaying information about you and your visit to tracking companies. These add-ons also name the companies that were blocked from receiving your data (one social network, five advertising companies and six data brokers on a recent visit to CNN.com), which is instructive in itself.''Companies like Google are creating these enormous databases using your personal information,'' said Paul Hill, senior consultant with SystemExperts, a network security company in Sudbury, Mass. ''They may have the best of intentions now, but who knows what they will look like 20 years from now, and by then it will be too late to take it all back.'' "
The Internet Remains a Tangle of Issues,"The Internet will be at the center of some of the knottiest policy fights President Obama is likely to face in his second term.He will have to wrestle with a divided Congress over regulations that limit the use of personal information online, laws to protect the nation's infrastructure from online attacks, and policies to deal with online piracy. The technology industry is also likely to press hard for things it sought, and didn't get, during Mr. Obama's first four years -- changes to the tax code and more visas for foreigners with the math and science skills that the industry is hungry for. Mr. Obama mentioned both in his victory speech Tuesday night.The administration is likely to continue pressing to free up wireless airwaves, or spectrum, to satisfy the demands of smartphones and tablets to send and receive data, audio, video and other large files. During the next four years, the White House may have to make appointments to the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates how private Web companies collect and use personal information. The commission has already imposed lengthy consent orders on Facebook and Google, as well as a penalty on Google. It has also encouraged industry groups to come up with a way to allow consumers to opt out of tracking online. If that fails to happen, the agency has said it would consider recommending legislation.The administration's efforts to regulate online privacy may be complicated by the Obama campaign's own track record of aggressively using targeted advertising online.Members of Congress are expected to soon push for at least two privacy related bills, said Gregory T. Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group partially financed by the industry. One would involve updates to the 25-year-old Electronic Communications Privacy Act, to cover how government authorities can monitor cellphone and Internet communications.The industry also wants to loosen a 1988 law that protects the privacy of movie rentals. The rapid churn of technology innovations could also bring new privacy issues to the president's desk on matters like the use of facial recognition technology and how drones can be deployed in American airspace.Mr. Obama is expected to resume pressure to enact cybersecurity legislation to protect the nation's power plants, water systems and other critical infrastructure. He spent significant political capital trying to pass such a law this year, but met with stiff opposition from Congressional Republicans, along with their private industry backers. The principal sticking point is whether the government should be allowed to regulate how private operators of critical infrastructure protect their systems from online attacks.Mr. Obama is likely to face resistance again on that issue, his former Internet security adviser, Howard Schmidt, said in an interview. But Mr. Schmidt said the chances of some movement on Internet security were likely to be greater now. ''People recognize this is a problem,'' he said.The White House may also find itself again in the middle of a dogfight between Hollywood and the Internet industry over online piracy. It sided with the technology sector in quashing an antipiracy bill. But Hollywood was one of Mr. Obama's most important sources of political contributions, and the Motion Picture Association of America, the movie industry lobby, wasted no time Tuesday in paying a tribute to the president's re-election victory.''President Obama has demonstrated a great understanding of the importance of intellectual property to the fundamental strength of the American economy,'' Chris Dodd, the group's chairman, said in a statement.In the effort to free up spectrum, the F.C.C. is looking to television broadcasters and the military. While neither has eagerly embraced the idea of giving up or sharing large swaths of spectrum, wireless companies have been clamoring for additional spectrum to accommodate data-hungry applications and devices. The F.C.C. has started the process of holding spectrum auctions to direct some of the proceeds to broadcasters that turn over their licenses.SOMINI SENGUPTAand EDWARD WYATT "

The Breakfast Meeting: Digital Privacy Makes a Comeback,"The Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Fla., could be summed up like this: different audience, different debate. The invective was as high as in recent debates in South Carolina, with a newly aggressive Mitt Romney saying that Newt Gingrich, as a consultant to the mortgage giant Freddie Mac, had been an ""influence peddler."" But without the raucous audiences of South Carolina, the event seemed more sedate, Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg write.The European Parliament will consider a proposal that would significantly shift the balance on data protection and online privacy toward consumers, Somini Sengupta reports, forcing companies like Amazon.com and Facebook to obtain explicit consent about the use of personal data and allowing a consumer to delete that data. The one silver lining for the companies, should the proposal become law (and take effect in 2014), is that would create a uniform code for all 27 countries in the Europe Union, where there is now a cacophony of different laws and regulations, she writes.The independent film executive Bingham Ray died on Monday in Provo, Utah, after a series of strokes while attending the Sundance Film Festival.

California Attorney General Reaches Deal on App Privacy," 4:14 p.m. | Updated  California's attorney general, Kamala D. Harris, said on Wednesday that the state had reached an agreement with Amazon.com, Apple, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Research in Motion to strengthen privacy protections for smartphone owners who download mobile applications.The agreement will force developers to post conspicuous privacy policies detailing what personal information they plan to obtain and how they will  use it. It also compels app store providers like Apple and Google to offer ways for users to report apps that do not comply. In a statement, the attorney general's office said developers who did not abide by their own privacy policies would face prosecution under California's Unfair Competition Law and False Advertising Law.""Your personal privacy should not be the cost of using mobile apps, but all too often it is,"" Ms. Harris said in a statement.The announcement comes on the heels of the news that applications on smartphones routinely transmit people's address book entries and other personal data, often without their knowledge. The practice came under scrutiny last week from members of Congress and the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates the use of consumer data on the Internet.Google, which makes the Android operating system, requires developers to ask users  upfront for permission to obtain their personal data, but users often are not told why developers need the data, how they plan to use it or how it will be stored. Likewise, Apple has said it prohibits and rejects any app that collects or transmits personal data without permission. But in practice, developers of some of the most popular applications for the iPhone, iPad and iPod have taken users' contacts and transmitted them without consent.In a statement, Ms. Harris's office said that only 5 percent of mobile apps offer a privacy policy, leaving smartphone owners in the dark about what developers, advertisers and analytic services do with their ""location, contacts, identity, messages and photos.""Randall Sarafa, a Google spokesman, said in a statement that Google was pleased with the agreement. ""From the beginning, Android has had an industry-leading permissions system which informs consumers what data an app can access and requires user approval before installation,"" the statement said. ""Coupled with the principles announced by the attorney general, which we expect to complete in the coming weeks, consumers will have even more ways to make informed decisions when it comes to their privacy.""Tom Neumayr, an Apple spokesman, would confirm only that Apple was part of the agreement.Ms. Harris's office said it approached companies involved in the app market to discuss privacy in August. It said it would talk to the companies in six months to reassess mobile privacy.In other privacy news, on Thursday the White House will host what it is calling a ""privacy event"" that is expected to discuss consumer privacy on the Internet. The event is to feature Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council; John Bryson, secretary of commerce; and Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. "
Building an Iconography for Digital Privacy,"Web site privacy policies are usually long, vague and notoriously neglected by most of us. Or as Alex Fowler, chief privacy officer at Mozilla, put it, ""We have long upheld that privacy policies suck."" Now, an experiment is under way to make those privacy policies somewhat more palatable. The idea is to have lawyers and coders muddle through thousands of words of legalese and distill their meaning into a set of graphic icons. In effect, the pros will read those notoriously unreadable policies, so the rest of us don't have to.The experiment began last Friday in Mozilla headquarters in San Francisco, under aptly dark clouds overhead. It was fueled by chicken-and-bacon sandwiches supplied by disconnect.me, a start-up that offers Web users tools to control how and with whom their personal data is shared. Friday's assignment was to vet the policies of 1,000 Web sites.If a Web site's privacy policy suggested that it might sell users' personal information to third parties, the site was assigned an orange circle with a dollar sign in the middle and an orange arrow pointing up, suggesting caution; if it promised not to sell personal information, it got a green circle.Likewise, if it made personal information available to law enforcement ""without proper legal procedure,"" it was assigned an orange sheriff's badge-shaped icon, with an orange arrow pointing up. If it specified how long it retained the data of its users, the number of days was encapsulated in a box; if it did not specify, it was assigned, provocatively, an infinity sign.Web users can install a browser plug-in,  available for now only on the Firefox browser made by Mozilla. Once the plug-in is installed, visited Web sites will be marked with a series of icons summing up their privacy terms.The experiment is part of a nascent movement by privacy advocates to educate Internet users about the spread of their personal data online and to offer tools that allow them to control who sees what. It's aimed for now at Web browsing on desktop computers, but not yet on mobile devices, where it is much harder to scroll through privacy policies.""We are in a model now where no one reads privacy policies,"" Mr. Fowler said. ""Does icon-ifying them make it of interest to the user? We have a ways to go.""Not even the pros were able to plod through so much jargon, or agree on exactly what it meant. They finished making icons for just 235 Web sites. "
Guarding a 'Fundamental Right' of Privacy in Europe,"PARIS -- Is it impolitic to ask the French privacy regulator a personal question about her Internet habits? Perhaps, but Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, head of the country's data protection agency, is perfectly forthcoming in her answer.''Facebook? I follow it but, to be perfectly honest, I don't use it,'' she said. As for Google, ''Of course I use it, but I am prudent about what I do. I don't give away any family secrets.'' Both Facebook and Google, along with a range of other Internet companies, have faced the scrutiny of Ms. Falque-Pierrotin and her colleagues at the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés, also known as the CNIL.The agency has taken the lead role among the 27 European authorities on data protection in an investigation of a new privacy policy that Google introduced this year to streamline the previously separate practices for data use in dozens of Google services. Last month, CNIL ordered the company to make changes to the policy or face disciplinary action.European privacy officials worry that the mining and blending of data across different Google services, like the search engine and the YouTube video site, could result in privacy violations.In an interview last week at the CNIL headquarters in Paris, Ms. Falque- Pierrotin said she wanted Google to report back with proposed solutions by February, nearly a year after the new policy was introduced. If the proposals are insufficient, she said, ''we will move on to a sanctions phase.''''This is not about taking the scalp of a big company,'' she said. ''It's about pushing them to come into conformity. If a company that is at the heart of the digital economy cannot come up with a satisfactory solution, that is very serious.''Google has said it has been reviewing a letter from Ms. Falque-Pierrotin to its chief executive, Larry Page. The company has consistently maintained that the new policy respects E.U. law.CNIL has the power to fine companies as much as &#x20ac;300,000, or about $382,000, for violations.Companies like Google are eager to use the personal data gleaned from the Internet in new ways to sell online advertising and to provide other services tailored to individual users.But Ms. Falque-Pierrotin said her tough approach was justified by the importance that the French, and Europeans more generally, attach to privacy.''In Europe, we consider privacy a fundamental right,'' she said. ''That doesn't mean it is exclusive of other rights, but economic rights are not superior to privacy.''In the United States, she said, despite signs of a new concern about privacy in the digital age, ''personal data are seen as raw material for business.''The inquiry illustrates a new level of cooperation among the various data protection agencies in Europe, which have sometimes struggled to respond in a consistent way to the challenges of regulating global Internet companies like Google and Facebook.Viviane Reding, vice president of the European Commission, has proposed the creation of a central authority to oversee data protection at the E.U. level. Big Internet companies have generally welcomed this approach, saying they find it difficult to deal with a welter of local regulations.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin said, however, that this approach would be ''too centralized,'' adding that she preferred to maintain the current decentralized system of regulation, but with greater cooperation among national agencies.''We have to have a system where a citizen can go to their local data protection authority,'' she said. ''Otherwise it is too remote.''Ms. Falque-Pierrotin has also been meeting with her counterparts at the Federal Trade Commission in Washington, which is responsible for data protection in the United States.Even though the American approach to privacy has traditionally been more accommodating, she said that she had been encouraged by recent enforcement action by the F.T.C. against Google and Facebook.''We are starting to learn, starting to get to know each other,'' Ms. Falque-Pierrotin said. Just do not turn to Facebook for her biography. "
Q&A: Staying Safe at Any Speed,"Q.I have a dial-up Internet connection for my PC. I've been told that with dial-up, one doesn't need security software. Is this true? A.While computers connecting to the Internet through a dial-up telephone line are usually less of a target for hackers than computers using faster, persistent broadband connections, it never hurts to be as protected as possible. Some types of firewall-related security breaches may be less of a worry over a dial-up connection, but viruses, spyware and other malicious intrusions can still invade through e-mail attachments, infected Web pages and other entry points. Although there are plenty of commercial security software programs available, you can often shore up your system with basic protections without having to spend much (if any) money. For example, Windows has included a built-in firewall in the Control Panel area since Windows XP. Microsoft has other security tools for Windows XP and later at microsoft.com/security. The Gizmo's Freeware site also has a big list of free antivirus programs from other companies here.  "
"For PC Virus Victims, Pay or Else","CULVER CITY, Calif. -- Kidnappers used to make ransom notes with letters cut out of magazines. Now, notes simply pop up on your computer screen, except the hostage is your PC.In the past year, hundreds of thousands of people across the world have switched on their computers to find distressing messages alerting them that they no longer have access to their PCs or any of the files on them.The messages claim to be from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, some 20 other law enforcement agencies across the globe or, most recently, Anonymous, a shadowy group of hackers. The computer users are told that the only way to get their machines back is to pay a steep fine.And, curiously, it's working. The scheme is making more than $5 million a year, according to computer security experts who are tracking them. The scourge dates to 2009 in Eastern Europe. Three years later, with business booming, the perpetrators have moved west. Security experts say that there are now more than 16 gangs of sophisticated criminals extorting millions from victims across Europe.The threat, known as ransomware, recently hit the United States. Some gangs have abandoned previously lucrative schemes, like fake antivirus scams and banking trojans, to focus on ransomware full time.Essentially online extortion, ransomware involves infecting a user's computer with a virus that locks it. The attackers demand money before the computer will be unlocked, but once the money is paid, they rarely unlock it.In the vast majority of cases, victims do not regain access to their computer unless they hire a computer technician to remove the virus manually. And even then, they risk losing all files and data because the best way to remove the virus is to wipe the computer clean.It may be hard to fathom why anyone would agree to fork over hundreds of dollars to a demanding stranger, but security researchers estimate that 2.9 percent of compromised computer owners take the bait and pay. That, they say, is an extremely conservative estimate. In some countries, the payout rate has been as high as 15 percent.That people do fall for it is a testament to criminals' increasingly targeted and inventive methods. Early variations of ransomware locked computers, displayed images of pornography and, in Russian, demanded a fee -- often more than $400 -- to have it removed. Current variants are more targeted and toy with victims' consciences.Researchers say criminals now use victims' Internet addresses to customize ransom notes in their native tongue. Instead of pornographic images, criminals flash messages from local law enforcement agencies accusing them of visiting illegal pornography, gambling or piracy sites and demand they pay a fine to unlock their computer.Victims in the United States see messages in English purporting to be from the F.B.I. or Justice Department. In the Netherlands, people get a similar message, in Dutch, from the local police. (Some Irish variations even demand money in Gaelic.) The latest variants speak to victims through recorded audio messages that tell users that if they do not pay within 48 hours, they will face criminal charges. Some even show footage from a computer's webcam to give the illusion that law enforcement is watching.The messages often demand that victims buy a preloaded debit card that can be purchased at a local drugstore -- and enter the PIN. That way it's impossible for victims to cancel the transaction once it becomes clear that criminals have no intention of unlocking their PC.The hunt is on to find these gangs. Researchers at Symantec said they had identified 16 ransomware gangs. They tracked one gang that tried to infect more than 500,000 PCs over an 18-day period. But even if researchers can track their Internet addresses, catching and convicting those responsible can be difficult. It requires cooperation among global law enforcement, and such criminals are skilled at destroying evidence.Charlie Hurel, an independent security researcher based in France, was able to hack into one group's computers to discover just how gullible their victims could be. On one day last month, the criminals' accounting showed that they were able to infect 18,941 computers, 93 percent of all attempts. Of those who received a ransom message that day, 15 percent paid. In most cases, Mr. Hurel said, hackers demanded 100 euros, making their haul for one day's work more than $400,000.That is significantly more than hackers were making from fake antivirus schemes a few years ago, when so-called ''scareware'' was at its peak and criminals could make as much as $158,000 in one week.Scareware dropped significantly last year after a global clampdown by law enforcement and private security researchers. Internecine war between scareware gangs put the final nail in the coffin. As Russian criminal networks started fighting for a smaller share of profits, they tried to take each other out with denial of service attacks.Now, security researchers are finding that some of the same criminals who closed down scareware operations as recently as a year ago are back deploying ransomware.''Things went quiet,'' said Eric Chien, a researcher at Symantec who has been tracking ransomware scams. ''Now we are seeing a sudden ramp-up of ransomware using similar methods.''Victims become infected in many ways. In most cases, people visit compromised Web sites that download the program to their machines without so much as a click. Criminals have a penchant for infecting pornography sites because it makes their law enforcement threats more credible and because embarrassing people who were looking at pornography makes them more likely to pay. Symantec's researchers say there is also evidence that they are paying advertisers on sex-based sites to feature malicious links that download ransomware onto victims' machines.''As opposed to fooling you, criminals are now bullying users into paying them by pretending the cops are banging down their doors,'' said Kevin Haley, Symantec's director of security response.More recently, researchers at Sophos, a British computer security company, noted that thousands of people were getting ransomware through sites hosted by GoDaddy, the popular Web services company that manages some 50 million domain names and hosts about five million Web sites on its servers.Sophos said hackers were breaking into GoDaddy users' accounts with stolen passwords and setting up what is known as a subdomain. So instead of, say, www.nameofsite.com, hackers would set up the Web address blog.nameofsite.com, then send e-mails to customers with the link to the subdomain which -- because it appeared to come from a trusted source -- was more likely to lure clicks.Scott Gerlach, GoDaddy's director of information security operations, said it appeared the accounts had been compromised because account owners independently clicked on a malicious link or were compromised by a computer virus that stole password credentials. He advised users to enable GoDaddy's two-step authentication option, which sends a second password to users' cellphones every time they try to log in, preventing criminals from cracking their account with one stolen password and alerting users when they try.One of the scarier things about ransomware is that criminals can use victims' machines however they like. While the computer is locked, the criminals can steal passwords and even get into the victims' online bank accounts.Security experts warn to never pay the ransom. A number of vendors offer solutions for unlocking machines without paying the ransom, including Symantec, Sophos and F-Secure. The best solution is to visit a local repair shop to wipe the machine clean and reinstall backup files and software.''This is the new Nigerian e-mail scam,'' Mr. Haley said. ''We'll be talking about this for the next two years.'' "
Owners May Not Be Covered When Hackers Wipe Out A Business Bank Account,"In May 2010, Golden State Bridge, an engineering and construction company based in Martinez, Calif., was robbed of more than $125,000 when cybercriminals hacked into its bank account.The hackers made two automated clearinghouse batch transactions with the office manager's user name and password, routing stolen money to eight other banks across the country.Ann Talbot, Golden State's chief financial officer, learned later that the office manager had violated policy by visiting a social networking site, which the company said it believed was how her computer was infected with malicious software, or ''malware,'' that antivirus software did not detect.Computer security specialists say these crimes, called ''corporate account takeovers,'' have become increasingly common, and small businesses are especially easy prey because many lack firewalls and monitoring systems. Gartner, an information technology research company, says regulators have not compiled statistics on the extent of the fraud, but the company estimates that more than 10 percent of small businesses have had funds stolen from their bank accounts -- losses totaling more than $2 billion. ''People think, 'It'll never happen to me,' but these are incredibly sophisticated criminals, and we're not I.T. experts,'' Ms. Talbot said. ''When you work for a big company, you have a full I.T. staff and you're locked down like Fort Knox. When you work for a small to midsize company, you're not locked down at all.''Even worse, owners often assume incorrectly that the protection they have on personal bank accounts applies to their business accounts. Many are shocked to learn that most banks do not take responsibility for unauthorized debits from business accounts. Unless the owners have fraud insurance, they must shoulder the losses alone. One reason is that owners who have been victimized are often reluctant to speak about it, out of embarrassment or fear of publicity.Although many financial institutions have taken measures to thwart hackers, they emphasize that other businesses must also defend themselves. Here are tips from security specialists and from owners who have learned these lessons the hard way.BEST PRACTICES Authorities recommend keeping firewalls up-to-date and limiting the number of employees with access to accounts. Sari Stern Greene, president of Sage Data Security in South Portland, Me., advises being diligent about applying security patches to operating systems like Windows.Owners should also educate their employees and enforce strict rules for office computers. Social media should be forbidden, and workers should avoid unusual links and e-mails.In some cases, companies receive e-mail that resembles official communication from agencies like the I.R.S. When a business owner or chief financial officer clicks on an e-mail saying, for example, that the company is being audited, a virus infects the computer.Some viruses capture keystrokes, enabling criminals to view user names and passwords as they are typed, while others allow criminals to manipulate computers from afar. Some obtain identifying information from shadow Web addresses that mimic a bank's Web site, persuading users to log on.BANKING PRECAUTIONS Business owners who have been hacked often feel most betrayed by the banks they thought were protecting their money. But banks have no legal obligation to reimburse businesses for attacks -- federal regulations do not cover commercial accounts. Regulatory bodies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council offer guidance on fraud controls for financial institutions, and owners should make sure their banks are up to speed.Owners may want to place accounts with larger banks -- such as Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo -- that have more mature pattern-recognition and monitoring capabilities. Banks should have automated systems to detect anomalous activity in accounts, but because these systems are expensive, many banks still rely on laborious manual processes. And if banks use third-party processors to handle transactions, as almost all but the largest do, business owners should confirm that the processors' practices are equally secure.''If you go two states over and use your credit card to buy gas, the credit card company calls you to say it's out of the norm, but most banks have no idea,'' said Mark Patterson, whose construction company, Patco, in Sanford, Me., was robbed of $588,000 in 2009 by ZeuS Trojan, a form of malware. ''Our bank had no alarms to say, hey, over five consecutive nights, Patco's wiring money all over the country -- to California, Florida, places we don't normally send money, and definitely not from an I.P. address outside the U.S.''Owners should require multiple people to approve every transaction and should insist on ''multifactor authentification,'' or more than one way for a bank to confirm an owner's identity before making a transfer. This necessitates approval through multiple channels, such as e-mail, text and verbal assurance by phone. Some banks require businesses to use a token, or secure ID card that generates new passwords that are valid for a very short time.Businesses should also place limits on the amounts of all automated clearinghouse transactions. If a normal payroll transaction is capped at $65,000, a hacker will not be able to increase the amount when trying to take cash.Still, Brian Krebs, a computer security authority who writes the blog Krebs On Security, insists these are not foolproof against sophisticated hackers. Mr. Krebs said the most effective way to guard against corporate account takeover was to dedicate one computer solely for online banking. Employees should never send e-mail or browse the Web from this machine.MONITOR YOUR BALANCES In corporate account takeover, timing is everything. Cybercriminals, many of whom are based in Eastern Europe, move quickly, so business owners need to check accounts daily.Karen McCarthy, the owner of Little & King, a marketing agency based in Great Neck, N.Y., discovered money missing from her account the day after it had been taken and immediately called her bank. But because it was a holiday, she said, the bank took more than a day to freeze her account. By then, $164,000 had been stolen.Golden State Bridge was able to recover about $29,000, and Patco halted or clawed back about $200,000 from transfers processed within 24 hours of discovering the fraud. But money stolen the previous four days was gone for good. Mr. Patterson took his bank to court and lost. ''This hurt a lot. If we hadn't always been very conservative financially, it could have put us out of business,'' he said. ''Our legal fees are not recoverable either.''BUY FRAUD INSURANCE Most unsuspecting owners do not own fraud insurance, and if they do, it includes only crimes like employee embezzlement.Because Golden State Bridge had been hacked previously, in 2006 at a different bank, Ms. Talbot knew to buy insurance with a rider covering cybercrime and fraudulent bank transfers. ''It's very rare that policies have them,'' she said. ''I've talked to brokers who tell me only one in 10 business customers ask for it, and it's cents on the dollar.''For owners without fraud insurance, like Ms. McCarthy, the crime can be devastating. It derailed Little & King's sale to a global marketing agency, which was scheduled to occur the day after hackers invaded in 2010. Ms. McCarthy took out a loan, slashed staff salaries and found cheaper office space, but that was not enough. ''I didn't have the funds to operate anymore, so I had to merge with another agency,'' she said. ''I lost my agency.'' "
Should Personal Data Be Personal?,"A technology reporter for The New York Times.MAX SCHREMS, a 24-year-old law student from Salzburg, Austria, wanted to know what Facebook knew: He requested his own Facebook file. What he got turned out to be a virtual bildungsroman, 1,222 pages long. It contained wall posts he had deleted, old messages that revealed a friend's troubled state of mind, even information that he didn't enter himself about his physical whereabouts.Mr. Schrems was intrigued and somewhat rattled. He wasn't worried about anything in particular. Rather, he felt a vague disquiet about what Facebook could do with all that information about him in the future. Why was it there at all, he wondered, when he had deleted it? ''It's like a camera hanging over your bed while you're having sex. It just doesn't feel good,'' is how he finally put it. ''We in Europe are oftentimes frightened of what might happen some day.'' Mr. Schrems's sentiment is emblematic of the discomfort sweeping through Europe about the ways in which Internet companies treat personal information. That discomfort has, in turn, prompted proposals for stricter regulation of online data across the continent. And Europe's moves to protect Internet privacy -- something Americans have not, as yet, actively agitated for -- have given rise to a thorny question: How do the laws and mores of different nations manage, if at all, the multinational companies that now govern our digital lives?Personal data is the oil that greases the Internet. Each one of us sits on our own vast reserves. The data that we share every day -- names, addresses, pictures, even our precise locations as measured by the geo-location sensor embedded in Internet-enabled smartphones -- helps companies target advertising based not only on demographics but also on the personal opinions and desires we post online. Those advertising revenues, in turn, make hundreds of millions of dollars for companies like Facebook, which announced last week that it was going public in what is expected to be the largest I.P.O. in digital history. And those revenues help to keep the Web free of charge.But there is a price: that data about our lives and wants are collected, scrutinized and retained, often for a long time, by a great many technology companies. Personal data is valuable. In the United States alone, companies spend up to $2 billion a year to collect that information, according to a recent report from Forrester Research.The European media seized on Mr. Schrems's discovery. German newspapers published instructions on how to request personal data files from Facebook. Within a few months, 40,000 people had made similar requests. The data protection office in Ireland, where Facebook has its European data center, conducted an audit of Facebook's data retention practices; the company agreed to overhaul the way it collects data in Europe, including disposing of user data ''much sooner.'' German regulators have scrutinized facial recognition technology. The Netherlands is considering a bill that would require Internet users to consent to being tracked as they travel from Web site to Web site. And last month, the European Commission unveiled a sweeping new privacy law that would require Web companies to obtain explicit consent before using personal information, inform regulators and users in the event of a data breach and, most radical, empower a citizen of Europe to demand that his or her data be deleted forever.''Europe has come to the conclusion that none of the companies can be trusted,'' said Simon Davies, the director of the London-based nonprofit Privacy International. ''The European Commission is responding to public demand. There is a growing mood of despondency about the privacy issue.''Every European country has a privacy law, as do Canada, Australia and many Latin American countries. The United States remains a holdout: We have separate laws that protect our health records and financial information, and even one that keeps private what movies we rent. But there is no law that spells out the control and use of online data.It would be tempting to say that history and culture on this side of the Atlantic make privacy a non-issue. That's not exactly the case. Privacy has always mattered in American law and to American sensibilities, but in a different way.Anxieties over privacy came up when postcards were first sent in the late 19th century. The advent of photography prompted Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis, in an 1890 article in The Harvard Law Review, to warn of the dangers of displaying private family wedding pictures in the pages of every newspaper. And in one of the most important privacy decisions in recent years, the Supreme Court in January ruled that police officers violated the Constitution when they placed a Global Positioning System tracking device on a suspect's car, to monitor its movements. ''Europeans are much more sensitive about controlling their image online,'' said James Q. Whitman, a Yale Law School professor who has written about the differences in jurisprudence between the United States and Europe.Social mores around privacy vary widely across the globe. In Japan, Google was criticized for being intrusive when its self-driven cars cruised the streets with a camera snapping pictures for Google Street View.In India, where I was a correspondent for this newspaper for more than four years, the notion of privacy seems foreign. A shopkeeper might casually ask a childless woman if she has gynecological trouble; school grades are posted on public walls; many people still live in extended families, literally wandering in and out of one another's bedrooms. But a project to issue biometric identity cards to every Indian citizen recently set off a flurry of concern over privacy, prompting the government to draft a new law that enshrines the right to privacy for the first time.IN the United States, federal legislation on online privacy has languished, as lawmakers weigh the interests of consumers and companies in the battle for personal information.Part of the difficulty in regulating online privacy is the speed of technological innovation. Just as it becomes remarkably easy for us to share our information with others, it also becomes cheaper and easier to crunch and analyze that information -- and store it forever, if necessary.Stewart A. Baker, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, is among those who see enormous benefits for private companies and government agencies alike. To fight it on privacy grounds, he argued, would be largely futile. ''You can't really have a property interest in data,'' he argued. ''It's going to get cheaper to reproduce it. It's going to get reproduced and stored. It's going to get copied.''Privacy advocates worry about the consequences. Most people may not have much to hide. For a few, not sharing personal information may be vital. They're the ones who need the protection of the law, argued Rebecca MacKinnon, a fellow at the New America Foundation and author of ''Consent of the Networked,'' a book about digital freedom.''It may be victims of domestic abuse who don't want to be stalked or tracked, or it could be dissidents in Syria, or someone who has weird opinions and could mistakenly end up on a watch list when they don't deserve it,'' said Ms. MacKinnon. ''If you have a democratic society, the point is not to say whatever is good for the majority is all we need.'' "
Conflict Over How Open 'Do Not Track' Talks Will Be,"WASHINGTON -- Technology companies want to talk with the government about protecting privacy on the Internet. They just want those talks to be private.Representatives of advertising companies, Internet sites and technology companies told a House subcommittee on Thursday that they thought Internet privacy policies, including Do Not Track options, should be created through an ''open and transparent'' process, as two government agencies have recommended.But openness is relative. ''If this process takes the form of a public discussion, industry participants will be looking over their shoulders or sitting on their hands instead of offering bold ideas for workable solutions,'' said Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, a trade association of software, hardware and technology consulting companies. The Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which are encouraging companies to be more open with consumers about their privacy policies, say that any such talks should be accessible to, if not include, Internet users.''We don't think there is any substitute for openness and transparency,'' Lawrence E. Strickling, assistant secretary for communication and information at the Commerce Department, told the subcommittee, a part of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Lawyers for companies are free to talk among themselves about the best practices in protecting consumer privacy, he said, but to give consumers faith in the process, ''the sessions we conduct will be open and transparent.''The hearing on consumer privacy, the fifth by the House panel, comes after the recent release by the White House and the F.T.C. of recommendations for how to protect personal data that individuals leave behind when they surf the Internet.As Internet privacy has become a bigger issue in Washington, technology companies have been increasing their lobbying. Google and Facebook recently bolstered their lobbying teams. Google hired Susan Molinari, a former New York congresswoman. Facebook hired Greg Maurer, a former aide to House Speaker John Boehner.Both companies, along with others, are likely to be engaged in the coming months with the trade commission, which called this week for legislation to regulate data brokers, companies that buy and sell personal data to help build online profiles of consumers. Technology companies fear that the F.T.C. might be drafting a definition of data brokers that is so broad it includes almost any company that collects user information online.Jon Leibowitz, the F.T.C.'s chairman, also got the industry's attention when he said this week that if companies could not create robust Do Not Track policies themselves, he would favor legislation requiring it.Some members of Congress are not so sure.''Before we do any possible harm to the Internet, we need to understand what harm is actually being done to consumers,'' Representative Mary Bono Mack, a California Republican and subcommittee chairwoman, said at the hearing. ''Where is the public outcry for legislation? Today, I'm simply not hearing it. I haven't gotten a single letter from anyone back home urging me to pass a privacy bill.''The idea of a law requiring companies to permit consumers to forbid tracking them online has upset several technology companies as well. When the White House presented its privacy framework in February, an online advertising alliance said it would support adding a Do Not Track option to all browsers by the end of 2012.When the trade commission released its report on Monday, however, members of the group, the Digital Advertising Alliance, said they were surprised by Mr. Leibowitz's comments about Do Not Track legislation. He said the commission took Do Not Track to mean not collecting any data from consumers.The advertising group, however, defines it as forbidding the serving of targeted ads to individuals but not prohibiting the collection of data.''That is not what was agreed to,'' Linda A. Woolley, executive vice president of the Direct Marketing Association, a member of the digital alliance, said Thursday in an interview. She said that was like moving the goal posts.Some technology companies are continuing to head down the path of Do Not Track, at a speed far more rapid than the usual pace of Congressional legislation. On Thursday, Yahoo said that it would put a Do Not Track option on its sites that would tell its network sites that a user did not want to be tracked.Users who turn on the Do Not Track option in their browsers and visit a Yahoo Web site will not see targeted ads, the company said, but the site will collect user data. The announcement follows similar moves by companies that make browsers, including Mozilla, the maker of Firefox, to include a Do Not Track mechanism in their privacy settings. "
Google Is Faulted for Impeding U.S. Inquiry on Data Collection,"SAN FRANCISCO -- When Google first revealed in 2010 that cars it was using to map streets were also sweeping up sensitive personal information from wireless home networks, it called the data collection a mistake. On Saturday, federal regulators charged that Google had ''deliberately impeded and delayed'' an investigation into the data collection and ordered a $25,000 fine on the search giant.The finding, by the Federal Communications Commission, and the exasperated tone of the report were in marked contrast to the resolution of a separate inquiry two years ago. That investigation, by the Federal Trade Commission, accepted Google's explanation that it was ''mortified by what happened'' while collecting information for its Street View project, and its promise to impose internal controls. But since then, the F.C.C. said, Google repeatedly failed to respond to requests for e-mails and other information and refused to identify the employees involved.''Although a world leader in digital search capability, Google took the position that searching its employees' e-mail 'would be a time-consuming and burdensome task,' '' the report said. The commission also noted that Google stymied its efforts to learn more about the data collection because its main architect, an engineer who was not identified, had invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.When the commission asked Google to identify those responsible for the program, Google ''unilaterally determined that to do so would 'serve no useful purpose,' '' according to the F.C.C. report.The data collection, which took place over three years, was legal because the information was not encrypted, the F.C.C. ultimately determined.A Google spokeswoman said Saturday that ''we worked in good faith to answer the F.C.C.'s questions throughout the inquiry, and we're pleased that they have concluded that we complied with the law.''Google still has the data, which it said it has never looked at and has never used in its products or services. It said it intended to delete the information once regulators gave it permission. A spokeswoman did not immediately return an e-mail inquiry about whether the engineer on the project still worked for the company.While Google's original intentions and actions with the project are still unclear, the commission's report and fine are likely to energize an ongoing debate about Internet privacy.The more companies like Google and Facebook know about their users, the more attractive they are to advertisers, which drive the vast majority of their income. Google's introduction last month of a new privacy policy -- one that allows more comprehensive tracking of its users' actions -- provoked a firestorm of criticism.That was only the latest privacy imbroglio the company found itself in the middle of. Some politicians are becoming skeptical. Senator Al Franken, a Democrat of Minnesota who is in charge of a subcommittee on privacy, said in a recent speech that companies like Google and Facebook accumulated data on users because ''it's their whole business model.''''And you are not their client; you are their product,'' he added.Earlier controversies generally focused on information that users willingly provided. With its Street View project, Google was taking data from people who did not even know that the company was literally outside the door, peering in.European and Canadian regulators who have examined the data Google collected in the project in their own countries found that it included complete e-mail messages, instant messages, chat sessions, conversations between lovers, and Web addresses revealing sexual orientation, information that could be linked to specific street addresses.When Google was repeatedly asked if it had searched for all responsive documents and provided complete and accurate answers to all the F.C.C.'s questions, it declined to respond, Michele Ellison, chief of the F.C.C.'s Enforcement Bureau, said in an interview.Google ultimately provided the information requested under threat of subpoena.The F.C.C. orders fines on companies for impeding investigations about once a year. The commission found that Google had violated provisions of the Communications Act of 1934. Of the $25,000 penalty, Ms. Ellison said, ''It's an appropriate fine based on evidence that the investigation was deliberately impeded and our precedent.'' Google, which for the last year has been run by Larry Page, one of its founders, reported net income of $2.89 billion in the first quarter of 2012.Scrutiny of Google's privacy policies is more intense in Europe, where the Street View issue first emerged, than it is in the United States. Last year, for example, France fined the company 100,000 euros, or about $140,000 at the time, for Street View privacy violations.What Google was gathering as its cars drove up and down many thousands of streets is technically called payload data, which simply means the content of Internet communications, including e-mail. On April 27, 2010, responding to rumors about its Street View project, Google said it ''does not collect or store payload data.''Two weeks later it acknowledged that was ''incorrect,'' saying, ''It's now clear we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data.'' In October 2010, it acknowledged that the data was more than fragments.Google's response to the inquiry puzzled some experts.''If it really was a mistake, you would expect the company to do everything possible to cooperate with the investigation,'' said Danny Sullivan of the blog Search Engine Land. ''On the upside, it's reassuring that the F.C.C. itself believes Google had no plans to use the information.''The F.C.C. did not examine the actual data that Google collected, but its report quotes the investigation by the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertes, the French data privacy regulator, as finding, for example, e-mails between married individuals seeking to have an affair. First names, e-mail addresses and physical addresses could all be discerned.After reviewing all the information it could get from Google, the F.C.C. said it could not find a clear precedent to take enforcement action on the data collection. But then, it said, it still had ''significant factual questions'' about what really happened with the data and why it was collected in the first place. "
No Resolution Is Reached In a 'Do Not Track' Effort,"BERLIN -- An effort to develop an easy way for consumers around the world to avoid being tracked and targeted by Internet advertisers appeared to hit an impasse Thursday, as privacy advocates and industry representatives accused each other of scuttling the process.The closed-door meeting organized by W3C, the global standards group that promotes good governance of the Internet, failed to produce a consensus on how to allow consumers to simply and effectively declare their ''do not track'' preferences on Web sites. The talks foundered on main issues like the extent and types of data that advertisers could continue to collect even after consumers indicated they no longer wanted to be followed.The conference, which concludes Friday, is not expected to produce a final resolution, and other meetings could be scheduled before the end of January, when the group is set to disband. But the stakes for Internet users are high and boil down to who determines the limits and protections of online privacy on the Internet: the businesses running the Web, which is largely the current status quo, or the consumers who use it.For the moment, privacy advocates say the status quo is winning out.''It seems the process has been hijacked by commercial interests,'' said Jacob Kohnstamm, the chairman of the European Commission's top privacy panel, the Article 29 Working Group. Mr. Kohnstamm's panel is an observer at the meetings, whose participants included about 40 Internet companies, advertising groups and privacy advocates.Mr. Kohnstamm, who is also president of the Dutch Data Protection Authority, said proposals before the W3C would let advertisers continue collecting personal data through each mouse click, without obtaining prior consent.''The Do Not Track standard would be utterly deceptive to users and act as a disguise for continuation of unfair and intransparent business practices,'' he said.If adopted in this fashion, European regulators would then be left to police advertisers' actions, initiating proceedings based on their own investigations or on individual complaints, he said.Advertising industry representatives attending the meetings were equally vocal in their displeasure over attempts to ban their ability to follow what people view online, which they argued would undermine the advertising-supported model used by most free services on the Web.''This basically attacks the financing model of the Internet,'' said Dan Jaffe, the executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers, a New York trade group representing 460 companies that spend $250 billion in advertising each year. ''If these various proposals limit this type of advertising, it will cut down on the amount of free information that consumers have on the Internet, create incentives for online companies to erect pay walls, and lead to more shotgun forms of advertising.''Thomas Roessler, who is leading the meeting in Amsterdam for the W3C, said that several ''open issues'' remained to be solved, though he declined to specify which ones because the discussions were under way.But he said the W3C, a group set up by one of the computer engineers who designed the World Wide Web, Timothy Berners-Lee, was optimistic that an effective compromise could be reached.''I still have some measure of confidence we will come up with a workable solution,'' Mr. Roessler said.In a 2011 version of its Firefox Web browser, Mozilla gave consumers a simple and effective way to avoid being tracked by advertisers. Until then, the only way consumers had to opt out of tracking was to visit Web sites sponsored by the ad industry like www.aboutads.info in the United States or www.youronlinechoices.com in Europe to request they no longer be followed. But not all Web sites honor those preferences.''We are still optimistic we will get to a point where this becomes meaningful to consumers,'' said Alex Fowler, the global privacy and policy leader for Mozilla, which is participating in the forum in Amsterdam.But he acknowledged wide differences among the participants, adding: ''It might take more time than people are hoping in the short term.''In the United States, a failure by the W3C to establish an effective standard allowing consumers to opt out of tracking could prompt Congress to propose legislation addressing the issue, said Jon Leibowitz, the Federal Trade Commission's chairman, in an interview.''There is enormous and bipartisan momentum for do-not-track options for consumers if there is no agreement by the end of this year,'' Mr. Leibowitz said.While he said that it was ''legitimate'' for businesses to collect some information on Internet users, advertisers needed to allow consumers to establish some limits in how data were collected and manipulated.''It is time to drop some of the bluster and work toward compromise,'' he said.The effort to reach a consensus in Amsterdam has been complicated by conflicting U.S. and European legal approaches to online privacy. In the United States, the F.T.C. in 2011 exempted so-called first-party advertisers, which include the world's biggest Web businesses, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, arguing that consumers effectively sanctioned their data collection by choosing to use their services.Representatives for Google, Microsoft and Apple, which are participating in the talks, declined to comment.But European law considers Internet tracking, whether done by first-party or third-party advertisers, to be illegal without explicit consent. Third-party advertisers typically put ads on the Web sites of other businesses.The effect of tracking options on advertising is moderate. Only 10 percent of Mozilla's 450 million users worldwide have activated the do-not-track option on their browsers, while about 12 percent of people who have visited the do-not-track Web site in the United States have opted out.A breakthrough appeared to be within reach last February when the F.T.C. announced that the Digital Advertising Alliance, the lead organization representing online advertisers, had agreed to abide and recognize a ''do not track'' option chosen by consumers, as long as consumers were required to actively request not to be followed.But that fragile agreement was undermined in May when Microsoft announced that it would make ''do not track'' the default setting on its Internet Explorer 10 browser, which will begin shipping this month in Windows 8 operating system software.Microsoft's decision raised the stakes in the debate, prompting industry associations like the Association of National Advertisers to join the W3C standards effort this summer.While they may not act to stop it, most people do not want their Web movements tracked, said Jeffrey Chester, the head of the Center for Digital Democracy, a group based in Washington that advocates a stringent mechanism to end the collection of Internet users' data for manipulation in advertising.The bigger problem, he said, is that the current proposals before the W3C have become so watered down that they could have no effect. That in turn would leave Europe with strict prohibitions on tracking and data collection, and the United States with few.''We could end up with a two-track do-not-track system, which would help no one,'' Mr. Chester said.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
New Player in E.U. Data Privacy Battle,"BERLIN -- In the mid-1990s, Alan Shatter, a lawyer from South Dublin in the lower house of Parliament, played a role in bringing together diverse elements of society to lift a constitutional ban and legalize divorce.This January, when Ireland assumes the rotating presidency of the European Union, Mr. Shatter, who is now Ireland's minister of justice, equality and defense, will take on another big challenge: putting together an agreement to extend the Union's 17-year-old data protection law to Web businesses and the digital economy. Mr. Shatter is Ireland's lead negotiator on the issue in the Council of Ministers, the legislative body in Brussels that acts as the European Parliament's upper house. The Union's 27 members are at odds over how to apply E.U. data protection laws in the digital world, and an agreement could require companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Amazon to provide the bloc's 503.7 million consumers with far greater control over their online data than people have in the United States.An important part of the proposal, which is now before two committees in the European Parliament, would require Web companies to ask E.U. citizens for their explicit consent before collecting online data and tracking Internet activity used to tailor marketing and advertising to individuals.The proposal, which was drafted by Viviane Reding, the vice president of the European Commission, has been welcomed by E.U. privacy regulators, who are battling Google over its data collection practices.But it is opposed by many large Web businesses, as well as by the American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union. Opponents view the prior consent clause as an onerous condition that threatens an Internet financial model that relies on advertising to pay for content.That has raised concerns among E.U. lawmakers, who are afraid that overly burdensome regulation would stifle Internet commerce and job growth.Into this predicament steps Mr. Shatter, 61. In an interview, he said that he looked forward to working on advancing the data protection proposal, which has been packaged as a ''regulation,'' a rarely used binding form of E.U. law that would take effect immediately upon adoption in Brussels and apply to all 27 member countries.''There is a need to improve trust and confidence to reassure people that their personal data won't be misused,'' Mr. Shatter said. ''Putting stronger data protection standards in place will make individual citizens across Europe more trustful of the technology and its use.''Mr. Shatter said he would aim for a compromise that recognized the growing importance of the digital economy to the European Union, as well as the need for hard-and-fast legal protections for E.U. citizens, who are increasingly making their purchases and many everyday decisions via the Internet.Without privacy constraints, those movements online can be tracked.''I think it is possible to reconcile the legitimate and economically important activities of the advertising industry with privacy issues,'' he said. ''I don't think we can commoditize individuals and simply regard them as something of business value to be sold on.''Such strict new rules would replace a law from 1995, which was conceived as more of a legal directive that effectively limited the possibilities of wide-scale data mining for direct marketing or other commercial purposes.Because of the existing law's optional nature and a loophole allowing companies to collect data for ''legitimate interests,'' Internet companies have been able largely to evade the directive's principle of obtaining prior consent.Mr. Shatter has been part of a lot of groundbreaking. His law firm, Gallagher Shatter, was the first in Ireland to represent and win a civil judgment for a victim of sexual abuse by a Catholic priest, which it did in the early 1990s. Mr. Shatter, who is also a trained professional mediator -- a skill that could serve him well -- has published several books on Irish family law, as well as the 1989 novel ''Laura,'' a story about a custody battle involving a fictional politician.But obtaining a consensus in the Council of Ministers, whose cooperation is important to passage of a revised data protection law, will not be easy, said Simon Davies, a founder of Privacy International, an advocacy group based in London, and a lecturer at the London School of Economics. Mr. Davies is advising the European Parliament on the legislation.''The problem is not that the will to reform isn't there. It is,'' Mr. Davies said. ''Everyone agrees in principle that we need to do this, but the devil is in the details. When you move into the details you find major ideological divides on both sides.''Ireland, with its educated work force and 15 percent corporate income tax rate, has become the European base for U.S. technology giants, including Microsoft, Facebook and Google.In the past, the country's data protection commissioners have attempted to mediate disputes over privacy issues between data protection hard-liners from Germany and France, and those advocating less regulation, like Britain.Mr. Shatter said Ireland had a ''pivotal role'' to play in resolving outstanding online privacy issues. Final adoption of a new data protection law is unlikely to take place before the second half of next year, when Ireland will no longer hold the E.U. presidency. At best, Mr. Shatter can aim to win consensus on the main issues: prior consent and an effective enforcement mechanism that relies on substantial fines.Mr. Shatter said the prior consent requirement was essential for the law to gain political backing, as were details on how to penalize companies financially if they ignored the law.Currently, most national regulators can levy limited fines of only a few thousand, or in rare cases, a few hundred thousand, euros, the equivalent of a rounding error in the profits of many global technology companies.The current proposal puts more bite into those penalties, allowing regulators to assess fines of as much as 2 percent of a company's annual sales.''Without a legal regime that provides sanctions for rule breaking, rules won't generally be complied with by some of those engaged in Web-based businesses,'' Mr. Shatter said, without endorsing specific levels of fines.That may not sound appealing to Web businesses, but Mr. Shatter is an optimist. His political slogan on his personal Web site is: Look forward with hope. "
"Dismayed at Google's Privacy Policy, European Group Is Weighing Censure","European data protection officials are drafting plans to censure Google over its online privacy policy if the company does not meet the demands of regulators to revise it.In a two-day closed-door meeting this week in Brussels of the European Union's 27 national data protection officials, the group mapped a preliminary strategy, including the possibility of testing Google's compliance with national privacy laws in countries like Ireland, Belgium and Finland, where the company operates data centers. That was the word from a person close to the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The group may issue a public statement next week on the matter. The group is focusing on new guidelines Google adopted this year for collecting information on individuals. Under the new policy, when people are logged into a Google account, the company can use information shared on one service in other Google services. For example, Google could show people an ad on YouTube based on what they have searched for, or fix the spelling of a friend's name in a Google search based on information from Gmail.When the guidelines were announced, they were sharply criticized in Europe. Data protection officials from various countries asked the French regulator, C.N.I.L., to study them. In mid-October, that regulator released a report criticizing the guidelines as allowing an ''uncontrolled combination of data.''The 27 European regulators wrote a letter to Larry Page, the chief executive of Google, asking the company to modify the new policy, which governs dozens of Google services -- among them the search engine, Android mobile phone apps and YouTube videos. The regulators want Google to give users a better sense of what personal data is being collected and to allow them to better control how that information is shared with advertisers.C.N.I.L. said the method of combining information from Google's search engine, YouTube, the Google Plus social network and other services ''suggests the absence of any limit concerning the scope of collection and the potential uses of the personal data.''Google made nearly all of its $37.9 billion in sales revenue in 2011 from Internet advertising, which relies in part on the collection and analysis of user data to produce ads aimed at individual consumers.When C.N.I.L. released its report, Google said it would study the analysis. But the company also asserted that its method of handling consumer data was legal under European Union rules. At a conference in Arizona in October, Mr. Page defended the guidelines.So far the company, which also ran afoul of European regulators in 2010 for its collection of personal data from home Wi-Fi routers in the Street View controversy, has not responded formally to the report by the French regulator.On Friday, a Google spokesman in Brussels, Alistair Verney, referred to the company's previous statement in October, which said Google was reviewing the French recommendations. ''Our new privacy policy demonstrates our longstanding commitment to protecting our users' information and creating great products,'' the Google statement said at the time. ''We are confident that our privacy notices respect European law.''When C.N.I.L. presented its analysis in October, the chairwoman of the French regulator, Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, gave the search engine ''three to four months'' -- roughly until mid-February -- to respond to its recommendations.Among other things, C.N.I.L. asked Google to heed European restrictions on mixing certain data and to heed Europe's rules for obtaining consent from consumers before collecting personal data.Google users in Europe cannot use the search engine's services unless they agree to accept the company's privacy policy.But C.N.I.L. argued in its review that the opt-in disclaimer, which is legal under United States law, was too broad. It also said consumers should be given clearer information and be allowed to individually authorize or reject the collection of certain kinds of data.While European lawmakers coordinate European Union data protection from Brussels, privacy law is enforced on the national level.That decentralization is why regulators are considering taking action within a few nations -- most likely in countries where Google has physical operations and where national courts could be asked to enforce penalties.But whether any actions, if they do eventually take place, result in anything other than minor sanctions remains to be seen. In general, European national regulators are limited to privacy violation fines of only a few hundred thousand euros against companies or individuals.A proposed update to European Union data protection law would give regulators the ability to assess much larger fines of as much as 2 percent of a company's annual sales -- which based on Google's financial performance would equate to about $760 million, based on 2011 revenue of $37.9 billion.But it is unclear how soon, if ever, those higher penalties will be adopted.Another person with knowledge of the regulators' discussion this week emphasized that the group was still hoping Google would adapt its rules in Europe to conform with the Continent's restrictions on data mining.''We still have a lot of time left before we come to this juncture,'' said another person with knowledge of the group's discussions, citing the spring deadline for Google's formal response. ''Let's wait and see what happens.'' "
A Step Toward E-Mail Privacy,"The growth of the Internet, social networking and mobile technologies has transformed how Americans communicate and exchange information, but Congress has lagged in updating federal privacy laws to safeguard digital communications from inappropriate prying. Late last month, the Senate Judiciary Committee made some serious progress in the right direction. By a voice vote, and with only a single Republican asking to go on record in opposition, the committee approved a measure, proposed by its Democratic chairman, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, that would significantly enhance the privacy protection given to e-mails.The bill, an amendment to the outdated 1986 law that now governs e-mail access, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, would require law enforcement agents to get a search warrant from a judge in order to obtain e-mail content from a communications service provider that holds private electronic messages, photos and other personal records, like Gmail or Facebook. This means having to show the court there is probable cause to believe that the sought-after records may reveal evidence of wronging.The approach embraces a sound principle: Private electronic correspondence stored with an Internet company in the ''cloud'' should receive the same protection afforded letters, photos and other private material stored in a drawer or filing cabinet, or on a computer at home.Under current law, the warrant requirement is largely limited to e-mails that are less than 180 days old. For other e-mails and digital files, investigators may obtain a court order based on a lower legal standard, showing only that the material is ''relevant'' to an investigation. In many cases, prosecutors can, without any judicial involvement, issue a subpoena demanding to see messages held by third parties.Of course, some law enforcement officials oppose tighter restrictions on e-mail access. But nothing in the bill would prevent law enforcement from doing its job or change exceptions in existing law for acting without a warrant in emergencies, when time is of the essence.The committee measure is limited in scope; most notably, it includes no new protections for location information from cellphones or GPS systems that can be as revealing of a cellphone owner's associations, activities and personal tastes as listening in on a conversation, for which a warrant is required.Although the bill is not expected to advance in this lame-duck session, it sets the stage for further debate and action on digital privacy in both the Senate and the House early in the new Congress.

Facebook's Sandberg Gently Warns Europe About Privacy Rules,"Concerned about privacy? Maybe you should be concernedabout the economy instead. That was the subtext of a keynote speech by Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, at a technology conference in the heart of Europe on Tuesday.Ms. Sandberg's remarks at the Digital Life Design conference in Munich came as the European Commission prepares to release a draft of a strict privacy regulation that stands to affect companies like Facebook. The law would apply across the 27 countries of the European Union and restrict the way Internet companies can gather, use and retain the volumes of personal data that their users post online.Ms. Sandberg's remarks offered a glimpse into the argument that global technology companies doing business in Europe are expected to raise against the looming data protection regulation: Internet companies create jobs and spur growth, and governments struggling with economic crises should not stand in their way.""In a world where increasingly these countries, like all of ours, have challenges, this is a really unique bright spot for our economies,"" she said, referring to Internet businesses. ""In Europe, in the United States, throughout the world, we need to make sure we are investing -- we are investing in technology, we are investing in basic education so that people can take advantage of these tools. We want to make sure we have the right regulatory environment -- a regulatory environment that promotes innovation and economic growth.""Facebook has not publicly said what it makes of the new would-be European privacy regulation, except to say that it hopes it will not stifle economic growth.Ms. Sandberg sprinkled her 25-minute speech with examples of European companies that use the Facebook platform and how Facebook has helped European businesses, including Burberry, the luxury brand, reach customers.She announced an offer of Facebook advertising credits worth 100 euros (about $130) for 50,000 small businesses. And she released the results of a report commissioned by Facebook that tallied the economic benefits of the social network. The report, prepared by the accounting firm Deloitte, estimated that Facebook, which has a global work force of about 3,000, indirectly helped create 232,000 jobs in Europe in 2011 and enabled more than $32 billion in revenues. Deloitte measured the company's ""broad economic impact"" by looking at a broad menu of things, including how many businesses had created Facebook pages to raise brand awareness, the applications developed for Facebook and Facebook's contribution to bolstering demand for devices and broadband connections.""So the Internet and social media, it's not just posts and pictures and fun things with your friends,"" Ms. Sandberg offered. ""But this is really serious stuff. This is about growth. This is about jobs.""That message is likely to be repeated at Ms. Sandberg's next stop: Davos, Switzerland, where she will be one of the leaders of the World Economic Forum, which starts Wednesday. Its theme this year is the transformation of the global economy. "
Reporter Is Banished From Twitter After Post on NBC's Olympics Coverage,"It all started with a little unbridled Olympic enthusiasm. Guy Adams, a Los Angeles-based correspondent for the British newspaper The Independent, started posting on Twitter how frustrated he was that NBC was delaying TV coverage of many of the most popular events of the Olympics until prime time.He wrote, ""Am I alone in wondering why NBColympics think its acceptable to pretend this road race is being broadcast live?"" He continued with his gripes: ""America's left coast forced to watch Olympic ceremony on SIX HOUR time delay. Disgusting money-grabbing by @NBColympics http://t.co/bQxKCCdj""Then Mr. Adams filed a post to Twitter that was heard throughout social media.""The man responsible for NBC pretending the Olympics haven't started yet is Gary Zenkel. Tell him what u think!"" He ended his post with the work e-mail address of Mr. Zenkel. Soon he was retweeted and some angry followers added the hashtag #NBCFAIL.Writing in The Independent, Mr. Adams said he discovered that his account had been suspended ""for posting an individual's private information such as private e-mail address."" But he stressed ""I do not wish Mr. Zenkel any harm."" NBC filed a complaint with Twitter; the two media outlets are collaborating to share the reaction of athletes and the public to the Games.NBC issued a statement saying: ""We filed a complaint with Twitter because a user tweeted the personal information of one of our executives. According to Twitter, this is a violation of their privacy policy. Twitter alone levies discipline.""Mr. Adams declined to comment for this article. A Twitter spokeswoman said the company does not comment on individual users for privacy reasons.Out of a sense of social-media solidarity, many on Twitter have been posting Mr. Zenkel's e-mail address.In his article, Mr. Adams shared an e-mail he sent to Rachel Bremer, Twitter's head of European public relations.""I'm of course happy to abide by Twitter's rules, now and forever,"" it reads. ""But I don't see how I broke them in this case: I didn't publish a private e-mail address. Just a corporate one, which is widely available to anyone with access to Google, and is identical [in form] to one that all of the tens of thousands of NBC Universal employees share.""Archie Bland, deputy editor of The Independent, wrote Monday afternoon that under those rules, Justin Bieber should also no longer be allowed on Twitter. Mr. Bieber recently briefly posted the phone number of someone who he said had hacked his friend's account. "
Europe Weighs Tough Law on Online Privacy,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Europe is considering a sweeping new law that would force Internet companies like Amazon.com and Facebook to obtain explicit consent from consumers about the use of their personal data, delete that data forever at the consumer's request and face fines for failing to comply.The proposed data protection regulation from the European Commission, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, could have significant consequences for all Internet companies that trade in personal data, whether it is pictures that people post on social networks or what they buy on retail sites or look for on a search engine.The regulation would compel Web sites to tell consumers why their data is being collected and retain it for only as long as necessary. If data is stolen, sites would have to notify regulators within 24 hours. It also offers consumers the right to transport their data from one service to another -- to deactivate a Facebook account, for example, and take one's trove of pictures and posts and contacts to Google Plus. The proposed law strikes at the heart of some of the knottiest questions governing digital life and commerce: who owns personal data, what happens to it once it is posted online, and what the proper balance is between guarding privacy and leveraging that data to aim commercial or political advertising at ordinary people.''Companies must be transparent about what they are doing, clear about which data is being used for what,'' the European Commission's vice president for justice, Viviane Reding, said in a recent telephone interview. ''I am absolutely persuaded the new law is necessary to have, on the one hand, better protection of the constitutional rights of our citizens and more flexibility for companies to utilize our Continent.''Ms. Reding is scheduled to release the proposed regulation on Wednesday in Brussels. The European Parliament is expected to deliberate on the proposal in the coming months, and the law, if approved, would go into effect by 2014.The regulation is not likely to directly affect American consumers. For American companies, its silver lining is that it offers one uniform law for all 27 countries in Europe. Currently each country, and sometimes, as in the case of Germany, each state, has separate laws about data protection.Even so, many of the provisions are likely to be costly or cumbersome. And the proposed penalties could be as high as 2 percent of a company's annual global revenue, according to a European diplomat who did not want to publicly discuss unreleased legislation.''Individuals are getting more rights. The balance is tilting more to the individual versus the companies,'' said Francoise Gilbert, a lawyer in Palo Alto, Calif., who represents technology companies doing business in Europe. ''There is very little that's good for the companies other than a reduction of administrative headaches.''Perhaps for historical or cultural reasons, Europeans tend to be more invested in issues of data privacy than Americans. Certainly, the proposed regulation is evidence that European politicians consider it to be a more urgent legislative issue than members of the United States Congress. Privacy bills have languished on Capitol Hill. Those that have been proposed, by Senator John Kerry and others, have none of the strict protections included in the draft European regulations.For the most part, American companies have pushed for a system of self-regulation and regard European-style regulations as a hindrance to innovation.Ronald Zink, chief operating officer for European affairs at Microsoft, pointed to the potential difficulty of obtaining explicit consent. He gave the example of Microsoft's Xbox Kinect system, which stores body measurements so it can visually recognize repeat players. He worried that the proposed law would require players to provide consent every time they played a game, even if the information never left the game console, requiring more time and effort on the player's part. ''We have designed the product to be private,'' Mr. Zink said. ''We put a lot of thought into how this controls our work in terms of privacy by design.''One of the most contested provisions of the European law is the so-called right to be forgotten, which refers to an Internet user's right to demand that his or her accumulated data on a particular site be deleted forever. ''When a citizen has asked to get it back, then the data has to be given back,'' Ms. Reding said in the interview. ''When an individual no longer wants his data to be processed, it will be deleted.''Critics warn that it is not so simple. Data does not always stay in one place; if it is transferred to another company it cannot easily be withdrawn. A company might license some of the data it collects to a third party to analyze market sentiments or social trends: reviews of kebab joints in Amsterdam or public opinion about burqas. Moreover, it may be less feasible to erase someone's credit history, for instance, or employment record than to, say, do away with her shopping history on Amazon.''You're not going to get a unilateral right for someone to say I want you to destroy all the information you have about me,'' said David Hoffman, global privacy officer for Intel. ''It would be preferable for people to be able to post something and then realize they made a mistake and have it taken down. However, if you were going to do that by law, it's not going to apply in all contexts, because of situations where it is perfectly reasonable to expect an organization to be able to keep the data.''Ms. Reding sought to temper expectations when she said in a speech at a technology conference in Germany on Sunday that the law would apply to information that a user had furnished to a Web site, and was not meant to erase unfavorable content about the person online.''It is clear that the right to be forgotten cannot amount to a right of the total erasure of history,'' she said. ''Neither must the right to be forgotten take precedence over freedom of expression or freedom of the media.''Malte Spitz, a Green Party politician from Germany and an advocate for strict data protection laws, said the regulation should restrict how companies hold onto personal information. ''Lots of companies are collecting as much information as possible, and lots of this information isn't really necessary,'' Mr. Spitz said. ''The right to be forgotten will change the work of companies that are doing profiling or targeted advertising.''Facebook, which has been investigated by European regulators for its data retention practices, warned last year against rules that might not keep up with the pace of change on the Internet. ''There is a risk that an excessively litigious environment would impede the development of innovative services that can bring real benefit to European citizens,'' the company said in comments submitted to the European Commission, according to Reuters.The European regulation, once passed, could serve as a template for other countries, as they draft or revise their data protection policies. ''There are very few countries that don't copy what is happening in Europe,'' said Ms. Gilbert, who has written a book on privacy laws worldwide. "
"Test Run: Addappt, a Connected Address Book for iPhones","You've probably heard this story before: A friend loses his cellphone, buys a new one and then invites hundreds of people on Facebook to join a group called ""Lost my phone. Post your numbers please."" As if that weren't annoying enough, he has bought a new phone and switched to another number, so you have to go into your address book and add his new digits. If you're anything like me, over a few years your address book has turned into a hopeless mess of duplicate entries, outdated numbers and out-of-date job titles. (And don't even get me started on what syncing up with Facebook did to my iPhone address book.)That's why a new, free app called Addappt piqued my interest. It's basically a connected address book that stays up to date. If my friend using Addappt edits his contact information with a new phone number or e-mail address, for example, it shows up in my Addappt address book, too. If he adds his home address, I can even see what time it is where he lives so I can decide when it's best to call him.The changes go both ways -- any edits made inside Addappt merge with the built-in address book on the iPhone and iPad, so I don't have to worry about updating entries there, too.But what about privacy? After logging in to Addappt for the first time, the first screen you see is a rather reassuring message: ""We will never spam you or your contacts. We will never sell, rent, share your personal information to 3rd parties. Never, ever!"" The company also makes this promise in its privacy policy on its Web site.At this early stage, you have to enter your e-mail address into the app to request an invitation from the company. This serves two purposes: to ensure that Addappt can scale up properly and also to make sure the e-mail address you're using to identify yourself is actually you.""That way, one can't enter bill.gates@microsoft.com and we connect you with Gates's contacts,"" said Mrinal Desai, a founder of Addappt. He says the company plans to make money eventually by offering paid features inside the app.The app is available for only Apple's mobile devices, but Mr. Desai expects to release an Android version by the middle of next year.

How to Devise Passwords That Drive Hackers Away,"Not long after I began writing about cybersecurity, I became a paranoid caricature of my former self. It's hard to maintain peace of mind when hackers remind me every day, all day, just how easy it is to steal my personal data.Within weeks, I set up unique, complex passwords for every Web site, enabled two-step authentication for my e-mail accounts, and even covered up my computer's Web camera with a piece of masking tape -- a precaution that invited ridicule from friends and co-workers who suggested it was time to get my head checked.But recent episodes offered vindication. I removed the webcam tape -- after a friend convinced me that it was a little much -- only to see its light turn green a few days later, suggesting someone was in my computer and watching. More recently, I received a text message from Google with the two-step verification code for my Gmail account. That's the string of numbers Google sends after you correctly enter the password to your Gmail account, and it serves as a second password. (Do sign up for it.) The only problem was that I was not trying to get into my Gmail account. I was nowhere near a computer. Apparently, somebody else was. It is absurdly easy to get hacked. All it takes is clicking on one malicious link or attachment. Companies' computer systems are attacked every day by hackers looking for passwords to sell on auctionlike black market sites where a single password can fetch $20. Hackers regularly exploit tools like John the Ripper, a free password-cracking program that use lists of commonly used passwords from breached sites and can test millions of passwords per second.Chances are, most people will get hacked at some point in their lifetime. The best they can do is delay the inevitable by avoiding suspicious links, even from friends, and manage their passwords. Unfortunately, good password hygiene is like flossing -- you know it's important, but it takes effort. How do you possibly come up with different, hard-to-crack passwords for every single news, social network, e-commerce, banking, corporate and e-mail account and still remember them all?To answer that question, I called two of the most (justifiably) paranoid people I know, Jeremiah Grossman and Paul Kocher, to find out how they keep their information safe. Mr. Grossman was the first hacker to demonstrate how easily somebody can break into a computer's webcam and microphone through a Web browser. He is now chief technology officer at WhiteHat Security, an Internet and network security firm, where he is frequently targeted by cybercriminals. Mr. Kocher, a well-known cryptographer, gained notice for clever hacks on security systems. He now runs Cryptography Research, a security firm that specializes in keeping systems hacker-resistant. Here were their tips:FORGET THE DICTIONARY If your password can be found in a dictionary, you might as well not have one. ''The worst passwords are dictionary words or a small number of insertions or changes to words that are in the dictionary,'' said Mr. Kocher. Hackers will often test passwords from a dictionary or aggregated from breaches. If your password is not in that set, hackers will typically move on.NEVER USE THE SAME PASSWORD TWICE People tend to use the same password across multiple sites, a fact hackers regularly exploit. While cracking into someone's professional profile on LinkedIn might not have dire consequences, hackers will use that password to crack into, say, someone's e-mail, bank, or brokerage account where more valuable financial and personal data is stored.COME UP WITH A PASSPHRASE The longer your password, the longer it will take to crack. A password should ideally be 14 characters or more in length if you want to make it uncrackable by an attacker in less than 24 hours. Because longer passwords tend to be harder to remember, consider a passphrase, such as a favorite movie quote, song lyric, or poem, and string together only the first one or two letters of each word in the sentence.OR JUST JAM ON YOUR KEYBOARD For sensitive accounts, Mr. Grossman says that instead of a passphrase, he will randomly jam on his keyboard, intermittently hitting the Shift and Alt keys, and copy the result into a text file which he stores on an encrypted, password-protected USB drive. ''That way, if someone puts a gun to my head and demands to know my password, I can honestly say I don't know it.''STORE YOUR PASSWORDS SECURELY Do not store your passwords in your in-box or on your desktop. If malware infects your computer, you're toast. Mr. Grossman stores his password file on an encrypted USB drive for which he has a long, complex password that he has memorized. He copies and pastes those passwords into accounts so that, in the event an attacker installs keystroke logging software on his computer, they cannot record the keystrokes to his password. Mr. Kocher takes a more old-fashioned approach: He keeps password hints, not the actual passwords, on a scrap of paper in his wallet. ''I try to keep my most sensitive information off the Internet completely,'' Mr. Kocher said.A PASSWORD MANAGER? MAYBE Password-protection software lets you store all your usernames and passwords in one place. Some programs will even create strong passwords for you and automatically log you in to sites as long as you provide one master password. LastPass, SplashData and AgileBits offer password management software for Windows, Macs and mobile devices. But consider yourself warned: Mr. Kocher said he did not use the software because even with encryption, it still lived on the computer itself. ''If someone steals my computer, I've lost my passwords.'' Mr. Grossman said he did not trust the software because he didn't write it. Indeed, at a security conference in Amsterdam earlier this year, hackers demonstrated how easily the cryptography used by many popular mobile password managers could be cracked.IGNORE SECURITY QUESTIONS There is a limited set of answers to questions like ''What is your favorite color?'' and most answers to questions like ''What middle school did you attend?'' can be found on the Internet. Hackers use that information to reset your password and take control of your account. Earlier this year, a hacker claimed he was able to crack into Mitt Romney's Hotmail and Dropbox accounts using the name of his favorite pet. A better approach would be to enter a password hint that has nothing to do with the question itself. For example, if the security question asks for the name of the hospital in which you were born, your answer might be: ''Your favorite song lyric.''USE DIFFERENT BROWSERS Mr. Grossman makes a point of using different Web browsers for different activities. ''Pick one browser for 'promiscuous' browsing: online forums, news sites, blogs -- anything you don't consider important,'' he said. ''When you're online banking or checking e-mail, fire up a secondary Web browser, then shut it down.'' That way, if your browser catches an infection when you accidentally stumble on an X-rated site, your bank account is not necessarily compromised. As for which browser to use for which activities, a study last year by Accuvant Labs of Web browsers -- including Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer -- found that Chrome was the least susceptible to attacks.SHARE CAUTIOUSLY ''You are your e-mail address and your password,'' Mr. Kocher emphasized. Whenever possible, he will not register for online accounts using his real e-mail address. Instead he will use ''throwaway'' e-mail addresses, like those offered by 10minutemail.com. Users register and confirm an online account, which self-destructs 10 minutes later. Mr. Grossman said he often warned people to treat anything they typed or shared online as public record.''At some point, you will get hacked -- it's only a matter of time,'' warned Mr. Grossman. ''If that's unacceptable to you, don't put it online.'' "
Trying to Purge Old Credit Card Data? Not So Fast,"A colleague recently alerted Bucks to a situation she encountered after closing her online account at Blockbuster, which last year was acquired by Dish Network.Because of all the news in recent months about hacked accounts, she thought that deleting her credit card information from the defunct account might be a good idea. But when she went to Blockbuster's Web site, she found she couldn't do that online. So she e-mailed customer service, which e-mailed her a response that said, in effect: Not possible. ""The information we have on file for you is kept for accounting purposes and cannot be removed,"" the e-mail said in part.The response also included a link to the company's privacy policy, which states in part,""If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as ZIP code, phone, e-mail or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or deactivate Users' personally identifiable information.""For instance, it says, ""You can review and change certain store-related information by visiting one of our stores, presenting suitable identification and giving the store agent your changes such as providing a new address or phone number, removing names from your account, changing your credit card or check card information, etc.""But the policy also says, ""Note that in most cases, Blockbuster will retain the previously entered data, and may even be prohibited by law from expunging certain data from its systems.""Our colleague is capable of fighting her own battles, but we were curious to learn more about what why such information is retained (is it in case some old, previously unrecorded charge shows up after you cancel?), and about what laws might prevent a company from deleting such information.This issue, apparently, isn't a new one. Online complaint sites, like one called Ripoff Report, have mentioned this problem in recent years.Our calls to Blockbuster were returned by a spokesman for Dish Networks, Aaron Johnson, who said in an e-mail that ""Blockbuster retains customer information on file for legal reasons and the company is in the process of establishing and planning the implementation of a best-in-class data retention and destruction policy.""(Huh? It's ""in the process"" of getting a ""best in class"" policy? Wouldn't it be nice if they already had one?)Mr. Johnson's e-mail didn't provide further details of the legal reasons for retaining card information. But he did say this: ""Blockbuster takes the protection of personal data very seriously including, among other things, keeping customer information secure in encrypted form. The company's encryption standards exceed the requirements set by the P.C.I. council.""He was referring to the P.C.I. (for ""payment card industry"") Security Standards Council, an initiative by major card companies to coordinate payment security rules. A spokeswoman for the council didn't immediately respond to a request for information.Our colleague said her credit card company advised her to change her account number, so at least no one else could charge anything to the card. She did that. But that could be mighty inconvenient if you had, say, other recurring bills that are paid using the same card.Readers, have you ever tried to delete your online credit card information from any sort of closed account? Were you successful? "
Silicon Valley Sounds Off on Failed Cybersecurity Legislation," A cybersecurity bill that would have set security standards for the computer networks that govern the nation's critical infrastructure was blocked by a Republican filibuster in the Senate on Thursday.John McCain, the Republican Senator from Arizona, and other Republicans opposed the bill on the grounds that the standards would have been too onerous for corporations. In the weeks leading up to the Senate vote, a compromise was struck to make those standards optional. But on Thursday, following the filibuster, the Senate voted 52 to 46 to end debate on the bill, which fell eight votes short of the 60 it would have needed to pass. In Silicon Valley, ""regulation"" is often treated like a four-letter word. But the Valley seems to have made an exception for cybersecurity, where a sort of Wild Wild West has taken hold. Criminals, ""hacktivists"" and government agents are able to have their way with few effective security technologies and regulations to stop them.We contacted three Silicon Valley security experts to get their take on the bill, the cyber threat and the potential, as some have warned, for a 9/11-style cyberattack. They are Rob Rachwald,  director of security strategy at Imperva, a network security firm; Roger Thornton, the chief technology officer of AlienVault, a threat detection service; and Mark Seward, a senior security director at Splunk, a data security firm.Mark Seward: The bill went through a metamorphosis over time. At one point it had real teeth for industry. Then, there was compromise to remove that. The fact is, it's needed.Rob Rachwald: It wasn't going to make any difference. The bill lost its teeth when it dropped the security mandate clause. The problem is that it was all sticks and no carrots. It included security mandates but it did not say, 'We're going to invest more in law enforcement, or create a central exchange where you can see where threats are coming from.' It just said, 'We're going to impose a bunch of stuff on you.' And then, 'Actually, we're going to make that voluntary.' It lost its teeth. It became an empty suit.Mr. Seward: This is a huge setback. Frankly, every day we don't pass legislation is a huge setback. It's  the difference between whether we want to be a third world country or a first world country. I've traveled abroad and experienced power outages firsthand. The resilience of our infrastructure's ability to resist an attack is the mark of a first world country. Not being able to trust that water is going to come out of the tap, or that when I light my stove natural gas is going to come out, is a real problem in a first world country. A cyberattack could literally mean that the things we most take for granted won't be available.Mr. Rachwald: After the standards became voluntary, it was a wash. The real opportunity loss was the fact that, at least initially, they wanted to build a centralized exchange between the public and private sectors for threat information. They weren't clear how they were going to do it, but the fact they wanted to do it was important. If nytimes.com gets hacked by someone with 'IP address 123' it might look like an isolated incident. But if law enforcement could see that there was an attack from that IP address against multiple news sites, it would indicate that something much bigger was happening. That was the real opportunity missed here.Roger Thornton: The fact is, intellectual property is being stolen from the industrial base at outrageous rates. Companies are getting broken into all the time. But the idea that there's some kind of regulation - some sweeping mission to Mars - that is going to solve the whole thing overnight, well, that's just not going to happen.This regulation wouldn't dramatically change the business of cybersecurity in my opinion. It would only build awareness -- which is good. Maybe if it had passed 10 years ago, we might have avoided these problems. But now, it's a different story.Mr. Seward: It's my understanding that the Department of Homeland Security's incident response team discovered that oil rigs are already under attack. But the fact that I can sit here and imagine scenarios where a key component, like water, might not be available to nuclear reactors is disconcerting. There are plenty of scenarios where the point at which two different parts of critical infrastructure intersect - like oil and gas pipelines, nuclear plants and water treatment facilities - could be jeopardized. All those things are interconnected. Our ability to have the society we have depends on the interconnection of those systems. An attack could happen tomorrow. It could happen next year. Or it could happen 10 years from now. There's no predicting.Mr. Rachwald: It's always quote-unquote imminent. The point is, this legislation would have forced people to think about the threat much more seriously than they will otherwise. "
Symantec Confirms 'Segment' of Source Code Was Stolen,"Hackers have stolen some of the programming code for two of Symantec's antivirus products for businesses.A Symantec spokesman, Cris Paden, confirmed the hack in an e-mail on Friday but said the products involved, Symantec Endpoint Protection 11.0 and Symantec Antivirus 10.2, are four and five years old respectively. Symantec no longer sells the latter product, but does continue to service it. Mr. Paden said the hack does not affect the company's flagship Norton brand consumer products.""Presently, we have no indication that the code disclosure impacts the functionality or security of Symantec's solutions,"" Mr. Paden wrote in an e-mail. ""Symantec is working to develop remediation process to ensure long-term protection for our customers' information.""Source code can be exploited by competitors, or used by hackers to corrupt antivirus products or write malicious code that circumvents those products altogether. But the age of the products involved could limit the damage.""If this code is four or five years old, it is likely it has evolved quite a bit,"" says Robert Rachwald, director of security strategy at Imperva, an Internet security company. ""That said, if there are any core functions that have not evolved, then hackers could take a look at Symantec's source code and find ways to manipulate it.""A hacker group calling itself the Lords of Dharmaraja claims to have discovered Symantec's source code in a hack they conducted on India's military and intelligence servers. In a post on the bulletin board Pastebin Wednesday, the hackers wrote, ""We have discovered within the Indian Spy Program source codes of a dozen software companies,"" which they said had signed agreements with an Indian defense program and its Central Bureau of Investigation.The original post, which is no longer on Pastebin but is still available through a Google cache, contained a document bearing a 1999 date that describes how Symantec software is designed to work but did not contain any code. The hackers later posted a second file on Pastebin, which is no longer available, that Symantec confirmed contained a ""segment"" of the source code for the enterprise products.""This does not happen very often,"" Mr. Rachwald of Imperva said. ""Source code is a company's crown jewels. Most companies put lots of locks and chains around it."" "
Hackers Breach Sites of Foreign Policy and Human Rights Groups,"In recent weeks, hackers have breached Web sites belonging to several foreign policy and human rights groups, including Amnesty International and the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, a nonprofit organization based in Israel that researches terrorism issues.Hackers infiltrated the sites using two well-known security vulnerabilities, one in Adobe Flash and another in Java software, according to a blog post by security researchers at the Shadowserver Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks cyber threats. The Flash loophole was used predominantly against Windows users and the Java vulnerability against Macintosh users.Both vulnerabilities were recently patched. The the incidents, however, show how quickly hackers work to exploit the time between the discovery of a security hole and the creation of a patch by programmers and its installation by users.Shadowserver's security researchers discovered that the Adobe Flash loophole had been used to attack visitors to the Web sites of Amnesty International Hong Kong and the Center for Defense Information, a research group in Washington. Oracle's Java vulnerability was used against visitors to the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism. The Web site of the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs was attacked through both loopholes.In each case, infected sites can drop malware onto visitors' computers, which opens a back door between the attackers' command center and the victims' computers. Once computers are infected, the attackers can move from infected computers into other computers in the victims' networks, or organizations.The security researchers noted that, as of Monday, the Web sites of Amnesty International Hong Kong, the Center for Defense Information and the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs were still infected and serving up malware to visitors' computers.""Visiting these Web sites can initiate a chain reaction in which malicious code is loaded from multiple Web sites and results in a system compromise for vulnerable systems without other mitigating factors,"" wrote Steven Adair and Ned Moran, two Shadowserver security researchers, in a blog post.The researchers did not attribute the attacks to a particular group but described the infections as an ""A.P.T."" -- or advanced persistent threat -- security jargon for an intelligence-seeking attack made by a foreign government.Shadowserver recommends that users run their computers' software updates as frequently as possible to avoid becoming infected,.""These attackers are not spreading malware through strategically compromised Web sites to make friends,"" the researchers wrote. ""They are aiming to expand their access and steal data.""""Communications (primarily e-mail), research and development (R&D), intellectual property (IP), and business intelligence (contracts, negotiations, etc.) are frequently targeted and stolen,"" they continued. ""Take the cyber espionage threat seriously and not as just something you read about occasionally. The problem is vastly understated."" "
Google's New Search Results Raise Privacy and Antitrust Concerns,"Google set off a furor on Tuesday when it added posts, photos, conversations and profiles from its Google Plus social network to search results, a feature it calls Search Plus Your World.Google said that people wanted search results to be more personal -- specifically, to include more Google Plus information. Not so fast, responded a chorus of voices in the technology, privacy and antitrust worlds.People do not necessarily want personal information appearing in search results, some said, while others said that Google was unfairly favoring its own social network over competitors like Facebook and Twitter.The latest complaint came Thursday, when the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research and advocacy group on Internet privacy, sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating Google over antitrust complaints and earlier this year penalized Google for privacy violations related to its Buzz social network.EPIC asked the F.T.C. to investigate whether Google's new product violated the terms of its privacy settlement over Buzz and raised the issue that Google's new search feature prioritized Google Plus pages over those of competing social networks.The F.T.C. did not respond to a request for comment. Previous EPIC requests have resulted in F.T.C. privacy settlements with both Google and Facebook.Google users see social content only when they are logged in to Google and see posts only from people they have chosen to follow on Google Plus who have shared specific items with them. But the results can be disconcerting because they show up out of context. A general search for ""baby photos,"" for instance, produces friends' personal photos in Google search results.The problem, said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, is that Google is showing Google Plus items in a different place than people assumed when they originally posted them.""People have been a bit unsettled by this particular change,"" Mr. Rotenberg said in an interview. ""If Google wants to pursue Google Plus and compete with Facebook, we would say that's fine, but the problem seems to arise when Google tries to hook its social network service to one of its other services.""In some instances, a person's Google Plus profile shows up in a search for his or her name before a more popular and comprehensive Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn profile. That issue gets to the core of the continuing antitrust investigations of Google, which are questioning whether Google search results favor its own e-commerce, local directory and other products over those of competitors.Facebook and Twitter do not allow the search engine to access their full feeds of posts, as Google has been quick to point out. However, both services include public profiles and posts. These have long shown up in Google search results, but are not part of the new Search Plus Your World.Google has said that it always intended for Google Plus to be a part of all its products, including search. And because it has exclusive access to Google Plus, it can add features that it could not as easily offer with other services, like the ability to follow or stop following people from the search results page.Google also has bad blood with Twitter because the companies could not come to a financial agreement for Twitter to supply Google with real-time search results, and with Facebook, which has declined to share private information with Google.Google said when it introduced the product that it took care to add privacy features like an encrypted Internet connection for searches, clearly marked notes on the search results page that explain why personal information shows up and the ability to opt out of seeing Google Plus items in search. On Thursday, it countered the online criticism with a blog post that collected positive opinions about the new service from around the Web.""Our goal with search has always been to provide the most relevant results possible,"" Google said in a statement Thursday. ""That's why for years we've been working on social search features to help you find the most relevant information from your social connections no matter what site it's on. Search Plus Your World doesn't change who has access to content, it simply helps people rediscover information they already have access to."" "
Virus Infects Computers Across Middle East," 9:09 p.m. | Updated A complex computer virus has been pilfering confidential information from computers in the Middle East for at least two years, according to a security report released on Monday.The virus, called Flame, has been infecting computers in Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Sudan, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. It has been grabbing images of users' computer screens, recording their instant messaging chats, remotely turning on their microphones to record their audio conversations and monitoring their keystrokes and network traffic, according to a report by Kaspersky Labs, a Moscow-based security research firm.If the report's findings prove to be true, Flame would be the third major Internet weapon to have been discovered since 2010. The first, named Stuxnet, was intended to attack software in specialized industrial equipment, and was used to destroy centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility in 2010. The second virus, called Duqu, like Flame, performed reconnaissance. Security researchers believe Duqu was created by the same group of programmers behind Stuxnet.The researchers said Flame appeared to have been developed by a different group of programmers. It contains 20 times more code than Stuxnet and is much more widespread than Duqu. Researchers believe Duqu hit fewer than 50 targets worldwide. Kaspersky's researchers said they had detected Flame on thousands of computers belonging to individuals, private companies and universities across the Middle East.""Flame can easily be described as one of the most complex threats ever discovered,"" Alexander Gostev, the head of Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis team, wrote in a blog post on Monday. ""It's big and incredibly sophisticated. It pretty much redefines the notion of cyberwar and cyberespionage.""Researchers say they do not know who is behind the virus, but given its complexity and the geography of its targets, they said it was most likely being staged by a government. The authors of Stuxnet and Duqu are also unknown but their targets and digital evidence suggest to some researchers that they may have been part of a joint American-Israeli project to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.Kaspersky's researchers said the majority of computers infected with Flame were located in Iran. Like Duqu and Stuxnet, Flame infects machines through a known security hole in the Windows operating software.Researchers discovered Flame while investigating reports that another computer virus, called Wiper, had been erasing computer programs in Iran. The International Telecommunications Union, a United Nations agency, had asked Kaspersky's researchers to look into Wiper when they discovered that thousands more computers had been infected with Flame. "
Cybersecurity Researchers Team Up to Combat Online Crime,"Last Friday, Microsoft employees and federal marshals raided command centers in Pennsylvania and Illinois used by criminals to run a botnet, a cluster of infected computers used to steal personal and financial information from millions of victims.But two days earlier, a separate group of cybersecurity researchers based in San Francisco quietly took down another botnet using more technical means. The five researchers, from four security firms -- Crowdstrike, Dell SecureWorks, the Honeynet Project and Kaspersky Labs-- worked together to decrypt and successfully commandeer the so-called Kelihos.b botnet that was using over 100,000 infected computers to blast pharmaceutical spam and, in some cases, steal Bitcoins, a virtual currency that is impossible to recover once stolen.The two takedowns were not timed to coincide with one another, nor were the two groups even aware they were operating in tandem. But they point to a renewed effort by technologists to take the lead in combating digital crime rather than waiting for law enforcement authorities to take action.Microsoft has preferred to take botnets down through court actions.  Including Friday's raid, Microsoft has disrupted four botnets in the last few years through civil suits. In each case, Microsoft sought secret court orders that allowed it to seize Web addresses and servers that run the botnets, without first alerting their owners.In the case of Kelihos.b, researchers took a more technical approach. They successfully reverse-engineered the botnet's structure and analyzed its cryptography, then injected their own file into its communication network. That file instructed infected computers to send any information to a ""sinkhole"" controlled by Crowdstrike, rather than to the command-and-control server run by criminals.Within a few minutes of infiltrating Kelihos.b, over 85,000 infected computers started communicating with Crowdstrike's sinkhole. As more infected users went online, Crowdstrike said that figure quickly jumped to 110,000. By Friday, researchers said the criminals behind Kelihos.b had already abandoned the botnet and moved on.By dismantling their tools this way, the researchers said they gleaned valuable information about the criminals' techniques.""We were able to understand how the computers were compromised, what operating systems they ran and the make-up of the botnet,"" said Adam Meyers, a threat researcher at Crowdstrike.Of the infected machines, 84 percent were exploited using a loophole in Microsoft Windows XP. Researchers also noted that the vast majority of infections -- a quarter of all identified machines -- were in Poland and that the botnet's creators spread Kelihos.b through a ""pay-per-install"" model typically favored by hackers in Eastern Europe. Richard Boscovich, a senior lawyer in Microsoft's digital crimes unit, said he had a ""high degree of confidence"" that the  culprits behind the botnet Microsoft took down last Friday were also based in Eastern Europe.That information could potentially be valuable in combating future threats. Unless a botnet's owners and clients are put behind bars, takedowns tend to be temporary. Microsoft's earlier disruption of a Waledac botnet, for example, lasted only as long as the time it took its creators to modify its architecture slightly to create a new botnet. Kelihos.b is a second-generation version of Kelihos, another botnet that was shut down last September.What is to say this botnet won't just morph itself again? ""That is a possibility,"" said Crowdstrike's Mr. Meyers. ""But when that happens, we'll be there to take it back down."" "
Symantec Dissolves a Chinese Alliance,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Less than four years after Huawei Technologies and Symantec teamed up to develop computer network security products, the joint venture is being dismantled because Symantec feared the alliance with the Chinese company would prevent it from obtaining United States government classified information about cyberthreats. According to two people briefed on the deal, Symantec's decision was a pre-emptive political maneuver timed to coincide with the United States government's efforts to share more classified cyberthreat information with the private sector. People with knowledge of the venture, who would speak only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak, said Huawei had already laid off several workers in Huawei Symantec's Silicon Valley offices this month and planned to move its entire operation out of the United States, largely because of increased American government oversight.In the next two weeks, Symantec, the Mountain View, Calif., computer security software firm, is expected to sell its 49 percent stake in the venture to Huawei for $530 million. The companies first announced the sale last November. In a news release, Enrique Salem, Symantec's chief executive, said the project had ''achieved the objectives we set four years ago'' and would ''exit the joint venture with a good return on our investment.''As online espionage proliferates, the United States government has grappled with how best to share its classified cyberthreat intelligence with the private sector. In January, the Pentagon transferred an information-sharing pilot program, called the Joint Cybersecurity Services Pilot, to the Department of Homeland Security. The program was originally intended to share classified National Security Agency intelligence with military contractors. Homeland Security is expected to extend the program beyond those companies to antivirus companies, like Symantec, and network providers.Symantec worried that its ties to Huawei would be a disadvantage when it came to being the recipient of classified threat information, according to the two people briefed on the matter. Cris Paden, a Symantec spokesman, declined to comment.William Plummer, a Huawei spokesman, said that from Huawei's perspective ''both companies had a positive experience with the joint venture.'' He added, ''We are going to streamline the organization market by market including in the U.S.''National security concerns have long dogged Huawei. Ren Zhengfei, Huawei's founder and chief executive, is a former officer in China's People's Liberation Army, and American government officials and regulators have repeatedly raised concerns about Huawei's close ties to the Chinese government.In 2008, Huawei was forced to abandon a bid for 3Com, which makes antihacking computer software for the United States military, among other products, after an American government panel raised questions about the national security risks. In 2010, Huawei lost a bid to supply mobile telecom equipment to Sprint Nextel after lawmakers expressed similar concerns. "
Security Start-Ups Catch Fancy Of Investors,"MENLO PARK, Calif. -- The question is no longer who have hackers hit. It is who has not been hit.The organizations attacked by pranksters, criminal syndicates or foreign governments include Google, LinkedIn and the Central Intelligence Agency.Big companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion on computer security this year, up 9 percent from last year. Small and medium-size businesses will spend more on security than on other information technology purchases in the next three years, according to the research firm International Data Corporation.Yet here in Silicon Valley, with all the feverish talk of innovation and billion-dollar start-ups, few entrepreneurs and venture capitalists have been eager to take on the security juggernauts Symantec and McAfee -- and in many cases cybercriminals -- for a piece of that action.That has started to change. In the last 12 months, the initial public offerings of once obscure security start-ups have outperformed offerings from household names like Facebook and Zynga. Imperva, a data security company that went public last year, finished 2011 among the year's top offerings. Its shares jumped nearly 30 percent on their first day of trading, and remain 37 percent above the offering price. Zynga's stock, by comparison, has plunged 73 percent since its offering last December. Shares of Splunk, a data security company, jumped nearly 65 percent from its offering in April. It raised $331 million in a secondary offering. Most recently, shares of Palo Alto Networks, a security start-up, climbed 26 percent when they started trading in July.The reason for the enthusiasm? ''People are starting to realize that the billions of dollars that have been invested into traditional network security is not working for them anymore,'' said Ted Schlein, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm.Security start-ups have also become red-hot takeover targets. Apple, which has avoided big-ticket deals, agreed to acquire AuthenTec for $356 million last month in its second-largest acquisition to date. And last year, the EMC Corporation, which already owned RSA, acquired NetWitness. The price was never disclosed but people close to the acquisition talks say NetWitness sold for $400 million, more than 10 times its 12-month trailing revenue.Venture capitalists have taken notice.Last year, they collectively poured $935 million into tech security companies, nearly double the $498 million they invested during 2010, according to a MoneyTree report compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the National Venture Capital Association and Thomson Reuters.''We're seeing a flow of new entrepreneurs interested in the space,'' said Asheem Chandna, a venture capitalist at Greylock who invested in Imperva and Palo Alto Networks.The rise of security start-ups is the product of a confluence of new technology, fear and people with a lot of money to invest. Major technological shifts, like the move to mobile devices and cloud storage, have redirected and increased the flow of information -- for both employees and hackers.Hackers are becoming more sophisticated, too. Last year was the year of the ''Advanced Persistent Threat,'' or A.P.T., a computer attack in which hackers spend time researching a target and its intellectual property, figuring out who has access to it, and deploying any means necessary to steal it.RSA was the victim of such an attack last year. So were the military contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Speaking at a security conference last year, Timothy McKnight, Northrop Grumman's chief security officer, said the company was fending off several such attacks a day.''The vast majority of companies have already been breached,'' Shawn Henry, the F.B.I.'s former top computer security official, said in a recent interview. ''I've looked at all sectors and the depth, penetration and breadth of these attacks are substantial.''The bulk of the attacks go undisclosed, either because companies don't know they have been hit or because they fear what disclosure will mean for their stock prices. But the attacks that have surfaced have become headline-grabbing events, exposing the vulnerability of technology firms, government agencies and the security companies that people assumed were well protected.Patrick Morley, chief executive of Bit9, a start-up that blocks malware, says the steady stream of ''bad news'' has been a boon for business.Bit9 was founded a decade ago but was largely unknown until 2010, when Google's password system was breached and top-level executives started to pay attention. ''In boardrooms, executives lifted their heads and asked, 'Are we O.K.?' '' Mr. Morley said.''We've grown 100 percent every year for the past two years. Before that, we didn't see that kind of growth,'' he said.Bit9, which roughly tripled its client base in two years, announced last week that it had raised $34.5 million in an investment round led by Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm.Mr. Chandna of Greylock said the bulk of security start-ups that solicit his firm fall into one of four categories: mobile security, authentication, intrusion detection and ''big data'' security companies.Several recently secured millions in financing. Lookout, a firm that blocks malware and spyware on consumers' mobile devices, raised $78 million from top-tier firms like Accel Partners and Andreessen Horowitz. A range of new start-ups market a similar service to businesses that now must deal with the headache of employees' bringing their iPhones and iPads to work and carting confidential intellectual property around with them.Zenprise, a start-up that brings business-level security to consumer phones, recently raised $65 million. Appthority, a one-year-old start-up that tracks suspicious behavior by mobile apps, raised $6.5 million from Venrock, U.S. Venture Partners and others last May. Solera Networks, a security start-up that tracks intrusions in real time, has raised over $50 million from Intel Capital and others, and many say it is ripe for a nine-figure acquisition.Investing in security can entail unusual challenges. In some cases, venture capitalists have received death threats from online criminals. In others, criminals have shut down their sites altogether.Ray Rothrock, an investment partner at Venrock, said he had received threatening e-mails from such people. On occasion, his firm has hired security guards to protect its offices.Blue Security, an Israeli start-up backed by Benchmark Capital and others, was forced to shut down its antispam service in 2006 after criminals responded to its filtering technology with an aggressive counterattack.Spammers flooded its database servers with so much traffic that it took down Blue Security -- and thousands of other Web sites with it -- to the point that Internet service providers refused to host the service and it was forced to close.''The thing about security investments is that sometimes you don't know where you're going to land in terms of attracting attention from the bad guys,'' Mr. Rothrock said. But, he said, the risks are still worth the rewards. ''Security is a growing market and it will grow forever.'' "
Senators Introduce Security Bill and Warn of Hacker Threat," Want swift action on a complicated, contentious piece of legislation aimed at guarding against hackers? Invoke Sept. 11. That's the lesson to be learned from the rhetoric around the long-awaited online security legislation introduced in the Senate on Tuesday. ""I fear that when it comes to protecting America from cyberattack it is Sept. 10, 2001, and the question is whether we will confront this existential threat before it happens,"" Senator Joseph Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut and a co-sponsor of the bill, told his colleagues, according to a prepared text sent by his office. Never mind that it's Valentine's Day. There was more dread than love on the Senate floor.Senator Lieberman's colleague, Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, echoed the warning. ""We are on the brink of what could be a calamity,"" he said. ""A widespread cyberattack could potentially be as devastating to this country as the terror attacks that tore apart this country 10 years ago."" Senate bill 2105 would authorize the federal government to regulate the security of privately owned critical infrastructure, including power grids, telecommunications networks and nuclear power plants. Much of that infrastructure is controlled by Internet-connected systems and susceptible to being hacked. Under the bill, the Department of Homeland Security would establish computer security regulations for critical infrastructure companies and levy penalties on those companies that fell afoul of the law. The bill also calls on private companies to share information about threats and breaches with each other and the government, a provision that Senator Dianne Feinstein of California had pressed for.She too invoked you know what. ""Alongside terrorism, cybersecurity is perhaps the No. 1 threat facing our nation today, but many obstacles exist that prevent the cooperation and coordination needed to deter this growing threat,"" she said in a statement. A hearing on the bill is scheduled for Thursday.  "
"One on One: Asheem Chandna, Venture Capitalist","Every week now, we get a jolting reminder of just how vulnerable our personal, financial and national security information is to hackers - and how inadequate existing security solutions have become.But here in Silicon Valley, for all the feverish talk of innovation and billion-dollar start-ups, few entrepreneurs and investors seem eager to take on the security juggernauts Symantec and McAfee and address what has become a growing and complex threat.They would do well to pay more attention. Imperva, a data security company that went public last year, finished 2011 as the year's top performing initial public offering. Its stock jumped 93 percent from its first day of trading. By comparison, shares of LinkedIn, arguably the year's most anticipated offering, rose 40 percent.This year, Silicon Valley and Wall Street are salivating over Facebook's impending I.P.O. But a smaller faction is awaiting the public debut of Splunk, a big-data security company that plans to go public at a $946 million valuation. Others are watching Palo Alto Networks, a fast-growing maker of online security products that filed to go public last Friday.Asheem Chandna, a partner at Greylock Partners, is a board member at Imperva and Palo Alto Networks and has invested in more than a dozen security-focused start-ups. He talks in this edited interview about how the nature of the cybersecurity threat is changing and what opportunities lie ahead.Q.A. We're starting to see a resurgence in the number of pitches for security-focused start-ups. Corporations continue to cite security as a growing and significant priority. This year, they are expected to spend over $30 billion on security products.Q.A. Unfortunately, utopia is not around the corner. The complexity of the threat continues and the technology is still catching up. But there is lot of room for innovation ahead. Right now, corporate security spending can be broken down into three large buckets: identity management and authentication tools; antivirus solutions; and network security, which includes firewalls and intrusion detection systems. But chief security officers continue to deploy these technologies separately and I haven't seen many start-ups that are looking to bridge that gap.Q.A.We've seen tons of pitches around mobile security. Also, intrusion detection and prevention systems. A third area would be companies that are applying big data to security threats. A fourth is cyber weaponry. Entrepreneurs are building software exploits that give governments the ability to monitor and, if needed, attack individuals or governments in foreign countries.Q.A. No, we have not. You have to ask whether a company like that could ever go public. Also, you would want to be sure that the business is completely aligned with the U.S. government - that they would not just sell their technology to the highest foreign bidder.Q.A. It's still early to see the fruits of big data analysis applied to security. The foundational technologies are only now becoming available to customers. The predictive analytics are yet to come.Q.A. More companies are allowing employees to bring their own devices to work. We're seeing  a boom in mobile device management and application management software. We backed Zenprise. Their technology allows organizations to let employees bring whatever device they want into the workplace. It gives I.T. departments full control over corporate data on the device and allows employees to still maintain privacy around their personal data and apps. If an employee's device gets lost, for example, the I.T. department has the ability to erase any sensitive, corporate data from afar without touching any of the employee's personal data.Q.A. Clearly Apple has invaded the enterprise with iPhones and iPads. That will continue to be the case, though Android is gaining share, especially abroad. Windows 8 is still the wild card.Q.A. Government agencies are looking to develop locked-down versions of mobile devices, with stripped down operating systems and additional layers of security wrapped around. Android is going to be deployed by government and intelligence agencies looking to develop such devices.Q.A. The DeVenCi program was set up by the Department of Defense to bypass bureaucracy and accelerate the deployment of new defense technologies. Two-dozen venture capitalists are actively helping match up the D.O.D. with new start-ups. They will periodically send us their requirements and outline new areas where they need help and we will try to pair them up with smaller companies.Q.A. Across the board. The U.S. government is about to dramatically increase its spend on cyber. In the past it was difficult for smaller companies to access government budgets because they had to go through approved purchasing lists and deal with middlemen at government approved contractors like Honeywell and Northrop Grumman. These avenues are starting to open because the government realizes it needs to get access to these technologies much quicker. They can't afford to wait.Q.A. If you went back a decade ago, hackers were in it for bragging rights. Today, it has evolved into a much more sophisticated threat. The commercial dollars at stake are much higher now. And we're seeing foreign governments spy on corporations and government agencies. When I speak with sources inside Washington, many acknowledge that China has recruited a huge pool of ""personnel"" focused on cyber and that it is much larger than anything the U.S. has in place.The U.S. is at risk of falling behind on the battlefield of the future. D.C. is increasingly reaching out to Silicon Valley because they have to accelerate the deployment of new technologies. They've typically parachuted in and flown back, but they may want to consider setting up a permanent government outpost here. "
Online Piracy and Political Overreach,"For months, it seemed as if Congress would pass an online antipiracy bill, even though its main weapons -- cutting off the financing of pirate Web sites and making them harder to find -- risk censoring legitimate speech and undermining the security of the Internet. But the unmovable corporations behind those bills have run into an unstoppable force: an outcry by Internet companies led by Google and Wikipedia that culminated in an extraordinary online protest on Wednesday.Lawmakers have begun peeling away from the bills, notably Senators Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who cosponsored the Senate version, and John Cornyn, the powerful Texas conservative. They dropped out after Wikipedia's English language site went dark and Google put a black bar on its homepage on Wednesday. The Protect I.P. Act would have easily passed the Senate last summer if not for a hold placed by Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat of Oregon. The Stop Online Piracy Act, introduced in the House in October, has also lost some of its initial backers. And on Saturday, the White House released a statement warning that it would ''not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet.''Though we are encouraged by legislators' newfound caution about the potential consequences of the bills, Congress must keep working on ways to curtail the growing business of foreign rogue Web sites trafficking in counterfeit goods and stolen intellectual property.The Internet industry was pitted against some of the best-honed lobbying groups, including Hollywood and the recording studios, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. The industry has made a good case that some of the definitions of wrongdoing -- like ''facilitating'' intellectual property infringement -- were overly broad. They said allowing property rights owners to direct payment companies like Visa and ad networks like Google's to stop doing business with sites they deemed infringing -- with no penalties if they were proved wrong-- could stymie legitimate online expression.They made the case that the proposal to make infringing Web sites ''disappear'' from the Internet by forbidding search engines from finding them or redirecting their Web addresses to other Internet domains was easy to get around and could potentially undermine efforts to stop hackers from doing exactly the same thing.The Internet companies now have the responsibility to come up with a workable alternative that gives owners of intellectual property rights better tools to stop piracy by Web sites located in faraway countries. These sites get some 53 billion visits a year, more than Google or Wikipedia. Yet they are outside the grasp of American law.The focus on cutting the financing of online pirates, which features in the House and Senate bills, is the right way to go. Sponsors of both bills have moved to delete, at least temporarily, provisions to make rogue Web sites disappear. The legislation could be further amended to narrow the definition of criminality and clarify that it is only aimed at foreign sites. And it could tighten guarantees of due process. Private parties must first get a court order to block business with a Web site they deem infringing on their copyrights.We are happy that the drive to pass antipiracy legislation has slowed enough that Congress might actually consider all its implications carefully. Lawmakers can now act wisely to create tools that can help combat the scourge of online piracy without excessive collateral damage. "
Twitter Acquires Second Security Firm in Three Months,"If recent acquisitions are any indication, Twitter is beefing up security on its site.On Monday, it acquired Dasient, a three-year-old Internet security start-up, marking Twitter's second security acquisition in just three months. Last November, Twitter acquired Whisper Systems, a security service for mobile devices. Terms for both deals were not disclosed.Twitter, the microblogging service, has long had issues with trending topic scams and spams, and is a frequent target for high-profile hacks. On Monday, as the Dasient acquisition became public, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, confirmed that his Twitter account had been hacked. Last month, Lady Gaga told her 18 million Twitter followers that her account had been compromised. And in 2010, the company was the subject of an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission into its security practices after the Twitter accounts of Facebook, Fox News, President Obama and several other prominent users were hacked.Dasient's scanning software helps businesses identify and contain malware on the Web. But it also markets what the company calls ""the industry's first anti-malvertising service,"" which claims to protect advertising networks and publishers from malware. The acquisition would seem to complement reports that Twitter is stepping up its monetization efforts with self-service ads.In a blog post, Dasient said, ""By joining Twitter, Dasient will be able to apply its technology and team to the world's largest real-time information network.""Dasient was co-founded in late 2008 by two ex-Googlers, Neil Daswani and Shariq Rizvi, and Ameet Ranadive, formerly of McKinsey & Company, with $4 million in seed money from Google Ventures, Floodgate, Radar Partners and Benhamou Global Ventures. In 2010, the company hired Paul Stich, a former vice president at McAfee, as its chief executive. "
European Privacy Regulators Warn Google on Data-Gathering Policies,"PARIS -- What does Google know about its users and how does it know it? European privacy regulators on Tuesday warned the company to clarify those issues -- or risk fines or other penalties by early next year.In a letter to Larry Page, the chief executive of Google, 27 European data-protection agencies asked the company to modify its global privacy policy that governs dozens of Google online services -- including the flagship search engine, Android mobile phone apps and YouTube videos -- so that users have a clearer understanding of what personal data is being collected and can better control how that information is shared with advertisers.Along with other Internet companies like Facebook and Microsoft, Google collects personal data, like the sex and age of users and their Web browsing histories, in order to tailor their services to individual users and also to sell ads. When Google introduced the privacy policy last winter, it described it as a way to streamline its use of personal data across a range of services that were each previously covered by separate privacy guidelines. And in keeping with European privacy law, Google said it was collecting the data only if users ''opted in.'' But opting in essentially became a requirement of using each of the services, by clicking the ''I Agree'' button before using the service for the first time, after the new policy went into effect.Analysts say the impact on Google's business of accepting the regulators' recommendations depends on whether customers readily accept having to opt into a more detailed privacy policy. If large numbers of users opt out, Google's advertising revenue would suffer.European privacy regulators had expressed concern last winter about the new procedures and had asked Google to delay implementing them. After the company declined, the European Commission asked France's privacy agency to take the lead on a legal analysis, which resulted in the warning letter Tuesday to Mr. Page.The privacy regulators said Google provided users with incomplete disclosure about its processing and storage of the data, as well as insufficient control over how information from different Google services is blended to build detailed personal profiles. Google also makes it too cumbersome for users to block the collection of these data, the regulators said.''The new privacy policy allows an unprecedented combination of data across different Google services,'' Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, chairwoman of the French data-protection authority, said at a news conference in Paris. ''We are not opposed to this, in principle, but the data could be employed in ways that the user is not aware of.''Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, whose agency, called CNIL, conducted an investigation of the policy change on behalf of the other European Union data-protection authorities, said she would give Google ''three to four months'' to make changes. If the company refuses, she and other officials said, the data-protection authorities might take legal action or impose fines.Google said it was reviewing the letter and an accompanying report from the data-protection authorities, but added that it was confident that the new policy respected European Union law.''Our new privacy policy demonstrates our longstanding commitment to protecting our users' information and creating great products,'' Peter Fleischer, the Google global privacy counsel, said in a statement.The letter to Mr. Page is only the latest addition to a growing list of regulatory headaches for Google. Antitrust officials at the European Commission are investigating whether Google has used its search engine to favor its own services and through preferential rankings to put competitors at a disadvantage. A similar inquiry is under way at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.David Vladeck, the F.T.C.'s director of consumer protection, met last week in Brussels with Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, said Cecelia Prewett, an F.T.C. spokeswoman. She declined to divulge what they discussed.On privacy, Google has been under growing scrutiny since it acknowledged in 2010 that it had collected private data on individuals when it took photographs for its Street View mapping feature. Regulators in several countries, including the United States and France, have fined Google in connection with this practice; criminal and civil investigations are still open in Germany.''There's a collective concern being expressed by different regulatory agencies in many parts of the world about the use of information online,'' said Joel Reidenberg, director of the Center on Law and Information Policy at Fordham University in New York. ''As the trend goes this way, we can expect to see more of these kinds of concerns expressed and a decreasing hesitancy about taking action.''While European Union lawmakers are working on an overhaul of the bloc's data-protection rules, with an eye toward updating them for the borderless era of the Internet, enforcement remains a matter for national regulators. In France, CNIL has the power to fine companies as much as &#x20ac;300,000, or about $390,000, for privacy breaches. In some countries, data protection agencies can bring criminal complaints; in others, it cannot.Given this fragmentation, analysts said it was striking that the national regulators, acting at the request of an advisory panel created by the European Commission, had come together to issue a joint letter to Google.''On the one hand, this is the first time all the European data-protection agencies have acted together as a group to tell a company that its actions are unacceptable,'' Mr. Reidenberg said. ''On the other hand, there is a bit of a mixed message, because they are refraining from taking any immediate action.''Coordinating such regulations and enforcement across continents is even more difficult, especially when cultural differences intrude, like in the perceived greater attachment to privacy in Europe than in, say, the United States. But regulators and Internet companies say greater alignment is desirable at a time when digital communications zip across borders and companies like Google operate on an ever more global scale.Jacob Kohnstamm, chairman of the European Commission's data-protection panel, said that regulators in Canada and some Asian countries had participated in the investigation, in an effort to give the inquiry an intercontinental scope. He and Ms. Falque-Pierrotin said the European regulators had also consulted with the F.T.C., though the U.S. agency did not sign the letter to Mr. Page.In the letter, the European officials said Google's new policy allowed the company to ''combine almost any data from any service for any purpose.''The regulators asked Google to give consumers more visibility over how their data is collected, used and combined, saying one possibility might be to create ''interactive online presentations.'' The regulators also chided Google for failing to specify how long it kept certain kinds of data, and urged the company to make it easier for users to ''opt out'' if they did not want their information gathered.The regulators also said Google did not distinguish between data of different levels of sensitivity, saying the company attached the same importance to credit card numbers or the contents of a search query, for example. And they said so-called passive users of Google services -- that is, those who use a Google feature embedded in a third-party Web site -- often are provided with no information on Google's data policies.Jeff Gould, the president of SafeGov, a group in San Francisco that represents companies selling software and hardware to governments, said Google's ''approach is that we can take anything we learn from you from our services to build a profile of a user to serve targeted ads.''''My view is that is a completely legitimate model, if you give the consumer the opportunity to opt out,'' he said.Analysts say Google needed to change its policy to keep pace with rivals like Apple and Facebook, whose services are more integrated than Google's. Ms. Falque-Pierrotin countered that greater transparency could actually be a competitive advantage for Google.Google's new privacy policy requires users to accept it before being able to use the full range of services, rather than approving individual uses of their data, as the European regulators would like. Whether this would dissuade them from using Google services is not clear.''If Google did that responsibly, I don't think it would kill their business,'' Mr. Gould said. ''But that is the 64,000-terabyte question.''This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Microsoft Tightens Personal Data Rules,"Microsoft said on Monday that it would change its new disclosure policy to tell consumers explicitly that it would not use personal information it collects from users of some Microsoft products to produce or promote targeted online advertising. The action followed a letter by Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who is co-chairman of the Congressional Bipartisan Privacy Caucus, to Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, expressing concern about the policy, which went into effect on Friday.In raising questions about Microsoft's new policy, Mr. Markey cited an Oct. 20 article in The New York Times, which reported that the new Microsoft Services Agreement gave the company broad leeway to collect and use personal information gleaned from consumers of its free, Web-based products like e-mail, search and instant messaging.The policy allowed Microsoft to use the personal data in targeted advertising, although Microsoft pledged in its blog posts and e-mails to customers that it would not do so. The products affected by the Service Agreement include the company's Web-based Hotmail and Outlook.com e-mail services, but not the Outlook program that is bought and loaded directly onto a personal computer's hard drive.Microsoft said it wanted to make its intentions clear in light of the Times article and the letter from Mr. Markey. ''One thing we don't do is use the content of our customers' private communications and documents to target advertising,'' Microsoft said in a statement released on Monday afternoon.''We could have been clearer about this when we rolled out our updated Services Agreement,'' the statement said. ''We appreciate the feedback we've received, and as a result, we will update the agreement as soon as possible to make that point absolutely clear.''The Times article reported that privacy advocates were concerned about the new policy, given that no single authority regulates the data-collection practices of Internet companies.The Microsoft policy appeared to give the company the same rights as Google, which scans the content of e-mails sent through its Gmail system, focusing on keywords to generate advertising that it thinks will interest the user. Google attracted widespread criticism when it revised its privacy policy to allow it to share that information across its product lines.In his letter to Microsoft, Mr. Markey said he was ''concerned about the privacy and security implications of Microsoft's policy of aggregating information about consumers across a suite of Microsoft services, stitching together detailed, in-depth consumer profiles.''He urged Microsoft to consider an opt-in standard that would allow the collection of personal information from users who specifically indicated that they wanted the company to collect that information.Microsoft's policy did not apply its Internet Explorer Web browser. But it has said that just such an opt-in standard, known as a ''do not track'' option, will be the default setting on the coming release of Internet Explorer 10, the latest version of the browser. "
Daily Report: Europeans Rethink Their Google Inquiries,"European privacy regulators said Wednesday that they were considering reopening their inquiries into Google's collection of personal e-mails and Web searches for its Street View service, reports Kevin J. O'Brien in Thursday's New York Times. The move came after revelations that collecting the Internet data had not been a lone programmer's error, and that others at the company had been told about it.Many regulators in Europe feel misled by Google in the matter, Jacob Kohnstamm, a Dutch regulator who is the chairman of the top European privacy panel, told The Times. He called for a stronger global response.""It is time for data protection authorities around the world to work together to hold the company accountable,"" Mr. Kohnstamm said. Google's collection of 600 gigabytes of personal data - including e-mails, photos, Web histories and passwords - from Wi-Fi routers worldwide was first uncovered in Germany in 2010. It prompted a series of inquiries in Europe and elsewhere.The data was obtained from unsuspecting households as cars photographing the streets for the company's Street View project drove by.All the overseas reviews except two in Germany - one regulatory, one criminal - were settled after Google apologized and blamed an error by the programmer for the incident.""We had been told that it was a simple mistake,"" said Johannes Caspar, the data protection commissioner for Hamburg, whose investigation first brought the illegal collection of Internet data to light. ""But now, we are learning that this wasn't a mistake and that people within the company knew this information was being collected. That puts it in a totally different light.""His office is still investigating, he said.In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission released a heavily redacted report on its inquiry, finding that Google had broken no American laws but had obstructed its investigation. Last Saturday, Google made available a largely unredacted version of the report that offered a fuller picture of what had happened.The unredacted report showed that the programmer, a Google engineer who lives in Palo Alto, Calif., told his colleagues in 2007 and 2008 that his software program would collect the so-called Internet payload data from unencrypted Wi-Fi routers.  "
British Officials Try Again on Google Data Collection," British privacy officials may have finally decided to get to the bottom of how and why Google secretly collected personal data from potentially millions of the nation's citizens. This week, the Information Commissioner's Office reopened its investigation. There is a big problem, however; the I.C.O. permitted Google to destroy the controversial data two years ago.""It is rather difficult for the I.C.O. to now turn the clock back or indeed prove anything,"" Chris Pounder, a data protection expert with the training firm Amberhawk,was quoted as saying in The Telegraph.The back story: Google was forced to reveal in the spring of 2010 that its Street View mapping cars had also been scooping up information from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks in homes and businesses. As privacy investigations began around the world, the company maintained that the data collection had resulted from an unauthorized project by an engineer acting on his own and that very little consequential data had been collected anyway.In July 2010, I.C.O. officials visited Google headquarters in London and viewed a sample of the data as served up by the search engine's technicians. Not much to it,the investigators concluded: ""On the basis of the samples we saw, we are satisfied so far that it is unlikely that Google will have captured significant amounts of personal data.""A second look, in 2011, persuaded the investigators that sensitive personal data had indeed been obtained. But it was the Federal Communications Commission's much more thorough examination, which concluded two months ago, that prompted the I.C.O. to take yet another crack at it.""We understand that a wide range of personal data together with some sensitive data was present in the payloads, including I.P. addresses, full user names, telephone numbers, complete e-mail messages, e-mail headings, instant messages and their content, logging in credentials, medical listings and legal infractions, information in relation to online dating and visits to pornographic sites and data contained in video and audio files,"" Steve Eckersley, the I.C.O. enforcement head, wrote to Google on Monday.What really seems to have irked Mr. Eckersley was that what was originally billed as ""a simple mistake"" was not, according to the F.C.C., quite so simple; others at Google were informed. ""If the data was collected deliberately then it is clear that this is a different situation than was reported to us in April 2010,"" Mr. Eckersley wrote.Google told the British media that its executives did not want the data and had never looked at it, and that it would cooperate with the new inquiry.Some experts were a bit more hopeful that the regulators could achieve a satisfactory resolution. Nick Pickles, director of the civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch,was quoted in the Huffington Post U.K.as saying that ""the investigation must now be pursued with the vigor sadly lacking in 2010, and every effort made to ensure that Google answers the extremely important questions that it has so far avoided.""One of those questions posed by the I.C.O. on Monday: When Google showed the I.C.O. a sample of what was collected in that July 2010 visit, why didn't it include anything like the type of personal data the I.C.O. now knows was collected?

"Malware for Macs Lucrative, Security Researchers Say"," Last month, cybercriminals embarked on what quickly became one of the largest-scale malware attacks on Apple computers to date. Their motive was financial: security researchers now estimate that the infected computers made the malware's creators $10,000 a day.The malware, called Flashback, targeted Mac users and infected their machines through a security hole in Java software that Oracle patched last February, but that Apple did not patch until early April. In those six weeks, Flashback spread to over half a million computers.It spread through particularly nefarious means. Unlike most malware, which typically requires users to click on a malicious link or open a compromised attachment to get infected, Flashback downloaded itself onto its victims' machines when they visited hijacked Web sites, often compromised WordPress blogs.Security researchers determined that Flashback used infected computers for click fraud, in which clicks on a Web advertisement are manipulated in exchange for kickbacks. Researchers at Symantec, who studied Flashback's code, determined that a Google search for ""toys""-- which would ordinarily send a user to Toys ""R"" Us -- instead redirected the user to a site where the attackers, not Google, would get 8 cents for the click.With 600,000 computers infected at its peak, Symantec estimates that Flashback generated $10,000 for the attackers each day. Two weeks after Apple issued a security patch, the number of infected users dropped to 140,000 from 600,000. But last week, researchers at Intego, another computer security firm, discovered that a new variant of Flashback, Flashback.S, continues to spread through the same Java vulnerability.Intego researchers did not say what the new variant of Flashback was being used for, but researchers at Symantec that analyzed a portion of the variant's code said that it communicated with the same command-and-control servers as Flashback and that it ""would be safe to assume the intention with this variant was the same.""To remove Flashback, Apple encouraged users to run their software updates. They can also download a Flashback removal tool on Apple's support site, which lets users know if their computer was infected.Security experts predicted in 2008 that when Apple's share of the PC market reached 16 percent and Windows antivirus software became 80 percent effective, Mac users would become a more frequent target for cybercriminals.That day is not far off. Apple currently holds 12 percent of the PC market and antivirus software has reached 95 percent effectiveness, according to AV Comparatives, a nonprofit that audits antivirus software. "
Products That Challenge RIM on Smartphone Security," Research in Motion has said the security of its smartphones is superior to that of its competitors' phones. But companies specializing in security tools for Apple's iOS and Google's Android systems may give businesses another reason not to buy a BlackBerry.Good Technology and 3LM are two companies offering such products. Good's service works inside its app, which acts like a secure container. You launch the Good app to do e-mail, check a calendar, browse the Web and pull up contacts in an encrypted environment. And Good this week announced partners whose apps can be opened inside that environment: Box, iAnnotate and QuickOffice, among others.For example, if you have a sensitive document and want to read or edit it in QuickOffice, you can use Good to load QuickOffice securely. That will address businesses' concerns about loading sensitive documents on an iPad, iPhone or Android device. Good said it planned to support many more apps in the coming year.Motorola's subsidiary 3LM has a product that specializes in security for Android, though it also recently began supporting iOS. Founded by Tom Moss, a former Google employee, 3LM offers security for the device's entire system. Using 3LM, businesses can get deep into the Android system to do things like block certain apps from running, or offer encryption for their corporate apps. There are also small modifications that I.T. managers can make, like prohibiting copying and pasting data between corporate apps and consumer apps, Mr. Moss said.All of Motorola's smartphones ship with 3LM's security software, and 3LM offers its software for other manufacturers' devices as well.RIM's security suite is called BlackBerry Enterprise Server. For device management, it also offers BlackBerry Mobile Fusion, which supports Android and iOS devices.RIM said companies like 3LM and Good couldn't match its security. Scott Totzke, vice president of the BlackBerry security group at RIM, said it had built security features into the software as well as the hardware components inside its devices.With Good and 3LM, Mr. Totzke said, ""You get to a limit of, how are the operating system and the hardware and software working together."" He said BlackBerry users' data was transmitted over a secured network and encrypted on the devices themselves, which makes BlackBerry Enterprise Server the most secure solution on the market.RIM last week previewed BlackBerry 10, its new software system for future BlackBerry phones, which will arrive later this year. The company is struggling to reverse its decline in the smartphone market. In the United States, its market share last quarter was 5 percent, compared with 56 percent in the first quarter of 2009, according to Canalys, the research firm.Mr. Moss of 3LM hopes to capitalize on that decline. ""We left Google because we thought there was a lot of opportunity to steal market share from RIM with Android,"" he said. ""By the time we did it, nobody wanted a BlackBerry anyway."" "
Congressman and Privacy Group Call for Google Inquiry,"9:52 p.m. | Updated A congressman and a privacy group on Tuesday called for further investigation into Google's collection of Internet communications during the course of its Street View project, in which the company sent cars into countries worldwide with a plan to photograph and map every street. The calls came in response to a report released by the Federal Communications Commission on Saturday, saying that Google had ""deliberately impeded and delayed""  the agency's inquiry into the data collection.""The circumstances surrounding Google's surreptitious siphoning of personal information leave many unanswered questions,"" said Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, in a statement. ""I believe Congress should immediately hold a hearing to get to the bottom of this serious situation.""The Electronic Privacy Information Center, based in Washington, sent a letter to United States Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. urging the Justice Department to open a new investigation into Google's actions and to ask why the search company impeded the F.C.C. during its inquiry.""Given the inadequacy of the F.C.C.'s investigation and the law enforcement responsibilities of the attorney general, EPIC urges the Department of Justice to investigate Google's collection of Wi-Fi data from residential Wi-Fi networks,"" said Marc Rotenberg, EPIC's executive director, in the letter.The letter pointed out that inquiries around the world, including in Europe and Canada, found that Google violated privacy laws. It argued that Google should be investigated for potential violation of the Wiretap Act, which, it said, ""prohibits the intentional interception, use, or disclosure of wire and electronic communications unless a statutory exception applies.""A Google Spokeswoman sent the following statement in response to the Wi-Fi investigation:""As the FCC notes in their report, we provided all the materials the regulators felt they needed to conclude their investigation and we were not found to have violated any laws. We disagree with the FCC's characterization of our cooperation in their investigation and will be filing a response.""""It was a mistake for us to include code in our software that collected payload data, but we believe we did nothing illegal. We have worked with the relevant authorities to answer their questions and concerns."" "
Google and F.T.C. Set to Settle Safari Privacy Charge," Google and the Federal Trade Commission are near a $22.5 million settlement agreement related to charges that Google bypassed privacy settings in Apple's Safari browser, according to a person briefed on the proposed settlement.The $22.5 million fine would be the largest privacy-related settlement in F.T.C. history. It comes as the commission investigates Google for antitrust violations and as it has been cracking down on privacy missteps by tech companies -- including Google, which last year agreed to pay for any future privacy blunders as part of a separate F.T.C. settlement.A Google spokesman, Chris Gaither, declined to comment on the specifics of the settlement. ""However, we do set the highest standards of privacy and security for our users,"" Google said in a statement. An F.T.C. spokesman, Peter Kaplan, also declined to comment.The case involves how Google shows users personalized Web ads based on their interests. To create these ads, Google uses cookies, which are small files that Web sites use to do things like identify the types of Web pages a user visits.Safari, unlike other browsers, blocks cookies from ad networks like Google's. But because of a loophole, Google had been able to avoid the block, and installed cookies and showed personalized ads to Safari users, researchers discovered in February.At the time, Google said that this was unintentional and had resulted from a change in Safari that Google was not aware of. When the issue was brought to Google's attention, the company stopped using the cookies on Safari browsers. It also changed an out-of-date page in its help center that gave Safari users inaccurate information about ad-related cookies.""We have now changed that page and taken steps to remove the ad cookies, which collected no personal information, from Apple's browsers,"" Google said in a statement Tuesday.Google will not claim liability for the privacy violations, according to a person briefed on the settlement, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Google agreed to settle in part to avoid a court battle while it faces broader regulatory investigations by the F.T.C., the person said. "
Apple and Google to Meet With Senator Over Privacy,"Senator Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, says Apple and Google have agreed to meet with him to discuss a privacy loophole on smartphones that gives apps unfettered access to people's personal photos.The New York Times reported last week that developers could take photos from Apple mobile and Google Android devices without the phone owners knowing that the images were being taken. In Apple's case, developers can also obtain the location information for each photo.Mr. Schumer said in a telephone interview that his office had spoken with officials at both Apple and Google on Monday.""We asked them if they could find a way on their own to prevent apps from having access to private info,"" Mr. Schumer said. ""They were friendly and open to the idea that this ought to be changed.""A Google spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano, said the company had nothing further to share at that time. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.On Sunday, Mr. Schumer said that he planned to send a letter to the Federal Trade Commission asking the agency to investigate Apple and Google after the privacy concerns came to light. Claudia Bourne Farrell, an F.T.C. spokeswoman, said the agency had received the letter but she could not comment further.""It sends shivers up the spine to think that one's personal photos, address book, and who knows what else can be obtained and even posted online without consent,"" Mr. Schumer wrote in his letter to the F.T.C. ""If the technology exists to open the door to this kind of privacy invasion, then surely technology exists to close it, and that's exactly what must happen.""Mr. Schumer said if Apple and Google could not come to an agreement to fix the problem, then he would be forced to take the issue further.He said other companies had been willing to work with his office to fix issues. ""I'm optimistic that we can get this changed without any regulation,"" he said. ""If it's not changed, then we'll look the F.T.C., and if that doesn't work then we'll look at legislative approach.""The F.T.C. has warned companies to try to be more vigilant in their efforts to protect consumers when it comes to privacy.""Industry should redouble its efforts to focus on privacy issues, or they may face additional pressure in form of legislation from Congress,"" Christopher N. Olsen, assistant director in the division of privacy and identity protection at the F.T.C., recently told The New York Times. "
Daily Report: Discoverer of Flame Virus Backs Ban on Computer Warfare," Eugene Kaspersky, the founder of Europe's largest antivirus company,  is using his company's integral role in exposing or decrypting three computer viruses aimed at Iran to argue for an international treaty banning computer warfare, Andrew E. Kramer and Nicole Perlroth report in Monday's New York Times.When Mr. Kaspersky discovered the Flame virus that is afflicting computers in Iran and the Middle East, he recognized it as a technologically sophisticated virus that only a government could create. He also recognized that the virus adds weight to his warnings of the grave dangers posed by governments that manufacture and release viruses on the Internet.""Cyberweapons are the most dangerous innovation of this century,"" he told a gathering of technology company executives, called the CeBIT conference, last month in Sydney, Australia. While the United States and Israel are using the weapons to slow the nuclear bomb-making abilities of Iran, he said, they could also be used to disrupt power grids and financial systems or even wreak havoc with military defenses.A growing array of nations and other entities are using online weapons, he said, because they are ""thousands of times cheaper"" than conventional armaments. In other Flame news, Microsoft released a Windows update on Sunday to close a security hole that was exploited by Flame. Rogue  security certificates could make it appear that some elements of the virus were produced by Microsoft and were therefore safe to install, Ars Technica reports. "
A Hacker Charms and Disappoints,"Skilled, profane and bombastic, the hacker who called himself Sabu had loyalists and critics. He also had admirers who marveled at his antics from afar, even as they disdained his tactics. That admiration helped explain the attraction of the Anonymous movement that Sabu came to represent.Nadim Kobeissi, a college student, security software developer and self-described activist in defense of free speech on the Internet, was among his admirers. He did not know the offline identity of Sabu, who last week authorities revealed to be Hector Xavier Monsegur, a 28-year-old resident of the Lower East Side. Court papers identified him as an informant in a federal indictment against a group of hackers aligned with Anonymous.Mr. Kobeissi did not agree with most of Sabu's tactics, like extracting names and credit card numbers of unsuspecting citizens. He did consider himself a fellow traveler in the sense that, like Sabu, he too opposed government censorship. He appreciated Sabu's idealism, his swagger.He was thrilled, he said, to receive compliments from Sabu on Twitter. In recent months, Mr. Kobeissi recalled, Sabu praised his coding skills, and vaguely invited him to join him on his escapades. Mr. Kobeissi was pleased by the praise, he said, though less than eager to engage in an attack.""I thought it was cool, "" Mr. Kobeissi said by phone from Montreal this week, after news broke of Sabu's arrest and cooperation with the federal authorities. ""Sabu thinks I'm cool. That's nice!""Sabu had a rare cred. He was sharp tongued, and he used a Hamas flag as his Twitter avatar. In the coder circles that Mr. Kobeissi runs in, Sabu was widely credited as the mastermind of several high-profile hacks that an Anonymous offshoot, LulzSec, took credit for - most famously, the attack on the security firm HBGary Federal. He was also known for showing off about his hacks in the most spectacular ways. LulzSec, for instance, publicized the HBGary hack on its Web site with the theme song to ""The Love Boat,"" except it was called the Lulz Boat.""The image he gave off and he did it very well, even after he was arrested by the F.B.I., he seemed like a very determined idealistic sort of person,"" Mr. Kobeissi said. ""He seemed to care about a bunch of things and wouldn't stop at anything.""""He could be so obnoxious!"" Mr. Kobeissi added. It was a compliment.Only recently did Mr. Kobeissi realize that Sabu was trying to trick him - and that Sabu had, for more than six months, been helping the federal authorities track down his compatriots in Anonymous. Mr. Kobeissi immediately posted links to the news on his Twitter page. The next day, he issued a warning to others who may be seduced in the future.""Sabu repeatedly encouraged me to work with him,"" he wrote. ""Please be careful of anyone ever suggesting illegal activity, even if they do it with you."" That message was shared widely. "
IBM Takes a Big Data Approach to Security," Companies will spend an estimated $50 billion on computer security this year, but they are not feeling particularly secure these days.Blame innovation, if you like. Every big digital advance opens the door to both opportunity and mischief. Smartphones, cloud computing and the data explosion promise a revolution in communications, cost-savings and knowledge discovery. But those three trends in technology also create security headaches. John Meakin, the global head of security for Deutsche Bank, speaks of the rising tempo and sophistication of security threats, and how applications delivered over the Internet and mobile devices take sensitive data beyond the traditional security stronghold -- the ""fortress firewall,"" he calls it.What is needed, according to Mr. Meakin, is a smart ""always-on, listening widely"" tool to detect emerging security threats -- typically software bots intent on pilfering information and committing fraud.I.B.M. is moving to provide the kind of digital security sentinel the Deutsche Bank security chief has in mind. The company is making a bundle of product announcements on Thursday that address the security challenges of mobile, cloud and Big Data computing, and I.B.M. is applying its own data analysis expertise to attack the data-security problem.The key, said Steven A. Mills, senior vice president in charge of I.B.M.'s software business, is technology that constantly monitors all kinds of data flowing into and out of a company and looks for unusual activity, or ""threat patterns.""""Security today is a real-time Big Data challenge,"" Mr. Mills said.The I.B.M. offerings are mainly monitoring software for data flows to and from mobile devices, remote data centers and programs built with Hadoop, the underlying software for many Big Data applications.The products are the result of years of I.B.M. investment and several recent acquisitions, notably Q1 Labs, a private company based in Waltham, Mass., that I.B.M. bought last year. With the Q1 deal, I.B.M. set up a separate security division, and Q1's chief executive, Brendan Hannigan, became general manager of the security business.Equifax, a large credit reporting agency, started working with Q1 shortly before it was bought by I.B.M. With 572 million consumer records in its data centers, Equifax must stay at the leading edge of security technology, said Tony Spinelli, its chief security officer. He said security was a never-ending race to stay ahead of modern hackers, whom he called ""artful and creative guys.""The appeal of I.B.M.'s strategy, Mr. Spinelli said, is that it focuses on ""security intelligence."" The traditional approach to security, he explained, has focused on ""detection and reaction."" But today, he added, the need is for automated tools that mine data flows to spot threats and issue alerts to security professionals.I.B.M.'s moves reflect how the computer security business is evolving, said Jon Oltsik, an analyst for the Enterprise Strategy Group, a research firm. The industry, he said, has long been dominated by niche companies that focused on specific products, like virus software or firewalls. But the rising complexity of computing, and of security threats, is prompting a consolidation -- and a need for products and services that span the spectrum of security threats companies face.I.B.M., Mr. Oltsik said, is one of the few companies that has both the technology expertise and broad reach to be a winner. Other candidates, he said, include Hewlett-Packard, McAfee, Symantec and perhaps Cisco.""This massive series of announcements shows that I.B.M. is executing on its security vision,"" Mr. Oltsik said. "
Study May Offer Insight Into Coca-Cola Breach,"Spend enough time with cybersecurity experts and chances are you will hear some variation of this line: There are two types of companies in the United States, those that have been hacked and those that don't yet know they've been hacked.Government intelligence officials and cybersecurity specialists say hackers -- predominantly from China -- are siphoning gigabytes, if not terabytes, of data from companies in the United States every day. We count on much of this information to deliver the innovative products and services that will lead to new jobs and economic growth. The security software company McAfee estimates that in 2008 alone, companies around the world lost more than $1 trillion because of this sort of intellectual property theft. ""I've seen behind the curtain,"" Shawn Henry, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.'s former top cyber agent, who recently joined the cybersecurity start-up CrowdStrike, told me in an interview in April. ""I can't go into the particulars because it's classified, but the vast majority of companies have been breached.""The problem is that such breaches rarely make headlines because companies fear what disclosure will mean for their stock price. Google was the first to try to change that mentality when, in 2010,it disclosed that it and 34 other companies, many based in Silicon Valley, had been attacked by Chinese hackers. Of those 34, only Intel and Adobe Systems came forward, and they provided few details.Still, news of some breaches leak out. That was the case, most recently, with Coca-Cola. This month, Bloomberg News reported that Coca-Cola was breached by Chinese hackers in 2009 during a failed $2.4 billion takeover attempt of the China Huiyuan Juice Group. That attempted deal would have been the largest foreign acquisition of a Chinese company.Now, a 2010 case study published by the Mandiant Corporation, a cybersecurity firm, may offer further details. The study, which does not mention Coca-Cola specifically, details a 2009 breach of a ""Fortune 500 Manufacturer"" that aligns almost perfectly with Bloomberg's account of Coca-Cola's breach.According to the study:In 2009, a U.S. based Fortune 500 manufacturing company initiated discussions to acquire a Chinese corporation. During the negotiations, APT [advanced persistent threat] attackers compromised computers belonging to the executives of the U.S.-based company, most likely in an effort to learn more details of the negotiations. Sensitive data left the company on a weekly basis during negotiations, potentially providing the Chinese company with visibility to pricing and negotiation strategies.As Bloomberg reported, Mandiant's study said the company gained knowledge of the breach only when law enforcement officials notified it of the intrusion. The study also details how hackers penetrated the company via a so-called spearphishing attack, in which the attackers sent e-mails to certain executives from a fake account ostensibly belonging to the chief executive.According to Bloomberg, an e-mail containing the subject line: ""Save power is save money! (from CEO)"" was sent to the e-mail account of Bernhard Goepelt, Coca-Cola's current general counsel. The e-mail contained a malicious link that, once clicked, downloaded malware that gave the attackers full access to Coca-Cola's network.Mandiant's 2010 report said the e-mail ""was crafted to look like it originated from a fellow employee and discussed a message from the CEO on conserving resources.""Tal Be'ery, a senior Web researcher at Imperva, a data security firm, compared details of the Coca-Cola breach with Mandiant's study and said the two accounts clearly referred to the same company. Executives at Mandiant and media officers at Coca-Cola did not return requests for comment.If Mandiant's study is, in fact, based on Coca-Cola, then it offers new insights into the breach. According to the study, once in, hackers used password-stealing software to gain access to other systems on the company's network. They also used the compromised executive's account to launch what is known as an SQL server attack, in which hackers exploit a software vulnerability and enter commands that cause databases to produce their contents.But one of the most interesting aspects of the breach, according to Mandiant, was how well the attackers had concealed their tracks. According to Mandiant, hackers used so-called stub malware. This is an agile agent whose code can be tweaked by hackers to use it for various functions while leaving a small forensic footprint.The one discrepancy between the Bloomberg and Mandiant accounts was why, ultimately, the company's acquisition fell apart. According to Bloomberg, Coca-Cola's takeover attempt of China Huiyuan Juice Group was thwarted because China's Ministry of Commerce rejected it for antitrust reasons. Mandiant's report offered a different take:The intrusion had a significant impact on the victim organization. As a result of the compromise, the U.S. company terminated their acquisition plans. While it was not possible to determine all the data that had been lost, the victim company was not able to compete the acquisition and accomplish their business objectives. Updated: In an e-mail, Kent J. Landers, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said that the company does not comment on security matters, but said Coca-Cola did not complete its acquisition of China Huiyuan Juice Group ""as a result of the China Ministry of Commerce declining approval for the proposed transaction.""

South Carolina Offers Details of Data Theft and Warns It Could Happen Elsewhere,"ATLANTA -- Gov. Nikki R. Haley said on Tuesday that South Carolina officials had not done enough to stop computer hackers who recently stole millions of personal financial records. A new report shows that outdated computers and security flaws at the state's Department of Revenue allowed international hackers to steal 3.8 million tax records, the governor said. She announced that the agency's director, James Etter, would resign at the end of the year.''Could South Carolina have done a better job? Absolutely,'' she said. ''We did not do enough.''Experts say the cyberattack, which resulted in the theft of 3.8 million Social Security numbers and 387,000 credit and debit card numbers, was the largest ever against a state government agency.On Tuesday, the computer security firm Mandiant released a report with new details about the attack. Hackers broke into the agency's computer system by sending state employees spam e-mail that contained an embedded link. If employees clicked on the link, software was activated on their computers that stole their user names and passwords, Mandiant found. Using this information, the hackers were able to log in as tax officials and steal the data.In addition to stealing records for the 3.8 million taxpayers, the hackers stole information on nearly 1.9 million dependents and nearly 700,000 businesses between August and October.Ms. Haley said the report revealed two basic security flaws: state employees did not need multiple passwords and user names to obtain sensitive tax data, and the state did not encrypt Social Security numbers, which could have reduced the harm if any were stolen.The state is paying up to $12 million to provide a free year of credit monitoring and identity theft prevention to anyone affected.One victim, Tina Mather, the owner of a catering company in Columbia, says $4,000 was stolen from her bank account and was transferred to companies in Boston and Atlanta and then to unknown people.''It has put our life through hell trying to figure out where our money went,'' said Ms. Mather, whose bank is investigating and plans to reimburse her.Ms. Haley said similar attacks would probably happen in other states if security was not enhanced. She called on the Internal Revenue Service and Congress to adopt new protocols for state tax agencies.''Every state needs to be looking at this,'' she said. ''It is a new part of any governor's role to make sure this data is secure.'' "
Utah Breach Shows Vulnerability of Health Records,"Eastern European hackers have stolen personal records for 780,000 people in the breach of a computer server in Utah. The list of victims include recipients of Medicaid and a health care program for low-income children in Utah, officials at Utah's Department of Health said in a statement. Hackers were able to breach the servers by exploiting a technician's weak password. On March 30, they downloaded 24,000 files to computers in Eastern Europe. Each file contained records for hundreds of  recipients. Utah's Department of Health has updated the number of victims three times. It initially said 24,000 people were affected but by Monday evening, the list had expanded to include 780,000. Of those, the department said 280,000 had their Social Security numbers stolen, according to the revised statement. Some security experts said the breach pointed to a problem with the way personal records were increasingly stored in bulk. ""Why do we continue to see these large aggregate databases?"" Eddie Schwartz, chief information security officer at the computer security firm RSA, said in an interview on Tuesday. ""Why should hackers be able to steal 10 million credit card numbers or 700,000 personal records at once? We need to think about distributing that information so that when networks do get penetrated, we're not looking an all-or-nothing situation.""In this case, officials at Utah's Department of Health said they had recently moved claim records to a new server. Despite several layers of security in place, they said hackers were able to bypass the system because a technician configured the server with a weak password. The department said it has since shut down the server, put new security measures in place and was inspecting other servers across the state. As banks step up their security measures, health providers and retailers have become a more prevalent target for hackers, security experts note. The same day hackers infiltrated the server in Utah, for instance, reports surfaced that another group of hackers had pilfered information for as many as three million credit card accounts in an attack on Global Payments, an Atlanta company that processes payments for retailers.  According to sources briefed on the investigation, the breach marked the second time the payment processor had been attacked in the last year.Security experts said health and insurance records were also becoming a target for hackers because personal information, like the kind stored by Utah's Department of Health, could fetch a higher price on the black market than a single credit card record. ""Credit cards have a much lower per-unit-value compared to identities which have a much higher per-unit-value on the black market,"" Mr. Schwartz said. Child records, in particular, are valuable to criminals because their lack of a credit report or bank account makes it difficult to monitor them for identity theft. Their identity can be exploited for years before it is uncovered. According to AllClear ID, a company that offers identity protection services, some 10 percent of children in the United States have had their identity stolen. Utah's Department of Health said it was cooperating with the F.B.I. on its breach and working to notify victims, with priority given to those whose Social Security numbers were stolen. The department said it would provide free credit monitoring to those victims. It suggested that Utah's Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Plan recipients, as well as anyone whose health-care provider might have submitted information to the state for Medicaid coverage within the last four months, monitor their credit and bank accounts.

"Again, Wrangling Over Surveillance in the Cybersecurity Bill","The so-called cybersecurity bill is being thrashed out on the United States Senate floor this week, a debate that is turning into a pitched battle over how easily the government can go through private data online.The White House on Wednesday made a last-minute push to salvage the measure, taking pains to say that it believes the military does not need to be rifling through private communications to keep the nation safe from cyberattack. The director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Keith Alexander, on a conference call with reporters, reiterated that private companies would not have to share information with his agency, but only with the civilian-run Department of Homeland Security.""We acknowledge the concerns on civil liberties and privacy,"" the General said. If necessary, he went on, the Department of Homeland Security can relay threat information to military agencies like his by first scrubbing away personal information on U.S. citizens. The General insists that his agency is not tasked with spying on Americans, and that it is under orders from the White House to ""minimize"" whatever data it collects on U.S. citizens.  The original goal of the cybersecurity bill, sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, was to let the government enforce minimum security standards for the computer systems that run power plants, air traffic control systems, dams and other critical infrastructure. The business lobby pushed back. The legislation now makes government oversight entirely voluntary.Some of the most important parts of the bill now center on the sharing of information between private companies and government agencies -- and therein lies the rub. There is a flurry of amendments to the bill, and a great many of them would either expand or limit the government's powers of surveillance.Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, wants language that could enable firms to share information directly with the National Security Agency.Some Democrats, meanwhile, are seeking to tack on privacy protection measures. Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, has proposed an amendment that would require the government to obtain a search warrant based on probable cause every time a law enforcement agency wanted to pry open e-mail communications by private citizens. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, has said he wants to propose an amendment to require the police to obtain a warrant before extracting location data from private cellphones.The business lobby continues to be opposed to the legislation. It is worried about any obligations to share information about security breaches, lest it open up companies to lawsuits.In a final push to pass the measure before Congress goes on recess, the White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan urged Senators to overlook partisan politics and pass the bill in an effort ""to give our cybersecurity professionals the tools they need to keep the nation safe.""By Wednesday afternoon, there was no movement on the bill, and a cloture vote was expected on Thursday. Skeptics worried that it would take a significant cyberattack  to rally Congress to unite across party lines in support of substantive security legislation.""Most outside observers believe that we will only get effective cybersecurity legislation after there has been a crisis of some kind, and that then we are likely to overreact, trampling privacy and putting in place rigid requirements,"" said James A. Lewis, a national security expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""This is an outcome no one on the Hill wants, but it may be inevitable."" "
Researchers Find a Flaw in a Widely Used Online Encryption Method,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A team of European and American mathematicians and cryptographers have discovered an unexpected weakness in the encryption system widely used worldwide for online shopping, banking, e-mail and other Internet services intended to remain private and secure.The flaw -- which involves a small but measurable number of cases -- has to do with the way the system generates random numbers, which are used to make it practically impossible for an attacker to unscramble digital messages. While it can affect the transactions of individual Internet users, there is nothing an individual can do about it. The operators of large Web sites will need to make changes to ensure the security of their systems, the researchers said. The potential danger of the flaw is that even though the number of users affected by the flaw may be small, confidence in the security of Web transactions is reduced, the authors said.The system requires that a user first create and publish the product of two large prime numbers, in addition to another number, to generate a public ''key.'' The original numbers are kept secret. To encrypt a message, a second person employs a formula that contains the public number. In practice, only someone with knowledge of the original prime numbers can decode that message.For the system to provide security, however, it is essential that the secret prime numbers be generated randomly. The researchers discovered that in a small but significant number of cases, the random number generation system failed to work correctly.The importance in ensuring that encryption systems do not have undetected flaws cannot be overstated. The modern world's online commerce system rests entirely on the secrecy afforded by the public key cryptographic infrastructure.The researchers described their work in a paper that the authors have submitted for publication at a cryptography conference to be held in Santa Barbara, Calif., in August. They made their findings public Tuesday because they believe the issue is of immediate concern to the operators of Web servers that rely on the public key cryptography system.''This comes as an unwelcome warning that underscores the difficulty of key generation in the real world,'' said James P. Hughes, an independent Silicon Valley cryptanalyst who worked with a group of researchers led by Arjen K. Lenstra, a widely respected Dutch mathematician who is a professor at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland. ''Some people may say that 99.8 percent security is fine,'' he added. That still means that approximately as many as two out of every thousand keys would not be secure.The researchers examined public databases of 7.1 million public keys used to secure e-mail messages, online banking transactions and other secure data exchanges. The researchers employed the Euclidean algorithm, an efficient way to find the greatest common divisor of two integers, to examine those public key numbers. They were able to produce evidence that a small percentage of those numbers were not truly random, making it possible to determine the underlying numbers, or secret keys, used to generate the public key.They said they ''stumbled upon'' almost 27,000 different keys that offer no security. ''Their secret keys are accessible to anyone who takes the trouble to redo our work,'' they wrote.To prevent this, one of the organizations that had collected the public keys has removed the information from the Internet and taken steps to protect it from theft.To perform their study, the researchers used several databases of public keys, including one at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and another created by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a Internet privacy rights group. The foundation's database results from a project, known as the SSL Observatory, originally intended to investigate the security of the digital certificates that are used to protect encrypted data transmitted between Internet users and Web sites.''We were very careful: we did not intercept any traffic, we did not sniff any networks,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''We went to databases that contained public information and downloaded public keys.''The researchers said they were not able to determine why the random number generators had produced imperfect results, but they noted that the problem appeared in more than the work of a single software developer.They also stated that if they had been able to discover the flaw, it was also possible that it had been previously uncovered, perhaps by organizations or individuals with malicious intent: ''The lack of sophistication of our methods and findings make it hard for us to believe that what we have presented is new, in particular to agencies and parties that are known for their curiosity in such matters,'' they wrote.While they said that the publication of results that potentially undermine the security of encryption keys was inappropriate unless the parties were notified first, the researchers noted that the way they discovered the flaw made identifying potentially vulnerable parties a challenge.''The quagmire of vulnerabilities that we waded into makes it infeasible to properly inform everyone involved, though we made a best effort to inform the larger parties and contacted all e-mail addresses recommended or specified in still-valid affected certificates,'' they wrote. ''The fact that most certificates do not contain adequate contact information limited our options. Our decision to make our findings public, despite our inability to directly notify everyone involved, was a judgment call.''There have been previous failures of random number generators that have undermined Internet security. For example, in 1995, two researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, discovered a flaw in the way the Netscape browser generated random numbers, making it possible for an eavesdropper to decode encrypted communications. Last year a group of computer hackers revealed that Sony had made a crucial mistake in not using a random number in the algorithm used by the security system of the PlayStation 3, making it possible to discover the secret key intended to protect digital content on the system.The researchers whimsically titled their paper ''Ron Was Wrong, Whit Is Right,'' a reference to two pioneers in public key cryptography, Ron Rivest and Whitfield Diffie.Mr. Diffie was a developer of the first method for two people who had not previously physically met to share a secret message safely. However, what became known as the R.S.A. algorithm, created by and named after three mathematicians, Mr. Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, ultimately became the dominant standard. (They later helped found the security company RSA.) The so-called Diffie-Hellman method, developed by Mr. Diffie, Martin Hellman and Ralph Merkle, required only a single secret number. "
Scientists Find Cheaper Way To Ensure Internet Security,"Scientists at Toshiba and Cambridge University have perfected a technique that offers a less expensive way to ensure the security of the high-speed fiber optic cables that are the backbone of the modern Internet.The research, which will be published Tuesday in the science journal Physical Review X, describes a technique for making infinitesimally short time measurements needed to capture pulses of quantum light hidden in streams of billions of photons transmitted each second in data networks. Scientists used an advanced photodetector to extract weak photons from the torrents of light pulses carried by fiber optic cables, making it possible to safely distribute secret keys necessary to scramble data over distances up to 56 miles.Such data scrambling systems will most likely be used first for government communications systems for national security. But they will also be valuable for protecting financial data and ultimately all information transmitted over the Internet. The approach is based on quantum physics, which offers the ability to exchange information in a way that the act of eavesdropping on the communication would be immediately apparent. The achievement requires the ability to reliably measure a remarkably small window of time to capture a pulse of light, in this case lasting just 50 picoseconds -- the time it takes light to travel 15 millimeters.The secure exchange of encryption keys used to scramble and unscramble data is one of the most vexing aspects of modern cryptography.Public key cryptography uses a key that is publicly distributed and a related secret key that is held privately, allowing two people who have never met physically to securely exchange information. But such systems have a number of vulnerabilities, including potentially to computers powerful enough to decode data protected by mathematical formulas.If it is possible to reliably exchange secret keys, it is possible to use an encryption system known as a one-time pad, one of the most secure forms. Several commercially available quantum key distribution systems exist, but they rely on the necessity of transmitting the quantum key separately from communication data, frequently in a separate optical fiber, according to Andrew J. Shields, one of the authors of the paper and the assistant managing director for Toshiba Research Europe. This adds cost and complexity to the cryptography systems used to protect the high-speed information that flows over fiber optic networks.Weaving quantum information into conventional networking data will lower the cost and simplify the task of coding and decoding the data, making quantum key distribution systems more attractive for commercial data networks, the authors said.Modern optical data networking systems increase capacity by transmitting multiple data streams simultaneously in different colors of light. The Toshiba-Cambridge system sends the quantum information over the same fiber, but isolates it in its own frequency.''We can pick out the quantum photons from the scattered light using their expected arrival time at the detector,'' Dr. Shields said. ''The quantum signals hit the detector at precisely known times -- every one nanosecond, while the arrival time of the scattered light is random.''Despite their ability to carry prodigious amounts of data, fiber-optic cables are also highly insecure. An eavesdropper needs only to bend a cable and expose the fiber, Dr. Shields said. It is then possible to capture light that leaks from the cable and convert it into digital ones and zeros.''The laws of quantum physics tell us that if someone tries to measure those single photons, that measurement disturbs their state and it causes errors in the information carried by the single photon,'' he said. ''By measuring the error rate in the secret key, we can determine whether there has been any eavesdropping in the fiber and in that way directly test the secrecy of each key.'' "
Former White House Cybersecurity Official Joins Start-Up," In January, Sameer Bhalotra left his position as President Obama's senior director for cybersecurity without discussing his next move.On Tuesday, he will announce his next gig: chief operating officer at Impermium, a cybersecurity start-up based in Redwood City, Calif., that wants to clean up the social Web using so-called big data techniques.Mr. Bhalotra is the latest cybersecurity expert to leave the public sector for a start-up. In April, Shawn Henry, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's top cybercop, joined CrowdStrike, a start-up that helps keep companies' intellectual property safe from hackers. And in June, Howard Schmidt, the Obama administration's former cybersecurity czar,  joined the board of Qualys, a security company.At the White House, Mr. Bhalotra coordinated several of President Obama's cybersecurity initiatives, including the White House's National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, a project that aims to set higher standards for the way major online vendors - banks, technology companies and mobile service providers - verify user identities and store personal data online.He also helped coordinate the White House's cybersecurity legislative agenda, which stalled in the Senate last month because of Republican concerns that the regulations would be too onerous for corporations and would give the Department of Homeland Security too much oversight.In an interview, Mr. Bhalotra said the failure to pass cybersecurity legislation was ""inevitable given that a significant portion of the private sector and U.S. Congress weren't interested in any new form of regulation.""But ""it was a missed opportunity,"" Mr. Bhalotra said. ""The situation is dire. In many parts of the world, hackers act with near impunity in attacking foreign governments, stealing intellectual property and credit cards, and it's getting worse and worse. The bad guys are extremely agile and it's very difficult for governments and companies to keep up with the next vector of attack.""Mr. Bhalotra said he decided to take the job at Impermium because he believes that the next battleground is the social Web: ""The bad guys are just beginning to set their sights there.""Investors seem to agree. Impermium has backing from top-tier venture capitalists including Accel Partners, Greylock Partners, Charles River Ventures, Highland Capital and other investors.The company ""cleans up"" social content for more than 300,000 Web sites and social networks - removing spam, fake registrations and hate speech - using ""big data"" analytics. Its technology uses natural language processing and algorithms that learn from threats it sees across its client base, and it uses that learning to simultaneously remove malicious content from other sites.Its algorithms look for things like users' I.P. addresses, where they're located and what type of machine they're using, to discern whether a Web site link, comment, or online payment is valid or malicious.""We have hundreds of thousands of sites that feed in, which help us analyze transactions in real time rather than one by one,"" said Mark Risher, Impermium's chief executive. ""Over time, we build up user reputations. We learn the patterns of bad guys and good guys and can make more relevant decisions about whether a transaction is good or bad.""Mr. Risher founded Impermium in 2010 after leaving a job as Yahoo's anti-spam chief. Originally his job was to rid Yahoo e-mail of spam, but he said he started getting more internal queries from other parts of the business - like Yahoo Finance and Flickr - looking for ways to clean up their own content.""Bad guys find a way to exploit every new form of communication,"" said Mr. Risher. ""Five years ago, it was e-mail. Now, you're seeing hundreds of millions of transactions per second take place on social channels, with ads for diet pills, drive-by-downloads, malware and identity theft scams on otherwise innocuous sites that do not have the same hardening as e-mail has.""Many workplaces, Mr. Risher and Mr. Bhalotra said, have taken a black-and-white approach to the problem, banning employees from visiting sites like Facebook and Twitter, which is no longer practical given how pervasive those sites now are.""They can cut off the Internet or deal with this content,"" said Mr. Risher. "
F.T.C. Charges Myspace With Breaking U.S. Law in Sharing Users' Personal Information,"WASHINGTON -- Continuing its crackdown on Internet privacy violations, the Federal Trade Commission charged Myspace on Tuesday with violating federal law by breaching its promise not to share users' personal information, including their Web browsing habits, with advertising companies.The advertisers that tracked the online browsing habits of Myspace users were not charged, reflecting a general lack of laws governing online privacy. On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce committee will question officials from the F.T.C. and the Obama administration about their recent proposals to require companies to obtain consumers' permission to be tracked online. The F.T.C. asserted that from January 2009 through June 2010, and again from October 2010 through October 2011, Myspace, a social media Web site, transmitted information, including internal identification numbers of users, and their ages and genders, to outside ad networks that served ads to Myspace.Using that information, the F.T.C. said, third parties could obtain the user's name and other personal information and use a file placed on the user's computer to view a history of Web sites the user had visited.That violated the privacy policy that Myspace disseminated beginning in 2008, which said that the company ''will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties unless you have given Myspace permission to do so.''Without admitting or denying the F.T.C.'s charge, Myspace agreed to a tentative consent order announced Tuesday that requires it to obey its stated privacy policies, to establish comprehensive privacy controls and procedures and to submit to audits of its actions every other year for 20 years.News Corporationsold Myspace in June to Specific Media, an advertising group based in Irvine, Calif., and Justin Timberlake, the musician. In a statement, Specific Media said it had settled the case ''to put any questions regarding Myspace's preacquisition practices behind us.'' Some of the period covered by the accusations came after Specific Media bought Myspace.Myspace has about 25 million users in the United States, according to comScore; Facebook has about 159 million users.The F.T.C. does not have the legal authority to assess penalties for violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act, like those reported against Myspace. If the commission accepts the consent order after a 30-day public comment period, later violations of the agreement could be punished with a civil penalty of up to $16,000 for each transgression.''One of our first actions after acquiring Myspace was to thoroughly examine the company's business practices and, where applicable, make improvements,'' Specific Media said. ''A major focus of this review was to ensure that Myspace delivered advertisements to consumers in a manner that safeguarded their privacy.''The agreement with Myspace is similar to one the F.T.C. made in November with Facebook over its sharing of users' information with advertisers and making public information that it had said would be kept private.The F.T.C. settled a similar privacy case with Google over the start-up of its Google Buzz network last year. The commission is now investigating whether Google violated that agreement when it reportedly circumvented privacy controls on Apple's Safari browser on computers and mobile devices, according to people close to the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to prejudice the inquiry.Aspects of those settlements and the F.T.C.'s other Internet privacy actions are likely to come up at a Senate Commerce committee hearing on Wednesday. The F.T.C. chairman, Jon Leibowitz, and Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen will testify about aspects of an F.T.C. report issued in March. It recommended privacy legislation and urged Internet companies to build Do Not Track safeguards into their products. Cameron F. Kerry, general counsel for the Commerce Department, will also testify about the Obama administration's privacy framework, released in February, which included a privacy ''bill of rights.''The F.T.C. on Tuesday also filed charges in Federal District Court in San Antonio seeking a civil contempt ruling against the Billing Services Group, a San Antonio company that provides services to telephone companies. The commission said that from 2006 to 2010, Billing Services violated a court order against placing false charges on consumers' phone bills.The charges were typically for so-called enhanced services, like voice mail, streaming video and identity theft protection, that consumers had not authorized, the F.T.C. said. According to the F.T.C.'s complaint, Billing Services placed more than $70 million in fake charges on phone bills; it refunded some of the charges, but the F.T.C. is seeking $52.6 million in additional refunds.In 1999, the company signed an agreement with the F.T.C. promising to refrain from unauthorized billing, misrepresenting services and charges to consumers and providing billing services to vendors who failed to clearly disclose the terms of their services.The Billing Services Group strongly disputed the F.T.C.'s assertions. It said it had cooperated fully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in its investigation of the company that it said was at fault, a company it described as a former client but that was not a part of the company.''Throughout the investigation, the company was repeatedly informed that B.S.G. was not suspected of any wrongdoing,'' the Billing Services Group said in a news release. ''The F.T.C. plainly misunderstands B.S.G.'s business, and declined our invitation to meet with them about our due diligence processes before filing its motion.'' "
F.T.C. and White House Push for Online Privacy Laws,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration and the nation's chief privacy regulator pressed Congress on Wednesday to enact online privacy legislation, saying new laws would level the playing field between companies that already had privacy policies and those that lacked them, and thus escape regulatory oversight.Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces limited Internet privacy laws, and Cameron F. Kerry, general counsel for the Commerce Department, said at a hearing of the Senate commerce committee that writing new laws and giving the F.T.C. the power to enforce them with civil penalties would promote Internet commerce by increasing the trust that Americans put in online transactions. Currently, the F.T.C. monitors whether Internet companies that have privacy policies keep their promises to consumers about when and where they will share personal information. But the commission lacks the authority to assess penalties for most transgressions, and it has little authority over how companies operate when they have no written privacy rules.''Granting direct enforcement authority to the F.T.C. would enable the commission to take action against outliers and bad actors even if their actions do not violate a published privacy policy,'' Mr. Kerry said, according to written testimony released at the beginning of the hearing.The F.T.C. recently accused Google, Facebook and Myspace of breaching promises about what consumer information they would keep secret or when they would share it with advertisers. While those companies face possible fines for further privacy violations, they were not financially penalized for the original incidents.Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the committee, also expressed his support for ''strong consumer-focused privacy legislation this year,'' according to prepared remarks.And he cast doubt on proposals for industry self-regulation. ''Sometimes industry self regulation efforts do not end up protecting consumers,'' Mr. Rockefeller said. ''In my experience, corporations are unlikely to regulate themselves out of profits.''Both Senator John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, and Cameron Kerry, his brother, said it was important for the United States to establish its own privacy standard and not let European regulators dictate the industry standard.Some Republican members of the Senate and the House have supported some privacy measures, while others have warned that strict new regulations could lead to an overexpansion of government red tape, inhibiting economic growth.Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, said at the hearing that he does not believe there is a demonstrated need for new privacy laws. ''It's premature to begin discussing specific legislative fixes,'' he said, ''when we don't fully know whether the problem exists.''Privacy concerns have come to the fore as consumers grow increasingly aware of just how closely their actions online are tracked. Individual Web sites or e-mail programs can follow users long after they leave a particular page on the Web, and in many cases use that information to display specific ads to the user. Sometimes, companies also sell the information to third parties.Reflecting heightened consumer objections, the White House and the F.T.C. each produced privacy reports and recommendations this year calling for varying degrees of industry self-regulation and statutes. The White House has put forward what it calls a Privacy Bill of Rights to provide basic online protection guarantees.Mr. Leibowitz, the F.T.C. chairman, said he was against the creation of a centralized database of Internet users who request not to be tracked, as has been done with ''Do Not Call'' telephone lists. That could cause privacy concerns itself, he said.While praising the efforts of retailing, advertising and technology companies to establish a ''Do Not Track'' mechanism, he also called on the industries to do more than simply block targeted ads. They should also address the collection of information by Web sites for other purposes, he said.''While much work remains to be done on Do Not Track,'' Mr. Leibowitz said, ''the commission believes that the developments to date, coupled with legislative proposals, provide the impetus'' toward useful methods of protecting privacy.Mr. Leibowitz said he expects that ''by the end of the year there's going to be meaningful Do Not Track for American consumers so they can opt out of third-party advertisements.''The F.T.C. also repeated its call for regulation of data brokers, companies that resell databases of personal information. Such oversight would allow consumers to see and correct the information that those companies have gathered. "
Courts Divided Over Searches Of Cellphones,"Judges and lawmakers across the country are wrangling over whether and when law enforcement authorities can peer into suspects' cellphones, and the cornucopia of evidence they provide.A Rhode Island judge threw out cellphone evidence that led to a man being charged with the murder of a 6-year-old boy, saying the police needed a search warrant. A court in Washington compared text messages to voice mail messages that can be overheard by anyone in a room and are therefore not protected by state privacy laws.In Louisiana, a federal appeals court is weighing whether location records stored in smartphones deserve privacy protection, or whether they are ''business records'' that belong to the phone companies.''The courts are all over the place,'' said Hanni Fakhoury, a criminal lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based civil liberties group. ''They can't even agree if there's a reasonable expectation of privacy in text messages that would trigger Fourth Amendment protection.'' The issue will attract attention on Thursday when a Senate committee considers limited changes to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, a 1986 law that regulates how the government can monitor digital communications. Courts have used it to permit warrantless surveillance of certain kinds of cellphone data.A proposed amendment would require the police to obtain a warrant to search e-mail, no matter how old it was, updating a provision that currently allows warrantless searches of e-mails more than 180 days old.As technology races ahead of the law, courts and lawmakers are still trying to figure out how to think about the often intimate data that cellphones contain, said Peter P. Swire, a law professor at Ohio State University. Neither the 1986 statute nor the Constitution, he said, could have anticipated how much information cellphones may contain, including detailed records of people's travels and diagrams of their friends.''It didn't take into account what the modern cellphone has -- your location, the content of communications that are easily readable, including Facebook posts, chats, texts and all that stuff,'' Mr. Swire said.Courts have also issued divergent rulings on when and how cellphones can be inspected. An Ohio court ruled that the police needed a warrant to search a cellphone because, unlike a piece of paper that might be stuffed inside a suspect's pocket and can be confiscated during an arrest, a cellphone may hold ''large amounts of private data.''But California's highest court said the police could look through a cellphone without a warrant so long as the phone was with the suspect at the time of arrest.Judges across the nation have written tomes about whether a cellphone is akin to a ''container'' -- like a suitcase stuffed with marijuana that the police might find in the trunk of a car -- or whether, as the judge in the Rhode Island murder case suggested, it is more comparable to a face-to-face conversation. That judge, Judith C. Savage, described text messages as ''raw, unvarnished and immediate, revealing the most intimate of thoughts and emotions.'' That is why, she said, citizens can reasonably expect them to be private.There is little disagreement about the value of cellphone data to the police. In response to a Congressional inquiry, cellphone carriers said they responded in 2011 to 1.3 million demands from law enforcement agencies for text messages and other information about subscribers.Among the most precious information in criminal inquiries is the location of suspects, and when it comes to location records captured by smartphones, court rulings have also been inconsistent. Privacy advocates say a trail of where people go is inherently private, while law enforcement authorities say that consumers have no privacy claim over signals transmitted from an individual mobile device to a phone company's communications tower, which they refer to as third-party data.Delaware, Maryland and Oklahoma have proposed legislation that would require the police to obtain a warrant before demanding location records from cellphone carriers. California passed such a law in August after intense lobbying by privacy advocates, including Mr. Fakhoury's group. But Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, vetoed the bill, questioning whether it struck ''the right balance between the operational needs of law enforcement and individual expectations of privacy.''Similar legislation has been proposed in Congress.Lacking a clear federal statute, the courts have been unable to reach a consensus. In Texas, a federal appeals court said this year that law enforcement officials did not need a warrant to track suspects through cellphones. In Louisiana, another federal appeals court is considering a similar case. Prosecutors are arguing that location information is part of cellphone carriers' business records and thus not constitutionally protected.The Supreme Court has not directly tackled the issue, except to declare, in a landmark ruling this year, that the police must obtain a search warrant to install a GPS tracking device on someone's private property.''We are in a constitutional moment for location tracking,'' said Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. ''It's percolating in all these places.''The Rhode Island case began shortly after 6 a.m. on a Sunday in October 2009, when Trisha Oliver called 911 to say that her son, Marco Nieves, 6, was unconscious in his bed. An ambulance rushed the boy to the hospital. A police officer also responded to the call, and Ms. Oliver escorted him through the bedrooms of her apartment. She then went to the hospital, leaving the police officer behind.The officer heard a ''beeping'' in the kitchen, according to court papers. He picked up an LG-brand cellphone from the counter and saw this message: ''Wat if I got 2 take him 2 da hospital wat do I say and dos marks on his neck omg.'' It appeared to be from Ms. Oliver to her boyfriend, Michael Patino, court documents said.Mr. Patino, 30, who was in the apartment at the time, was taken to the police station for questioning. The cellphone he had with him was seized. By evening, the boy was dead. The cause of death, according to court records, was ''blunt force trauma to the abdomen which perforated his small intestine.''Mr. Patino was charged with Marco's murder.In the course of the investigation, the police obtained more than a dozen search warrants for the cellphones of Mr. Patino, Ms. Oliver and their relatives. They also obtained records of phone calls and voice mail messages from the cellphone carriers.Nearly three years later, in a 190-page ruling, Judge Savage sharply criticized the police.The first police officer had no right to look at the phone without a search warrant, Judge Savage ruled. It was not in ''plain view,'' she wrote, nor did Ms. Oliver give her consent to search it. The court said Mr. Patino could reasonably have expected the text messages he exchanged with Ms. Oliver to be free from police scrutiny.The judge then suppressed the bounty of evidence that the prosecution had secured through warrants, including the text message that had initially drawn the police officer's attention.''Given the amount of private information that can be readily gleaned from the contents of a person's cellphone and text messages -- and the heightened concerns for privacy as a result -- this court will not expand the warrantless search exceptions to include the search of a cellphone and the viewing of text messages,'' she wrote.Mr. Patino remains in jail while the case is on appeal in the state's Supreme Court. A lawyer for Mr. Patino did not respond to a request for comment.Just months before Judge Savage's ruling, the Rhode Island legislature passed a law compelling the police to obtain a warrant to search a cellphone, even if they find it during an arrest. Gov. Lincoln D. Chafee, an independent, vetoed the bill, saying, ''The courts, and not the legislature, are better suited to resolve these complex and case-specific issues.'' "
Dell Acquires A Big Maker Of Software,"For Dell, the future is data.The company, best known for selling affordable personal computers, announced on Monday a $2.4 billion purchase of Quest Software. The deal will form the backbone of Dell's software business and push it deeper into the higher-margin enterprise market. Quest is an uncharacteristically large acquisition for Dell, which has done only one other multibillion-dollar deal in its history. But Quest is the latest in a string of enterprise deals for Dell. Since February, the computer maker has announced six transactions, including SonicWall, a network security business and AppAssure, a security software maker.''The addition of Quest will enable Dell to deliver more competitive server, storage, networking and end user computing solutions and services to customers,'' John A. Swainson, president of Dell's software group, said in a statement.Dell's shopping spree hinges on the thesis that the ballooning amount of data being generated by businesses and the Web is presenting new challenges for companies, which need to store, manage and protect more and more content.Founded in 1987, Quest is one of the larger players in this arena, with about $857 million in annual sales. It sells a broad range of solutions, such as software to manage databases, protect information and simplify access to data. According to Mr. Swainson, Dell was particularly attracted to Quest's application monitoring software and its identity access software, which allows users to access multiple password-protected accounts with a single login.''This is the right move for Dell,'' said Peter Misek, an analyst with Jeffries & Company, said. ''With Quest, Dell can provide a bundled offering for software applications in a very seamless way.''With the acquisition of a management software company, Dell is trying to position itself as a vendor for businesses that are trying to build and manage their own data centers, whether on site or in the cloud.In a bid to become an end-to-end solutions company, Dell also aggressively sells servers and networking products to small- and medium-size businesses.The enterprise campaign is an important one for this company in transition, which is still heavily dependent on its low-margin personal computing business. In the first quarter, Dell's profits fell 33 percent to $635 million. The soft spot, once again, was Dell's PC business, with mobile and desktop computer sales down about 6 percent in the quarter from a year ago. For Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., the Quest acquisition did not come easy.The company sparred for weeks with a competing investor group led by Insight Venture Partners, a private equity and venture capital firm, which originally offered $23 a share for Quest in March.At $28 a share, Dell's offer is 22 percent higher than Insight's starting bid - and 33 percent higher than the average daily price of Quest's stock in February. Still, analysts say the company could wring out more value from Quest, based on possible cuts to its sales force and accounting departments.''At $28, it's a pretty cheap valuation for Quest,'' said Rob D. Owens, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. ''It has room to grow.''Quentin Hardy contributed to this post.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Dell to Buy Security Services Provider for $1.25 Billion,"Dell said  Tuesday that it had agreed to buy SonicWall, a privately held provider of data security measures for businesses, to continue expanding its corporate services offerings.The purchase price was undisclosed, but a person briefed on the matter told DealBook that Dell paid about $1.25 billion, including the assumption of SonicWall's debt.Dell will gain a provider of high-grade networking security services, which include network firewalls, e-mail protection and backup and recovery offerings. SonicWall, which was founded in 1991, says it has more than 300,000 customers in 50 countries.In a nod to the highly litigious landscape increasingly found in the tech world, SonicWall noted that it holds more than 130 patents.""We are building a strategic software portfolio to address the needs of our customers with key assets in the fast-growing and highly profitable I.T. security solutions business,"" John Swainson, the president of Dell's software group, said in a statement. ""SonicWall gives Dell access to unique intellectual property resources and technology that position us well in fast growing parts of the software security business.""The deal will provide a hefty return for SonicWall's majority owner, Thoma Bravo, the private equity firm. It bought a controlling stake in SonicWall in 2010 for about $717 million in cash.The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of Dell's 2013 fiscal year.Dell was advised by the law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf, and SonicWall was advised by the law firm Kirkland & Ellis and Centerview Partners.

Daily Report: Tech and Media Companies Resist Proposal to Strengthen Online Privacy Protections for Children,"Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have all objected to portions of a federal effort to strengthen online privacy protections for children, Natasha Singer reports in The New York Times on Tuesday. In addition, media giants like Viacom and Disney, cable operators, marketing associations, technology groups and a trade group representing toy makers are arguing that the Federal Trade Commission's proposed rule changes seem so onerous that, rather than enhance online protections for children, they threaten to deter companies from offering children's Web sites and services altogether.The underlying concern, for both industry and regulators, is not so much about online products for children themselves. It is about the data collection and data mining mechanisms that facilitate digital marketing on applications and Web sites for children - and a debate over whether these practices could put children at greater risk. In 1998, Congress passed the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act in an effort to give parents control over the collection and dissemination of private information about their children online. The regulation requires Web site operators to obtain a parent's consent before collecting personal details, like home addresses or e-mail addresses, from children under 13.Now, federal regulators are preparing to update that rule, arguing that it has not kept pace with advances like online behavioral advertising, a practice that uses data mining to tailor ads to people's online behavior. The F.T.C. wants to expand the types of data whose collection requires prior parental permission to include persistent ID systems, like unique device codes or customer code numbers stored in cookies, if those codes are used to track children online for advertising purposes. The idea is to preclude companies from compiling dossiers on the online activities - and by extension the health, socioeconomic status, race or romantic concerns - of individual children across the Web over time.But the economic issue at stake is much bigger than just the narrow children's audience. If the F.T.C. were to include customer code numbers among the information that requires a parent's consent, industry analysts say, it might someday require companies to get similar consent for a practice that represents the backbone of digital marketing and advertising - using such code numbers to track the online activities of adults.

Now on Pinterest: Scams,"Wherever Internet users go, scammers are sure to follow.Now, it's Pinterest, the hot new social-networking site where people share and discuss interesting items from around the Web that they ""pin"" to virtual pinboards on topics from knitting to books to ""all things purple.""In a blog post Monday, the security software maker McAfee said it had discovered several money-making scams taking aim at Pinterest users. Such scams seem likely to mushroom because they are born of illicit software tool kits now easily available on the Internet that let criminals create new scams in minutes with few, if any, programming skills.The tool kits help scammers make money through several well-worn methods: by exploiting online-marketing referral programs, sending calls to expensive ""premium"" phone numbers and getting people to complete intrusive marketer surveys. One tool kit profiled by McAfee gets the ball rolling by pushing people to pin the scammer's site - such as a site promising free gift cards - to their Pinterest profiles in an effort to get exposure to more potential victims. To do this, it asks users to pin the site to ""unlock"" the page and be able to see it themselves. Those who comply and visit the scammer's site may be redirected to Amazon, along with a code that will earn the scammer a referral fee if they buy something. Or they may be asked to fill out a survey that will earn the scammer a small payment. They could also end up shelling out money themselves. Those using mobile devices may be shown pornographic images that, if clicked on, begin costly phone calls that show up on their wireless bills, according to McAfee. McAfee also said it had found tools for creating large numbers of bogus Pinterest accounts and to automate mass following of accounts and commenting on posts - all tactics that can allow a scammer to manufacture viral excitement for supposedly hot new content that is, in fact, just a scam.Adam Wosotowsky, a messaging data architect at McAfee, said that Pinterest - like Facebook and Twitter before it - would have to adapt its system to keep scammers and other malcontents at bay. ""There's no easy fix,"" he said. ""In time, I'm sure they will come up with solutions for things like this.""In an e-mailed statement, Pinterest said it was ""a tremendous priority for us to quickly address"" the challenge of spammers and scammers on the Web. The company's engineers are ""revisiting the nature of public feeds on the site to make it harder for fake or harmful content to get into them and have put tools in place to detect suspicious activity like automated following and commenting.""Pinterest encourages users to report abusive posts by clicking the ""Report Pin"" button on the right of pinned content. It also recommends that users refrain from clicking on any promotional content (advertising is not allowed on Pinterest), avoid accounts with pins that do not link to relevant content, and use strong passwords and keep them close.McAfee warns users to be especially wary of requests to pin content before viewing it, as doing so is likely to lead down a winding, scammy path. Likewise, it urges people to be suspect of offers for free gift cards, pleas to fill out surveys and links with tempting titles like ""shocking video,"" ""you will not believe it"" and ""free giveaway."" Just because you're on a new social network that seems safe, clean and fun, ""that doesn't necessarily mean you are immune from the general scams that are associated with the Internet at large,"" Mr. Wosotowsky said.

British Prosecutors Consider Charges in Phone Hacking Case,"LONDON -- The wide-ranging police inquiry into phone hacking and other wrongdoing at Rupert Murdoch's tabloid newspapers moved a step closer to possible criminal prosecutions on Wednesday when Scotland Yard sent four files on 11 unidentified people, including 4 journalists and a police officer, to the Crown Prosecution Service.There also appeared to be an intensification of interest in the case of Rebekah Brooks, the former chief of Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper operations, and her husband, Charlie Brooks, an Eton-educated racehorse trainer. The couple are close friends of Prime Minister David Cameron's, and have entertained each other at their weekend homes in rural Oxfordshire. Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, told reporters that the two had been made the subject of a separate police inquiry, Operation Sacha, on suspicion of trying to pervert the course of justice. They were arrested last month.Under Britain's judicial system, criminal charges are drawn up by the Crown Prosecution Service on the basis of evidence gathered by the police. A spokeswoman for the service said that the names of those now being considered for prosecution would not be released, and that the service could not say when it would decide whether to prosecute those involved.She also emphasized that the 11 names submitted by the police so far are only a start, and that others who have been under investigation could be put forward for possible prosecution later.A statement from the prosecution service listed the offenses covered by the police files as including misconduct in public office and breaches of the Data Protection Act, involving one journalist and one police officer; perverting the course of justice, involving one journalist and ''six other members of the public''; and witness intimidation and harassment, involving one journalist. The Telegraph newspaper reported that Ms. Brooks was the journalist in at least one of the cases, but did not cite any sources for its information.The statement's list of offenses under review also included breaches of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, a broad statute that regulates the powers of public bodies to carry out surveillance and investigation, and to intercept communications, including telephone calls and e-mails. That charge involved one of the journalists.No new criminal prosecutions have taken place since the phone hacking scandal broke into public view nearly six years ago with the arrest and subsequent conviction of two men for hacking into the cellphone messages of members of the royal family and their aides. Those two men -- Clive Goodman, a former royal reporter for The News of the World, a defunct tabloid, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator working for the paper -- served brief jail terms.But the cases under review for possible prosecution cover a far wider range of offenses, with a potential for much stiffer jail terms upon conviction, according to legal experts. The 43 people who have been arrested and released on bail since Scotland Yard reopened its investigations last year, most of them with links to two Murdoch-owned tabloids, The News of the World and The Sun, have faced police questioning on suspected wrongdoing that has included systematic hacking of the cellphone messages of politicians, celebrities, sports figures and crime victims; computer hacking; bribery of police officers for disclosing confidential information; and giving false or misleading information to the police.Those waiting to be told whether charges would be filed against them include some of the best-known figures of recent years in the world of mass-market journalism in Britain, among them Ms. Brooks and Andy Coulson, a former News of the World editor who quit after the original hacking scandal and eventually became communications chief at 10 Downing Street after Mr. Cameron became prime minister in 2010. Mr. Coulson resigned last year, saying the pressures of the hacking scandal were distracting him from his work.As the transfer of the police files to the prosecutors was announced, Mr. Starmer issued a new set of ''interim'' guidelines for lawyers with the Prosecution Service to follow when assessing cases involving the news media. These included the issue that lawyers have suggested might form the legal defense for some of those arrested in the current scandal: the public interest in the information that reporters, editors and investigators were seeking in using the techniques that are now under investigation.Mr. Starmer told the BBC that one of his purposes in issuing the guidelines was to make clear that a public interest defense was possible. He said that it had been many years in Britain since cases involving such a wide number of journalists had come before prosecutors, and that the guidelines made clear that ''prosecutors must decide if journalists have acted in the public interest before charging them.''He gave as examples cases where journalists were working on ''disclosing a criminal offense'' with their inquiries, and whether their work could be ''considered capable of contributing to an important matter of public debate.'' Legal experts said the second guideline appeared to open a broad line of defense in at least some of the cases under review in the current scandal.But Mr. Starmer noted the difficult balancing act prosecutors would face in assessing individual cases. ''Freedom of information and the public right to know about important matters of public debate are an essential foundation of our society, but there are limits for those who cross the line into criminality,'' he said.Asked how long the prosecution service would take to decide on whether to charge those named in the police files now under review, he hedged. ''The decisions we are going to make are going to be extremely difficult and extremely sensitive,'' he said.He added, ''It isn't sensible for me to say, 'Well, it'll be x weeks or months,' '' since there were many possible reasons for delay, including the need of prosecutors to seek more information from the police in individual cases. "
Google to Update Privacy Policy to Cover Wider Data Use,"  8:15 p.m. | Updated Google said Tuesday that it would revise its privacy policies and terms of service, to make them shorter and more readable and to change the way Google can use information that users provide. To alert users about the changes, which take effect March 1, Google plans to undertake its biggest notification effort ever via e-mail and announcements on its various sites, according to a person briefed on Google's plans. Though the announcement comes two weeks after Google was hammered by critics for the way it integrated Google Plus posts into search results, Google said that it had been working on the new policies for a long time and that recent events had nothing to do with the timing. Still, the biggest change in the new policies goes to the heart of privacy concerns about Google's new search feature. Google Plus posts that appear in search results are only from people whom Google users have chosen to follow on Google Plus and who have shared specific items with them or made them public. But critics said that it violated users' privacy because when people posted on Google Plus, they did not know that the posts would show up in search results. The new privacy policy makes clear that for people logged into a Google account, Google can use information shared on one service in other Google services. ""If you're signed in, we may combine information you've provided from one service with information from other services,"" Alma Whitten, Google's director of privacy for product and engineering, wrote in a company blog post. ""In short, we'll treat you as a single user across all our products, which will mean a simpler, more intuitive Google experience."" The change will also allow Google to do other useful things, Ms. Whitten wrote, such as letting a user know she might be late for a meeting based on her calendar and current location, or correcting the spelling of a friend's name in a Google search. Last year, Google settled with the Federal Trade Commission over privacy misrepresentations it made related to Buzz, a social networking tool. It agreed to start a privacy program, submit to audits and pay a fine for any future misrepresentations. One watchdog group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said this month that it thought Google's new social search tool violated that agreement. Google also shrank and rewrote its privacy policies and terms of service - documents that on many Web sites are known for being too long, convoluted and bogged down by legalese. Google's main privacy policy, which had more than 70 separate documents for various products, will now cover 60 products in one document. A dozen, like Wallet or Chrome, will still have separate privacy policies. The terms of service are also consolidated and explain legal terms. Between now and March 1, as Google notifies users of the changes, they will be able to view and compare the old and new policies. Google's new efforts build on changes it made to simplify its privacy policy in 2010. Other companies, like Facebook, have also tried to shorten their policies, as industry regulators demand clearer and more concise statements. Google emphasized that its core privacy guidelines will not change. For instance, it does not sell personal information or share it externally except in the case of a valid court order, and it allows data liberation, which means Google users can export information to other services. The changes come a week after Google unveiled an ad campaign in United States newspapers, magazines, Web sites and subways to educate people about privacy. The campaign had already been running in Europe, where Google has faced more criticism and investigation of its privacy practices.  "
F.T.C. Tells Consumer Watchdog to Mind Its Own Business,"A consumer watchdog's pleas to the Federal Trade Commission to scrutinize Google's latest privacy policy changes have met with a curt ""No, thanks.""Last year, Google signed a consent decree with the commission, promising not to make changes to the information it made public about its users without their consent. Last week, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, known as EPIC, sued the Federal Trade Commission in Federal District Court in Washington, calling for it to investigate Google's privacy policy changes. On Friday, the agency responded by saying that EPIC has no legal standing in the matter. It asked the court to dismiss the case. The agency's response says nothing about the substance of the allegations. The agency reserves the right to scrutinize Google anyway and rule on whether it violated the consent decree it signed with the government last March. The F.T.C.'s court filing late Friday simply tells the consumer group to mind its own business.In an e-mail statement, the agency said: ""We are asking the court to dismiss the case because parties such as EPIC are barred by law from interfering with the proper investigation and enforcement of F.T.C. orders."" Google has said it will combine the user data it collects from all of its different products, in effect compiling what an individual searches on Google with what is posted on YouTube, Google Plus and other Google properties. Google has aggressively been flagging the changes to its customers. The company insists that does not violate its agreement with the government.  "
Facebook Advisers Propose Ways to Allow Tweens on the Site Officially,"For a long time, Facebook has known that among its 901 million users are millions of children who lie about their age - including some who do so with help from their parents. What could Facebook, which officially says no one under 13 may join, do to keep them from lying - and still keep them on the site? The company will not say, but it has received tips and wish lists from several handpicked advisers. The Wall Street Journal said on Monday that Facebook was exploring new technologies to allow children under 13 to get on the site. At present they are prohibited, because of a federal law that says Web sites that collect personal data from children 13 and younger must first obtain verifiable parental consent, something that Facebook and other Web companies describe as difficult. Facebook has said in the past it is equally difficult, if not impossible, to enforce the law. Facebook users who describe themselves as being 13 to 18 face limited restrictions: their posts are, by default, seen only by their Facebook ""friends"" and friends of friends, rather than by the public.  The company said it had no new products to announce and was testing ways to allow younger users to gain access to the site. ""We are in continuous dialogue with stakeholders, regulators and other policy makers about how best to help parents keep their kids safe in an evolving online environment,"" the company said in an e-mailed statement. Anne Collier, who belongs to Facebook's safety advisory board, said her wish list would have a parental approval panel, through which a parent could control whom children can ""friend"" and which applications they can download, if any.  Stephen Balkam, another advisory board member, said he had proposed a ""learners permit"" type of space within the site. He recommends that it remain free of advertisements, a costly proposition for Facebook, and require that children ""friend"" their parents so they can see what their children post. ""The reality is they have an enormous population of under-age kids. They're trying to figure out the best way of dealing with it,"" said Mr. Balkam, executive director of a research and advocacy group called the Family Online Safety Institute.Last fall, the Federal Trade Commission proposed updates to the , or COPPA, including a provision that compels Web sites that collect a child's information to hold onto it ""for only as long as is reasonably necessary"" and delete it safely. At the time of the proposed revisions, which are pending approval, a representative for Facebook had said that the company wished to see a greater focus on keeping children ""safe"" on the site, rather than keeping them off the site entirely. The office of Maryland's attorney general, Douglas Gansler, said he had spoken to Facebook executives in Washington about making adjustments to accommodate children 13 and under, including keeping it ad free and limiting how long the company holds onto data about its child users.  If Facebook does make changes to address those under 13, it would potentially lure younger eyeballs away from social networking sites specifically designed for children, including Togetherville, a company recently acquired by Disney. Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, sits on the board of Disney. Common Sense Media, an advocacy group, opposes allowing access to Facebook by children under 13. On Monday, it issued a statement that denounced the social network for singling out the very young in a bid to drum up advertising revenues.Others said Facebook would have to straddle a difficult balance between not turning a blind eye to lawbreakers while also allowing parents to have more fine-tuned controls over their children's social lives online. ""It's inevitable and favorable,"" said Marian Merritt, Internet safety advocate at Norton, the computer security company best known for its antivirus products. ""You can't keep your kids safe from this activity if you can't be in the room.""Ms. Merritt wrote in ablog post earlier Monday that parents should be able to know who their children's friends are and keep track of who can see what.   "
Facebook Says Child Privacy Laws Should Not Apply to 'Like' Buttons," The social networking giant Facebook has told the Obama administration that child privacy laws should not apply to a Web site's ability to incorporate a ""like"" button, because that would inhibit free expression.The company sent a 20-page letter to the Federal Trade Commission last week in which it objected to certain proposed revisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or Coppa. In it, the company argued that it had no control over sites that incorporate social plug-ins, such as a ""like"" button, and should therefore not be held liable under the child privacy law.A ""like"" counts as free speech, the company has repeatedly argued, and muzzling a user's ability to ""like"" something on Facebook would infringe on a user's constitutional rights. ""A government regulation that restricts teens' ability to engage in protected speech - as the proposed Coppa Rule would do - raises issues under the First Amendment,"" Facebook wrote in its letter.Coppa requires sites that collect personal information on children to obtain written parental permission if the child is under the age of 13. Facebook prohibits children under 13 from signing up for its services, but studies have repeatedly shown that millions of under-age children do so anyway, often with help from their parents.The proposed revisions in the child privacy law could apply to Web sites and other services that use so-called cookies to track users' travels across the Web. Cookies are ubiquitous across the Internet and are used to deliver targeted advertisements based on which Web sites a user has visited.Facebook has an additional assett: the ever-present ""like"" buttons, integrated with over 9 million different Web sites. Facebook knows each time someone goes on a page with a ""like"" button, even if she or he does not click on it. Facebook argues that it already tries to keep children under the age of 13 off its site, but it cannot always control when someone under 13 visits a Web site that contains a Facebook ""like"" button.

Daily Report: Fan Sites Settle Children's Privacy Charges,"The operator of fan Web sites for the pop stars Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Rihanna and Demi Lovato agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty to settle federal charges that the sites illegally collected personal information about thousands of children,reports Natasha Singer in Thursday's New York Times.The penalty came as a result of a complaint by the Federal Trade Commission that Artist Arena, the operator of the sites, violated a children's online privacy law by collecting personal details - like the names, e-mail addresses, street addresses and cellphone numbers - of about 101,000 children aged 12 or younger without their parents' permission.The law, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or Coppa, requires operators of Web sites to notify parents and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting, using or disclosing personal information about children younger than 13.As part of the registration process, the four fan sites asked users to submit personal details including their birth dates that would enable members to create online profiles, post messages and sign up for newsletters about the pop stars, the complaint said. Because the sites therefore knew the children's ages, the F.T.C. charged, the company had knowingly collected information and failed to properly notify their parents.The settlement, which will have to be ratified in court, comes as the agency is preparing to extensively strengthen the children's online privacy protection rule for the first time since its introduction more than a decade ago.

"For Children, a Lie on Facebook Has Consequences, Study Finds"," A federal law designed to protect children's privacy may unwittingly lead them to reveal too much on Facebook, a provocative new academic study shows, in the latest example of how difficult it is to regulate the digital lives of minors.Facebook prohibits children under 13 from signing up for a Facebook account, because of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, which requires Web companies to obtain parental consent before collecting personal data on children under 13. To get around the ban, children often lie about their age. Parents sometimes help them lie -- and in order to keep an eye on what they post, become their Facebook friends. Consumer Reports earlier this year estimated that Facebook has more than 5 million children under age 13.   That relatively innocuous family secret that allows a preteen to get on Facebook can have potentially serious consequences, including for their peers who do not lie. The study, conducted by computer scientists at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, finds that in a given high school, a small share of students who lie about their age in order to get a Facebook account can help a complete stranger collect sensitive information about a majority of their fellow students. In other words, children who deceive can endanger the privacy of those who don't. The latest research is part of a growing body of work that highlights the paradox of enforcing children's privacy by law. For instance, a study jointly authored by academics at three separate universities and Microsoft Research earlier this year found that even though parents were concerned about their children's digital footprints, they had helped them circumvent Facebook's terms of service by entering a false date of birth. Many parents seemed to be unaware of Facebook's minimum age requirement; they thought it was a recommendation, akin to a PG-13 movie rating. ""Our findings show that parents are indeed concerned about privacy and online safety issues, but they also show that they may not understand the risks that children face or how their data are used,"" that paper concluded. Facebook, for its part, has long said that it is difficult to ferret out every deceptive teenager and pointed to its extra precautions for minors. For children between ages 13 and 18, only their Facebook friends can see their posts, including photos.That system, though, is compromised if a child lies about her age when she signs up for Facebook - and thus becomes an adult much sooner on the social network than in real life, according to the experiment by N.Y.U. researchers. The key to the experiment, explained Keith W. Ross, a computer science professor at N.Y.U. and one of the co-authors of the study, was to first find known current students at a particular high school. A child could be found, for instance, if she was 10 years old and said she was 13 in order to sign up for Facebook. Five years later, that same child would show up as 18 years old - an adult, in the eyes of Facebook -- when in fact she was only 15. At that point, a stranger could also see a list of her friends. The researchers conducted their experiment at three separate high schools. They were able to construct the Facebook identities of most of the schools' current students, including their names, gender, profile pictures and other data. The researchers identified neither the schools nor any of the students. Their paper is awaiting publication. Using a publicly available database of registered voters, someone could also match the children's last names with their parents' -- and potentially, their  home addresses, Prof. Ross pointed out. The COPPA law, he argued, seemed to serve as an incentive for children to lie, but made it no less difficult to verify their real age. ""In a COPPA-less world, most kids would be honest about their age when creating accounts. They would then be treated as minors until they're actually 18,"" he said.  ""We show that in a COPPA-less world, the attacker finds far fewer students, and for the students he finds, the profiles have very little information."" How children behave online is one of the most vexing issues for parents, to say nothing of regulators and lawmakers who say they wish to protect children from the data they scatter online. Independent surveys suggest that parents are worried about how their children's social network posts can harm them in the future. A Pew Internet Center study earlier this month showed that most parents are not just concerned, but many are actively trying to help their kids manage the privacy of their digital data; over half of all parents said they talked to their children about something they posted.Teenagers seem to be vigilant, in their own way, about controlling who sees what on the Facebook pages. A separate study by the Family Online Safety Institute and released in November  found that four out of five teenagers have adjusted privacy settings on their social networking accounts, including Facebook, while two-thirds place restrictions on who can see which of their posts.

SpongeBob Game Removed From App Store After Complaints," SpongeBob Diner Dash, a free game app for children featuring the popular yellow cartoon character loved by millions of youngsters, disappeared from the Apple App Store on Monday after an advocacy group complained that the app violated federal privacy protections for children online.The Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, saying the SpongeBob app violated a children's online privacy law by collecting children's e-mail addresses and other information without obtaining their parents' permission. The group asked federal regulators to investigate PlayFirst, the developer of the Diner Dash app, and Viacom, the parent company of the Nickelodeon network which carries the SpongeBob SquarePants cable TV program, over ""deceptive marketing."" David Bittler, a spokesman for Nickelodeon, said the company had learned of the advocates' filing on Monday morning and had temporarily taken down the app while it investigated their complaint.A spokeswoman for PlayFirst referred questions from a reporter to Nickelodeon.The SpongeBob complaint comes as the F.T.C. is preparing to update privacy protections for children online. Those rules, based on a 1998 law, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or Coppa, require operators of Web sites directed at children to notify parents and obtain their consent before collecting information like names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers from children under 13. The  law is meant to give parents more control over entities that collect personal details about younger children online, often with the aim of contacting them for marketing purposes.Yet most popular apps for children fail to give parents basic facts about the kinds of personal information they collect from children and with whom they share it, agency researchers said in an F.T.C. report published last week.SpongeBob Diner Dash is a game app in which children can earn points by directing the sponge character to serve customers in various colorful cartoon restaurants. The free app frequently asks users if they want to pay a small fee to upgrade to the premium version of the game or buy special game features -- in both cases by charging a credit card attached to the device's Apple account.In Apple's App Store on Monday morning, the description of the SpongeBob app explained that it collected ""personal user data as well as nonpersonal user data,"" connected with third-party social media apps, allowed players to communicate with other app users and included in-app purchases. It also stated that the app complied with federal privacy protections for children online.""User data collection is in accordance with applicable law, such as Coppa,"" the description said.But in its complaint to the F.T.C., the advocacy group said the app neither provided the kind of notice required by that children's online privacy law,  ""nor makes any attempt to obtain prior, verifiable parental consent required by the law.""The description in the app store, along with links to the two companies' privacy policies, did not provide notice of the specific information the app collected, according to the complaint. And the app itself did not contain a privacy policy explaining its data collection practices.The app, for example, asked a player to enter ""your name"" and e-mail address to receive a ""newsletter for game tips and news!"" It also asked permission to send players on-screen notices. These included messages - like ""Help SpongeBob serve hungry customers in SpongeBob Diner Dash!"" - that encouraged children to play the game. To contact specific children with such messages, the complaint said, the app collected a string of numbers that was unique to each mobile device.But the app did not ask children to check with their parents before entering their information or agreeing to receive the notices, the complaint said. (A reporter who downloaded and played the app on Monday morning had the same experience. After the app collected the e-mail address, it did not e-mail the promised newsletter -- leaving a question about how the app actually uses player e-mail addresses).This is the second complaint about children's app developers lodged this month by the Center for Digital Democracy. Last week, the group filed a complaint with the F.T.C. saying Mobbles, a Pokemon-inspired cartoon game app, also collected data from children without seeking parental consent. The developer of Mobbles said the app was not meant for children under 13.In a letter to the agency accompanying the SpongeBob complaint, the advocacy group asked federal regulators to increase enforcement actions against the developers of mobile apps for children. It also asked the agency to add unique mobile device code numbers to the types of data collected from children that require prior parental consent. "
Children's Online Privacy Rules: Winners and Losers," Now that the Federal Trade Commission has published itsupdated privacy protections for children online, Facebook may finally open its site to children under 13, industry analysts say.But those very same new rules, they say, may prompt some small app developers to pull out of the children's market altogether.The original rules, based on the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, or Coppa, required operators of Web sites directed at children under 13 to notify parents and obtain their consent before collecting personal information from children, like their names, addresses and phone numbers. The revised rules, made public at a press conference in Washington on Wednesday, widen the list of children's personal information that will require parental permission to collect. It will now include children's photos, videos or voice recordings, the IP addresses of their computers and the locations of their mobile phones. The updated rule also requires social networks, advertising networks and other third parties to get parents' permission before knowingly collecting data from children's sites and apps.But the rules have radically different implications for big Web sites and small app developers.Some Silicon Valley executives and their lawyers lobbied for months to try to get the commission to water down some of its proposed rule revisions.One of the agency's original proposals would have made social networks like Facebook and Twitter liable for collecting information from children's sites or apps, even if the companies had no actual knowledge - but just a ""reason to know"" -- that developers had incorporated the social networks' plug-ins into their children's services.In a meeting with Commissioner Julie Brill in September, Facebook executives including Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, opposed that requirement.""Facebook representatives discussed the company's consideration of opening up the social media site to children under the age of 13,"" an F.T.C. summary of that meetingsaid. In connection with that possibility, Facebook executives said they were concerned about the company's ""potential liability for data collected by its 'plug-ins' on other websites - the Facebook representatives pointed out that that it often does not know or have control when developers add the Facebook 'plug-ins.'""On that point, at least, Facebook got its way.The final children's online privacy rule uses an ""actual knowledge"" standard for collecting information about children. That means social networks and ad networks that collect information from children without knowing that their software is operating on a children's site or app will not be liable.In an e-mail,  Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, wrote:  ""We are pleased the Commission clarified the limited circumstances under which providers of social plugins would be subject to Coppa when those plugins are displayed on other websites.""Other lobbying efforts fared less well.Representatives of app developers, for example, told federal regulators that thousands of small developers of children's apps had been able to comply with the old rule by choosing not to collect personal information from youngsters. Those app developers, they said, had outsourced the data collection to advertising networks and analytics companies because the apps themselves often did not have the financial or legal resources to handle children's personal information.The new rule, however, gives children's apps and sites primary responsibility for the ad networks and social networks they incorporate into their services. That means even children's educational apps that do not themselves collect personal information from children will now have to redesign their user interfaces to notify parents of their partners' data collection practices and obtain parents' permission, said Tim Sparapani, the senior adviser for policy and law of the Application Developers Alliance, a trade group.Because children's apps may incorporate different software from outside sources -- for analytics, say, or interactive features -- they may also face greater compliance burdens than established children's Web sites with their own resources, he says.For example, the updated rule permits data collection from children for certain internal operations as long as that information is not used ""for any other purpose.""Support for the internal operations of the website or online service means those activitiesnecessary to:(a) maintain or analyze the functioning of the website or online service;(b) perform network communications;(c) authenticate users of, or personalize the content on, the website or online service;(d) serve contextual advertising on the website or online service or cap the frequencyof advertising;(e) protect the security or integrity of the user, website, or online service;(f) ensure legal or regulatory compliance; or(g) fulfill a request of a child as permitted by §§ 312.5(c)(3) and (4);so long as the information collected for the activities listed in paragraphs (a)-(g) is not used ordisclosed to contact a specific individual, including through behavioral advertising, to amass aprofile on a specific individual, or for any other purpose.Mr. Sparapani said that app developers who incorporate free software to analyze use patterns for their children's apps, for example, will now have to notify their analytics companies that the children's data may not be collected and used for other purposes. And those analytics companies in turn may not want to provide free services if they cannot tap an app's user data for their own purposes. Some advertising networks, he said, could pull out of children's apps for the same reason.""What you are going to end up doing is choking off the monetary flow that monetizes the app,"" Mr. Sparapani said.He added that the rule's new requirements could push some developers to revise their apps to aim at teenagers -- because teenagers' data can be freely collected without regulation.""You can build an app with relatively no regulatory burden or you can build an app with high burdens and strict liability and a lot of monitoring,"" he said. ""Which one are you going to produce?"" "
Citrix Acquires Mobile Security Start-Up Zenprise,"Citrix will announce Wednesday that it has bought Zenprise, a mobile security start-up company whose backers include Greylock Partners, Shasta Ventures, the Mayfield Fund and Bay Partners.The deal terms were not disclosed. The acquisition may come as a surprise to many who expected that Zenprise might try to go it alone with an eventual initial public offering of stock. The start-up, which has raised over $60 million from venture capitalists, has been a darling in the red-hot mobile security sector. That industry continues to attract more interest, and dollars, from corporations struggling to manage their data in the era of ""Bring Your Own Device"" to work, or as the industry calls it, B.Y.O.D. Zenprise is a mobile application that lets companies wrap extra security around employees' iPhones, iPads, Android devices and other personal devices so employees can use them safely for work.It spots unusual activity, such as a hacker trying to break into the phone. It also separates employees' personal files from corporate data so employees do not have to worry about giving their employers full access to personal material. And it lets companies remotely wipe the data on a personal device should, say, the employee leave a phone at a bar-- apparently a frequent occurrence in Silicon Valley. The start-up's technology is on well over a million devices. Its clients include Monsanto and the Boston Red Sox.Zenprise, which is seven years old, was about to raise another round of financing from venture capitalists when it began discussing a potential deal with Citrix. Citrix, which is familiar to chief information officers looking to streamline their desktop computing systems and to provide employees with ways to work remotely from home, has turned its focus to mobile offerings. In the last year, the company has expanded those offerings with applications for e-mail, calendars and productivity, as well as applications that traditionally were available only on desktop computers, like Excel, PowerPoint and those from SAP. With Zenprise, Citrix can wrap its mobile offerings in better security.""This is the first truly comprehensive mobile offering for the enterprise,"" Sumit Dhawan, a vice president and general manager at Citrix, said in an interview on  Tuesday. ""No one else has put together one solution that can be easily absorbed by customers.""Chief information officers are often frustrated by the fact that they are inundated by vendors but still have no universal remote device for corporate security, mobility and storage. Mr. Dhawan said he hopes the acquisition of Zenprise might provide such a universal remote.Amit Pandey, chief executive of Zenprise, said the start-up had not been looking to be acquired. He said company officials initially met with Citrix to explore partnerships.""We didn't really know Citrix had moved as far ahead in mobile management apps as they had,"" Mr. Pandey said. ""It started to become more and more clear that an acquisition made sense."" "
Panetta Warns Of Dire Threat Of Cyberattack,"Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned Thursday that the United States was facing the possibility of a ''cyber-Pearl Harbor'' and was increasingly vulnerable to foreign computer hackers who could dismantle the nation's power grid, transportation system, financial networks and government.In a speech at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York, Mr. Panetta painted a dire picture of how such an attack on the United States might unfold. He said he was reacting to increasing aggressiveness and technological advances by the nation's adversaries, which officials identified as China, Russia, Iran and militant groups. ''An aggressor nation or extremist group could use these kinds of cyber tools to gain control of critical switches,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''They could derail passenger trains, or even more dangerous, derail passenger trains loaded with lethal chemicals. They could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.''Defense officials insisted that Mr. Panetta's words were not hyperbole, and that he was responding to a recent wave of cyberattacks on large American financial institutions. He also cited an attack in August on the state oil company Saudi Aramco, which infected and made useless more than 30,000 computers.But Pentagon officials acknowledged that Mr. Panetta was also pushing for legislation on Capitol Hill. It would require new standards at critical private-sector infrastructure facilities -- like power plants, water treatment facilities and gas pipelines -- where a computer breach could cause significant casualties or economic damage.In August, a cybersecurity bill that had been one of the administration's national security priorities was blocked by a group of Republicans, led by Senator John McCain of Arizona, who took the side of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and said it would be too burdensome for corporations.The most destructive possibilities, Mr. Panetta said, involve ''cyber-actors launching several attacks on our critical infrastructure at one time, in combination with a physical attack.'' He described the collective result as a ''cyber-Pearl Harbor that would cause physical destruction and the loss of life, an attack that would paralyze and shock the nation and create a profound new sense of vulnerability.''Mr. Panetta also argued against the idea that new legislation would be costly for business. ''The fact is that to fully provide the necessary protection in our democracy, cybersecurity must be passed by the Congress,'' he told his audience, Business Executives for National Security. ''Without it, we are and we will be vulnerable.''With the legislation stalled, Mr. Panetta said President Obama was weighing the option of issuing an executive order that would promote information sharing on cybersecurity between government and private industry. But Mr. Panetta made clear that he saw it as a stopgap measure and that private companies, which are typically reluctant to share internal information with the government, would cooperate fully only if required to by law.''We're not interested in looking at e-mail, we're not interested in looking at information in computers, I'm not interested in violating rights or liberties of people,'' Mr. Panetta told editors and reporters at The New York Times earlier on Thursday. ''But if there is a code, if there's a worm that's being inserted, we need to know when that's happening.''He said that with an executive order making cooperation by the private sector only voluntary, ''I'm not sure they're going to volunteer if they don't feel that they're protected legally in terms of sharing information.''''So our hope is that ultimately we can get Congress to adopt that kind of legislation,'' he added.Mr. Panetta's comments, his most extensive to date on cyberwarfare, also sought to increase the level of public debate about the Defense Department's growing capacity not only to defend but also to carry out attacks over computer networks. Even so, he carefully avoided using the words ''offense'' or ''offensive'' in the context of American cyberwarfare, instead defining the Pentagon's capabilities as ''action to defend the nation.''The United States has nonetheless engaged in its own cyberattacks against adversaries, although it has never publicly admitted it. From his first months in office, Mr. Obama ordered sophisticated attacks on the computer systems that run Iran's main nuclear enrichment plants, according to participants in the program. He decided to accelerate the attacks, which were begun in the Bush administration and code-named Olympic Games, even after an element of the program accidentally became public in the summer of 2010.In a part of the speech notable for carefully chosen words, Mr. Panetta warned that the United States ''won't succeed in preventing a cyberattack through improved defenses alone.''''If we detect an imminent threat of attack that will cause significant physical destruction in the United States or kill American citizens, we need to have the option to take action against those who would attack us, to defend this nation when directed by the president,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''For these kinds of scenarios, the department has developed the capability to conduct effective operations to counter threats to our national interests in cyberspace.''The comments indicated that the United States might redefine defense in cyberspace as requiring the capacity to reach forward over computer networks if an attack was detected or anticipated, and take pre-emptive action. These same offensive measures also could be used in a punishing retaliation for a first-strike cyberattack on an American target, senior officials said.Senior Pentagon officials declined to describe specifics of what offensive cyberwarfare abilities the Defense Department has fielded or is developing. And while Mr. Panetta avoided labeling them as ''offensive,'' other senior military and Pentagon officials have recently begun acknowledging their growing focus on these tools.The Defense Department is finalizing ''rules of engagement'' that would put the Pentagon's cyberweapons into play only in case of an attack on American targets that rose to some still unspecified but significant levels. Short of that, the Pentagon shares intelligence and offers technical assistance to the F.B.I. and other agencies. "
Chinese Grad Student Hacks Indian Military Research Firms,"India's military preparedness and the possibility of defense breaches has dominated the news after Army chief V.K.. Singh's letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh surfaced recently calling India's weapons ""obsolete."" Amid a raging debate about who should be blamed for leaking the letter, India's cyber security is actually under attack, from a Chinese former graduate student who now works for Tencent, China's leading internet portal company. Areport released Friday by Trend Micro, a computer security firm, ""describes systematic attacks on at least 233 personal computers,"" Nicole Perlroth writes in The New York Times. ""The victims include Indian military research organizations and shipping companies; aerospace, energy and engineering companies in Japan; and at least 30 computer systems of Tibetan advocacy groups, according to both the report and interviews with experts connected to the research. The espionage has been going on for at least 10 months and is continuing, the report says."" The e-mail ""bait"" the hackers used to get access to computers is chilling: Each attack began, as is often the case, with an e-mail intended to lure victims into opening an attachment. Indian victims were sent an e-mail about India's ballistic missile defense program. Tibetan advocates received e-mails about self-immolation or, in one case, a job opening at the Tibet Fund, a nonprofit based in New York City. After Japan's earthquake and nuclear disaster, victims in Japan received an e-mail about radiation measurements. Each e-mail contained an attachment that, when clicked, automatically created a backdoor from the victim's computer to the attackers' servers. To do this, the hackers exploited security holes in Microsoft Office and Adobe software. Almost immediately, they uploaded a directory of the victims' machines to their servers. If the files looked enticing, hackers installed a remote-access tool, or rat, which gave them real-time control of their target's machine. As long as a victim's computer was connected to the Internet, attackers had the ability to record their keystrokes and passwords, grab screenshots and even crawl from that machine to other computers in the victim's network.Read the full article here.

Hacking of Tax Records Has Put States on Guard,"The theft of tax information from a South Carolina computer system appears to have been the largest cyberattack ever on a state government and has put other states on high alert, computer security experts say.The state announced late last month that an international hacker had stolen 3.6 million Social Security numbers and 387,000 credit and debit card numbers. Now tax departments across the country are inspecting their own security systems.''When one employee's laptop gets stolen, it's a big deal,'' said Verenda Smith, the deputy director of the National Federation of Tax Administrators. ''So you can imagine the reverberations when this news came out.'' Since 2005, at least 11 state tax agencies have faced security breaches, according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer rights group. But most were caused by internal accidents, not attacks, and none were on this scale.''As a cyberattack, this appears to be in a league of its own,'' said Beth Givens, the group's director.The hacking has raised questions about whether South Carolina was unprotected or simply unlucky. Most of the stolen credit cards were encrypted, but the Social Security numbers were not. The computer system that was hacked did not have a free layer of security monitoring offered to all South Carolina agencies, according to the State Budget and Control Board.In a lawsuit filed last Wednesday, a former state senator, John Hawkins, said the state had failed to protect taxpayers and had not reported the attack promptly. The tax agency detected the attack on Oct. 10 and, after notifying federal authorities, alerted the public on Oct. 26.''Obviously these hackers picked South Carolina because it was vulnerable,'' Mr. Hawkins said. ''I equate it to a burglar going into a neighborhood. He's going to break into the house with no alarms and the door open.''But South Carolina is hardly the first state to suffer a large-scale security breach. In Texas last year, Social Security records for 3.5 million people were inadvertently disclosed to the public on a computer server.In Georgia in 2007, a computer disk containing personal information on 2.9 million people disappeared. At the federal Veterans Affairs Department in 2006, an employee lost a laptop and an external hard drive containing the Social Security records of 26.5 million active-duty troops and veterans.Gov. Nikki R. Haley said that South Carolina had a state-of-the-art security system but that the hacker nevertheless found a way around it. Her office said on Friday that it was encrypting all tax files to reduce the harm if any were stolen, and that the process would be completed within 90 days. The state is paying up to $12 million to provide a free year of credit monitoring and identity theft prevention to anyone affected.Last Wednesday, the state disclosed that tax records for 657,000 businesses had also been hacked.Anyone who has filed a tax return since 1998 has been urged to contact state law enforcement officials. By last Thursday, 653,000 people had called the state's emergency hot line, and 521,000 had signed up for identity protection.Within state governments, tax agencies face the highest risk for hacking, said Larry Ponemon, the founder of a security research firm, the Ponemon Institute. If stolen, their data can be used for tax fraud, credit card fraud and identity theft.''This is the crown jewel for a cyberattacker: having the Social Security numbers, personal information and credit card for the same person,'' he said.After the attack, state tax agencies, including in California, said they were monitoring their security particularly closely.Michael Hicks, the director of the Maryland Cybersecurity Center at the University of Maryland, said states needed a clearer understanding of the attack in South Carolina.''The only way states can raise the level of vigilance,'' Mr. Hicks said, ''is if they really get to the bottom of what really happened in this attack.''

Elusive FinSpy Spyware Pops Up in 10 Countries," It is one of the more elusive commercial cyberespionage tools available. It is marketed as a way for governments to spy on criminals. And for over a year, virus hunters unsuccessfully tried to track it down. Now it is popping up across the globe, from Qatar to an Amazon server in the United States.FinFisher is a spyware product manufactured by the Gamma Group, a British company that sells surveillance technology. It says its spyware offers ""world-class offensive techniques for information gathering."" According to FinFisher's promotional materials, the spyware can be ""used to access target systems, giving full access to stored information with the ability to take control of the target system's functions to the point of capturing encrypted data and communications.""Security researchers who studied the spyware last month said it can grab images of users' computer screens, record their Skype chats, remotely turn on cameras and microphones, and log keystrokes. The Gamma Group markets FinFisher as a way for government law enforcement and intelligence agencies to keep track of criminals, but the researchers' findings suggested that it was being used more broadly.The spyware first attracted attention in March 2011 after protesters in Egypt raided the country's state security headquarters and found an offer to buy FinFisher for 287,000 euros, or $353,000. Then in May of this year, pro-democracy Bahraini activists, one in London, another in Washington and one in the Bahraini capital, Manama, started receiving suspicious e-mails, which they passed to a Bloomberg reporter.Bill Marczak, a computer science graduate student, and Morgan Marquis-Boire, a security researcher with the Citizen Lab of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, analyzed the e-mails and found evidence that they contained FinSpy, part of the FinFisher spyware tool kit. The term ""FinSpy"" itself appeared in the malware's code.The findings, published last month, suggested FinFisher technologies were being used for surveillance beyond suspected criminal activity. Martin J. Muench, the managing director of Gamma International, who develops the FinFisher line of products from Munich, did not respond to a request for comment, and a Gamma Group representative did not respond to e-mailed questions.  Mr. Muench told Bloomberg that his company did not sell FinFisher spyware to Bahrain, and said the malware might have been a stolen demonstration copy or reverse-engineered by criminals.But last week, security researchers at Rapid7, a security firm, took the earlier findings a step further. They studied the communication structure of the spyware and found that when they probed the I.P. address of a FinFisher-infected machine with unexpected data, it responded with a unique message: ""Hallo Steffi.""Rapid7 scanned the Internet to see if any other I.P. addresses returned the same message and found 11 I.P. addresses in 10 other countries: Indonesia, Australia, Qatar, Ethiopia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Mongolia, Latvia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.The I.P. address tied to FinFisher in the United States is hosted by EC2, Amazon's cloud storage service. Amazon did not respond to a request seeking further information about which customer was using its service to disperse the spyware. As of Monday afternoon, the spyware was still active on Amazon's service.Security researchers say their findings contradict Mr. Muench's suggestion that the FinSpy samples they found were stolen demonstration copies or had been repurposed by criminals. For one thing, the researchers say the samples are too fully featured to be demonstration versions. For another, they questioned why a company that licenses its product at such a high cost would not have the ability to disable unauthorized copies remotely.The researchers also said that the imbalance between the sophistication of the spyware and its distribution techniques contradicts Mr. Muench's version of events. The spyware, researchers say, is highly sophisticated, particularly in its obfuscation, which circumvents more than 40 antivirus products on the market. But the unsophisticated way in which it is distributed - in suspicious e-mails rather than through sophisticated or even well-known security exploits, and from easily traceable command-and-control servers - suggests that those who engineered the spyware are much more sophisticated than those who distributed it.""To steal a malware sample and re-engineer it with this level of encryption requires a set of skills that didn't show up in the infection methods,"" said Claudio Guarnieri, a researcher from Rapid7 who studied the samples.Researchers said it was still unclear whether the spyware was being distributed by governments. The I.P. addresses hosting FinSpy in Australia and Bahrain can be traced to Canberra and Manama, their respective capital cities, which would seem to support that claim. But the I.P. addresses in Latvia and Indonesia, for example, are not located in their capital cities.Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak said they were continuing to study the Bahraini samples and look for more. ""I suspect we will find a lot more,"" Mr. Marquis-Boire said. "
Careless Social Media Use May Raise Risk of Identity Fraud,"Users of social media who don't restrict the information they share online have a higher risk of identity fraud, a new report from Javelin Strategy & Research finds.The incidence of identity fraud in 2011 rose to about 5 percent of the adult United States population, up from roughly 4 percent the year before, the report found. But among Facebook users with public profiles, the rate was 7.5 percent, while users who accept ""friend"" requests from strangers had an even higher rate, of nearly 9 percent.The study defined a ""public"" profile as one that allows strangers to see personal information, including profiles open to ""friends of friends."" Roughly a quarter of Facebook users have public profiles, the study found.Fred Wolens, a spokesman for Facebook, dismissed the survey's findings, saying it doesn't reveal any higher risk of fraud among Facebook users because the percentages reported were within the survey's stated margin of error.  ""This survey doesn't prove anything,"" he said.He added that it is ""common sense"" that if you post about your dog using its name on Facebook, you probably shouldn't be using your dog's name as any sort of password.While there's no direct ""causation"" between using social media and identity fraud, the report found, the behavior of those participating is probably a factor. Information revealed in public profiles, including your full date of birth or your mother's maiden name or the name of your pet, is valuable to thieves because companies often use such information to verify your identity online. Nearly half of those with public Facebook profiles revealed their full birth date, including the year, compared with about a third of those with private profiles, the report found.""The proper use of privacy settings on social network profiles is essential to reconcile the connectivity of social media with the protection of personal information,"" the report said.A probable factor in the rise in identity theft in 2011, the report found, was an increase in reported data breaches, like those at Sony PlayStation and Epsilon. Fifteen percent of Americans were notified that their information was lost in a data breach in 2011, and those notified of a data breach are almost 10 times more likely to be an identity fraud victim than someone who wasn't notified, Javelin found. But, the report found, the dollar amount of the typical fraud incident is declining. ""Although fraud is more pervasive,"" the report said, ""it is less severe.""Smartphone users, too, face a higher risk, the report found, with nearly 7 percent of users experiencing fraud in 2011. Smartphone users' generally higher incomes may contribute to their higher risk, but behavioral factors may also play a role, the report found. For instance, a third of smartphone users store personal information on their phones, but only 16 percent have installed software that allows them to remotely wipe the device if it is lost or stolen.The report is based on survey conducted in October of 5,022 adults recruited by the survey firm Knowledge Networks, which uses address-based online sampling. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2 percentage points. (For a subset of questions asked of fraud victims, the margin of sampling error is 3 percent.)What steps do you take to guard your privacy when using social media? "
Nissan Is Latest Company to Get Hacked,"Nissan confirmed its computer systems were hacked two weeks ago.The Japanese automaker said that hackers broke into its network and stole employees' usernames and encrypted passwords. The company said it first noticed an abnormality on its network Friday, April 13, when it discovered a piece of malicious malware had targeted employees' log-in credentials and was transmitting them back to an outside computer server. Nissan did not say which employees had been targeted, what division they worked in or what the intruders may have been after. The company tracked the intrusions back to an Internet protocol address, but said it did not give much indication of who was behind the attack.""We do know the I.P. addresses but it really does not tell you a whole lot,"" said David Reuter, a Nissan spokesman. ""Hackers can bounce things off servers all over the world, so the entry I.P. address is not necessarily where the hack originates. The trail goes cold pretty quickly.""Nissan said it waited a week to disclose the attack to customers and employees while it closed open holes in its network and cleaned up its systems with the help of outside security consultants. On Friday, Andy Palmer, a Nissan executive vice president, disclosed the attack in a statement and said there was no indication any customer, employee or intellectual property data had been stolen.The attack is just the latest in a string of cyberattacks on corporations, the majority of which, experts say, go undisclosed or unnoticed.""There are two types of companies: companies that have been breached and companies that don't know they've been breached,"" Shawn Henry, the F.B.I.'s top former cyber cop who recently joined thecybersecurity start-up CrowdStrike,said in an interview. ""I've seen behind the curtain. I've been in all the briefings. I can't go into the particulars because it's classified, but the vast majority of companies have been breached.""Attributing the breaches back to specific actors can be difficult, Mr. Henry noted, but said ""The primary adversary is foreign intelligence services that are stealing corporate information.""Recently, American officials and security researchers have pointed the finger at China.""Japanese industry is very concerned about Chinese intruders, and now it appears names are coming to public notice,"" said Richard Bejtlich, the chief security officer at Mandiant Corporation, a leading incident response and computer forensics company.Last month, security researchers were able to trace a widespread computer attack on companies in Japan and India and on Tibetan activist groups back to specific hackers in China. And in December, the United States Chamber of Commerce confirmed that it, too, had been compromised by Chinese hackers.But, Mr. Henry noted, ""Dozens of countries have offensive cyber capabilities and cyberespionage plans in place. It's not just one particular country that is doing this."" "
A Law to Strengthen Our Cyberdefense,"Ashton B. Carter is the deputy secretary of defense and Jane Holl Lute is the deputy secretary of homeland security.WashingtonOVER the last decade, the United States has built a sophisticated security system to protect the nation's seaports against terrorists and criminals. But our nation's critical infrastructure is not similarly secured from cyberattack. Although we have made progress in recent years, Congressional action is needed to ensure that our laws keep pace with the electronically connected world we live in. The bipartisan Cybersecurity Act of 2012, currently before the Senate, offers a way forward.A disruption of our electric grid or other critical infrastructure could temporarily cripple the American economy. What's less well known is that such an attack could threaten the nation's defense as well. Ninety-nine percent of the electricity the military uses comes from civilian sources. Ninety percent of military voice and Internet communications travel over commercial networks. Much of the country's military logistics are handled by commercial shippers who rely, in turn, on privately managed networks.As we protect our ports and coastlines, so must we marshal resources and techniques to mount an adequate defense of our networks. Our port security is ensured by a combination of the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, state and local governments, and private shipping companies and port operators, with the support of the Navy and the intelligence agencies. Together, they patrol American waters, scan cargo, analyze and share information about threats to our coastlines, and report suspicious behavior to the proper authorities. If any of these layers were to be removed, our defenses would be weakened.Effective cybersecurity requires a similar multilevel approach. We have a final line of cyberdefense in the Defense Department's Cyber Command, which defends the nation against advanced cyberattacks, and we have a strong cyberintelligence system in the National Security Agency, which detects cyberthreats from overseas. But we need additional levels of defense to protect the nation's critical infrastructure.Collective problems require collaborative solutions. The government and private sector must work together to prevent cyberdisruption, cyberdestruction and theft of intellectual property. This requires robust sharing of information between the government and private sector, aggressive prosecution of cybercriminals, and cooperation among federal agencies.Simply put, the Cybersecurity Act would help by enabling the government to share information about cyberthreats with industry. The legislation would also permit the private sector to report cyberintrusions to the government or private companies. That ability would increase awareness of cyberthreats, while leaving the private sector in control of which information is shared. It would do all of this while protecting privacy and civil liberties, through robust oversight and accountability measures.None of us want to see heavy government regulation, especially of the Internet, the fount of so much innovation and economic productivity. The legislation would provide meaningful baseline cybersecurity standards for industry, developed and adopted through a joint industry-government process.Although the American economy needs effective cybersecurity measures to function and prosper, many providers of critical infrastructure have not invested in basic strategies to defend themselves against cyberthreats. Meaningful standards will help drive companies to invest and help fill the gaps in our nation's cyberdefenses.Finally, the Cybersecurity Act would ensure that the Department of Homeland Security has the ability to protect federal networks and assist the private sector effectively and efficiently, by strengthening the department's legal authority.The Department of Defense stands ready to support the Department of Homeland Security and any other agency in protecting the nation's critical infrastructure. Together, our two departments can bring our technical ability to bear and improve the nation's stock of cybersecurity tools and technology.This legislation is a critical step for defending America's infrastructure against the clear and present cyberthreats we face. We're not going to solve this problem overnight; it will involve a learning experience for both the private sector and the government, but we must learn fast, and develop solutions as quickly as possible. The legislation will help pave the way to American security and prosperity in the information age. It deserves the full support of Congress and the American people. "
"Risk and Riches in User Data: Opt-Out Provision Would Halt Some, but Not All, Web Tracking","Last Thursday federal regulators, members of advertising trade groups and technology companies gathered in Washington to announce new initiatives to protect consumers' privacy online.But, as it turns out, privacy is in the eye of the beholder.The Obama administration has pushed hard for a privacy bill of rights that would give consumers more control over what personal data is collected online and what limits would be placed on that data.The advertising and technology industries, which have been under pressure to do more to ensure privacy, said they would support a ''Do Not Track'' mechanism that would be clearly and uniformly adopted by browser vendors and would allow consumers to opt out of having some companies, but not all, keep data on their online activities.While the agreement would limit certain types of data collection, consumers would hardly be invisible on the Web. '' 'Do Not Track' is a misnomer. It's not an accurate depiction of what's going on,'' said Stuart P. Ingis, the head of the Digital Advertising Alliance, a trade group representing the advertising industry, which regards consumer behavior as crucial to its business. ''This is stopping some data collection, but it's not stopping all data collection.''Thursday's announcement was the administration's first digital initiative since the antipiracy legislation known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, was met with furious reaction from the technology industry last month, and eventually dropped.The issue of digital privacy, especially how users' data is collected online and then employed to show those users ads tailored to them, has been hotly debated for years.The announcements represent the attempt to satisfy consumer privacy concerns while not stifling the growth of online advertising, which is seen as the savior of media and publishing companies as well as the advertising industry. According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, digital advertising revenues in the United States were $7.88 billion for the third quarter of 2011, a 22 percent increase over the same period in 2010.The industry's compromise on a ''Do Not Track'' mechanism is one result of continuing negotiations among members of the Federal Trade Commission, which first called for such a mechanism in its initial privacy report; the Commerce Department; the White House; the Digital Advertising Alliance; and consumer privacy advocates.Until now, methods for opting out of custom advertising varied depending on the privacy settings of a user's browser or whether a user clicked on the blue triangle icons in the corners of some digital ads. Under the new system, browser vendors will build an option into their browser settings that, when selected, will send a signal to companies collecting data that the user does not want to be tracked.The agreement covers all the advertising alliance's members, including Google, Yahoo, AOL, Time Warner and NBCUniversal.Privacy advocates complain that the mechanism does not go nearly far enough in part because it affects only certain marketers. Many publishers and search engines, like Google, Amazon or The New York Times, are considered ''first-party sites,'' which means that the consumer goes to these Web pages directly. First-party sites can still collect data on visitors and serve them ads based on what is collected.''There's never been an expectation that all first-party data collection would be stopped,'' Mr. Ingis said.But third-party sites, which are networks that collect and use data to serve advertising tailored to the user, like DoubleClick (which is owned by Google); Advertising.com, owned by AOL; and a multitude of smaller ad networks would be restricted in the data they can collect on users if they select a Do Not Track option. Such companies would be limited to using data for purposes like market research and analytics but could not create detailed profiles on users or show them ads based on online behavior.Some consumer privacy advocates, while offering measured praise for the new privacy option, saw the move as an attempt to thwart a more restrictive stance on data collection. Jeffrey Chester, the head of the Center for Digital Democracy, which is pushing for more restrictions on data collection, called the move a win for the advertising lobby.In a statement, Mr. Chester said: ''We cannot accept any 'deal' that doesn't really protect consumers, and merely allows the data-profiling status quo to remain. Instead of negotiations, C.D.D. would have preferred the White House to introduce new legislation that clearly protected consumers online.''But advertisers have plenty to fear if consumers use Do Not Track in large numbers. ''If there's a high rate of opt-out, it's an issue,'' said George Pappachen, the chief privacy officer of the Kantar Group, the research and consultant unit of WPP. ''Our position is data should flow,'' Mr. Pappachen said, adding that data helps drive innovation and newer commercial models.Mike Zaneis, the senior vice president for public policy and general counsel of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, said large-scale adoption of the opt-out mechanism would have a severe effect on digital advertising networks and third parties that work with publishers to sell behaviorally targeted ads.''The reality is if you had 50-80 percent of consumers opting out it could have a really significant negative impact on the third-party ad model,'' Mr. Zaneis said. ''There is no eraser button for the Internet. But we can address consumers' concerns about having certain data about them collected, especially data for advertising and marketing.''Google, which is one of the biggest players in online advertising, would also be affected because it is both a first- and third-party publisher. The company earns most of its nearly $40 billion in revenue through search-related advertising, which would not be affected by Do Not Track.But its display advertising business, driven largely by its DoubleClick ad network, representing some $5 billion in revenue, is considered third party and could be affected. The company expects to have the Do Not Track option on its Chrome browser by the end of 2012.For advertisers, a lot will depend on how consumers respond. A recent study from the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press seemed to contain mixed signals on the issue: 56 percent of the respondents thought the government should not become more involved with regulating how Internet companies handle privacy issues. Yet 59 percent said collection of user data for targeted advertising was an unjustified use of a person's private information.And there are still unresolved technical issues regarding Do Not Track, including what defines tracking and how that would apply to first-party and third-party Web sites. Over the last few months the World Wide Web Consortium, an international group that sets voluntary technical standards for the Web, has been working with representatives from companies like Microsoft, Google and Nielsen, along with academics, privacy advocates, legislators and digital advertising groups, to define the technical standard of Do Not Track.The consortium is also considering whether sites like Facebook, whose ''like'' button is used across multiple Web sites, would be considered first-party or third-party sites.''I do think you will see a lot of contention going forward about what Do Not Track means,'' said Thomas Roessler, the technology and society domain leader at the consortium.Whether any companies should be allowed to collect data and follow users online, regardless of who they are, remains ''the million-dollar question,'' said Alex Fowler, the global privacy leader at Mozilla, the nonprofit organization that created the Firefox browser. Firefox was one of the first to include a Do Not Track option.''When you look at user testing, the expectation for the user for Do Not Track means, don't behaviorally target me and also don't collect information on me,'' Mr. Fowler said. "
Daily Report: New Rules on Anti-Terror Data Mining,"  The Obama administration is moving to relax restrictions on how counterterrorism analysts may retrieve, store and search through data on Americans that was gathered for purposes other than national security threats, Charlie Savage reports on Friday in The New York Times.Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. signed new guidelines on Thursday for the National Counterterrorism Center, which was created in 2004 to foster intelligence sharing and serve as a terrorism threat clearinghouse. The guidelines will lengthen to five years - from 180 days - the amount of time the center can retain private information about Americans when there is no suspicion that they are tied to terrorism, intelligence officials said. The guidelines are also expected to result in the center making more copies of entire databases and ""data mining them"" using complex algorithms to search for patterns that could indicate a threat.Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, voiced concerns about how the guidelines would interact with proposals to give the government greater access to telecommunications information in order to protect critical infrastructure from hackers. The new rules are silent about the use of commercial data - like credit card and travel records - that may have been acquired by other agencies.  "
A New Kind of Warfare,"Cybersecurity efforts in the United States have largely centered on defending computer networks against attacks by hackers, criminals and foreign governments, mainly China. Increasingly, however, the focus is on developing offensive capabilities, on figuring out how and when the United States might unleash its own malware to disrupt an adversary's networks. That is potentially dangerous territory. Such malware is believed to have little deterrent value against criminals who use computers to steal money from banks or spies who pilfer industrial secrets. But faced with rising intrusions against computers that run America's military systems and its essential infrastructure -- its power grid, for instance, and its telecommunications networks -- the military here (and elsewhere) sees disruptive software as an essential new tool of war. According to a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the 15 countries with the biggest military budgets are all investing in offensive cyber capabilities.The latest step occurred last month when the United States sent out bids for technologies ''to destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, corrupt or usurp'' an adversary's attempt to use cyberspace for advantage. The Air Force asked for proposals to plan for and manage cyberwarfare, including the ability to launch superfast computer attacks and withstand retaliation.The United States, China, Russia, Britain and Israel began developing basic cyberattack capabilities at least a decade ago and are still figuring out how to integrate them into their military operations. Experts say cyberweapons will be used before or during conflicts involving conventional weapons to infect an adversary's network and disrupt a target, including shutting down military communications. The most prominent example is the Stuxnet virus deployed in 2010 by the United States and Israel to set back Iran's nuclear program. Other cyberattacks occurred in 2007 against Syria and 1998 against Serbia.Crucial questions remain unanswered, including what laws of war would apply to decisions to launch an attack. The United States still hasn't figured out what impact cyberweapons could have on actual battlefield operations or when an aggressive cyber response is required. Nor has Washington settled on who would authorize an attack; experts see roles for both the president and military commanders. There is also the unresolved issue of how to minimize collateral damage -- like making sure malware does not cripple a civilian hospital.Another big concern is China, which is blamed for stealing American military secrets. Washington has not had much success persuading Beijing to rein in its hackers. There is a serious risk of miscalculation if, for example, there is a confrontation in the South China Sea. China could misinterpret a move, unleash a cyberattack and trigger a real cyberwar. What's clearly needed are new international understandings about what constitutes cyber aggression and how governments should respond. Meanwhile, the United States must do what it can to protect its own networks. "
Rethinking An Inquiry Of Google,"BERLIN -- European privacy regulators said Wednesday that they were considering reopening their inquiries into Google's collection of personal e-mails and Web searches for its Street View service. The move came after revelations that the activity had not been a lone programmer's error, and that others at the company had been told about it.Many regulators in Europe feel misled by Google in the matter, said Jacob Kohnstamm, a Dutch regulator who is the chairman of the top European privacy panel. He called for a stronger global response. ''It is time for data protection authorities around the world to work together to hold the company accountable,'' Mr. Kohnstamm said.Google executives, he said, had reassured European lawmakers, often in personal appearances, that the data collection, which was illegal in Europe, was unintentional and the work of one engineer working secretly.Google's collection of 600 gigabytes of personal data -- including e-mails, photos, Web histories and passwords -- from Wi-Fi routers worldwide was first uncovered in Germany in 2010. It prompted a series of inquiries in Europe and elsewhere.The data was obtained from unsuspecting households as cars photographing the streets for the company's Street View project drove by.All the overseas reviews except two in Germany -- one regulatory, one criminal -- were settled after Google apologized and blamed an error by the programmer for the incident.''We had been told that it was a simple mistake,'' said Johannes Caspar, the data protection commissioner for Hamburg, whose investigation first brought the illegal collection of Internet data to light. ''But now, we are learning that this wasn't a mistake and that people within the company knew this information was being collected. That puts it in a totally different light.''His office is still investigating, he said.In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission released a heavily redacted report on its inquiry, finding that Google had broken no American laws but had obstructed its investigation. Last Saturday, Google made available a largely unredacted version of the report that offered a fuller picture of what had happened.The unredacted report showed that the programmer, a Google engineer who lives in Palo Alto, Calif., told his colleagues in 2007 and 2008 that his software program would collect the so-called Internet payload data from unencrypted Wi-Fi routers.A Google spokesman in Hamburg on Wednesday repeated the company's previous statements: ''While we disagree with some of the statements made in the document, we agree with the F.C.C.'s conclusion that we did not break the law. We hope that we can now put this matter behind us.''Privacy regulators in Britain and in France said they would review the F.C.C. report to determine whether further action was called for.The French regulator, the National Commission for Computing and Liberties, or CNIL, is leading a European review of Google's new global data privacy policy, announced in January, which combines data collected from several Google services. It is currently analyzing Google's responses to 69 questions the French regulator sent the company this year.A person with knowledge of the review said it was likely that the French agency would include new questions about Google's collection of Wi-Fi data.In the United States, regulators had a milder reaction.At the Federal Trade Commission, which closed an investigation into Street View in late 2010 after the company asserted that the collection of data had been inadvertent, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to re-examine the issue.A spokeswoman for George Jepsen, the Connecticut attorney general, who is leading a multistate investigation of Street View, repeated earlier declarations that it was ''active and ongoing.''Google said last week that the Justice Department had cleared it of wiretapping. Both Google and the Justice Department declined to release the department's May 2011 letter closing the investigation.Mr. Caspar, the German regulator, said he thought that his European colleagues who had already settled with Google would have a hard time legally reopening their cases. Even the German criminal investigation could be thwarted by jurisdictional obstacles, he said.But Mr. Kohnstamm, the head of the top European privacy panel, known as the Article 29 Group, and the chairman of the Dutch Data Protection Authority, said that the new disclosures would be a topic of discussion among European regulators attending a convention in Luxembourg.''We will certainly discuss the matter,'' he said. ''My first reaction is, this is a bloody shame.''Mr. Kohnstamm recalled how in 2010, Google's global privacy counsel, Peter Fleischer, spoke at a hearing in the Netherlands on the incident.''Peter Fleischer made it pretty clear in his oral statement and in writing that it was the mistake of one single guy working at Google who had made a stupid mistake,'' Mr. Kohnstamm said. ''But apparently, it wasn't a mistake at all.''In a political sense,'' Mr. Kohnstamm continued, ''that would be considered contempt of Parliament and would mean the end of the career for the person responsible.''The unauthorized collection of Internet payload data, which the F.C.C. determined was not illegal in the United States, is a violation of European law, Mr. Kohnstamm said.Enforcement of privacy law in Europe is done on a national level, although a proposed revision to the European Data Protection Directive, which will not be completed until 2013 at the earliest, would give national regulators the power to fine violators up to 2 percent of annual sales. Based on Google's 2011 results, such a fine would amount to $758 million.Under existing law, European privacy regulators can impose only limited fines on global technology companies, even in egregious cases.The engineer at the center of the controversy, Marius Milner, lives in the United States, which could complicate efforts by German prosecutors to question him. The engineer invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to speak with officials at the F.C.C. "
Germany Reopens Privacy Inquiry Into Facebook's Archiving of User Photos,"BERLIN -- Data protection officials in Germany reopened an investigation into Facebook's facial recognition technology Wednesday, saying that the social networking giant was illegally compiling a huge database of members' photos without their consent.The data protection commissioner in Hamburg, Johannes Caspar, suspended the inquiry in June, but said he reopened it after attempts to persuade Facebook to change its policies had failed.''We have met repeatedly with Facebook but have not been able to get their cooperation on this issue, which has grave implications for personal data,'' Mr. Caspar said in an interview. The company's use of analytic software to compile photographic archives of human faces, based on photos uploaded by Facebook's members, has been problematic in Europe, where data protection laws require people to give their explicit consent to the practice.Instead of using such an opt-in system, Facebook requires them to opt out instead.The Hamburg regulator is demanding that Facebook destroy its photographic database of faces collected in Germany and revise its Web site to obtain the explicit consent of members before it creates a digital file based on the biometric data of their faces.Mr. Caspar, who led Germany's investigation into Google's illegal collection of personal Internet data during its Street View project, said he had met with Facebook executives several times on the issue since he opened his investigation in June 2011, but closed it a year later when Facebook appeared to be complying with his demands.In their meetings, Facebook representatives acknowledged that the company was compiling biometric data on users, Mr. Caspar said, but have maintained that the practice is legal in Ireland, where Facebook's European operation is incorporated.Mr. Caspar said he planned to end his investigation and make a formal request to Facebook to amend its practices by the end of September.Facebook said in a statement that it was not breaking European Union law with facial recognition software, which prompts members to ''tag,'' or identify, people in photos uploaded to the service.''We believe that the photo tag suggest feature on Facebook is fully compliant with E.U. data protection laws,'' the statement said. ''During our continuous dialogue with our supervisory authority in Europe, the Office of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, we agreed to develop a best practice solution to notify people on Facebook about photo tag suggest.''Irish officials appeared to dispute that view, and were concluding a second audit of the company's data protection practices. Gary Davis, Ireland's deputy data commissioner, said the agency was continuing its talks with Facebook and hoped to reach a settlement on obtaining a consent agreement and on the status of photo archives compiled from European users.Facebook, Mr. Davis said, had voluntarily agreed to suspend its tagging feature for all Europeans who join the network as of July 1. The situation for others ''remains under active discussion,'' he said.''Those discussions are continuing, and we remain hopeful that they will be concluded satisfactorily shortly.''European data protection officials have limited means to compel global companies like Facebook to alter their businesses to conform with local law.In Germany, Mr. Caspar could fine Facebook up to 25,000 euros, or about $31,000, should it refuse to destroy its biometric database and alter its consent practices.He could also sue Facebook and try to obtain a court order to compel it to alter its German operations. But establishing legal jurisdiction would be difficult, especially over a global online company with headquarters in the United States, said Ulrich Börger, a privacy lawyer in Hamburg with the law firm Latham & Watkins.''The fines are ridiculously small for a company the size of Facebook,'' Mr. Börger said. ''The most important thing for Facebook is the reputational risk.''Mr. Caspar said he was exploring that option but agreed that his staff had difficulty establishing jurisdiction over Facebook, which maintains that its activities at its German headquarters in Hamburg are limited to marketing activities, and not the technical and privacy-related functions relevant to Facebook's collection of biometric data.In March, in response to the dispute, the European Union's top advisory panel on privacy, the Article 29 Working Party, released an opinion that the collection of biometric data without the explicit consent of users was illegal.The decision by the privacy panel, which is made up of regulators from the 27 member countries of the European Union, prompted the Irish regulator to reopen its own negotiations with Facebook. After an audit of Facebook last year, the Irish regulator advised the company that it could simply inform people of its biometric data collection practices and Facebook did so on its Web site this year.But the decision by the European panel has increased pressure on Irish regulators to toughen their stance.Ciara O'Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Irish data protection agency, said that in September it planned to publish the results of an new audit of Facebook's privacy practices conducted last month."
Instagram Reversal Doesn't Appease Everyone,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook may have quelled a full-scale rebellion by quickly dumping the contentious new terms of use for Instagram, its photo-sharing service. But even as the social network furiously backpedaled, some users said Friday they were carrying through on plans to leave.Ryan Cox, a 29-year-old management consultant at ExactTarget, an Indianapolis-based interactive marketing software company, said he had already moved his photos to Flickr, Yahoo's photo-sharing app, where he could have better control. Mr. Cox said the uproar this week over whether Instagram owned its users' photos was ''a wake-up call.''''It's my fault,'' he continued. ''I'm smart enough to know what Instagram had and what they could do -- especially the minute Facebook acquired them -- but I was a victim of naïve optimism.''''Naïve optimism'' is as good a term as any for the emotion that people feel as they put their private lives onto social networks.Companies like Google, Twitter, Yelp and Facebook offer themselves as free services for users to store and share their most intimate pictures, secrets, messages and memories. But to flourish over the long term, they need to seek new ways to market the personal data they accumulate. They must constantly push the envelope, hoping users either do not notice or do not care.So they sell ads against the content of an e-mail, as Google does, or transform a user's likes into commercial endorsements, as Facebook does, or sell photographs of your adorable 3-year-old, which is what Instagram was accused of planning this week.''The reality is that companies have always had to make money,'' said Miriam H. Wugmeister, chair of Morrison Foerster's privacy and data security group.Even as Instagram was pulling back on its changed terms of service on Thursday night, it made clear it was only regrouping. After all, Facebook, as a publicly held corporation, must answer to Wall Street's quarterly expectations.''We are going to take the time to complete our plans, and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work,'' Kevin Systrom, Instagram's youthful co-founder, wrote on the company's blog.Instagram's actions angered many users who were already incensed over the company's decision earlier this month to cut off its integration with Twitter, a Facebook rival, making it harder for its users to share their Instagram photos on Twitter.Users were apprehensive that the new terms of service meant that data on their favorite things would be shared with Facebook and its advertisers. Users also worried that their photos would become advertising.Instagram is barely two years old but has 100 million users. Last spring, Facebook announced plans to buy it in a deal that was initially valued at $1 billion. The deal was closed in September for a somewhat smaller amount.For some users, Mr. Systrom's apology and declaration that ''Instagram has no intention of selling your photos, and we never did'' was sufficient.National Geographic, which suspended its account in the middle of the uproar, held a conference call with members of Facebook's legal and policy teams. Afterward, the magazine, which has 658,000 Instagram followers, said it would resurrect its account.Also mollified was Noah Kalina, who took wedding photographs earlier this year for Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. In a widely circulated post on Twitter, Mr. Kalina said the new terms of service were ''a contract no professional or nonprofessional should ever sign.'' His advice: ''Walk away.''On Friday, the photographer said he had walked back. ''It's nice to know they listened.''Kim Kardashian, the most followed person on Instagram, said on Tuesday that she ''really loved'' the service -- note the past tense -- and that the new rules were not ''fair.'' She had yet to update her 17 million Twitter followers on Friday, but since she is pushing her True Reflection fragrance it is a safe bet that she has forgiven and forgotten.Andy Benson, a creative director at a Philadelphia advertising service, was less conciliatory. He said it was not the fact that Instagram needed to monetize the service that bothered him, but the way it had done so.''Instagram was a social, creative tool,'' he said. ''But now that Facebook is involved, it felt reckless to suggest that they could sell user-created content for their own financial gain.''Mr. Benson added: ''The best advertising in the social media realm is a conversation -- it's not a monologue to the consumer. And that is what this felt like. 'Oh, we're going to let you use this tool, then take everything and sell it.' ''Mr. Cox had similar feelings. As the guardian for his 4- and 8-year-old nephews, he said he used the service to upload pictures of the boys and enjoyed the feedback of the ''likes'' he got through the service.''But the idea that a year from now a Disney ad could pop up on my friend's Facebook page featuring a picture of my nephew feels like a bad TNT daytime movie,'' he said. ''I want to be able to control what is out there.''The Electronic Frontier Foundation said on Friday that Instagram's newest privacy policy still came up short. The service no longer ''directly promises that private photos will remain private,'' it noted on its site. ''Instead, your privacy on Instagram is subject to future changes in the privacy settings options.''The privacy brouhahas that Facebook has been involved in, the foundation noted, have involved attempts to adjust settings ''in ways that meant your ability to keep some information private was no longer available.'' Facebook is operating under a consent decree with regulators.Facebook and Instagram declined to say Friday how many people were quitting the service despite the policy reversal. They took a common approach of Internet companies after a scrap with their users: pretend nothing happened and move on. Instagram's blog featured a post about how it now was available in 25 languages. Mr. Zuckerberg has not posted on his Facebook page since Tuesday. "
"In Latest Crackdown, China Toughens Rules on Internet Users","HONG KONG -- The Chinese government issued new rules on Friday requiring Internet users to provide their real names to service providers, while assigning Internet companies greater responsibility for deleting forbidden postings and reporting them to the authorities.The decision came as government censors have sharply stepped up restrictions on China's international Internet traffic in recent weeks. The restrictions are making it harder for businesses to protect commercial secrets and for individuals to view overseas Web sites that the Chinese Communist Party deems politically sensitive.The new regulations, issued by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, allow Internet users to continue to adopt pseudonyms for their online postings, but only if they first provide their real names to service providers, a measure that could chill some of the vibrant discourse on the country's Twitter-like microblogs. The authorities periodically detain and even jail Internet users for politically sensitive comments, such as calls for a multiparty democracy or accusations of impropriety by local officials.Any entity providing Internet access, including over fixed-line or mobile phones, ''should when signing agreements with users or confirming provision of services, demand that users provide true information about their identities,'' the committee ordered. In recent weeks, Internet users in China have exposed a series of sexual and financial scandals that have led to the resignations or dismissals of at least 10 local officials. International news media have also published a series of reports in recent months on the accumulation of wealth by the family members of China's leaders, and some Web sites carrying such reports, including Bloomberg's and the English- and Chinese-language sites of The New York Times, have been assiduously blocked, while Internet comments about them have been swiftly deleted.The regulations issued Friday build on a series of similar administrative guidelines and municipal rules issued over the past year. China's mostly private Internet service providers have been slow to comply with them, fearing the reactions of their customers. The committee's decision has much greater legal force, and puts far more pressure on Chinese Internet providers to comply more quickly and more comprehensively, Internet specialists said.In what appeared to be an effort to make the decision more palatable to the Chinese public, the committee also included a mandate for businesses in China to be more cautious in gathering and protecting electronic data.''Nowadays on the Internet there are very serious problems with citizens' personal electronic information being recklessly collected, used without approval, illegally disclosed, and even traded and sold,'' Li Fei, a deputy director of the committee's legislative affairs panel, said on Friday at a news conference in Beijing. ''There are also a large number of cases of invasive attacks on information systems to steal personal electronic information, as well as lawbreaking on the Internet through swindles and through defaming and slandering others.''Mr. Li denied that the government was seeking to prevent the exposure of corruption.''When citizens exercise these rights according to the law, no organization or individual can use any reason or excuse to interfere, and cannot suppress them or exact revenge,'' he said. ''At the same time, when citizens exercise their rights, including through use of the Internet, they should stay within the bounds of the Constitution and the laws, and must not harm the legitimate rights and interests of the state, society, the collective or of other citizens.''A spokesman for the National People's Congress said that 145 members of the committee voted in favor of the new rules, with 5 abstaining and 1 voting against them.The requirement for real names appeared to be aimed particularly at cellphone companies and other providers of mobile Internet access. At the news conference, an official from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Zhao Zhiguo, said that nearly all fixed-line services now had real-name registration, but that only about 70 percent of mobile phones were registered under real names.The authorities have made it harder in the last several years to buy a cellphone chip with a new phone number anonymously. New buyers are required to register with their identity documents before making international calls.''To implement the relevant requirements of this decision, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will improve its regulatory system and draft a detailed implementation plan to fully develop authenticated identity administration for telephone users,'' Mr. Zhao said.China's censors have begun blocking more foreign Web sites and, in recent weeks, have sharply stepped up the blocking of virtual private networks, or VPNs. A VPN is a tool for encrypted computer communication that is widely used by businesses and individuals in China to protect against prying by the government and state-owned enterprises, and to circumvent China's blocking of a long and lengthening list of overseas Web sites that cover subjects the government considers politically sensitive.The Chinese government has been experimenting over the past two years with ways to identify and block VPNs, said Xiao Qiang, the leader of a team of Chinese Internet researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. But the government did not begin deploying that capability on a considerable scale until September, and it has stepped up its use of blocking since then, particularly in the weeks leading up to the Communist Party's National Congress in early November, he said.Although many had expected the blocking of Web sites and VPNs to recede after the party congress, that has not happened. Mr. Xiao said that the Chinese blocking of VPNs was ''technically savvy and politically self-destructive,'' in that it may allow the authorities to more effectively monitor communications and interfere with the dissemination of politically sensitive information, but at a high price in terms of antagonizing computer users across China.Taken together, political analysts said, the various Internet moves suggest that while the new team of leaders selected at the party congress may be talking about reforms, including further opening of the economy to international competition, the new leaders remain very wary of freer political discourse, and may even pursue further restrictions.A review of search terms on Google, one way of tracking subjects of interest in China, shows a surge in searches for the term ''VPN'' that began in late August, peaked in early November at the start of the party congress and has stayed high ever since.Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader in the 1980s and 1990s, famously observed that in opening up the country's economy to the world after the Cultural Revolution, some ''flies'' would inevitably come in. Bill Bishop, a social media specialist based in Beijing, said that the latest policy moves suggested, ''They've got some very smart computer scientists trying to figure out how to keep the digital flies away.''

"How to ChangeThe Start-Up Routine" ,"Q. I installed the Windows 8 preview on an old laptop, but now the system won't start unless I have the DVD in the drive.A. When you installed the Windows 8 software on the computer from the DVD, the system may have been switched to start from the disc drive instead of the hard drive.Unless the drive is damaged, you can usually fix this by adjusting a setting in the computer's BIOS, or Basic Input/Output System, a bit of software built into the hardware. To do so, restart the PC and watch the screen for information about which key to press to change the start-up routine or adjust the BIOS. This key varies by manufacturer, but it is often the F2, F8, F10 or Delete key; your computer's manual should have instructions. Once you press the key and land on the text-based BIOS Setup Utility screen, use the keyboard's right arrow key to move to the Boot menu. Use the down arrow key to get to the Boot Device Priority area and hit the Enter key. Here, you can change the first boot device from the disc drive to the hard drive. Select the option from the on-screen menu to save the setting and exit the BIOS Setup Utility. The system should now start from the hard drive.Data SecurityFor the MacQ. I'm new to Macs. What is FileVault and do I need to use it?A. FileVault is a data security feature built into the Mac's OS X operating system. With FileVault, you can encrypt the Mac's hard drive to keep its contents locked with a passcode, even if someone gets access to your computer. FileVault can also encrypt the data on external drives and can be used to erase the Mac's hard drive before it is recycled.The necessity of FileVault depends on your personal need for file security and keeping your data confidential. You can get a better idea of how it might be useful from Apple's guide to the software at support.apple.com/kb/HT4790. Some versions of Windows include a similar feature called BitLocker (bit.ly/6dnxgJ).TIP OF THE WEEK Google's Android operating system and Apple's iOS software both include a Web browser that lets you save bookmarks. For sites you visit frequently, however, it is often faster to get to your favorite page with the mobile equivalent of a desktop shortcut -- an icon on the phone's home screen -- instead of fiddling around with the browser's bookmark menu.To save a bookmark as a Home screen icon on an Android phone, open the built-in browser app, press the menu button and choose Bookmarks. Find the bookmark that you'd like to add to your home screen and press down on it until a new menu appears. Tap the ''Add shortcut to Home'' option to place an icon for the bookmarked page on the Home screen.On an iPhone or other device running Apple's iOS 6 software, open the Safari browser and go to the page you wish to use. In the Safari toolbar (which is at the bottom of the screen on the iPhone and iPod Touch, but at the top of the screen on the iPad), tap the Share menu icon, which looks like an arrow bursting out of a rectangle. On the menu that appears, tap the ''Add to Home Screen'' option to create an icon that takes you back to the page with one tap from the home screen.

"British Police Say Climate E-mail Case Was Crime, While Giving Up the Chase","Apologies for the delay on this post, but I was out on the Hudson yesterday with ""River University"" students seining for fish and probing mud samples when the Norfolk Constabulary, the local British police force investigating the 2009 disclosure of e-mails and files from the University of East Anglia climate unit, finally officially deemed the incident a crime -- even as it closed the case, conceding that it was uncrackable.The news release ends with a paragraph that, in essence, says users of the Internet are on their own: Norfolk Assistant Chief Constable Charlie Hall, Protective Services lead, said: ""Online crime is a global issue. While law enforcement agencies continue to develop our response to emerging threats, it falls upon individuals and organizations to be alert to this and and take steps to mitigate risk as far as is practicable.""While unable to close in on suspects, the Norfolk police at least said they could confirm that the files were illegally extracted from outside the university:[A]s a result of our enquiries, we can say that the data breach was the result of a sophisticated and carefully orchestrated attack on the CRU's data files, carried out remotely via the internet. The offenders used methods common in unlawful internet activity to obstruct enquiries.There is no evidence to suggest that anyone working at or associated with the University of East Anglia was involved in the crime.Brandon DeMelle of DeSmogBlog, frustrated with what appears to be a pretty limp effort, began his post on the end of the investigation this way:""Our Priority is You,"" reads the tagline of the Norfolk Constabulary. The rest of the sentence ought to read, ""unless you are a climate scientist.""There have been indications of a continuing federal investigation in the United States, as described by some blogging climate science critics who received Department of Justice letters. But I wouldn't count on arrest warrants any time soon.This leads back to the importance of Chief Constable Hall's admonition about securing files and computer operations as well as can be done -- and the basic logic of putting something in an e-mail message on a matter of public import only if you wouldn't mind seeing it revealed in public.It's worth reviewing the thoughts expressed here in November, 2009, by Raymond T. Pierrehumbert of the University of Chicago and the (hacked) Real Climate blog. At the time he already saw this as a clear act of cyberterrorism, as described below, and expressed concern with my lack of indignation:[T]is illegal act of cyber-terrorism against a climate scientist (and I don't think that's too strong a word) is ominous and frightening. What next? Deliberate monkeying with data on servers? Insertion of bugs into climate models? Or at the next level, since the forces of darkness have moved to illegal operations, will we all have to get bodyguards to do climate science?Maybe reporters just like information to be out, even if it is illegally obtained. Certainly, I thought it was right to publish the Pentagon Papers. But when the attack is on an individual scientist rather than a government entity, and when the perpetrator is unknown and part of some shadowy anonymous network, it raises a lot of new concerns. [.]At that time, I was still blogging on the news side of The Times, and actively reporting on the story, which involved me because more than a dozen of my e-mail messages were in the disclosed material. I agree that the incident, particularly now that authorities have excluded non-criminal possibilities, is ""ominous and frightening."" I think a vigorous international investigation should be sustained.I also think it was a mistake for the administrators of the American blog Real Climate, which was clearly subjected to a computer hack at the same time back in 2009, not to file a formal complaint with the police.Overall, I don't see a case that the impacts for science and scientists are any different than those on people in other arenas -- from personal privacy and finance to business to the administration of public services and records -- where such intrusions are increasingly a reality.

Build Up Your Phone's Defenses Against Hackers,"Chuck Bokath would be terrifying if he were not such a nice guy. A jovial senior engineer at the Georgia Tech Research Institute in Atlanta, Mr. Bokath can hack into your cellphone just by dialing the number. He can remotely listen to your calls, read your text messages, snap pictures with your phone's camera and track your movements around town -- not to mention access the password to your online bank account.And while Mr. Bokath's job is to expose security flaws in wireless devices, he said it was ''trivial'' to hack into a cellphone. Indeed, the instructions on how to do it are available online (the link most certainly will not be provided here). ''It's actually quite frightening,'' said Mr. Bokath. ''Most people have no idea how vulnerable they are when they use their cellphones.''Technology experts expect breached, infiltrated or otherwise compromised cellphones to be the scourge of 2012. The smartphone security company Lookout Inc. estimates that more than a million phones worldwide have already been affected. But there are ways to reduce the likelihood of getting hacked -- whether by a jealous ex or Russian crime syndicate -- or at least minimize the damage should you fall prey. As cellphones have gotten smarter, they have become less like phones and more like computers, and thus susceptible to hacking. But unlike desktop or even most laptop computers, cellphones are almost always on hand, and are often loaded with even more personal information. So an undefended or carelessly operated phone can result in a breathtaking invasion of individual privacy as well as the potential for data corruption and outright theft.''Individuals can have a significant impact in protecting themselves from the kind of fraud and cybercrimes we're starting to see in the mobile space,'' said Paul N. Smocer, the president of Bits, the technology policy division of the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry association of more than 100 financial institutions.Cellphones can be hacked in several ways. A so-called man-in-the-middle attack, Mr. Bokath's specialty, is when someone hacks into a phone's operating system and reroutes data to make a pit stop at a snooping third party before sending it on to its destination.That means the hacker can listen to your calls, read your text messages, follow your Internet browsing activity and keystrokes and pinpoint your geographical location. A sophisticated perpetrator of a man-in-the-middle attack can even instruct your phone to transmit audio and video when your phone is turned off so intimate encounters and sensitive business negotiations essentially become broadcast news.How do you protect yourself? Yanking out your phone's battery is about the only way to interrupt the flow of information if you suspect you are already under surveillance. As for prevention, a common ruse for making a man-in-the middle attack is to send the target a text message that claims to be from his or her cell service provider asking for permission to ''reprovision'' or otherwise reconfigure the phone's settings due to a network outage or other problem. Don't click ''O.K.'' Call your carrier to see if the message is bogus.For added security, Mr. Bokath uses a prepaid subscriber identity module, or SIM, card, which he throws away after using up the line of credit. A SIM card digitally identifies the cellphone's user, not only to the cellphone provider but also to hackers. It can take several months for the cellphone registry to associate you with a new SIM. So regularly changing the SIM card, even if you have a contract, will make you harder to target. They are not expensive (about $25 for 50 of them on eBay). This tactic works only if your phone is from AT&T or T-Mobile, which support SIM cards. Verizon and Sprint do not. Another way hackers can take over your phone is by embedding malware, or malicious software, in an app. When you download the app, the malware gets to work corrupting your system and stealing your data. Or the app might just be poorly designed, allowing hackers to exploit a security deficiency and insert malware on your phone when you visit a dodgy Web site or perhaps click on nefarious attachments or links in e-mails. Again, treat your cellphone as you would a computer. If it's unlikely Aunt Beatrice texted or e-mailed you a link to ''Great deals on Viagra!'', don't click on it.Since apps are a likely vector for malware transmission on smartphones, Roman Schlegel, a computer scientist at City University of Hong Kong who specializes in mobile security threats, advised, ''Only buy apps from a well-known vendor like Google or Apple, not some lonely developer.''It's also a good idea to read the ''permissions'' that apps required before downloading them. ''Be sure the permissions requested make sense,'' Mr. Schlegel said. ''Does it make sense for an alarm clock app to want permission to record audio? Probably not.'' Be especially wary of apps that want permission to make phone calls, connect to the Internet or reveal your identity and location.The Google Android Market, Microsoft Windows Phone Marketplace, Research in Motion BlackBerry App World and Appstore for Android on Amazon.com all disclose the permissions of apps they sell. The Apple iTunes App Store does not, because Apple says it vets all the apps in its store.Also avoid free unofficial versions of popular apps, say, Angry Birds or Fruit Ninja. They often have malware hidden in the code. Do, however, download an antivirus app like Lookout, Norton and AVG. Some are free. Just know that security apps screen only for viruses, worms, Trojans and other malware that are already in circulation. They are always playing catch-up to hackers who are continually developing new kinds of malware. That's why it's important to promptly download security updates, not only from app developers but also from your cellphone provider.Clues that you might have already been infected include delayed receipt of e-mails and texts, sluggish performance while surfing the Internet and shorter battery life. Also look for unexplained charges on your cellphone bill.As a general rule it is safer to use a 3G network than public Wi-Fi. Using Wi-Fi in a Starbucks or airport, for example, leaves you open to hackers shooting the equivalent of ''gossamer threads into your phone, which they use to reel in your data,'' said Martin H. Singer, chief executive of Pctel, a company in Bloomingdale, Ill., that provides wireless security services to government and industry.If that creepy image tips you into the realm of paranoia, there are supersecure smartphones like the Sectera Edge by General Dynamics, which was commissioned by the Defense Department for use by soldiers and spies. Today, the phone is available for $3,000 only to those working for government-sponsored entities, but it's rumored that the company is working to provide something similar to the public in the near future. General Dynamics did not wish to comment.Georgia Tech Research Institute is taking a different tack by developing software add-on solutions to make commercially available phones as locked-down as those used by government agents.Michael Pearce, a mobile security consultant with Neohapsis in Chicago, said you probably did not need to go as far as buying a spy phone, but you should take precautions. ''It's like any arms race,'' he said. ''No one wins, but you have to go ahead and fight anyway.'' "
A Move to Investigate the Investigators in WikiLeaks Case," This much is known: In its hunt for information about three people it believes to be associated with the whistle-blower site WikiLeaks, the  Justice Department has sought to extract details about them and their communications on Twitter. What is not yet known is where else the Justice Department went looking. On Friday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation asked a federal court in Virginia to reveal the names of the other Internet companies from whom the Justice Department solicited information about the three people: Jacob Appelbaum, an American citizen; Birgitta Jonsdottir of Iceland; and Rop Gonggrijp of the Netherlands. Their case has become a testing ground for online privacy and speech, in part because the Justice Department sought the information without a search warrant in 2010. Instead, it relied on a 1994 law called the Stored Communications Act, and asked Twitter to release information about the three Twitter users. It sought, among other things, their Internet Protocol addresses, which identify and can give the location of a computer used to log onto the Internet. Twitter responded by informing the three about the government's request - and they, in turn, went to court. The petitioners argued that their I.P. addresses should be considered private information, and that this was unrelated to WikiLeaks. A federal judge in Virginia, Liam O'Grady, ruled against them last November, saying that the information sought by the government was relevant to a continuing ongoing investigation. The court also dismissed a petition to unseal the Justice Department's explanation for why it sought the account information. Earlier in January, the same judge refused to suspend the order pending an appeal, which meant that Twitter was required to furnish the data to the government. The only other window into the Justice Department's strategy came from a small  Internet service provider in Northern California called Sonic.net. It too received a request from the Justice Department for information on Mr. Appelbaum, one of its customers. Sonic successfully went to court so it could inform Mr. Appelbaum of the government's request. The brief filed Friday seeks to unseal court orders sent to other companies seeking information about the three people. Aden Fine, an attorney with the A.C.L.U., said in a statement, ""This case is just one example of the unfortunate recent trend to make our court processes less open and transparent."" "
Consumer Rights Group Says Google Broke its Promise,"Less than a year ago, Google made a deal with the government. It promised the Federal Trade Commission it would seek its users' consent before changing the way any Google products share personal information. On Wednesday, a consumer watchdog pressed the Federal Trade Commission to hold the Internet giant accountable to its promise. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, based in Washington, cited Google's recent announcement that it would combine the user data it collects from all of its different products, in effect compiling what an individual searches on Google with what is posted on YouTube, Google Plus and other Google properties. That, according to privacy information center, violates the agreement Google made with the government. It filed a lawsuit against the Federal Trade Commission in federal district court in Washington, asking the regulatory agency to enforce its original order. Google denied doing anything wrong with its policy change. It pointed out that it has been aggressively notifying users about the change, which is expected to go into effect March 1 and stands to give Google a far more comprehensive data about what its users are interested in. In an e-mail Wednesday, a Google spokesperson responded to the privacy information center by saying it was giving its users ""many opportunities and ample time to learn about our Privacy Policy change"" and offering ""choice and control over how people use Google services.""Google has already faced scrutiny from users and even members of Congress who questioned the implications of the change. In a blog post last week, Google countered: ""We want to make our users' experience seamless and easy by allowing more sharing of information among products when users are signed into their Google Accounts. In other words, we want to make more of your information available to you when you're signed into Google services."" The original Google agreement with the trade commission, in March 2011, came in response to a complaint filed by privacy information center. "
"Disruptions: So Many Apologies, So Much Data Mining"," Last week, Arun Thampi, a programmer in Singapore, discovered that the mobile social network Path was surreptitiously copying address book information from users' iPhones without notifying them.David Morin, Path's voluble chief executive, quickly commented on Mr. Thampi's blog that Path's actions were an ""industry best practice."" He then became uncharacteristically quiet as the Internet disagreed and erupted in outrage. Amid his silence, he did take the time to reply to the actress Alyssa Milano, who was one of hundreds who questioned Path's practices. (His reply to her via Twitter contained his personal e-mail address.)Mr. Morin seemed unconcerned about how people could be harmed by his company's carelessness. Consider this: Amira El Ahl, a foreign journalist covering the Middle East, said bloggers in Egypt and Tunisia are often approached online by people who are state security in disguise.The most sought-after bounty for state officials: dissidents' address books, to figure out who they are in cahoots with, where they live and information about their family. In some cases, this information leads to roundups and arrests.A person's contacts are so sensitive that Alec Ross, a senior adviser on innovation to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, said the State Department was supporting the development of an application that would act as a ""panic button"" on a smartphone, enabling people to erase all contacts with one click if they are arrested during a protest.Mr. Morin eventually did bow to pressure with an earnest apology on the company's blog. He said that Path would begin asking for permission before grabbing address books and that the company would destroy the data collected.And with that, the knife fight turned into a pillow fight. Mr. Morin, who declined to comment, was lauded and exonerated for any wrongdoing by his peers in Silicon Valley. On Twitter, he was repeatedly ""applauded"" and called a ""pro."" Christopher Sacca, a prominent angel investor, tweeted to Mr. Morin: ""Impressed by how you handled the privacy issue today.""Some even asked: What's the big deal anyway?The big deal is that privacy and security is not a big deal in Silicon Valley. While technorati tripped over themselves to congratulate Mr. Morin on finessing the bad publicity, a number of concerned engineers e-mailed me noting that the data collection was not an accident. It would have taken programmers weeks to write the code necessary to copy and organize someone's address book. Many said Apple was at fault, too, for approving Path for its App Store when it appears to violate its rules.David Jacobs, a fellow with the Electronic Privacy Information Center, noted that, once again, an Internet company showed a lack of understanding about the consequences of taking data.Lawyers I spoke with said that my address book - which contains my reporting sources at companies and in government - is protected under the First Amendment. On Path's servers, it is frightfully open for anyone to see and use, because the company did not encrypt the data.Mary Landesman, a senior security researcher at Cisco, says start-ups often do not build apps with security in mind: ""Attackers are like electricity; they like to follow the track of least resistance.""At Mr. Morin's last job at Facebook, his boss Mark Zuckerbergapologized publicly more than 10 times for privacy breaches.It seems the management philosophy of ""ask for forgiveness, not permission"" is becoming the ""industry best practice."" And based on the response to Mr. Morin, tech executives are even lauded for it. "
Google's New Privacy Policy: What to Do,"Google started its unified privacy policy on Thursday.The company has been telling users of its services - search, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps and Google Docs, among others - that information it collects about users will be compiled in a single dossier for its use.What does that mean to users and what should they do about it?Until Thursday, a record of a user's activity on Google's search engine was kept apart from the record of that user's activity on other Google properties.Google's search engine may have known a user was looking up sites about Jamaica, but it was not giving that information to YouTube or Google Maps, just as those sites were not sharing that user's activity with Google Search.Now it is. That is the big change. If you have a Google Account, your activity on one Google property is available to other Google properties.Some people do not like this, because Google's search engine is used for lots of activities, some of them personal, financial or medical.It is one thing to search for information about, say, a particular ointment. It may be jarring, however, to go to YouTube later and see that it has suggested toe fungus videos.If you would rather not have all of your Google-related activity sloshing around the ""Don't Be Evil"" empire, remedies are available. Some are simple, others laborious:¶ You can delete your search history and prevent Google from using it for advertising purposes in the future.To do this, sign in to your Google Account and go to google.com/history.You will see two buttons: ""Pause"" and ""Remove All Web History."" If you click on ""Remove all Web History,"" you have not only deleted what you have looked up in the past, you have also turned off any tracking of your search history by Google in the future.¶ If you really want to keep your activity on various Google sites segregated from one another, you could set up a separate user account for each service - one for Gmail, one for YouTube and so on.The problem is that you will need a different e-mail address for each account, and managing all of them could be annoying, particularly if you log into one Google service and then click on a link to another without first having logged out and re-entered under a different account. (Even describing that procedure was time-consuming; imagine having to do it all the time.)¶ If you do not want Google to use your search history to help determine what ads the company shows you, you can opt out by going to google.com/ads/preferences.Doing so, however, affects only the computer you are using. You must perform the opt-out procedure on every other computer you use.This will not affect how Google sites share your activity with one another, nor will it reduce the number of advertisements you see.But it will make those ads less relevant - or less creepy - depending on your feelings about the issue.

Companies Raise Concerns Over Google Drive's Privacy Protections,"5:50 p.m. | Updated Added more explanation form Google about the terms of service agreement. A number of companies are raising concerns about what Google says it can do with documents stored on the new Google Drive online storage service.On Tuesday, Google Drive began offering 5 gigabytes of free storage of documents, pictures, video, and other digital goodies. Google executives said that customers could avail themselves of built-in Google technologies like character recognition, visually based image search and video encoding for multiple formats, including Google's YouTube.Critics pointed out that Drive, like any Google product, would fall under Google's terms of service, which let Google scan and use its consumers' content for Google's own purposes. Load a sensitive corporate document onto Drive and Google would be within its rights to read it. The Verge Web site pulled out language from the service agreements of Dropbox and Microsoft's Skydrive service that were considerably more sensitive to concerns over privacy and intellectual property rights.For example, one section of Google's terms of service agreement says:When you upload or otherwise submit content to our services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content.Companies, The New York Times among them, advised employees not to use Drive or Gmail for company content until Google clarified how its policies might affect corporate information.Kent Walker, Google's general counsel said, ""People shouldn't come to the conclusion that we're doing nefarious things. We, Facebook and Microsoft are all trying to do similar things. The terms of service are trying to cover what is inherent in Web-based services.""Google executives seemed puzzled by the concern, saying that the same policies had applied to services like Gmail for years, and actually did not differ much from those of competitors. ""It's not very different from policies at Dropbox, Box.Net, or Microsoft,"" said Jill Hazelbaker, a Google spokeswoman. The company also said that the terms of service in Google's Apps for Business service prevent it from developing products from scanning corporate content. Policies at all these companies, as well as Facebook and others, allow companies to scan personal data and use it to improve products or build new ones. Dropbox says personal information may be used ""to provide and improve our service"" and ""to personalize and improve your experience."" Microsoft and Facebook also talk about using personal data to build their products.Having confidence and trust in Google is important to Google's strategy of convincing corporations to buy Google products to process documents and store them. At a security conference last month at Stanford University, Joe Sullivan, Facebook's chief security officer, said that ""owners of data in the cloud are going to start insisting on more control,"" adding that ""Google Docs is a great collaborative tool. It works well. But if you're Facebook do you want all your documents sitting on one of your biggest competitor's servers?""Every online e-mail and storage service, at minimum, scans for viruses and makes backup copies of user data. The scale at which Google operates, however, and the number of features it offers, may affect how it is seen. The prospect of fresh petabytes of data inside Google, where Google has broad license to experiment, may provide renewed scrutiny about what Google does with data. The content of e-mails that people write in Gmail is machine scanned to place ads, for example, but it is not broadly understood that so also are e-mails sent into a Gmail account from other service providers.Google executives say that the ability to look at people's stuff is precisely how they are able to create many of the products on which people rely. ""We don't take personal information and use it in a way that we don't represent to the user,"" said Sundar Pichai, senior vice president for Chrome and Apps at Google, who headed the release of Drive.Mr. Pichai noted that Google services like language translation, spell check and others depend on scanning large amounts of content, including what people load into Google's servers. ""This is all read by machines,"" Mr. Pichai said. ""Spell check identifies patterns across many languages; it doesn't say, 'this person likes to spell things this way.'""At least one privacy advocate called Google's terms of service standard. ""Every time a company updates their terms of service-- or posts a new one-- users end up being shocked by the language that describes a company's right to use your information,"" said Jules Polonetsky, director at the Future of Privacy Forum. ""But it does not appear that Google claims ownership of your data. This is just the annual, fire alarm when users actually look at the legalese needed to describe a company's right to host your data for you.""Even at that, these terms have long made some executives uncomfortable about corporate uses of Google Apps for Business, which includes Gmail. ""Consumers can make individual choices. Businesses have a different view of the content they are distributing,"" said Zach Nelson, chief executive at NetSuite, an online provider of business software.Mr. Nelson said, ""we have contracts with customers about protecting the information they give us, and Google would scan that content. You can't be sure about the point at which the machine is using that information."" In addition, he noted, as a public company there was some concern by some lawyers about NetSuite's financial information being scanned for content, not just viruses, on Google's servers.""If companies want to use the cloud, I don't think we are doing anything we don't see others doing,"" said Mr. Pichai. ""When we walk into a company to talk about Google Apps for Business this is not an issue we have."" "
European Regulator Warns Silicon Valley About Privacy,"The European data protection supervisor, Peter Hustinx, on Thursday urged technology companies to ""innovate"" in the area of consumer privacy, saying that lawmakers on the continent would press ahead on a contentious proposed law that would, in part, compel companies to pare down the personal data kept in their digital vaults. ""It really is based on the idea that when there is not good enough reason to keep the data, it should be deleted,"" Mr. Hustinx told a conference on digital privacy, sponsored by the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, which is part of the University of California at Berkeley School of Law. ""When data have been published or have been shared and it is within your power to get them back, you have to make reasonable effort to get the spirit back in the bottle,""he said.The European Commission proposed earlier this year a wide ranging new law designed to protect personal data online. It has met with strong resistance from some Silicon Valley companies on the grounds that it would be costly, logistically difficult and a hindrance to innovation. One of the most contested parts of the law, known as the right to be forgotten, would allow consumers to demand that personal data, from shopping records to photographs, be deleted forever. The proposed E.U. law would impose stiff fines on companies that break the law. The daylong privacy conference repeatedly raised the question of the value of privacy, with Michael Hintze, a lawyer for Microsoft, pointing out that despite privacy flaps at companies like Facebook, Google and Microsoft, no company seems to have lost market share as a result. ""A company may get bad press on privacy but large numbers of its customers aren't leaving in droves,"" he said.  Mr. Hustinx was undeterred. ""It is true that people behave sometimes in a different manner,"" he said. ""But we get continued, strong feedback for stronger protection.""  "
Consumers Say No to Mobile Apps That Grab Too Much Data,"The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday nudged application developers to take steps to protect consumer privacy. But many consumers seem to be already taking steps to guard their personal information from data-grabbing apps.A study by the Pew Research Center, released Wednesday, found that among Americans adults who use smartphone apps, half had decided not to install applications on their mobile phones because they demanded too much personal information. Nearly a third uninstalled an application after learning that it was collecting personal information ""they didn't wish to share."" And one in five turned off location tracking ""because they were concerned that other individuals or companies could access that information."" A customer's whereabouts can be extremely valuable to marketers trying to sell their wares, or government authorities trying to keep tabs on citizens' movements.The study seems to suggest a deepening awareness of digital privacy. And it contradicts a common perception that the generation of young Americans who have grown up in the Internet age blithely share their personal details. Mobile phone users between ages 18 and 29 were equally likely to decline an application because of privacy concerns as older Americans, even though the younger group was more likely to use applications in the first place. Nearly half of all those interviewed said they downloaded apps on their phones.The Pew study also suggested that consumers were taking steps to safeguard their information. Four out of five smartphone owners backed up their data and half cleared their browsing histories.The results come from a survey conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates earlier this year of 2,254 adults. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.The proliferation of mobile apps has lately given rise to regulatory scrutiny. In California, the state attorney general's office has persuaded many of the largest companies that distribute applications on their platforms to make sure that their privacy policies are clearly displayed. The F.T.C., which is responsible for enforcing consumer rights, earlier this year concluded that applications directed at children were not sufficiently clear about how they used the data they collected.On Wednesday, the commission published its recommendations for application developers: Among other things, it suggested that companies seek their customers' ""express agreement"" for data they collect and share.

Larry Page Defends Google's Privacy Policy,"Even though European regulators want it changed, Google's current privacy policy is necessary for the company to be able to create new products that know more about Google users, Larry Page, the company's chief executive, said Tuesday.""Virtually everything that we want to do, I think, is somewhat at odds with locking down all of your information for uses you haven't contemplated yet,"" Mr. Page said. ""That's something I worry about.""Mr. Page spoke at Google's annual Zeitgeist sales conference in Paradise Valley, Ariz., the same day that European privacy regulators sent him a letter requesting that Google make significant changes to its privacy policy or risk fines or other penalties.He said he was ""sad"" that regulators have tried to restrict certain types of online data collection, when nobody knows how the Internet will function in a decade.The policy under consideration, which was announced in January and took effect in March, says that for people logged in to a Google account, Google can use information shared on one service in other Google services. For example, Google could show people an ad on YouTube based on what they have searched for in the search engine, or correct the spelling of a friend's name in a Google search based on information gleaned from Gmail.Mr. Page said that recent Google products would not be possible without the policy. His example was a new product for Android called Google Now, which can do things like alert you that you need to leave to avoid being late for a meeting based on information from your calendar, your phone's current location and traffic conditions.Google plans to introduce similar products using information made accessible by the new privacy policy, he said, like one that could instruct your phone that it is not a good time to interrupt you if you are in an important meeting.""That's almost a trivial thing to know, but for us, solving that problem requires changing our privacy policy, which we've now done,"" he said. ""And now you'll see those kinds of things roll out.""European regulators asked Google to more clearly explain which data it collects and how it uses it, and to more easily allow people to opt out, among other requests.In a statement, Google said, ""We are confident that our privacy notices respect European law."" A person familiar with Google's perspective said that the company breathed a sigh of relief when the European decision arrived, because it had expected a much harsher penalty, like a fine and charges that Google broke the law.In the United States, consumer privacy groups loudly protested Google's new privacy policy when it was announced, and one, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, filed suit to try to make the Federal Trade Commission block it. A judge dismissed that complaint and the F.T.C. has not said it is investigating Google's policy.In the meantime, Google has faced other privacy penalties in the United States, including a $22.5 million fine in August over showing ads to Safari users.Marc Rotenberg, president of E.P.I.C., said that for all the privacy uproars that accompany new features introduced by Google and other Web companies, the new privacy policy was most controversial.""This is the Google issue of 2012,"" Mr. Rotenberg said.The European decision was minimal, but left the door open for future enforcement, Mr. Rotenberg said.""Google bought some time,"" he said. The message from European authorities, he said, was, ""We've been through this before, with companies like Facebook, and they responded. If you choose not to respond, you do so at your own risk.""Google has shown new found caution when it releases new products and seems acutely aware that moving too quickly might raise red flags among privacy advocates and users. For example, in August, it introduced a feature to show personal Gmail messages in search results, but only for the first million people who signed up. On Monday, it opened the feature to anyone, but still limited it to people who sign up. "
"More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds","The number of trackers collecting data on users' activities on the most popular Web sites in the United States has significantly increased in the last five months, according to research from the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley.The Berkeley project, called the ""Web Privacy Census,"" aims to measure online privacy by conducting periodic web crawls and comparing the number of cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.During a test conducted on Oct. 24, researchers encountered cookies on every site included in a list of the 100 most popular sites compiled by Quantcast, an analytics and audience targeting firm.On those 100 sites, researchers found 6,485 standard cookies last month compared with 5,795 cookies in May. In both months, third party trackers, not the Web sites themselves, set a majority of those cookies, the report said.In October and May, cookies placed by DoubleClick, Google's ad technology service, appeared on the most sites on the top 100 list. ScorecardResearch, an analytics unit of comScore, was the second-most-prevalent tracker, the researchers reported.The number of cookies on the top 1,000 and 25,000 Web sites also increased significantly, researchers said.""More popular sites are using more cookies,"" the report said.The Berkeley study comes at a time of fierce debate among federal regulators, advertising associations and consumer advocates over how best to regulate online tracking. Marketers advocate self-regulation, allowing consumers who wish to opt out of receiving ads based on data-mining to use an already-established industry program. Some consumer advocates are pushing for federal regulation as well as a ""Do Not Track"" mechanism that would allow Internet users to control tracking through settings on their own computer browsers. Chris Hoofnagle, the director of information privacy programs at the Berkeley center and co-author of the study, said he hoped the data would set a baseline, providing all sides in the debate with empirical information as to the optimum method to regulate tracking.""I'm hoping that it will inform which approach is the best,"" Mr. Hoofnagle said. ""We are not going to be well-served unless we measure these trends more rigorously."" "
How Careful Are You Online?," The director of the C.I.A., David H. Petraeus, resigned last week after the Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered he was having an extramarital affair.  The F.B.I. began by investigating a civilian e-mail harassment case, but, as the bureau reviewed thousands of pages of private e-mails, the scandal widened - to General Petraeus and others. While this scandal raises many questions about ethics, it also raises questions about online privacy and expectations of privacy.     How careful are you about what you post and write on the Web?In ""Online Privacy Issue Is Also in Play in Petraeus Scandal,"" Scott Shane writes:On the Internet, and especially in e-mails, text messages, social network postings and online photos, the work lives and personal lives of Americans are inextricably mixed. Private, personal messages are stored for years on computer servers, available to be discovered by investigators who may be looking into completely unrelated matters.  The hazards of the Web as record keeper, of course, are a familiar topic. New college graduates find that their Facebook postings give would-be employers pause.

"Daily Report: Apps for Children Fall Short on Disclosure to Parents, Report Says","Natasha Singer reports in The New York Times about a new federal report that says hundreds of the most popular educational and game mobile apps for children fail to give parents basic explanations about what kinds of personal information the apps collect from children, who can see that data and what they use it for. The apps often transmit the phone number, precise location or unique serial code of a mobile device to app developers, advertising networks or other companies, according to the report released on Monday by the Federal Trade Commission. Regulators said such information could be used to find or contact children or track their activities across different apps without their parents' knowledge or consent.The agency reviewed 400 of the most popular children's apps available on Google and Apple platforms, and reported that only 20 percent disclosed their data collection practices.""The survey results described in this report paint a disappointing picture of the privacy protections provided by apps for children,"" the report said.Regulators said they were investigating whether the practices of certain apps violated a federal law requiring Web site operators to get parents' permission before collecting or sharing names, phone numbers, addresses or other personal information obtained from children under 13.The report comes as the agency is preparing to strengthen those protections by requiring site operators to obtain parental consent before collecting many other kinds of personal information from children. But over the last few months, the agency's efforts have met with opposition from Apple, Facebook, Google and Viacom as well as from technology associations and marketing industry groups, who say the agency's proposed solution is so broad that it could inhibit companies from offering sites, apps and other services for children.

What Instagram's New Terms of Service Mean for You," Instagram released an updated version of its privacy policy and terms of service on Monday, and they include lengthy stipulations on how photographs uploaded by users may be used by Instagram and its parent company, Facebook.The changes, which will go into effect Jan. 16, will not apply to pictures shared before that date.Facebook and Instagram have both hinted at plans to incorporate advertisements into Instagram's application, although they have declined to provide details about how and when ads would be deployed. These freshly drafted terms give the first glimpse of what the companies might have planned. Here's a quick rundown of what the new terms, the most significant changes in Instagram's short history, could mean for users.  1. Instagram can share information about its users with Facebook, its parent company, as well as outside affiliates and advertisers.  Instagram said that the changes to its privacy policy are a means to help Instagram ""function more easily as part of Facebook by being able to share info between the two groups."" The potentially lucrative move will let advertisers in Facebook's ad network use data and information that users have shared on Instagram, like details about favorite places, bands, restaurants or hobbies, to better target ads at those users. 2. You could star in an advertisement -- without your knowledge.  A section of the new terms of service, titled ""Rights,"" notes that Instagram will also be able to use your photographs and identity in advertisements. ""You agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you,"" the new terms say. This means that photographs uploaded to Instagram could end up in an advertisement on the service or on Facebook. In addition, someone who doesn't use Instagram could end up in an advertisement if they have their photograph snapped and shared on the service by a friend. Facebook already runs ads that make use of people's activity on its site.Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington, said that the use of a person's likeness in ads could run into some state laws protecting people's privacy.""Most states have laws that limit the use of a person's 'name or likeness' for commercial purposes without consent,"" Mr. Rotenberg said. ""The legal purpose is to allow people to obtain the commercial value of their images and endorsements, which is a big issue for celebrities and others, but also a reasonable concern for Facebook users whose images are used by Facebook to encourage friends to buy products and services."" 3. Underage users are not exempt. Athough Instagram says people must be at least 13 years old to sign up for the service, the new terms note that if a teenager signs up, they are agreeing that a parent or guardian is aware that their image, username and photos can also be used in ads. 4. Ads may not be labeled as ads. In another section of the updated terms, the company says ads will not necessarily be labeled as ads. ""You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such,"" the company wrote. 5. Want to opt out? Delete your account.  The only way to opt out of the new Instagram terms is to not use the service. If you log into Instagram in any way, including through the Web site, mobile applications or any other services offered by Instagram, you agree to have your content used in ads. Instagram's new terms of service say that ""by accessing or using the Instagram website, the Instagram service, or any applications (including mobile applications) made available by Instagram (together, the ""Service""), however accessed, you agree to be bound by these terms of use.""Instagram addressed the changes on its company blog, saying that ""nothing has changed about your photos' ownership or who can see them."" In its blog post, Instagram said the changes would primarily help the company combat spam, which has plagued the application as it has swelled in popularity.""Our updated terms of service help protect you, and prevent spam and abuse as we grow,"" the company wrote.

When GPS Tracking Violates Privacy Rights,"For the right to personal privacy to survive in America in this digital age, courts must be meticulous in applying longstanding privacy protections to new technology. This did not happen in an unfortunate ruling last month by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The case concerned a drug conviction based on information about the defendant's location that the government acquired from a cellphone he carried on a three-day road trip in a motor home. The data, apparently obtained with a phone company's help, led to a warrantless search of the motor home and the seizure of incriminating evidence.The majority opinion held that there was no constitutional violation of the defendant's rights because he ''did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the data given off by his voluntarily procured pay-as-you-go cellphone.''The panel drew a distinction between its ruling and a ruling by the Supreme Court last January in United States v. Jones, which held that the placement of a hidden device on a suspect's car without a valid warrant violated the Fourth Amendment. The three-judge panel said that its case, in contrast, did not involve physical trespass on the suspect's private property. The judges also asserted that the tracking in the case before them was not sufficiently ''comprehensive'' to be ''unreasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes'' and trigger the need for a warrant -- even though the police tracked the defendant's every move for three days, hardly a negligible time period.The Jones case suggests that the Supreme Court's future direction may be more protective of privacy in cases involving new and potentially invasive technologies. In two concurring opinions in that case, a majority of justices agreed that ''longer-term'' GPS monitoring impinged on expectations of privacy.As Justice Sonia Sotomayor stressed in her concurrence, ''GPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person's public movements that reflects a wealth of detail about her familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.'' If anything, tracking someone using cellphone GPS capabilities is even more invasive than following someone with a GPS device attached to a car since it allows for 24/7 coverage. Most people carry their phones wherever they go, including into their homes.The circuit court panel majority concluded that because the defendant's phone emitted information that could be picked up by law enforcement agents, he had no reasonable expectation of privacy and thus no warrant was needed to conduct the surveillance. This was at odds with yet another Supreme Court ruling, in 2001, involving a thermal-imaging device aimed at a private home from a public street.Carrying a cellphone should not obliterate privacy rights or the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. The full Sixth Circuit should grant a pending request for a rehearing and reverse the panel's damaging ruling. "
Senators Question Employer Requests for Facebook Passwords,"Two Democratic senators are asking Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to investigate whether employers asking for Facebook passwords during job interviews are violating federal law, their offices announced Sunday. Troubled by reports of the practice, Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said they were calling on the Justice Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to begin investigations. The senators are sending letters to the heads of the agencies.The Associated Press reported last week that some private and public agencies around the country were asking job seekers for their social media credentials. The practice has alarmed privacy advocates, but its legality remained murky.On Friday, Facebook warned employers not to ask job applicants for their passwords, presumably so they could view applicant profiles on the site. The company threatened legal action against applications that violated its longstanding policy against sharing passwords.A Facebook executive cautioned that if an employer discovered that a job applicant is a member of a protected group, the employer might be vulnerable to claims of discrimination if it did not hire that person.Personal information such as gender, race, religion and age are often displayed on a Facebook profile -- all details that are protected by federal employment law.Not sharing passwords is a basic tenet of online conduct. Aside from the privacy concerns, Facebook considers the practice a security risk.''In an age where more and more of our personal information -- and our private social interactions -- are online, it is vital that all individuals be allowed to determine for themselves what personal information they want to make public and protect personal information from their would-be employers. This is especially important during the job-seeking process, when all the power is on one side of the fence,'' Mr. Schumer said in a statement.Specifically, the senators want to know if the practice violates the Stored Communications Act or the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Those two acts, respectively, prohibit intentional access to electronic information without authorization and intentional access to a computer without authorization to obtain information.The senators also want to know whether two court cases relating to supervisors asking current employees for social media credentials could be applied to job applicants.The senators said they were writing a bill to fill in any gaps not covered by current laws. "
An Alert System for Security Breaches,"It was, no doubt, the year of the security breach.Hackers breached LinkedIn, LastFM.com, eHarmony, Yahoo and other sites, then posted customers' usernames, passwords, e-mail addresses and device IDs to the Internet for all to see. In most cases,  the consumers had to dig through hackers' data dumps to find out what, if any, of their information had been compromised, then scurry to change their log-in credentials across many sites.Now, with breaches on the rise, some companies have started offering customers new services to save them the trouble. LastPass, a service for managing passwords, said on Tuesday that it had partnered with PwnedList, a database of leaked usernames and passwords, to alert customers if a Web site was breached and if their information was included in the data dump.The company will perform daily scans of PwnedList's database of 24 million (and growing) publicly leaked usernames and passwords and alert customers by e-mail if a domain was breached, if their log-in information was compromised and if they used the same password for the breached Web site elsewhere. In a blog post, LastPass said it planned to offer its alert system, called LastPass Sentry,  free.A similar service for potentially more sensitive information -- like credit card and Social Security numbers -- is available through AllClearID, an identity protection service. This year, AllClearID debuted a free mobile app for the iPhone and iPad that alerts consumers if their credit cards or Social Security numbers have been stolen or if thieves are using their child's identity.AllClearID pulls that information from the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, an organization that partners with law enforcement agencies and companies like PayPal and Microsoft as a repository for stolen consumer information. Any time these agencies or companies encounter stolen credentials, they send them to the alliance. Until this year, the alliance reported any stolen credentials to the companies that had issued them.The AllClear ID mobile app and LassPass service mark the first time consumers will be alerted directly. "
House Votes To Approve Disputed Hacking Bill,"WASHINGTON -- Defying a veto threat from President Obama, the House on Thursday passed a bill that encourages intelligence agencies and businesses to share information about threats to computer systems, including attacks on American Web sites by hackers in China and other countries.The vote was 248 to 168, as 42 Democrats joined 206 Republicans in backing the bill. The ''no'' votes were cast by 140 Democrats and 28 Republicans, including a number who described the measure as a potential threat to privacy and civil liberties. Under the bill, the federal government can share classified information with private companies to help them protect their computer networks. Companies, in turn, could voluntarily share information about cyberthreats with the government and would generally be protected against lawsuits for doing so if they acted in good faith.The White House opposed the bill, saying it could ''undermine the public's trust in the government as well as in the Internet by undermining fundamental privacy, confidentiality, civil liberties and consumer protections.''In addition, the White House said the government should set ''minimum cybersecurity performance standards'' for the private sector -- an approach resisted by House Republican leaders.''The White House believes the government ought to control the Internet, government ought to set standards and government ought to take care of everything that's needed for cybersecurity,'' said Speaker John A. Boehner. ''They're in a camp all by themselves.''''We can't have the government in charge of our Internet,'' Mr. Boehner added.The Senate is working on a more comprehensive bipartisan bill that directs the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to issue regulations to protect ''critical infrastructure,'' including the electric power grid, water and sewer systems, transportation hubs and financial service networks.In confidential briefings on Capitol Hill, administration officials have expressed alarm about the damage that could be done by malicious attacks on computer systems and networks that have become an indispensable part of everyday life. Supporters of the bill said China was stealing jobs by pilfering proprietary information and valuable trade secrets stored in American computers.The House bill was written by Representatives Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House intelligence committee, and C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the panel.They accepted many amendments to protect privacy, but not enough to satisfy advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union or the Center for Democracy and Technology. The civil liberties union criticized the bill as ''a privacy disaster.''However, Mr. Rogers said the sharing of information with the government was ''all voluntary,'' and he added, ''There is no government surveillance, none, not any in this bill.''The bill says that ''cyber threat information'' shared with the federal government by the private sector can be used for five purposes: to protect computer systems; to investigate cybersecurity crimes; to protect people from ''serious bodily harm''; to protect ''the national security of the United States''; and to prevent the sexual exploitation or kidnapping of children.Some members of both parties said they worried that the bill could lead to violations of privacy.''We do have a real cyberthreat in this country, and this bill is an honest attempt to deal with it,'' said Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, who voted against the legislation.''But the absence of explicit privacy protections for individuals is, to me, a greater threat to democracy and liberty than the cyberthreats that face America.''The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said, ''The threat of cyberattack is a real one, but the response must balance freedom and security.'' "
Cybersecurity at Risk,"Relentless assaults on America's computer networks by China and other foreign governments, hackers and criminals have created an urgent need for safeguards to protect these vital systems. The question now is whether the Senate will provide them. Senator John McCain, a Republican of Arizona, and the Chamber of Commerce have already exacted compromises from sponsors of a reasonably strong bill, and are asking for more. Their demands should be resisted and the original bill approved by the Senate. Officials and experts have warned about cybersecurity dangers for years; now the alarms are more insistent. On Thursday, Gen. Keith Alexander, the chief of the United States Cyber Command and the director of the National Security Agency, said intrusions against computers that run essential infrastructure increased 17-fold from 2009-11 and that it's only a matter of time before an attack causes physical damage. He has also called the loss of industrial information and intellectual property through cyberespionage ''the greatest transfer of wealth in history.''American officials say businesses already lose billions of dollars annually. Hundreds of major companies, defense contractors and government agencies have been affected. Attacks on power plants, electric grids, refineries, transportation networks and water treatment systems present an even greater threat. Last year, there were at least 200 attempted or successful cyberattacks on those facilities.Yet defenses are dangerously thin. On a scale of 1 to 10, General Alexander rated preparedness for a large-scale cyberattack -- shutting down the stock exchange, for instance -- as ''around a 3.'' That is why President Obama and others have argued for mandatory minimum standards that would require companies to share information and harden computer protections.Bipartisan legislation drafted by Senator Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut independent and the chairman of the homeland security committee, and Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the ranking Republican member, met that bar. But faced with strong opposition from Mr. McCain and the business community, the sponsors compromised. Under the revised bill, industry will develop the standards for addressing threats and compliance will be voluntary.This has not satisfied Mr. McCain or the chamber, which insists the bill would still be too costly and cumbersome. Last year, a survey of more than 9,000 executives in more than 130 countries by the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting firm found that only 13 percent of those polled had taken adequate defensive action against cyberthreats.Not all companies share that aversion to the bill. Microsoft and Symantec, among others, have supported the original Lieberman-Collins legislation. And civil liberties groups say their earlier privacy concerns have been addressed. It's time for the endless talk of cyberthreats to be met by action. The Lieberman-Collins bill should be voted by the Senate this week and then merged with the House version so a law can be enacted this year. If not, and a catastrophic cyberattack occurs, Americans will be justified in asking why their lawmakers, mired in election-year partisanship, failed to protect them. "
A Tumultuous Trip to Mobile App Transparency,"MOBILE apps are the Trojan horses of our smartphones.We think they're free, or nearly free, and invite them in -- without always knowing exactly what's inside.Apps often collect all kinds of information from our smartphones, like our contact lists and data on our precise locations. Both Android and iPhone apps are supposed to ask users' permission first. But many people probably don't know that third parties, like ad networks, analytics companies and data brokers, may also gain access to that information, security experts say.An Android photo-sharing app, for instance, might request access to a user's contacts, making it easy for that user to share photos, says Harry Sverdlove, the chief technology officer at Bit9, a cybersecurity firm. But a banner ad running on that same app, he says, might also be able to get access to that list, too, and use it to profile the user's activities.''It's like the app is asking, 'May I have permission to enter your home?' '' Mr. Sverdlove says. ''Maybe I am coming over to visit and have dinner. Maybe I am coming over to steal.'' Now, a new joint effort of the app industry and advocacy groups is working to give consumers more clarity on this issue. Last month, the coalition -- it includes the Application Developers Alliance, the American Civil Liberties Union, Consumer Action and the World Privacy Forum -- proposed that mobile apps voluntarily display standardized, short-form notices that would list the main types of data they collect and the entities with which that information is shared.The idea came in response to a federal effort to update consumer privacy rights for the digital era.''App developers want to do something that advances consumers' trust in their industry,'' says Tim Sparapani, senior adviser for policy and law at the Application Developers Alliance, an industry group. ''To make it work, they want it to be implementable and easy.''The White House earlier this year asked the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a division of the Commerce Department, to gather industry and advocacy groups together in an effort to develop a ''Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights.'' After reviewing public commentary on the process, the telecommunications agency announced its first step would be to convene interested parties to work out a code of conduct for transparency in how mobile apps handle consumer data.The process has been bumpy. The mobile app meetings have been beset by animosity and incivility. And some of the parties are operating on different channels. Some advocacy groups have been publicly pushing for comprehensive, detailed disclosures on data use by apps and third parties. Meanwhile, an advertising industry alliance has been working outside of the process to privately develop its own self-regulatory code of conduct.A recent report about the collection of mobile device location data issued by the Government Accountability Office faulted the telecommunications agency for its unstructured approach. Although the collection and sharing of location data could put consumers at serious risk of surveillance, stalking and identity theft, the report said, the telecommunications agency ''has not set specific goals, milestones and performance measures for this effort.''''Consequently, it is unclear if or when the process would address mobile location privacy,'' the G.A.O. said.The telecommunications agency sees its role as a facilitator or convener of the process, not as a director or active member.''I am pretty pleased with the progress the stakeholders have made so far,'' John Morris, the agency's director of the Office of Policy, Analysis and Development, said in a phone interview last Thursday. ''I am looking forward to seeing them reach a conclusion.''But some stakeholders say they have been frustrated with the lack of progress. That is why the app developer and advocacy groups worked on their own to develop a more practical approach, designing what they call ''voluntary transparency screens.''''There's a whole lot of shouting going on about process. There's a whole lot of shouting going on about substance,'' Jon Potter, the president of the Application Developers Alliance, said at a meeting of the stakeholders on Nov. 30. ''What if we close the door, lower the temperature and try to get something done?''THE level of strife so far over the narrow issue of mobile app transparency, some advocates say, doesn't bode well for the larger federal effort to work out a comprehensive consumer bill of privacy rights.App industry representatives and advocates wrangled for months to hammer out prototypes for their short-form notices, negotiating over the data disclosures they felt consumers should see and different ways to present them. They came up with an idea that users could click on a disclosure screen or two before they downloaded an app.A first screen, the coalition proposed, might list the types of data an app collected, like a device's location, personal contacts, Web browsing history, photos, financial or health information. A second screen could list the kinds of entities -- ad networks, data brokers, data analytics companies, government agencies, social networks and so on -- that could also gain access to that data. Or it could all be on one screen.The idea, Mr. Potter says, is to give consumers a quick way to compare apps not just on utility but also on the extent of data collection. In an industry where long-winded, opaque privacy policies have become the norm, the proposed short notices seem radical in their clarity and brevity.''The process is about effectively communicating to consumers what data is being collected and who it is being shared with,'' Mr. Potter says.Ad industry representatives applauded the simplicity of the notices. But they vociferously objected to the idea that app users would have to click through a screen before they could use an app.''That you'd have to scroll through all this privacy stuff before you get to the app, there's no public call for that,'' said Stuart P. Ingis, a lawyer representing the Direct Marketing Association, an industry group, in the negotiations on mobile app transparency. ''Consumers don't want that.''Mr. Ingis also represents the Digital Advertising Alliance, an ad industry self-regulatory initiative that offers an ad-choices program for Internet users. The alliance, he says, has been working outside of the telecommunications agency process to privately develop its own guidelines for third parties that collect consumer data across apps.But advocates and app developers argue that consumers should receive clear notices of mobile app and third-party data collection practices before they download apps.

Twitter Reacts to Anonymous Attacks on Westboro Baptist Church,"The last few days have seen a flurry of Twitter activity from Anonymous, the hacker collective, and more recently, from Twitter itself.Anonymous has been campaigning against the Westboro Baptist Church after its members threatened to picket at a vigil for victims of the Newtown, Conn., shootings, claiming ""God sent the shooter"" in retaliation for the fact that Connecticut has legalized gay marriage. In response, Anonymous hacked into the Twitter and Facebook accounts of several Westboro Baptist Church members and tweeted information about members like their home addresses and telephone numbers, as well as the locations of the hotel rooms where they say church members have been coordinating their protests.As a result, Twitter suspended one of the primary accounts associated with Anonymous, @YourAnonNews as well as the Twitter account of Westboro Baptist Church spokeswoman Shirley Phelps-Roper, which had been taken over by Anonymous.The move was a bit of an about-face for Twitter, which has largely played a passive role in allowing Anonymous to publicize its campaigns on the platform. Twitter spokesman Jim Prosser said the company would not comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons, but an Anonymous member posted an e-mail received from Twitter that said that their account was suspended ""for posting an individual's private information such as a private e-mail address, physical address, telephone number, or financial documents,"" referring to Ms. Phelps-Roper.Suspending accounts has been a tricky issue for Twitter. Last summer, the company publicly apologized after briefly suspending the Twitter account of Guy Adams, a British reporter, who had been critical of NBC's Olympics coverage and at one point published the e-mail address of an NBC executive. In an online apology, Twitter's lawyer, Alexander Macgillivray, said it was ""not acceptable"" for Twitter to scrutinize Tweets and would only remove information if it received a report from a person whose private information had been posted.Mr. Prosser, the Twitter spokesman, did not say whether Twitter received a report from Mr. Phelps-Roper, but quickly reinstated the @YourAnonNews account about an hour later.By then, Anonymous members had already resorted to a back-up account. As for the reinstated account,  it not only emerged unscathed, it re-emerged with over 100,000 new followers. "
Malicious Code Can Wipe Out Some Samsung Phones," A simple line of malicious code embedded in a Web page can cause some Samsung Galaxy smartphones to lose all their data, security researchers revealed this week. But Samsung says a fix has been out for months.The code, composed of 11 digits and symbols, was revealed at a security conference in Argentina, according to a report by The Telegraph. Samsung issued a statement saying it has already dealt with the issue:We would like to assure customers that the recent security issue affecting the Galaxy S III has already been addressed in a software update. We believe this issue was isolated to early production devices, and devices currently available are not affected by this issue. To ensure customers are fully protected, Samsung advises checking for software updates through the 'Settings: About device: Software update' menu. We are in the process of evaluating other Galaxy models.Teri Daley, senior director of public relations at Samsung, said in an interview that the company had found that the problem was addressed in a software update issued months ago, so only customers using older versions of the software would be vulnerable. She said the company was trying to determine the specific models and software versions that were affected by the vulnerability.The Galaxy S III and some Galaxy S II smartphones have been found to be vulnerable to the attack. But again, Ms. Daley said customers who had downloaded the latest software should be safe.Tim Strazzere, lead security engineer of Lookout, a mobile security firm, confirmed that the attack worked only on Galaxy devices with older software. He said other phones with Android would not be affected by the malicious code, and he recommended that phone owners always keep their software up to date. He also said Android users should use Google's Chrome browser instead of the standard one on the phone, or use Lookout's free app to protect their Android phones from malware.Mobile devices are typically not as prone to running into viruses or malicious software as PCs, but smartphones have become bigger targets as their numbers have grown. Google in February introduced a security system called Bouncer, which analyzes Android apps for suspicious code to prevent malware from entering the Android app store. "
Warnings And Buzzwords At Security Event,"SAN FRANCISCO - Here is a look at some of the highlights, lowlights and scarier happenings taking place at the annual RSA security conference here this week.DIABETICS BEWARE: HACKERS CAN TAKE OVER YOUR INSULIN PUMPS. Panel discussions piled fear-mongering upon fear-mongering. Of the more egregious examples: One RSA panel discussion about trojans, malware and targeted hacks included a slide featuring a month-old online ad for a hitman's services. The hitman offered to ''eliminate someone while keeping above suspicion'' within 30 days for $9,133. It's still not entirely clear what this had to do with trojans, or cyberattacks, but it was scary nonetheless. In another talk, Stuart McClure, McAfee's chief technology officer, demonstrated how easily a diabetic's insulin pump could be commandeered by hackers. This could ''affect a patient's health dramatically,'' Mr. McClure told a crowd of hundreds. He concluded his speech this way, ''When communications cannot be secured, it can lead to death.'' 'BIG DATA' IS IN. FIREWALLS ARE OUT. Buzzwords like ''virtualization,'' ''big data'' and ''cloud security solutions'' are very much in vogue among security folk these days. Mention of firewalls and usernames and passwords elicits smug chuckles. The mind-set of the security industry has changed from one that thinks it can keep malware and bad guys out with antivirus solutions and firewall protection, to one that tries to identify and control the bad guys once they inevitably break in. In the last two weeks, both I.B.M. and Cisco announced new security intelligence systems that monitor and analyze threats in real time using the ''big data'' they cull from their information technology systems and networks, respectively. A number of companies already do this, albeit on a smaller scale. Solera Networks, Narus, Niometrics, AccessData, Log Logic, Niksun and dozens of others at the conference all market similar services. They look for patterns or telltale signs among large quantities of unstructured data to flag vulnerabilities before a security breach occurs, or to spot a breach as it is happening.FOR SECURITY FOLK, SMARTPHONES ARE THE BANE OF THEIR EXISTENCE. I.T. professionals used to have a realistic sense of the data flowing in and out of their networks. With employees plugging their personal smartphones, tablets and laptops into employers' networks and carrying sensitive data around with them, that's no longer the case. The inmates have basically taken control, and security professionals are desperate for ways to stymie the outpouring of information. A number of panels focused on the ''B.Y.O.D.,'' or bring your own device, phenomenon. Among them: ''Does B.Y.O.D. Spell RISK?'' and ''B.Y.O.D(evice) Without B.Y.O.I(nsecurity).''OLD SCHOOL HACKERS STILL DRAW A CROWD. Standing merrily among the hundreds of security vendors pitching souped-up firewalls and secure cloud solutions on an expo floor on Tuesday, the convicted-hacker-cum-security-consultant Kevin Mitnick recounted some of his exploits of yesteryear. He showed onlookers - many of them already anxiety-ridden chief information officers - how easily corporate assets could be pilfered using a thumb drive pulled from a dumpster. On Wednesday, a line to secure Mr. Mitnick's autograph snaked around the auditorium, while other people settled for snapping photographs of Mr. Mitnick with their cellphones.'WE LOVE ANONYMOUS.' Contrary to conventional wisdom, security folk love Anonymous, the loose hacking collective that says it has taken on groups as diverse as the C.I.A., Interpol and Stratfor. Several security experts I interviewed called the group ''a welcome wake-up call.'' For years, chief information officers had to pound their fists on the table to convince their bosses to allocate more resources to information security. Now Anonymous does that for them. ''Anonymous added a silent 'J-O-B' before security,'' one conference attendee said. ''The more companies they hack, the more vulnerabilities get exposed, the greater our job security.'' He spoke -no pun intended-on condition of anonymity.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Saudi Oil Producer's Computers Restored After Virus Attack,"DUBAI (Reuters) -- Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, has resumed operating its main internal computer networks after a virus infected about 30,000 of its workstations earlier this month, the company said Sunday.Immediately after the Aug. 15 attack, the company announced it had cut off its electronic systems from outside access to prevent further attacks. On Sunday, Saudi Aramco said the workstations had been cleansed of the virus and restored to service. Oil exploration and production were not affected because they operate on isolated systems, it said.''We would like to emphasize and assure our stakeholders, customers and partners that our core businesses of oil and gas exploration, production and distribution from the wellhead to the distribution network were unaffected and are functioning as reliably as ever,'' Saudi Aramco's chief executive, Khalid al-Falih, said in a statement.However, one of Saudi Aramco's Web sites taken offline after the attack -- www.aramco.com -- remained down on Sunday. E-mails sent by Reuters to people within the company continued to bounce back.The company said that the virus ''originated from external sources,'' and that an investigation into the causes of the incident and those responsible was continuing. It did not elaborate.Information technology experts have warned that computer attacks on countries' energy infrastructure, whether conducted by hostile governments, militant groups or private ''hacktivists'' to make political points, could disrupt energy supplies.Iran, the focus of international economic sanctions focused on its oil industry over its disputed nuclear program, has been hit by several computer attacks in the last few years.In April, a virus infected the Iranian oil ministry and national oil company networks, forcing Iran to disconnect the control systems of oil facilities including Kharg Island, which handles most of its crude exports.Iran has attributed some of the attacks to the United States, Israel and Britain.Current and former American officials have said that the United States built the complex Stuxnet computer worm to try to prevent Tehran from completing suspected nuclear weapons work.An English-language posting on an online bulletin board on Aug. 15, signed by a group called the ''Cutting Sword of Justice,'' claimed the group was responsible for the attack and wanted to destroy the 30,000 computers at Saudi Aramco.It said the company was the main source of income for the Saudi government, which it blamed for ''crimes and atrocities'' in several countries, including Syria and Bahrain. Saudi Arabia sent troops into Bahrain last year to back the gulf state's Sunni Muslim rulers against Shiite-led protesters. Riyadh is also supporting Sunni rebels against the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad.The Cutting Sword of Justice was not widely known before this attack, and information security experts contacted by Reuters had no information on the group.Rob Rachwald, director of security strategy for United States-based data security firm Imperva, said in a blog posting last week that if the Saudi Aramco attack had been carried out by hacktivists, it could be a milestone in computer hacking.''A group of hobbyists and hacktivists with several very strong-minded developers and hackers achieved results similar to what we have allegedly seen governments accomplish,'' Mr. Rachwald wrote.Symantec, one of the world's largest Internet security companies, said on the day after the Saudi Aramco attack that it had discovered a new virus directed against at least one organization in the global energy sector, although it did not name that organization.''It is a destructive malware that corrupts files on a compromised computer and overwrites the MBR (Master Boot Record) in an effort to render a computer unusable,'' Symantec said in a blog posting about the virus, which it called W32.Disttrack. ''Threats with such destructive payloads are unusual and are not typical of targeted attacks.''Mr. al-Falih, the oil company's chief executive, said in his statement on Sunday: ''Saudi Aramco is not the only company that became a target for such attempts, and this was not the first nor will it be the last illegal attempt to intrude into our systems, and we will ensure that we will further reinforce our systems with all available means to protect against a recurrence of this type of cyberattack.'' "
Simulating a City Of Android Phones,"An air-conditioned data center at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, Calif., has the ambience of a Best Buy showroom, with 500 inexpensive desktop computers lined up on racks. But the PCs here are doing something special.A small team of cybersecurity researchers have lashed the computers together to form a homebrew computing cluster. They are stacked five levels high, braced in impromptu fashion with metal girders in the event of earthquakes, and woven together with colorful Ethernet cables. They serve as a cyber-Potemkin village -- a distributed software simulation that is intended to mimic the behavior of an entire city's worth of Android smartphones.So far, the researchers have emulated the behavior of a network of 300,000 Android phones, down to details like sending text messages and transmitting wireless data, and even the behavior of the phone's radios or sensors.In the future, they hope that their software, which will be freely available through an open-source license, will be used by groups designing social network applications like Foursquare, military battle planners, disaster relief workers and American hackers who are building mesh wireless networks intended to make the Internet available inside nations controlled by dictators, among others.""We wanted to create something that would approximate the many, many phones in a real network,"" said John Floren, a Sandia computer scientist who is part of the group of researchers that built the system, which is called MegaDroid.The idea is that while such simulators have in the past been developed by the engineers of large data networks, they have not been generally accessible to small groups of designers who might be working on a some new type of distributed application.To date, wireless smartphone networks have not suffered malicious software infections at the same rate as the standard wired network, which is now plagued by a vast array of malware. Many computer security specialists believe that this will soon change as personal computing goes mobile, much as Willie Sutton robbed banks because, as he put it, that's where the money was.A wireless network simulation like MegaDroid would make it possible for security researchers to gain new insights into ""attack vectors,"" according to the Sandia engineers. Their computing cluster is in an unclassified area of Sandia, which historically has been one of the two engineering and design centers that has built and maintained the nation's nuclear weapons.On a large monitor outside the data center, it appears as if the researchers have turned loose a frenetic army of virtual Charlie Sheens on the city of Livermore, Calif. (The use of the Charlie Sheen icons is apparently an inside joke among the researchers.) The scene is actually a visualization tool used by the MegaDroid simulator, which includes fake GPS data and gives the appearance of a beehive of cellular activity as the Android phone owners drive and walk around a map of the city.The researchers stressed that simulating a wireless network is a much more complex undertaking than simulating a standard desktop-based network.""In a desktop PC network, the biggest problem you have is someone kicking a cord out,"" said David Fritz, one of the MegaDroid designers.In contrast, modern wireless networks are composed of shifting herds of tens of thousands of smartphone users. The simulation is made even more complex by the fact that each phone contains multiple radios and sensors.The danger of not having a deep understanding of the behavior of a computer network was made clear several decades ago at the very beginning of the Internet era. In 1988 a Cornell graduate student brought much of the Internet to a standstill -- it was composed of about 50,000 computers at the time -- when he unleashed a program known as a worm that was intended to live in the network as a bit of digital graffiti -- in effect, the cyber-equivalent of writing ""Kilroy was here."" However, because of an error in coding that caused the software to rapidly replicate, a vast number of copies spread through the network, overwhelming it.The researchers said they were concerned about such issues of network resilience, but they also saw the possibility that MegaDroid might be used to build new kinds of distributed applications. For example, disaster workers in an earthquake zone could harness the accelerometers in their phones together to provide a digital seismograph, tracking aftershocks. Or small and inexpensive chemical and biological sensors could be added to smartphones carried by government workers, creating an early warning system in the event of terrorist attacks.The researchers said that they were sensitive to privacy issues and that they believed the simulator could be used to build systems that provided useful data in national security situations while protecting privacy.Right now the system models only the open-source Android operating system designed by Google, but the Sandia researchers said they hoped to add other operating sytems like Apple's IOS. This would give a more realistic model of the wireless data world.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
A Win for Small Businesses in a Bank Fraud Case,"In June, we published an article advising small-business owners to guard against hackers who use malicious software, or malware, to raid business bank accounts. Computer security specialists say these crimes, called ""corporate account takeovers,"" have become increasingly common, and small businesses are especially easy prey because many lack firewalls and monitoring systems.Worse, business owners often assume incorrectly that the protection they have on personal bank accounts applies to their business accounts as well. But historically that has not been the case. Provided banks can show adequate security procedures, they have no legal obligation to reimburse businesses for attacks, as federal regulations do not cover commercial accounts. A recent court decision, however, creates a precedent to change that. In July, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston ruled in favor of a construction company that had been hacked, declaring its bank responsible for the losses. Last month the two parties reached a settlement. In May 2009, Mark Patterson's company, Patco Construction in Sanford, Me., was robbed of $588,000 by cybercriminals using ZeuS Trojan, a form of malware. Over seven consecutive days, thieves executed automated clearinghouse batch transactions with Patco's user name and password.Mr. Patterson assumed incorrectly that his financial institution, Ocean Bank, a southern Maine community bank, would cover the unauthorized debits. When he learned otherwise, he tried to cut a deal.""We thought there were enough red flags that the bank should have detected"" fraudulent activity, Mr. Patterson said, ""but we also knew the malware was on our systems."" Because the bank was able to recover about $240,000 by halting or clawing back money from transfers processed within 24 hours of discovering the fraud, Patco's actual losses were about $350,000. So Mr. Patterson asked Ocean Bank to reimburse $250,000. When the bank refused, he called a lawyer.Patco brought suit against People's United Bank, a regional bank based in Bridgeport, Conn., which had acquired Ocean Bank. With both sides in agreement that money was stolen and about how it was stolen, the facts of the case were never in dispute. In August 2011, Maine's Federal District Court ruled in favor of the bank, finding that People's United's security systems were ""commercially reasonable,"" meaning the bank had done everything possible to protect its customers from fraud.But Patco appealed, arguing that because People's United had configured its security systems improperly, the bank failed to prevent the crime. ""In this case, the bank put settings in place that were counter to good security,"" said Dan Mitchell, a partner in the Portland, Me., office of Bernstein Shur and a member of the law firm's data security practice. Mr. Mitchell represented Patco in the case. ""The way they operated it left holes in the system.""Mr. Mitchell explained that thieves spirited away money from Patco's account to places like California and Florida, where the company does not normally conduct business. The timing and values of payments were also inconsistent with regular orders.While People's United assigned a risk score from zero to 1,000 for every transaction, the bank did not monitor scores to halt the fraud. ""Patco's typical scores were zero to 214 max, but in this case the risk scores were in the high 700s,"" Mr. Mitchell said. ""So the bank had the ability to generate these scores but didn't do anything with them.""On this basis, Patco won the appeal, and in November People's United agreed to pay back the full amount stolen from Patco, plus interest. Representatives of People's United did not respond to requests for comment.""The Patco case was the first to come from a court that high up,"" Mr. Mitchell said. ""This case is a guidepost now. My guess is that most of these cases get resolved, and this case will encourage that even more."" He believes the ruling will motivate banks not only to purchase adequate security systems but also to configure and maintain them properly.Still, the impact of the Patco case may be muted, as financial institutions and their customers have become increasingly knowledgeable about computer security in the past three years. ""If the status quo had been maintained, this decision would have put the fear of God into institutions,"" said Sari Stern Greene, president of Sage Data Security in South Portland, Me., who testified as an expert witness in the case on behalf of Patco. ""But in the interim, financial institutions have significantly enhanced their security controls and helped educate their customers.""Ms. Greene also underscores that small businesses must erect their own firewalls and take precautions to prevent hacking. ""Online banking security is really a partnership between the customer and the financial institution. When customers use online banking, they're in essence creating their own personal branch,"" she said. ""Businesses invest in locks, alarms and motion sensors; they understand they need those controls in the physical world. And now they need them in the digital world too.""As for Patco, the company no longer makes automated clearinghouse batch transactions. Mr. Patterson and his lawyer estimate People's United spent more than $1 million in legal fees, while Patco spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to resolve the case.""Yeah, I feel good about winning,"" Mr. Patterson said. ""But in the end, why does this stuff have to occur? Why didn't the bank just settle?"" "
Web Gang Operating In the Open,"Five men believed to be responsible for spreading a notorious computer worm on Facebook and other social networks -- and pocketing several million dollars from online schemes -- are hiding in plain sight in St. Petersburg, Russia, according to investigators at Facebook and several independent computer security researchers.The men live comfortable lives in St. Petersburg -- and have frolicked on luxury vacations in places like Monte Carlo, Bali and, earlier this month, Turkey, according to photographs posted on social network sites -- even though their identities have been known for years to Facebook, computer security investigators and law enforcement officials.One member of the group, which is popularly known as the Koobface gang, has regularly broadcast the coordinates of its offices by checking in on Foursquare, a location-based social network, and posting the news to Twitter. Photographs on Foursquare also show other suspected members of the group working on Macs in a loftlike room that looks like offices used by tech start-ups in cities around the world. Beginning in July 2008, the Koobface gang aimed at Web users with invitations to watch a funny or sexy video. Those curious enough to click the link got a message to update their computer's Flash software, which begins the download of the Koobface malware. Victims' computers are drafted into a ''botnet,'' or network of infected PCs, and are sent official-looking advertisements of fake antivirus software and their Web searches are also hijacked and the clicks delivered to unscrupulous marketers. The group made money from people who bought the bogus software and from unsuspecting advertisers.The security software firm Kaspersky Labs has estimated the network includes 400,000 to 800,000 PCs worldwide at its height in 2010. Victims are often unaware their machines have been compromised.The Koobface gang's freedom underscores how hard it is to apprehend international computer criminals, even when identities are known. These groups tend to operate in countries where they can work unmolested by the local authorities, and where cooperation with United States and European law enforcement agencies is poor. Meanwhile, Western law enforcement is awash in computer crime and lacks the resources and skilled manpower to tackle it effectively, especially when evidence putting individuals' fingers on keyboards must be collected abroad.On Tuesday, Facebook plans to announce that it will begin sharing information about the group and how to fight them with security researchers and other Internet companies. It believes public namings can make it harder for such groups to operate and send a message to the criminal underground.None of the men have been charged with a crime and no law enforcement agencies have confirmed they are under investigation.The group investigators have identified has adopted the tongue-in-cheek name, Ali Baba & 4: Anton Korotchenko, who uses the online nickname ''KrotReal''; Stanislav Avdeyko, known as ''leDed''; Svyatoslav E. Polichuck, who goes by ''PsViat'' and ''PsycoMan''; Roman P. Koturbach, who uses the online moniker ''PoMuc''; and Alexander Koltyshev, or ''Floppy.'' )Efforts to contact members of the group for comment have been unsuccessful.Weeks after early versions of the Koobface worm began appearing on Facebook, investigators inside the company were able to trace the attacks to those responsible. ''We've had a picture of one of the guys in a scuba mask on our wall since 2008,'' said Ryan McGeehan, manager of investigations and incident response at Facebook.Since then, Facebook and several independent security researchers have provided law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with information and evidence. Most notably, Jan Droemer, a 32-year-old independent researcher in Germany, has provided important information and leads, including a password-free view inside Koobface's command-and-control system, known as the ''Mothership.'' Mr. Droemer spent nights and weekends for four months in late 2009 and early 2010 unmasking the gang members using only information available publicly on the Internet.The F.B.I. declined to comment.That computer crime pays is fueling a boom that is leaving few Internet users and businesses unscathed. The toll on consumers alone is estimated at $114 billion annually worldwide, according to a September 2011 study by the security software maker Symantec.Russia, in particular, has a reputation as a hacker haven, although it has pursued several prominent cases against spammers recently. The Soviet education system's emphasis on math and science combined with post-Communist economic collapse and weak private industry meant there were many highly trained engineers, but few legitimate outlets for their skills, said Vsevolod Gunitskiy, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto.''Russia is sort of a perfect storm for cybercrime,'' he said. The proliferation of organized crime and official corruption created ''this very strong legacy of contempt for the laws and general culture of criminality.''The Russian Embassy in Washington said it does not have any information regarding this group and that American law enforcement officials had never contacted the embassy on this issue.The men investigators believe are behind Koobface look a lot like ordinary software enthusiasts, albeit with more tattoos and an outlaw persona. Mr. Avdeyko, who is two decades older than the other men and has been tied to an infamous spyware program dating to 2003 called CoolWebSearch, appears to hold a leadership role.He and at least two of the other men have worked in the world of online pornography, said Mr. Droemer. Mr. Korotchenko and several of the other men apparently tried to run a legitimate mobile software and services business, colorfully named MobSoft Ltd. They did not reply to e-mails requesting interviews.Mr. Droemer said the gang's success was more attributable to workaday persistence and willingness to adapt than technical sophistication. They could have spread Koobface to many more PCs, he said. ''They could have done a lot more technical things to make it more perfect, more marvelous. But there was just no need to do it. They were just investing as much to get the revenue they wanted to get.''The group cleverly harnessed the infrastructures of powerful online services -- from Facebook and Twitter to Google's search engine and Blogger -- to do the heavy lifting, and may have run its enterprise with just a few computers.Koobface will probably earn its place in history for pioneering and leading the criminal exploitation of social networks, rather than the size of its profits. Data found in the botnet's command-and-control system suggests the group has earned at least $2 million a year for the 3 1/2 years of its existence, although the actual total is very likely higher, Mr. Droemer said.Experts say the gang could have further enriched itself through identity fraud, since it has had access to millions of PCs and social-network profiles, but that there is no evidence it has done so.Indeed, in a 2009 Christmas e-card to security researchers left inside victim computers, the gang vowed it would never steal credit card or banking information. It called viruses ''something awful.'' Its tactics have been less ruthless than those of many other hacker groups, experts said. For instance, it has never deployed malicious programs that install automatically, and rather has required its victims to make several unwise clicks.While the Koobface gang operates freely, Facebook has focused on building elaborate defenses against the worm, which relentlessly struck the site again and again until disappearing in March. The gang abandoned the site after Facebook mounted a major counteroffensive, which included an effort to dismantle the command-and-control system of the botnet and a simultaneous push to scrub its network of the worm and clean up infections in users' PCs.''We fired all the different guns at the same time,'' said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer at Facebook. ''If we could literally shut down the command-and-control, all the infections, and just make them have to start over from scratch in all contexts, we figured they might decide to move on.'' He hoped they would conclude Facebook was unprofitable, he said.But Facebook's effort and two earlier takedown efforts by security researchers -- including one by the Bulgarian researcher Dancho Danchev, who revealed the name of one Koobface member on his blog last week -- have failed put an end to Koobface, and smaller sites continue to suffer.''People who engage in this type of stuff need to know that their name and real identity are going to come out eventually and they're going to get arrested and they're going to be targeted,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''People are fighting back.'' "
Europe Cracks Down on Cybercrime,"LONDON - The European Union is preparing new steps to crack down on bot-herders, identity thieves, web hijackers and other online fraudsters who are skimming millions of euros a day from a growing number of its half billion citizens.In separate initiatives this week, the European Commission, which implements EU policy, proposed a new cybercrime center, and an EU committee proposed mandatory jail time across all 27 member states for some online offenses.The Commission said cybercrime was a global and cross-border phenomenon that now brought more profits for organized crime - $388 billion a year worldwide - than the global trade in marijuana, cocaine and heroin combined. In Europe, however, action to detect and prosecute it was hampered by inadequate information sharing between national jurisdictions.Trained investigators, prosecutors and judges were not available in all member states and investigative and forensic capacities varied across the EU, the Commission said.The new center, set to open in the Netherlands early next year, will focus on organized crime gangs engaged in online fraud, online predators who sexually exploit children, and hackers who attack critical infrastructure and IT systems. It will be located at the headquarters of Europol, the European criminal intelligence agency in The Hague.The Commission estimated that more than a third of EU citizens now bank online and the incidence of fraud is growing. ""Moreover, the extent of cyber-attacks affecting public and private information systems clearly increased in 2011 and early 2012,"" the Commission said.It quoted official British figures that showed cybercrime was costing British businesses alone (EURO)21 billion a year. German police reported the number of cases of ''phishing"" in online banking rose from less than 2000 incidents in 2008 to over 5000 in 2010. On Tuesday, a committee of the European Parliament proposed a new law that would include mandatory minimum jail sentences across the EU for some computer crimes. At present, cybercrime is dealt with differently in the various member states. ""We are dealing here with serious criminal attacks, some of which are even conducted by criminal organizations,"" said Monika Hohlmeier, a German member of the Parliament. ""The financial damage caused for companies, private users and the public side amounts to several billions each year.""The committee proposed a minimum jail sentence of two years for crimes such as computer hacking and up to five years for aggravated offenses, such as operating botnets - networks of computers infected with malicious software and then used to ""phish"" and ""spam.""And what's a ""bot-herder""? That's someone who sets up and runs a botnet. For more on that, read my colleagues Nick Wingfield and Nicole Perlroth on Microsoft's latest campaign to crack down on internet crime. "
F.B.I. Says 24 Are Arrested In Credit Card Theft Plan,"For hackers in search of information like credit card numbers and software to spy on computers, the site called Carder Profit appeared to be a veritable eBay for thieves.Instead, it was a creation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.On Tuesday, after a two-year undercover operation, authorities in 13 countries arrested two dozen people who are accused of fraud involving computer crime. Federal officials said Operation Card Shop, as the sting is being called, was unusually broad and represented a significant step in combating credit card fraud, which has grown notably more sophisticated recently.''These guys represent the complete ecosystem of Internet fraud,'' said one senior law enforcement official who requested anonymity because of the confidentiality of the investigation. ''We drew them out of the shadows with the Web site as bait.''Hackers have become increasingly successful recently in obtaining credit card information and other personal data, sharing it on secure Web sites, often on overseas servers. Last year, hackers in Eastern Europe obtained the names, account numbers, e-mail addresses and transaction histories of more than 200,000 Citibank customers.The online forum, one law enforcement official said, was ''like a restricted eBay,'' open only to people who had a reputation and who had been vouched for by someone on the site. Besides the financial data, hacking tips, malware, spyware and access to stolen goods, like iPads and iPhones, were also possible on the site, the official said.Federal officials maintained that the sting operation prevented potential losses of more than $200 million. Credit card providers were notified of more than 400,000 compromised credit and debit cards, the officials said.Many of the 11 individuals arrested in the United States offered specialized skills and products on the sting site. One, who used the screen name xVisceral, offered remote access tools known as RATS that would spy on computers and Web cameras; the programs sold for $50 a copy.Another, Mir Islam, known as JoshTheGod, sold stolen credit card information and had data on 50,000 credit card accounts, according to the United States attorney for the Southern District. He was arrested after buying cards from an undercover agent and trying to use one at an A.T.M. on Eighth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.Mr. Islam is accused of helping to operate additional forums, UGNazi.com and Carders.org, both of which were seized by the F.B.I. A lawyer for Mr. Islam declined to comment.Other people arrested offered to ship stolen merchandise and arrange drop services so items like sunglasses, air purifiers and synthetic marijuana could be picked up.Two individuals were arrested in New York, nine elsewhere in the United States and 13 in a dozen other countries, according to an F.B.I. spokeswoman.In addition to arresting purveyors of stolen credit card information, authorities also aimed to trap people who created fake credit cards. The information included credit card numbers, addresses, Social Security numbers, mothers' maiden names and details of bank accounts.Some people who bought software and other items on the sting site purchased products from retailers like Apple and Walmart.''The coordinated law enforcement actions taken by an unprecedented number of countries around the world today demonstrate that hackers and fraudsters cannot count on being able to prowl the Internet in anonymity and with impunity, even across national boundaries,'' said Preet Bharara, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.In addition to luring hackers onto the site, federal authorities also monitored the discussion threads that sprang up, as specialized hackers sold their wares. The site was created in June 2010 and shut last month.''From New York to Norway and Japan to Australia, Operation Card Shop targeted sophisticated, highly organized cybercriminals involved in buying and selling stolen identities, exploited credit cards, counterfeit documents and sophisticated hacking tools,'' Janice K. Fedarcyk, assistant director for the F.B.I., said in a statement.She said the arrests would cause ''significant disruption to the underground economy.''The overall number of arrests had been reported earlier as 26.Credit card fraud has exploded in recent years, with increasingly sophisticated hackers teaming up with criminal organizations overseas. In the case of Operation Card Shop, the arrests took place in nations like Britain, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Norway and Germany. Search warrants and interviews were obtained in Australia, Canada, Macedonia and Denmark.''They didn't just take down one kid and a Web site,'' said Dave Marcus, director of advanced research and threat intelligence at McAfee, a major provider of computer security software. ''They took down a very organized group of people.''While the international reach of the operation was notable, the number of stolen cards pales in comparison with some earlier breaches. This year, Global Payments, an Atlanta-based transaction processor, reported a breach affecting 1.5 million credit cards. And in 2008, the underground market for the data was flooded with more than 360 million stolen personal records, mainly credit and debit files. "
Path Improves Security in Mobile App," Path, the mobile social network, announced on Monday that it had added a privacy feature to its mobile application. The update comes two months after it was discovered that some app makers, including Path, were copying people's address book data without permission. In some instances the data was stored unencrypted on company servers.""We take privacy and security seriously, and we believe your data deserves to be well protected,"" the company said in a short blog post. It went on to say that Path version 2.1.1, which is in the iTunes App Store, enhances security by adding a protective layer called hashing to data sent to Path's servers. Hashing turns text into an unintelligible string of letters and numbers and in turn anonymizes the information being sent to a server.""This means last names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, Twitter handles and Facebook IDs"" will all be hashed, the blog post said.Since the address book debacle began this year, Path and dozens of other app makers have come under questioning from Congress about their practices. Last week, lawmakers sent letters to 34 app developers requesting information about their data-collection techniques.Two congressmen sent Apple a letter last month asking Timothy Cook, Apple's chief executive, to answer questions about privacy problems in the company's iTunes App Store. The letters were co-written by Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat, and Representative G.K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina.Path's update should help quell some of the ire about data handling.  Path's post concluded: ""We hope our actions set a new standard in this field as we strive to serve you, our users, first.""

Swiss Seek Arrest of German Tax Officials Over Stolen Data,"BERLIN -- A long-simmering dispute between Germany and Switzerland over a CD containing stolen data about possible tax evaders has escalated after Swiss authorities issued arrest warrants for three German tax inspectors who paid $3.3 million for the information. The neighboring countries had hoped that a tentative deal calling for Switzerland to tax and fine the German accounts, without revealing the names of the accountholders to the German government, would help ease the tensions, but it still requires parliamentary approval and the gap remains wide.After news emerged over the weekend that the Swiss have demanded the extradition of the inspectors, a leading German politician said on Monday that the inspectors should instead be decorated with medals.Tax evasion has long been a source of contention between the countries, with some wealthy Germans using Switzerland's banking secrecy laws to avoid the high tax rates Germany levies on the rich and on top wage earners. German officials view the Swiss laws as enabling the theft of Germany's tax revenues. Switzerland, on the other hand, looks on the German tax inspectors who bought the CD with stolen account information as having violated its banking secrecy and data privacy laws.The CD was purchased from an informant in February 2010 and used by authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia and other states to begin more than 1,000 investigations of possible tax dodging by Germans. At the time, the Swiss denounced the investigation as an intrusion into their historical banking privacy.Now Swiss prosecutors have asked their counterparts in North Rhine-Westphalia to arrest the tax investigators, the Justice Ministry in Berlin confirmed Monday. Officials in the state capital of Dusseldorf said they saw no reason to comply.A spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday that the case had not harmed Swiss-German relations.But Joachim Poss, a leading member of the opposition Social Democrats in the German Parliament, told the Saarbrucker Zeitung daily newspaper that he found it galling that the Swiss were pursuing charges against German officials instead of those hiding money in their country's banks. ''When dictators and mass murderers have to flee their homelands, often enough they have their stolen fortune in Switzerland,'' Mr. Poss said.The German opposition has said that, without changes, it will block passage of the agreement in the Bundesrat, the upper chamber whose approval is required if legislation passed by the Bundestag is to become law.Swiss politicians have remained relatively quiet on the issue. ''We are aware that the entire situation is politically very sensitive,'' Switzerland's federal prosecutor, Michael Lauber, said on Germany's ARD public radio on Monday. ''Conversely, the law obliges us to do our job if and when we have the evidence, and that's exactly the case.'' "
Hackers Breach 53 Universities and Dump Thousands of Personal Records Online,"Hackers published online Monday thousands of personal records from 53 universities, including Harvard, Stanford, Cornell, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, the University of Zurich and other universities around the world.The group of hackers, calling themselves Team GhostShell, claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter and published some 36,000 e-mail addresses and thousands of names, usernames, passwords, addresses and phone numbers of students, faculty and staff, to the Web site Pastebin.com. In most cases the data was already publicly available, but in some instances the records included additional sensitive information such as students' dates of birth and payroll information for university employees.Typically, hackers seek such information because it can be used to steal identities, crack bank accounts or can be sold on the black market. Universities make ripe targets because they store vast numbers of personal records, often in decentralized servers. The records can be a gold mine because students often have pristine credit reputations and do not monitor their account activity and credit scores as vigilantly as adults. Dozens of universities have been plagued by breaches recently. Last August alone, the University of Rhode Island warned that students and faculty that their information may have been exposed. And at the University of Arizona, a student discovered a breach after a Google search exposed her personal information - and that of thousands of others at the university. Smaller computer breaches at Queens College and Marquette University were also reported.In this case, the hackers said they were not motivated by profit but to ""raise awareness towards the changes made in today's education."" In a message accompanying the stolen data, they bemoaned changing education laws in Europe and spikes in tuition fees in the United States. But they also noted that in many cases, the servers they breached had already been compromised.""When we got there, we found that a lot of them have malware injected,"" the hackers wrote on Pastebin.To breach servers, the hackers used a technique known as an SQL injection, in which they exploit a software vulnerability and enter commands that cause a database to dump its contents. In the case of some universities, the hackers breached multiple servers.IdentifyFinder, a firm that works to prevent identify theft from security breaches, analyzed the published data and said it appeared to be legitimate. The company analyzed the data and found 36,623 unique e-mail addresses and tens of thousands of student, faculty and staff names as well as thousands more usernames and passwords, some encrypted but many stored in plain text.Aaron Titus, a spokesman for IdentityFinder, said that in analyzing the hackers' attack methods, there was evidence that in many cases they had been inside the universities' systems for ""at least four months.""Lisa Ann Lapin, a spokeswoman for Stanford University, said that the university discovered the breach Tuesday evening. She confirmed that two departmental Web sites belonging to the university had been accessed, but said the servers ""have been secured.""""Our information security officers consider the breaches to be minor in nature,"" Ms. Lapin said. ""No restricted or prohibited data was compromised, nor was any sensitive or other personal information that could lead to identity theft.""At colleges across the country, some students set up sites that allowed students and faculty to search the leaked data for their information. For instance, at the University of Pennsylvania, Matt Parmett, a junior, created a Web site that made it possible for classmates to search the leaked data by name. "
Q&A: Keeping the PC Safe on the Cheap,"Q.How good is Microsoft's free Security Essentials program? Is it safe to just use that instead of buying antivirus software?A.Microsoft Security Essentials, the company's free security software for Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, can protect a PC from viruses, spyware and other forms of malicious software. The program has gotten generally good reviews in some places and has been deemed to do a ""decent job,"" although it has been knocked for ""long scan times"" and infrequent updates. You cannot beat the price, but free software does have its cost. Unlike a commercial security suite, technical support options for Security Essentials (and other free programs) are comparatively sparse, and sifting through online documentation and forums on Microsoft's Web site is your best source of help. Other security programs may offer additional features as well, like spam filters, parental controls and phishing protection.While the Microsoft Security Essentials price tag (or lack thereof) appeals to many people, there are other free security programs for the PC out there. These include Avast! Free Antivirus, AVG Anti-Virus Free and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Free. Gizmo's Freeware site, among others, has reviews of many free antivirus programs.  "
Lax Security At LinkedIn Is Laid Bare,"SAN FRANCISCO -- LinkedIn is a data company that did not protect its data.Last week, hackers breached the site and stole more than six million of its customers' passwords, which had been only lightly encrypted. They were posted to a Russian hacker forum for all to see.That LinkedIn was attacked did not surprise anyone. Companies' computer systems are attacked every day. Indeed, the CBS music site Lastfm.com and the dating site eHarmony confirmed last week that millions of user passwords were stolen.What has surprised customers and security experts alike is that a company that collects and profits from vast amounts of data had taken a bare-bones approach to protecting it. The breach highlights a disturbing truth about LinkedIn's computer security: there isn't much. Companies with customer data continue to gamble on their own computer security, even as the break-ins increase. ''If they had consulted with anyone that knows anything about password security, this would not have happened,'' said Paul Kocher, president of Cryptography Research, a San Francisco computer security firm.Part of the problem may be that there are few consequences for companies with a devil-may-care attitude toward data. There are no legal penalties. Customers rarely defect. And in LinkedIn's case, its stock price actually rose in the days after the breach.What especially concerns many people on this particular breach was that LinkedIn was not some green start-up or a company unfamiliar with data. After a highly successful initial public offering in May last year, it has piles of cash. It recruits top talent. And it makes money. It also has 160 million members who share their business connections in the hopes of making a broader and more efficient network. And they want their data to be protected.''I expected better from LinkedIn,'' said Craig Robert Smith, a professional musician and product manager at Buzzmedia. ''But I can't delete my account because it's the place to be in terms of getting recruited and networking.''It was not immediately clear how hackers were able to breach the system, how long they had been there, or if they are still poking around inside. LinkedIn does not have a chief security officer whose sole job it is to monitor for breaches. The company says David Henke, its senior vice president for operations, oversees security in addition to other roles, but Mr. Henke declined to speak for this article.On a grading scale of A through F, experts say, LinkedIn, eHarmony and Lastfm.com would get, at best, a ''D'' for password security. The most negligent thing a company can do with users' passwords is store them in plain text. That was the case with RockYou, a gaming site that lost 30 million user passwords in a 2009 breach. The most basic step they can take to protect passwords is camouflage them with basic encryption -- what is known as ''hashing'' -- in which they mash-up a password with a mathematical algorithm and store only the encoded, or ''hashed,'' version.But hackers are a determined bunch. They use automated tools that can test up to a million passwords a second. To crack hashed passwords, they exploit so-called dictionaries, extensive online databases of common passwords and their precalculated hash values. Some sites contain sublists of foreign passwords -- in Finnish, say -- or even religious-themed passwords (''angel,'' ''Jesus'' and ''God'' were among the top 15 LinkedIn passwords cracked). Other hackers use ''rainbow tables,'' which list hash values for nearly every alphanumeric character combination, up to a certain length. Some sites publish as many as 50 billion hash values.To make hackers' jobs more difficult, diligent companies will append a series of random digits to the end of each hashed value, a process known as ''salting,'' which requires only a few more lines of code and can be done at no cost.Salting passwords, security experts say, is Security 101 -- a basic step that LinkedIn, eHarmony and Lastfm.com all failed to take. (An A+ security grade involves hashing passwords with complex cryptographic functions, salting them, hashing the result again and storing those credentials on separate, secure Web servers where hackers cannot easily break in.)''This isn't rocket science,'' Mr. Kocher said.In a blog post after the breach, Vicente Silveira, a director with LinkedIn, said the company had invalidated passwords for compromised accounts and said members would ''benefit from the enhanced security we just recently put in place, which includes hashing and salting of our current password databases.''But Julie Inouye, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn, would not say when the company started hashing and salting its passwords, or why it did not enact these security measures in the first place.On its face, a compromised LinkedIn account -- where people rarely store more than their resume -- would not appear to have broad consequences. But hackers know full well that people tend to use the same password across multiple sites and will test those passwords on Web mail, bank, corporate or brokerage firm accounts, where precious personal and financial data is free for the taking.In this case, hackers posted a list of 6.4 million hashed passwords online and asked others to help crack them. By Thursday, some 60 percent of passwords had already been decoded. Mr. Kocher estimates that some 95 percent will eventually get cracked.In its blog post, LinkedIn noted that the user names associated with those passwords had not been posted online, but security experts say that is probably because whoever breached its systems simply kept those for themselves.''You don't give up the crown jewels so other people can match them up,'' said Jeremiah Grossman, founder and chief technology officer of WhiteHat Security.The motivation of the hackers is apparent. But what mystifies security experts is why breaches keep happening. Mr. Grossman estimates that the cost of setting up proper password, Web server and application security for a company like LinkedIn would be a one-time cost of ''a couple hundred thousand dollars.'' The average breach costs a company $5.5 million, or $194 for each record breached, according to a Symantec-sponsored study by the Ponemon Institute, an organization that tracks data breaches.Mr. Kocher thinks he sees one reason in two charts he consults. One shows the number of airplane fatalities per miles flown, which decreased to one-thousandth of what it was in 1945, with the advent of the Federal Aviation Administration in 1958 and stricter security and maintenance protocols. The other, which charts the number of new computer security threats, shows the opposite. There has been a 10,000-fold increase in the number of new threats since 2002, according to data from Symantec, the antivirus firm.The problem, Mr. Kocher and others security experts say, is a lack of liability. Computer security is not regulated and even as loads of sensitive personal, corporate and financial data gets uploaded daily, companies continue to skimp on basic protections. If 5 percent of airplanes in the United States crashed tomorrow, there would be investigations, lawsuits, a cutback in air travel and airlines' stock prices would most likely suffer. With social networks, Mr. Kocher says, ''People don't vote with their feet.''LinkedIn would not say whether any members had dropped the service since the breach became public on Wednesday, but even as hackers worked diligently to crack its passwords, the company's stock rose 4 percent by the end of the week.''Every time a plane crashes, the F.A.A. investigates and publishes the data in aggregate,'' Mr. Grossman said. ''With breaches, there's no such thing. There's no government agency. We don't know where the bodies are buried, or how they got there.'' "
Q&A: Protecting an Electronic Passport,"Q.What data does an electronic United States passport contain in the smart chip? Is this information safe?A.Passports with an integrated circuit embedded in the back cover have been issued by the United States Department of State for the past several years, and this radio-frequency identification (RFID) chip contains several pieces of information. Specialized RFID chip readers can read the stored information at a close distance.An electronic version of the passport's data page is stored on the chip, as well as a unique chip-identification number and a digital signature designed to verify and protect stored data from tampering. The chip also holds a digital image of the passport holder's photograph - which can be used as a biometric identifier with face-recognition systems. According to the State Department's Web site, the agency has taken several measures to help protect the chip's data from intruders. The protections include cryptographic keys stored on the chip that allow only authorized electronic readers to scan the data. The passport's cover also uses metallic material that blocks radio frequency (RF) waves so that the passport must be open for someone with an RFID chip reader to gain access to its electronic data. Third-party passport covers designed to block RF waves are also available for those who want increased protection; budget-minded travelers have been known to wrap the passport in aluminum foil to inhibit unauthorized RFID activity.

An App for Watching for Personal Data Breaches,"Want to know if your identity has been stolen? Or if your or your child's Social Security number is being pawned off on the Internet?There's an app for that.On Wednesday, AllClear ID, an identity protection service that scans the Internet for stolen information, will offer a free mobile app for the iPhone and iPad to alert users when their personal or financial records have been compromised. The free app alerts users if their credit card and Social Security numbers have been stolen or if thieves are using their child's identity. (Not-so-fun fact: Your child is 51 more times likely to become a victim of identity theft than you.)Once users get alerts, they have the option of speaking with an AllClear ID investigator to manage their case. The company said it would charge consumers only for premium features like credit monitoring and a $1 million identity theft insurance policy, which cost $14.95 a month.The mobile app will siphon information from the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, an organization that works with law enforcement agencies and companies like PayPal and Microsoft as a repository for stolen consumer information. Any time these agencies or companies encounter stolen credentials, they send it to the alliance. Until now, the alliance reported any stolen credentials to the companies that issued them. The AllClear ID mobile app is the first time the alliance will be able to alert consumers directly.""This is the first time there has been a bridge between the front line and consumers,"" Bo Holland, All Clear ID's chief executive, said in an interview on Monday. ""It will make a big difference in slowing this crime down.""This is AllClear ID's first foray into the consumer space. The company was founded in 2004 as Debix. It typically worked with large companies after a security breach to protect consumers' identities. Sony enlisted the service after it was hacked last year. So did the State of Ohio.Judging by the growing number of security breaches these days, that's a lucrative endeavor. Among AllClearID's shareholders are Facebook's former financial officer, Gideon Yu, and its former security chief, Max Kelly. "
"After a Data Breach, Visa Removes a Service Provider","Visa removed Global Payments, an Atlanta company that helps the payment giant process transactions for merchants, from its list of ''compliant service providers.''A security breach at Global Payments reported on Friday was thought to have compromised up to three million credit card accounts. It is among a group of companies that act as the plumbing in the electronic transaction chain, authorizing millions of transactions a day. That makes the companies prime targets for data thieves looking to steal richly detailed financial information. The details of the data breach are still unknown, but bank officials said Friday that they were told by Visa and MasterCard that the breach happened between late January and late February. The hackers gained access to what is known as Track 1 and Track 2 data, which includes names, card numbers and validation codes.Ahead of a scheduled conference call, Global Payments announced on Sunday that hackers had compromised only 1.5 million card numbers. In a statement, the company also reassured investors and customers that the data theft was limited to Track 2 data and did no include Social Security numbers, addresses or cardholder names. ''Based on the forensic analysis to date, network monitoring and additional security measures, the company believes that this incident is contained,'' the company said in the statement. That's not enough to earn Global Payments a spot on Visa's approved provider list. In a statement Sunday, Visa confirmed its decision to remove Global Payments from its list of approved providers. The decision was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.''Based on Global Payments' reported unauthorized access, Visa removed the company'' from its list of providers, Visa said in a statement.Amy Corn, a spokeswoman for Global Payments, said the company expected to be reinstated, but she did not indicate how long that would take. ''We continue to process transactions for our merchants and customers with the same efficiency and care that they have come to expect,'' she said. "
Two British Men Admit Role In Series of Computer Attacks,"LONDON (AP) -- Two British hackers linked to the notorious Lulz Security group pleaded guilty on Monday to several computer crimes, the latest blow against online criminals whose exploits have grabbed headlines and embarrassed governments around the world. The hackers, Ryan Cleary, 20, and Jake Davis, 19, pleaded guilty to conspiring with other members of LulzSec to attack government, media and law enforcement Web sites last year, according to Gryff Waldron, an official at Southwark Crown Court in London.LulzSec, an offshoot of the loose-knit hacker movement known as Anonymous, has claimed responsibility for assaults on sites run by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Public Broadcasting Service in the United States, and the media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News International. Other targets included Nintendo, Sony, the National Health Service in Britain and the Arizona state police.Mr. Waldron said two other defendants -- Ryan Ackroyd, 25, and an unnamed 17-year-old -- had pleaded not guilty to the same charges and would face trial in April 2013.All four defendants have denied charges of encouraging or assisting others to commit computer offenses and fraud. Mr. Waldron said British prosecutors were still weighing whether to take Mr. Cleary and Mr. Davis to court on the remaining charges.LulzSec, whose name draws on Internet slang for ''laugh out loud,'' shot to prominence in mid-2011 with an eye-catching attack on PBS, whose Web site it defaced with an article claiming that the late rapper Tupac Shakur had been found alive in New Zealand.It was an opening shot in what became several months of data theft, online vandalism and denial-of-service attacks, which try to swamp Web sites with excess traffic.The hackers repeatedly humbled law enforcement -- stealing data from InfraGard, a partner organization of the F.B.I.; briefly jamming the Web site of the Serious Organized Crime Agency of Britain; and publishing a large cache of e-mails from the Arizona Department of Public Safety.The spree focused attention on Anonymous, a loose-knit collection of activists -- many of whom have taken on governments, officials or corporations over a variety of grievances.Members of LulzSec and its reputed leader, known as Sabu, were some of the best known in the movement. But in March, officials in the United States unmasked Sabu as an F.B.I. informant named Hector Xavier Monsegur, and officials on both sides of the Atlantic arrested roughly half a dozen people who were suspected of collaborating.

"More Data Thefts Affect Individuals, Verizon Report Finds"," Of the 855 data thefts that were reported to law enforcement authorities last year, 97 percent could have been avoided through basic, relatively inexpensive safety measures, according to an annual report released on Thursday by Verizon.The majority of those thefts, 58 percent, were carried out by so-called hacktivists, or hackers with an ideological agenda, the report concludes. But it's worth bearing in mind that Verizon's tally does not include heists that private companies kept to themselves. Hacktivists who operate under the banner of Anonymous and its offshoots disclose their handiwork - usually by broadcasting it on Twitter and dumping their stolen goods on Pastebin and BitTorrent. ""The online world was rife with the clashing of ideals, taking the form of activism, protests, retaliation and pranks,"" Verizon wrote in its report.Unlike in the past, the impact of data breaches on individuals has become acute. In 2011, 95 percent of the stolen data included what is known as personally identifiable information: names, e-mail addresses and Social Security numbers, which are all targets of Anonymous and its affiliates. By contrast, in 2010, only 1 percent of the stolen data included such individual information.Where did the thieves come from? Nearly 70 percent of the breaches originated in Eastern Europe. Two-thirds of all breaches required ""low"" or ""very low"" skill levels.Verizon recommended that businesses, small and large, take basic steps to protect themselves, including installing firewalls, changing default credentials to log onto Web sites and analyzing ""event logs"" of network traffic for suspicious activity. Among its recommendations is one that is perhaps the easiest and most humanly difficult: at a time when storing huge amounts of data is easy and cheap, security experts urge that companies destroy information when it is no longer essential.When a hacktivist group penetrated the network of Stratfor, a geopolitical risk analysis company, in December, it found five years' worth of e-mail communications, which WikiLeaks in turn released onto the Internet.

Google Warns of New State-Sponsored Cyberattack Targets,"In June, many Google users were surprised to see an unusual greeting at the top of their Gmail inbox, Google home page or Chrome browser. ""Warning: We believe state-sponsored attackers may be attempting to compromise your account or computer.""On Tuesday, tens of thousands more Google users will begin to see that message. The company said that since it started alerting users to malicious -- probably state-sponsored -- activity on their computers in June, it has picked up thousands more instances of cyberattacks than it anticipated.Mike Wiacek, a manager on Google's information security team, said in an interview on Tuesday that since Google started to alert users to state-sponsored attacks three months ago, it had gathered new intelligence about attack methods and the groups deploying them. He said the company was using that information to warn ""tens of thousands of new users"" that they may have been targets, starting on Tuesday.By Tuesday afternoon, several people -- many of them American journalists and foreign policy experts -- had already taken to Twitter to say they had seen the warning. Noah Schactman, the editor of Wired's national security blog ""Danger Room,"" tweeted: ""Aaaaand I just got Google's 'you may be a victim of a state-sponsored attack' notice. #WhatTookYouSoLong?"" Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, also reported getting the message.  As did Joshua Foust, a fellow at the American Security Project, a nonprofit research organization, who has written extensively about Afghanistan.Mr. Wiacek noted that Google had seen an increase in state-sponsored activity coming from the Middle East. He declined to call out particular countries, but he said the activity was coming from ""a slew of different countries"" in the region.Those findings triangulate with recent discoveries by security researchers that Middle Eastern states, including Iran, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, have used spyware to monitor citizens and activists overseas.Last week, several American banks were hit with cyberattacks by hackers claiming Middle Eastern ties. Security researchers have said they have noticed an increase in cyberattacks originating in the region. ""We absolutely have seen more activity from the Middle East, and in particular Iran has been increasingly active as they build up their cybercapabilities,"" George Kurtz, the president of CrowdStrike, a computer security company, said in a recent interview.Mr. Wiacek said there were several steps Google users, especially those who get its warning, could take to protect themselves, like changing their e-mail and account passwords, enabling Google's two-step authentication service and running their computer software updates.

Researchers Say They Took Down World's Third-Largest Botnet,"On Wednesday, computer security experts took down Grum, the world's third-largest botnet, a cluster of infected computers used by cybercriminals to send spam to millions of people. Grum, computer security experts say, was responsible for roughly 18 percent of global spam, or 18 billion spam messages a day.Computer security experts blocked the botnet's command and control servers in the Netherlands and Panama on Tuesday. But later that day, Grum's architects had already set up seven new command and control centers in Russia and Ukraine. FireEye, a computer security company based in Milpitas, Calif., said it worked with its counterparts in Russia and with SpamHaus, a British organization that tracks and blocks spam, to take down those command and control centers Wednesday morning.The researchers said they were able to vanquish the botnet by tracing Grum back to its servers and alerting Internet service providers to shut those computers down.Technologists have taken the lead in combating digital crime rather than waiting for law enforcement authorities to act. Earlier this year, Microsoft employees assisted federal marshals in a raid on botnet servers in Pennsylvania and Illinois. Those servers were used by criminals to run Zeus, a botnet that siphoned people's personal information, like online bank account passwords and credit card numbers, from infected computers. Almost simultaneously, a separate group of cybersecurity researchers in San Francisco were busy eliminating another botnet, called Kelihos.b, which was used to send spam.While computer security companies are quick to publicize botnet takedowns, their gains tend to be temporary. The blocking of Kelihos.b lasted less than a week before a modified version of the botnet started infecting computers. Microsoft's takedown of Waledac, another spam botnet in 2010, lasted only as long as the time it took its creators to modify its architecture slightly and create a new botnet.So what's to say Grum's creators will not just run their botnet from a new command and control center tomorrow?""It's not about creating a new server. They'd have to start an entirely new campaign and infect hundreds of thousands of new machines to get something like Grum started again,"" said Atif Mushtaq, a computer security specialist at FireEye.""They'd have to build from scratch. Because of how the malware was written for Grum, when the master server is dead, the infected machines can no longer send spam or communicate with a new server."" "
Daily Report: Cybersecurity Bill Blocked by G.O.P. Filibuster,"A cybersecurity bill that had been one of the Obama administration's top national security priorities was blocked by a Republican filibuster in the Senate on Thursday, severely limiting its prospects this year, reports Michael S. Schmidt on Friday in The New York Times.The Senate voted 52 to 46 to cut off debate, falling short of the 60 needed to force a final vote on the measure, which had bipartisan support but ran into a fight over what amendments to the legislation could be proposed.The bill's most vocal opponents were a group of Republican senators led by John McCain of Arizona, who took the side of businesses and steadfastly opposed the legislation, arguing that it would be too burdensome for corporations. On Bits, Several Silicon Valley security experts shared their take on the bill, the cyber threat and the potential, as some have warned, for a 9/11-style cyberattack. The bill would have established optional standards for the computer systems that oversee the country's critical infrastructure, like power grids, dams and transportation.In the hopes of winning over Mr. McCain and the other Republicans, the bill had been significantly watered down in recent weeks by its sponsors, led by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who made the standards optional. Original versions of the bill said the standards would be mandatory and gave the government the power to enforce them.The legislation is likely to come up again in the fall, though few are optimistic about its prospects. "
Cybersecurity Bill Dies Under Weight of Partisan Bickering,"No amount of death-and-destruction talk about the prospects of cyberattacks on the nation's nuclear power plants and water systems could override the intense partisanship on Capitol Hill.The cybersecurity bill, already heavily rewritten to reflect opposition from industry groups and their political allies, died in the Senate on  Thursday. It was unable to muster enough support in a procedural cloture vote.The bill reflects a confluence of concerns over civil liberties and national security, not to mention the difficulty of forging any agreement during an election year.The bill was introduced by Senators  Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, and Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine. It was originally intended to allow the government to enforce minimum security standards for the computer systems that govern critical infrastructure systems. But industry opposition compelled the backers of the bill to make it voluntary.What survived was largely a measure to allow private companies and government agencies to share information about cybersecurity threats. Responding to civil libertarians' worries about the military snooping on private communications, the Obama administration took pains to let the Department of Homeland Security be the main government hub, rather than the National Security Agency. Administration officials expended a great deal of political energy trying to get the bill through the Senate. In the end,  dozens of amendments were attached to it, and it failed to attract the 60 votes needed to get through cloture.It is likely to come up again in the fall, though few are optimistic about its prospects.

2 Israeli Web Sites Crippled As Cyberwar Escalates,"JERUSALEM -- Israel faced an escalating cyberwar on Monday as unknown attackers disrupted access to the symbolically strategic Web sites of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and El Al, the national airline. A hacker identifying himself as oxOmar, already notorious for posting the details of more than 20,000 Israeli credit cards, sent an overnight warning to Israel's Ynet news outlet that a group of pro-Palestinian cyberattackers called Nightmare planned to bring down the sites in the morning.The attackers did not break into the sites' operating systems, but used a far simpler tactic: creating an overload of access attempts. Neither the Israeli economy nor flights in and out of the country were endangered, and the sites appeared to be recovering within hours, but the assault left many Israelis feeling vulnerable.Yoni Shemesh, who is responsible for the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Web site, said that his team had already begun preparing for an attack a few days ago and went on high alert after the Ynet report.''We are putting up blocks to the hackers,'' he told Israel Radio at noon, about three hours after the attack started. ''It is a real cyberwar.''El Al said it took down its site as a cautionary measure as soon as unusual activity was noticed about 10 a.m.The Web site usually sees about 50 simultaneous access requests at any given moment in the morning hour, according to a spokeswoman for the airline, speaking anonymously per policy. ''As soon as we saw that the number had risen to about 1,000, we closed it down,'' she said.A spokesman for Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, praised the hackers for opening up a new resistance front against Israel.Israel is widely considered a technological powerhouse and a hub of high-tech industry. But Avi Weissman, the chief executive of See Security InfoSec and Cyber Warfare College and chairman of the Israeli Forum for Information Security, a nonprofit organization, told the radio that in the cyberrealm, Israel may be a power ''in terms of attack, but in terms of defense, we are a very small and pretty neglected country.Professor Yitzhak Ben Yisrael, a military scientist who has advised the government on cybersecurity, said that the country had been working to protect its most vital systems in the security establishment and in the civilian sphere, including electricity, water and trains, for more than 10 years.The hacker oxOmar described himself as a 19-year-old from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, when he posted the details of the thousands of Israeli credit cards, turning himself into a household name here. A few days later, a hacker presenting himself as an Israeli and going by the name oxOmer -- a twist of the Saudi handle -- countered by posting details of what he said were more than 200 Saudi credit cards. But he did not expose the security codes, saying his aim was only to ''alert.'' "
Google Is Asked to Delay Privacy Shift,"BRUSSELS -- European governments, supported by the top justice official in the European Union, are pressing Google to halt coming changes to its privacy policies while they investigate the implications for personal data protection.The move is a shot across the bow for a range of companies, including Facebook, that rely on the European market of 500 million people for a hefty chunk of their business. It comes amid a new drive to make privacy protection in Europe -- where people are generally more wary than Americans about surveillance by companies and governments -- more coherent and efficient.Viviane Reding, the E.U. justice commissioner, called on European authorities Friday ''to ensure that E.U. law is fully complied with in Google's new privacy policy.'' She was backing a request sent Thursday by national data protection authorities to Google, asking that the search engine company suspend its plans to change its privacy policies on March 1 while they conduct an inquiry into the implications for citizens and users.The authorities wrote to Larry Page, the chief executive of Google, to ''call for a pause in the interests of ensuring that there can be no misunderstanding about Google's commitments to information rights of their users and E.U. citizens.''Ms. Reding said Friday that the investigation would help give ''legal certainty for citizens and businesses.''The European action follows the announcement by Google in late January that it would combine about 60 privacy policies for separate products to create a simple system for users that also satisfied the wishes of regulators.The changes also would mean that Google could use information shared on one Google service in other Google services for people logged into a Google account. For example, Google could guide a user who had looked for recipes using the Google search engine to relevant cooking videos the next time that person signed in to YouTube, which is also owned by Google.The company said Friday that it was prepared to answer any questions raised by the investigation but gave no indication that it would delay the changes. Instead, it suggested that any delay instituting the new policy would harm rather than help the 350 million users it had already notified about the changes.''As part of announcing our new privacy policy, we've made the largest communication to users in our history,'' said Alistair Verney, a Google spokesman in Europe. ''Delaying the new policy would cause significant confusion.''The French data privacy regulator, known as CNIL, is conducting the investigation on behalf of 26 other E.U. governments. CNIL said Friday that there was no formal deadline for completing the inquiry. ''Of course, we're going to try to do it as quickly as possible,'' said Gwendal Le Grand, an official at CNIL.He said the timing would depend on how long it took investigators to sift through the changes and evaluate the implications, and on how long it took Google to respond to further questions.The investigation is the clearest sign so far of a new drive to streamline privacy protection in Europe. That effort, led by Ms. Reding, would require national authorities to delegate a single country, most likely where a company is based, to conduct privacy investigations.Google has opened a large office in Paris, but the company said its European headquarters were in Dublin.Mr. Le Grand, the French official, said his agency had the power to fine companies up to --100,000, or about $132,000, for a first offense and up to --300,000 for repeat offenses.But the fact that a member state is conducting the inquiry, rather than E.U. authorities in Brussels, illustrates how European laws remain a hodgepodge, particularly in the area of justice and home affairs.Under a new law proposed by Ms. Reding, which still must be approved by the European Parliament and E.U. governments, member states still would lead such investigations.Ms. Reding would get added power under the new law to sue a member state that conducted an inquiry improperly, for example by failing to delegate an investigation to a single authority in Europe, like the French agency, or by failing to take into account her opinion or the opinions of other governments.The investigation into Google also seems to reflect a degree of coordination with like-minded counterparts in the U.S. Congress.Eight members of the House of Representatives, including Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, and Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, sent Mr. Page a formal request for information about Google's new privacy policy on Jan. 26. The letter contained 11 questions about the new policy, including whether consumers could opt out of the new system, either globally or on a product-by-product basis.The privacy policy investigation is just the latest challenge to Google in Europe. The European Commission, the E.U. executive agency, already is investigating the giant Internet search and advertising company for possible breaches of antitrust laws. The commission could send formal charges to Google this spring.The commission also is considering whether to approve the purchase by Google of Motorola Mobility, a maker of smartphones.In recent years European authorities have also been disturbed by the way Google has treated privacy issues in Germany and in other countries related to its Street View mapping service and by the ramifications of Google's project to digitize books.The letter sent to Google on Thursday came from a so-called Article 29 Working Party representing the 27 national data protection authorities across the Union. The group's name comes from the E.U. directive on data protection that established it.''Given the wide range of services you offer, and popularity of these services, changes in your privacy policy may affect many citizens in most or all of the E.U. member states,'' Jacob Kohnstamm, the chairman of the working party and of the Dutch Data Protection Authority, wrote to Mr. Page. ''We wish to check the possible consequences for the protection of the personal data of these citizens in a coordinated procedure,'' Mr. Kohnstamm wrote.In a three-page response posted on Friday afternoon on Google's Web site, Peter Fleischer, the global privacy counsel for Google, wrote that there had been ''misconceptions that have been spread about these changes by some of our competitors.''Mr. Fleischer explained that the company had briefed data authorities across the European Union before the announcement and that at ''no stage did any E.U. regulator suggest that any sort of pause would be appropriate.''David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

France Says Google Plan Violates Law,"PARIS -- The French data protection authority said on Tuesday that Google's new privacy policy appeared to violate European Union law.Google announced the new policy last month, billing it as a way to streamline and simplify the privacy practices it employed worldwide across about 60 different online services, and to introduce greater clarity for users.But the French privacy agency, the National Commission for Computing and Civil Liberties, said in a letter to Larry Page, Google's co-founder and chief executive, that the proposed policy was murky in the details of how the company would use private data. Google and other Internet companies gather personal information in an effort to build anonymous profiles of users, helping them to sell advertising. ''Rather than promoting transparency, the terms of the new policy and the fact that Google claims publicly that it will combine data across services raises fears about Google's actual practices,'' the letter from the French privacy agency, known as CNIL, said. ''Our preliminary investigation shows that it is extremely difficult to know exactly which data is combined between which services for which purposes, even for trained privacy professionals.''The warning to Google carries potential implications for other European Union countries, because in this case the French regulator was acting at the request of an advisory panel to the European Commission, which asked the French agency to conduct an initial assessment of the Google privacy changes. The new rules were set to come into effect on Thursday.Meanwhile, the commission is in the process of overhauling its privacy rules to bring them in line with the era of the Internet and cloud computing. The commissioner in charge of privacy, Viviane Reding, has called for streamlined privacy rules, which currently vary widely across the European Union, with separate enforcement bodies like the French privacy agency overseeing national guidelines.Google is also facing an antitrust investigation in Brussels, where the European Commission is scrutinizing its dominant position in Internet search. The privacy policies of individual Google services, especially its StreetView mapping feature, have also been investigated in a number of European Union countries.Ms. Reding had already asked Google to delay adoption of the new privacy policy while regulators assessed its compatibility with European Union law. But the company reiterated on Tuesday that it had no intention of doing so.''We are confident that our new simple, clear and transparent privacy policy respects all European data protection laws and principles,'' Peter Fleischer, Google's chief privacy counsel, wrote in a letter to the French privacy agency. He said the company had tried unsuccessfully to meet with the agency to discuss the changes.''Like all companies, we have struggled with the conundrum of how to pursue both of the CNIL's recommendations: How to 'streamline and simplify' our privacy policies, while at the same time providing 'comprehensive information' to our users,'' Mr. Fleischer's letter states.The French privacy agency said in its letter that it would send Google a ''full questionnaire'' about its privacy policies by mid-March.In addition to issuing warnings, the French privacy agency has the power to fine companies up to 300,000 euros ($400,000) for privacy breaches in France. It can also seek court orders to try to stop companies from engaging in practices that are deemed to violate data protection laws. Enforcement in other European countries would be up to individual data protection authorities.Google's new privacy policy applies to services like the YouTube online video platform, the Android mobile phone software and the Google search engine. Users were notified of the changes via e-mail and postings on the relevant sites, among other methods.The proposed changes have also attracted scrutiny in the United States, where privacy advocates have urged Congress to look into the new policy.Big Brother Watch, a British privacy advocate, published a study on Tuesday that said only 12 percent of Google users had read the new policy. Forty-seven percent were unaware of the changes, the study showed.''Google is putting advertisers' interests before user privacy and should not be rushing ahead before the public understand what the changes will mean,'' the group said in a statement posted on its Web site. "
Unanswered Questions in F.C.C.'s Google Case,"One of the most audacious projects ever to come out of Google was the plan to photograph and map the inhabited world, one block at a time. But a report over the weekend from federal regulators has rekindled questions over exactly what the company was doing -- questions the search giant has spent years trying not to answer.The Federal Communications Commission censured Google for obstructing an inquiry into the Street View project, which had collected Internet communications from potentially millions of unknowing households as specially equipped cars drove slowly by.But the investigation, described in an interim report, was left unresolved because a critical participant, the Google engineer in charge of the project, cited his Fifth Amendment right and declined to talk. It is unclear who else at Google might have known about the data gathering, or when they might have known. Google maintains that the data gathering was unauthorized, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, but the engineer is maintaining that other people at the company knew about it.Google was fined $25,000 for obstruction, a penalty it can challenge. It and the F.C.C. are wrangling over how much information can be revealed in the final report. In the interim report, many passages were heavily redacted.Privacy advocates said the F.C.C. report was only a start.''I appreciate that the F.C.C. sanctioned Google for not cooperating in the investigation, but the much bigger problem is the pervasive and covert surveillance of Internet users that Google undertook over a three-year period,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. He said that on Monday he would ask the Justice Department to investigate Google over wiretapping.Google said Sunday that it disagreed with the F.C.C.'s characterization of its lack of cooperation, but that its collection of what is called payload data -- Internet communications, including texts and e-mails -- was legal, if regrettable. ''It was a mistake for us to include code in our software that collected payload data, but we believe we did nothing illegal,'' a spokeswoman said.As part of the Street View project, as Google was collecting photographs on every street, it was also gathering information about local wireless networks to improve location-based searches.But the Google engineer wrote a program for the project that went beyond what was originally envisioned. Using this program, Google collected unencrypted data sent by computers.The data proved be a snapshot of what people were doing at the moment the cars rolled by -- e-mailing a lover, texting jokes to a buddy, balancing a checkbook, looking up an ailment. Google spent more than two years scooping up that information, from January 2008 to April 2010.The photographs were used to refine Google's maps, the wireless information to improve searches. Google had not figured out what, if anything, to do with the personal data, nor had it even looked at it, when rumors about the secret project began in 2010.Google first said it had not collected personal data. Then it said such data was in fragments. Then it conceded there were things like entire e-mails. People, mostly in Europe, were furious.Even in the United States, where regulators take a more restrained approach to privacy issues than in Europe, there was widespread concern. A multistate inquiry was begun by state attorneys general. The Federal Trade Commission looked into it.Google, by simultaneously apologizing, promising to do better and saying as little as possible, made the issue go away.Coincidentally, the F.C.C. opened its investigation of the Street View project on the same day in October 2010 that the F.T.C. ended its inquiry.While staff members from the two entities spoke about their efforts, they were looking at potential violations of different statutes and their investigations took place separately.Some F.C.C. staff members argued strongly that Google should be charged with a violation of the Communications Act, and the agency and Google spent weeks debating whether Google had violated the Wiretap Act or the Communications Act.The F.C.C.'s enforcement division finally declined to charge Google with violating the Communications Act after determining that there was no precedent for applying the statute to Wi-Fi communications. But by publicly reprimanding Google for its conduct, the F.C.C. is hoping that Congress will see that the law has not kept up with advances in digital communications and will rewrite the statutes. Encryption technology did not exist when the Communications Act was written.Google argued that the few precedents that do apply favor a broad interpretation of what is permissible under the two laws.People close to the discussion said that determination was affected by inconsistent language between the two statutes. The Communications Act prohibits intercepting radio communications ''except as authorized by'' the Wiretap Act.The Wiretap Act says it is ''not unlawful to'' intercept unencrypted communication, but it does not give specific permission for the interception of unencrypted communications.Federal courts have generally given a broad interpretation, however. But the F.C.C. was not able to determine if there had been actions that clearly would violate the statutes -- say, if Google intercepted and made use of encrypted information -- because the Google engineer who would know invoked his Fifth Amendment right.The determination not to charge Google with a Communications Act violation was made by the enforcement division staff. Google can decide whether to oppose the obstruction charge and fight the fine, eventually taking the fight to the five-member commission and perhaps to federal court.In Europe, where the outcry against Google was greatest, most government data protection regulators have settled their disputes with the company.Some countries, like Ireland, asked Google in 2010 to simply destroy the data it had gathered illegally in their jurisdictions. Google informed Ireland and other countries that it had done so and no penalties were levied.On April 5, the Dutch Data Protection Authority closed its investigation after Google gave residents in the Netherlands the option of removing their Wi-Fi routers from Google's global tracking database.But in Germany, where Google's collection of personal data was first uncovered by a regulator in Hamburg, two proceedings are officially up and running.The Hamburg prosecutor's office is still pursuing a criminal investigation, which it opened in May 2010, into whether Google broke German law by illegally intercepting private data through electronic means.Johannes Caspar, the Hamburg regulator, said in a recent interview that he was delaying his own administrative review of the situation until the Hamburg prosecutor decides whether or not to press criminal charges.J. Trevor Hughes, president of the International Association of Privacy Professionals, said the Google case represented what happened when technical employees of technology companies made ''innocent'' decisions about collecting data that could infuriate consumers and in turn invite regulatory inquiry.''This is one of the most significant risks we see in the information age today,'' he said. ''Project managers and software developers don't understand the sensitivity associated with data.'' "
F.T.C. Seeks Tighter Rules On Web Sites For Children,"WASHINGTON -- Seeking to further tighten rules on online collection or disclosure of children's personal information, the Federal Trade Commission proposed restrictive requirements on Wednesday on companies and Web sites that target youths or that have young audiences.The proposal expands restrictions that the commission originally proposed last fall after it found that regulations governing the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act had not kept up with advances in Internet technology. The commission's proposals were released publicly after they were first disclosed by The Wall Street Journal.If adopted by the commission, the proposed rules would dictate that both the operator of a Web site that is directed at children and any third-party advertising network or application -- like a company that provides the software behind a chat function -- would be responsible for complying with the child privacy law, generally known as Coppa.The act already requires Web companies to notify parents and obtain consent when personal information is collected from children under the age of 13. But the law, which took effect in 2000 -- four years before the start-up of Facebook -- did not envision the now common practice of including add-ons on children's sites.As written, the privacy act applies to a Web site operator, but not to a third-party supplier of other functions, said Mary K. Engle, associate director of advertising practices at the F.T.C. ''The proposal would close an apparent or possible loophole in the rule,'' she said.Other tweaks in the proposed rule would address sites that are used by both children and adults. Where the current rule treats all visitors as being under 13, the proposed rule would allow a Web site that attracts both children and adults to screen users by asking their age and applying the privacy protections only to those who say they are under 13.That kind of self-reporting can be manipulated. Facebook, for example, currently requires a user to be at least 13, but many children misrepresent their age, often with parental permission.In a comment to the commission addressing the changes proposed last year, Facebook said that it had tiered screening, including ''technical checks at sign-up, social verifications and reports from our community to help identify child accounts,'' which were deleted once they are identified.Facebook is reported to be considering opening itself to younger users. Until it does so, the proposed rules would not directly apply to the company's social network site. But it would apply, Ms. Engle said, to instances where Web sites directed at children include one of Facebook's ''like'' buttons or a similar application.Web sites whose overall content is likely to attract children under 13 as their primary audience would be required to treat all users as children, even if the site attracted some teenagers and older users.Some consumer groups support the stricter proposals. Ioana Rusu, regulatory counsel for the Consumers Union, said in a statement that the proposal made ''it clear to industry partners that protecting children's online privacy is a shared priority.''The commission also has proposed modifying its definition of personal information that can be collected from youth. The proposed rules say that includes any ''persistent identifier'' that can be used ''to recognize a user over time, or across different sites or services'' would be covered, except in certain instances.Those exceptions include contextual advertisements to users but not the use of behaviorally targeted advertising. Also allowed are the use of persistent identifiers for maintaining user preferences or protecting against fraud.Public comments on the proposals will be received by the F.T.C. until Sept. 10.The regulations, which the commission intends to complete by the end of the year, are the result of a review begun in 2010. That was the commission's first review of the privacy act since 2005. "
Web Sites Accused of Collecting Data on Children,"A coalition of nearly 20 children's advocacy, health and public interest groups plans to file complaints with the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday, asserting that some online marketing to children by McDonald's and four other well-known companies violates a federal law protecting children's privacy.The law, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, requires Web site operators to obtain verifiable consent from parents before collecting personal information about children under age 13. But, in complaints to the F.T.C., the coalition says six popular Web sites aimed at children have violated that law by encouraging children who play brand-related games or engage in other activities to provide friends' e-mail addresses -- without seeking prior parental consent. At least one company, however, said the accusation mischaracterized its practices, adding that the law allows an exception for one-time use of a friend's e-mail address. As of late Tuesday, the companies said they had not received copies of the complaints. Obtaining information about adults' social networks to e-mail marketing messages to their friends is a common industry practice called ''tell a friend'' or ''refer a friend.'' But now an increasing number of children's sites are using the technique by inviting children to make customized videos promoting certain products, for example, and then sending them to friends.The sites cited by the advocacy groups include McDonald's HappyMeal.com; Nick.com, the Nickelodeon site owned by Viacom; General Mills' ReesesPuffs.com; SubwayKids.com; another General Mills site, TrixWorld.com; and Turner's CartoonNetwork.com.''It really shows that companies are doing an end run around a law put in place to protect children's privacy,'' said Laura Moy, a lawyer for the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington that led the complaints. ''Under the law, they can't just collect e-mail addresses from kids and send them marketing material directly. So they are embedding messages saying, 'Play this game and share it with your friends,' in order to target the friends.''Other members of the coalition include Public Citizen, the Consumer Federation of America, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale.In their letter to the F.T.C., the groups also ask the agency to investigate additional marketing practices that they claim are unfair or deceptive. These include sites that use computer code to track children's activities online or sites that ask them to upload their photographs.In an e-mail, Tom Forsythe, a spokesman for General Mills, said the company followed approved practices. It does not collect the original child's e-mail address and sends only one e-mail to that child's friend, he said.In an e-mail, James Anderson, a spokesman for Turner, said the Cartoon Network took compliance with the children's online privacy law seriously and would review any accusations closely. A spokesman for Subway said the company takes online privacy seriously and complies with the law.The concerns about certain Web sites aimed at children come as the F.T.C. tries to update children's privacy rules to ensure that the protections keep pace with the latest technology. The agency recently proposed updates to clarify that the rule extended to mobile devices.It would also expand protections beyond children's names and addresses to encompass persistent identifiers like tracking codes that could be used to collect information about individual children as they visited sites without needing to know their names. And it would add photos of children to protected information. "
U.S. Is Tightening Web Privacy Rule To Shield Young,"Federal regulators are about to take the biggest steps in more than a decade to protect children online.The moves come at a time when major corporations, app developers and data miners appear to be collecting information about the online activities of millions of young Internet users without their parents' awareness, children's advocates say. Some sites and apps have also collected details like children's photographs or locations of mobile devices; the concern is that the information could be used to identify or locate individual children.These data-gathering practices are legal. But the development has so alarmed officials at the Federal Trade Commission that the agency is moving to overhaul rules that many experts say have not kept pace with the explosive growth of the Web and innovations like mobile apps. New rules are expected within weeks.''Today, almost every child has a computer in his pocket and it's that much harder for parents to monitor what their kids are doing online, who they are interacting with, and what information they are sharing,'' says Mary K. Engle, associate director of the advertising practices division at the F.T.C. ''The concern is that a lot of this may be going on without anybody's knowledge.'' The proposed changes could greatly increase the need for children's sites to obtain parental permission for some practices that are now popular -- like using cookies to track users' activities around the Web over time. Marketers argue that the rule should not be changed so extensively, lest it cause companies to reduce their offerings for children.''Do we need a broad, wholesale change of the law?'' says Mike Zaneis, the general counsel for the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry association. ''The answer is no. It is working very well.''The current federal rule, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, requires operators of children's Web sites to obtain parental consent before they collect personal information like phone numbers or physical addresses from children under 13. But rapid advances in technology have overtaken the rules, privacy advocates say.Today, many brand-name companies and analytics firms collect, collate and analyze information about a wide range of consumer activities and traits. Some of those techniques could put children at risk, advocates say.Under the F.T.C.'s proposals, some current online practices, like getting children under 13 to submit photos of themselves, would require parental consent.Children who visit McDonald's HappyMeal.com, for instance, can ''get in the picture with Ronald McDonald'' by uploading photos of themselves and combining them with images of the clown. Children may also ''star in a music video'' on the site by uploading photos or webcam images and having it graft their faces onto dancing cartoon bodies.But according to children's advocates, McDonald's stored these images in directories that were publicly available. Anyone with an Internet connection could check out hundreds of photos of young children, a few of whom were pictured in pajamas in their bedrooms, advocates said.In a related complaint to the F.T.C. last month, a coalition of advocacy groups accused McDonald's and four other corporations of violating the 1998 law by collecting e-mail addresses without parental consent. HappyMeal.com, the complaint noted, invites children to share their creations on the site by providing the first names and e-mail addresses of their friends.''When we tell parents about this they are appalled, because basically what it's doing is going around the parents' back and taking advantage of kids' naïveté,'' says Jennifer Harris, the director of marketing initiatives at the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, a member of the coalition that filed the complaint. ''It's a very unfair and deceptive practice that we don't think companies should be allowed to do.''Danya Proud, a spokeswoman for McDonald's, said in an e-mail that the company placed a ''high importance'' on protecting privacy, including children's online privacy. She said that McDonald's had blocked public access to several directories on the site.Last year, the F.T.C. filed a complaint against W3 Innovations, a developer of popular iPhone and iPod Touch apps like Emily's Dress Up, which invited children to design outfits and e-mail their comments to a blog. The agency said that the apps violated the children's privacy rule by collecting the e-mail addresses of tens of thousands of children without their parents' permission and encouraging those children to post personal information publicly. The company later settled the case, agreeing to pay a penalty of $50,000 and delete personal data it had collected about children.It is often difficult to know what kind of data is being collected and shared. Industry trade groups say marketers do not knowingly track young children for advertising purposes. But a study last year of 54 Web sites popular with children, including Disney.go.com and Nick.com, found that many used tracking technologies extensively.''I was surprised to find that pretty much all of the same technologies used to track adults are being used on kids' Web sites,'' said Richard M. Smith, an Internet security expert in Boston who conducted the study at the request of the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group.Using a software program called Ghostery, which detects and identifies tracking entities on Web sites, a New York Times reporter recently identified seven trackers on Nick.com -- including Quantcast, an analytics company that, according to its own marketing material, helps Web sites ''segment out specific audiences you want to sell'' to advertisers.Ghostery found 13 trackers on a Disney game page for kids, including AudienceScience, an analytics company that, according to that company's site, ''pioneered the concept of targeting and audience-based marketing.''David Bittler, a spokesman for Nickelodeon, which runs Nick.com, says Viacom, the parent company, does not show targeted ads on Nick.com or other company sites for children under 13. But the sites and their analytics partners may collect data anonymously about users for purposes like improving content. Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Disney, said the company does not show targeted ads to children and requires its ad partners to do the same.Another popular children's site, Webkinz, says openly that its advertising partners may aim at visitors with ads based on the collection of ''anonymous data.'' In its privacy policy, Webkinz describes the practice as ''online advanced targeting.''If the F.T.C. carries out its proposed changes, children's Web sites would be required to obtain parents' permission before tracking children around the Web for advertising purposes, even with anonymous customer codes.Some parents say they are trying to teach their children basic online self-defense. ''We don't give out birth dates to get the free stuff,'' said Patricia Tay-Weiss, a mother of two young children in Venice, Calif., who runs foreign language classes for elementary school students. ''We are teaching our kids to ask, 'What is the company getting from you and what are they going to do with that information?' '' "
Do Not Track? Advertisers Say 'Don't Tread on Us',"THE campaign to defang the ''Do Not Track'' movement began late last month.Do Not Track mechanisms are features on browsers -- like Mozilla's Firefox -- that give consumers the option of sending out digital signals asking companies to stop collecting information about their online activities for purposes of targeted advertising.First came a stern letter from nine members of the House of Representatives to the Federal Trade Commission, questioning its involvement with an international group called the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, which is trying to work out global standards for the don't-track-me features. The legislators said they were concerned that these options for consumers might restrict ''the flow of data at the heart of the Internet's success.'' Next came an incensed open letter from the board of the Association of National Advertisers to Steve Ballmer, the C.E.O. of Microsoft, and two other company officials. Microsoft had committed a grievous infraction, wrote executives from Dell, I.B.M., Intel, Visa, Verizon, Wal-Mart and other major corporations, by making Do Not Track the default option in the company's forthcoming Internet Explorer 10 browser. If consumers chose to stay with that option, the letter warned, they could prevent companies from collecting data on up to 43 percent of browsers used by Americans.''Microsoft's action is wrong. The entire media ecosystem has condemned this action,'' the letter said. ''In the face of this opposition and the reality of the harm that your actions could create, it is time to realign with the broader business community by providing choice through a default of 'off' on your browser's 'do not track' setting.''So far, Microsoft has shrugged off advertisers' complaints. In an e-mailed statement, Brendon Lynch, Microsoft's chief privacy officer, said a recent company study of computer users in the United States and Europe concluded that 75 percent wanted Microsoft to turn on the Do Not Track mechanism.''Consumers want and expect strong privacy protection to be built into Microsoft products and services,'' Mr. Lynch wrote.The tone of the industry offensive may seem a bit strident, given that the W3C has yet to decide how to implement the don't-track-me mechanisms -- or even what they signify. For the moment, that means the browser buttons are little more than digital bumper stickers whose sentiments companies are free to embrace or entirely ignore.But what is really at stake here is the future of the surveillance economy.The advent of Do Not Track threatens the barter system wherein consumers allow sites and third-party ad networks to collect information about their online activities in exchange for open access to maps, e-mail, games, music, social networks and whatnot. Marketers have been fighting to preserve this arrangement, saying that collecting consumer data powers effective advertising tailored to a user's tastes. In turn, according to this argument, those tailored ads enable smaller sites to thrive and provide rich content.''If we do away with this relevant advertising, we are going to make the Internet less diverse, less economically successful, and frankly, less interesting,'' says Mike Zaneis, the general counsel for the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry group.But privacy advocates argue that in a digital ecosystem where there may be dozens of third-party entities on an individual Web page, compiling and storing information about what a user reads, searches for, clicks on or buys, consumers should understand data mining's potential costs to them and have the ability to opt out.''If you are looking up the word 'cancer' '' on a health site, says Dan Auerbach, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group in San Francisco, ''there's a high probability that you have cancer or are interested in that. This is the sort of data that can be collected.'' He adds: ''Consumers absolutely have a right to know how their information is being used and to opt out of having their information used in ways they don't like.''But the two sides seem to have reached an impasse. When the W3C met recently in Amsterdam to hammer out Do Not Track standards, as my colleague Kevin J. O'Brien reported in an article earlier this month, advertising industry executives and privacy advocates accused each other of trying to stymie the process.''There is a strong concern that the W3C is not the right forum to be making this decision,'' says Rachel Thomas, the vice president of government affairs at the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group based in Manhattan. ''The attempt to set public policy is entirely outside their area of expertise.''During the Amsterdam meeting, Ms. Thomas proposed that Do Not Track signals should actually permit data collection for advertising purposes, the very thing the mechanisms were designed to control. That provocative idea went over with European privacy advocates about as well as a smoker lighting up in a no-smoking zone full of asthmatics.Indeed, some prominent consumer advocates have interpreted the industry's proposal as an act of bad faith.''While many advertisers do support privacy, there is clearly a rogue element of advertising networks that wants to subvert the process,'' says Jon D. Leibowitz, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. ''Or so it seems to me.''Earlier this year at a White House event, the Digital Advertising Alliance, or D.A.A., an industry consortium, pledged to honor don't-track-me signals so long as the systems required consumers to make an affirmative choice. But last Tuesday, the consortium published guidelines saying that it viewed Microsoft's latest browser setting as an automatic, machine-driven choice preselected by a company -- not a choice actively made by an individual consumer. During the installment process, Microsoft's new software actually does give users a choice of whether to keep the mechanism on, or to turn it off. Nevertheless, the consortium said it would not require members to honor the forthcoming browser's don't-track-me signals.Besides, the D.A.A. has already established its own program for consumers who want to opt out of receiving ads tailored to their online behavior, says Mr. Zaneis, whose own group is a member of that consortium. The consortium remains committed to incorporating browser signals into its program, he says, provided that the systems require consumers to make affirmative choices and give them information on the potential effects of eschewing tailored ads.''We have self-regulation. It's working very well,'' he says. ''Why don't we give that a chance to succeed?''SOME government officials vehemently disagree. In a letter to the F.T.C. earlier this month, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, called the industry program an ''ineffective regime'' riddled with exceptions.''To date, self-regulation for the purposes of consumer privacy protection has failed,'' Mr. Rockefeller wrote.Now regulators are warning that opposition to Do Not Track could backfire on advertisers, by giving browsers more incentive to empower frustrated users.''We might see a technology arms race with browsers racing to see -- by letting consumers block ads -- who can be the most privacy-protective,'' says Mr. Leibowitz of the F.T.C. ''Maybe that's not a bad thing.''E-mail: slipstream@nytimes.com "
"A Trail of Clicks, Culminating in Conflict","Washington is pushing Silicon Valley on children's privacy, and Silicon Valley is pushing back.Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have all objected to portions of a federal effort to strengthen online privacy protections for children. In addition, media giants like Viacom and Disney, cable operators, marketing associations, technology groups and a trade group representing toy makers are arguing that the Federal Trade Commission's proposed rule changes seem so onerous that, rather than enhance online protections for children, they threaten to deter companies from offering children's Web sites and services altogether.''If adopted, the effect of these new rules would be to slow the deployment of applications that provide tremendous benefits to children, and to slow the economic growth and job creation generated by the app economy,'' Catherine A. Novelli, vice president of worldwide government affairs at Apple, wrote in comments to the agency.But the underlying concern, for both the industry and regulators, is not so much about online products for children themselves. It is about the data collection and data mining mechanisms that facilitate digital marketing on apps and Web sites for children -- and a debate over whether these practices could put children at greater risk. In 1998, Congress passed the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act in an effort to give parents control over the collection and dissemination of private information about their children online. The regulation, known as Coppa, requires Web site operators to obtain a parent's consent before collecting personal details, like home addresses or e-mail addresses, from children under 13.Now, federal regulators are preparing to update that rule, arguing that it has not kept pace with advances like online behavioral advertising, a practice that uses data mining to tailor ads to people's online behavior. The F.T.C. wants to expand the types of data whose collection requires prior parental permission to include persistent ID systems, like unique device codes or customer code numbers stored in cookies, if those codes are used to track children online for advertising purposes.The idea is to preclude companies from compiling dossiers on the online activities -- and by extension the health, socioeconomic status, race or romantic concerns -- of individual children across the Web over time.''What children post online or search as part of their homework should not haunt them as they apply to colleges or for jobs,'' Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and co-chairman of the Bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus, said in a recent phone interview. ''YouTube should not be turned into YouTracked.''The agency's proposals have provoked an intense reaction from some major online operators, television networks, social networks, app platforms and advertising trade groups. Some argue that the F.T.C. has overstepped its mandate in proposing to greatly expand the rule's scope.Others say that using ID systems like customer code numbers to track children ''anonymously'' online is benign -- and that collecting information about children's online activities is necessary to deliver the ads that finance free content and services for children.''What is the harm we are trying to prevent here?'' said Alan L. Friel, chairman of the media and technology practice at the law firm Edwards Wildman Palmer. ''We risk losing a lot of the really good educational and entertaining content if we make things too difficult for people to operate the sites or generate revenue from the sites.''The economic issue at stake is much bigger than just the narrow children's audience. If the F.T.C. were to include customer code numbers among the information that requires a parent's consent, industry analysts say, it might someday require companies to get similar consent for a practice that represents the backbone of digital marketing and advertising -- using such code numbers to track the online activities of adults.''Once you've said it's personal information for children that requires consent, you've set the framework for a requirement of consent to be applied to another population,'' Mr. Friel said. ''If it is personal information for someone that's 12, it doesn't cease being personal information when they are 13.''Indeed, many of the F.T.C.'s proposed rule revisions have vocal detractors.Take, for example, the agency's plan to require companies to get a parent's permission before collecting photographs, videos or voice recordings from children under 13. The idea makes sense to some leading privacy researchers, who say that facial recognition technology could allow strangers to identify and possibly contact children.''Because of advances in facial recognition technology, photos are increasingly identifiable by third parties and not anonymous,'' said Alessandro Acquisti, an associate professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.Children, he added, often have difficulty understanding the long-term risks of sharing intimate details like photos of themselves. ''You might get an immediate benefit from uploading a photo because you get your face close to the mascot,'' he said, referring to mascots for food and toy companies, but the cost ''comes much later.''But the proposed regulation of children's photos could interfere with a popular marketing technique that involves encouraging children to submit photos or videos of themselves online as a way to increase their engagement with a brand. Toy makers, for one, say the F.T.C. has gone too far.''So long as reasonable methods to assure that the photo, video or audio file, or facial recognition technology, does not include contact details, this sort of engagement does not pose a privacy risk to kids,'' Carter Keithley, president of the Toy Industry Association, wrote in comments to the F.T.C.An agency proposal to hold sites and apps liable for the data collection practices of their third-party analytics or advertising partners has also met with fierce opposition.The Association for Competitive Technology, a trade group representing more than 5,000 app developers, has estimated that complying with such requirements could cost educational app developers $250 million in legal fees. It could also dissuade some mom-and-pop developers, who rely on free third-party software for features like animation and social networking, from designing products for children, said Morgan Reed, the trade group's executive director.''Children under 13 aren't enough of a market, aren't worthwhile to spend the money on compliance and tolerate the risk of getting it wrong,'' Mr. Reed said.Facebook, which does not allow children who say they are under 13 to register as members, and Twitter, which says its service is not intended for those under 13, have criticized another F.T.C. proposal: to hold third parties liable if they know or have reason to know that they are collecting personal data on children's sites.The social networks say they cannot keep track of the many sites that download their software plug-ins, and therefore cannot know whether they are inadvertently collecting data on children's sites. Google and Apple made a similar argument, telling regulators that app platforms like Android and the iTunes store should not be held liable for the data collection practices of the children's apps they sell.Many children's advocates, however, have urged the agency to impose proposed revisions in full, arguing that a stricter rule is needed to give parents greater control over the many entities that track or show ads to their children online.''Until there are some rules, marketers will continue to use what they have to penetrate children's lives,'' said Kathryn Montgomery, a professor of communications studies at American University who helped lead the effort to get Congress to pass the original children's online privacy law. ''Without constraints, it could easily get out of hand.''Regulators, for their part, said the planned new rule should not inhibit companies from designing apps and sites for children.''The choice they can make is not to engage with children,'' said Phyllis H. Marcus, a senior attorney in the F.T.C.'s division of advertising practices, ''or they may seek parental consent and give robust offerings.'' "
Mediator Joins Contentious Effort to Add a 'Do Not Track' Option to Web Browsing,"Over the last few months, an international effort to give consumers more control over the collection of their online data has devolved into acrimonious discussions, name-calling and witch hunts.The idea was to work out a global standard for ''Do Not Track,'' a computer browser setting that would allow Internet users to signal Web sites, advertising networks and data brokers that they did not want their browsing activities tracked for marketing purposes.But some industry executives involved in the negotiations have questioned the agenda of privacy advocates, saying their efforts threaten to undermine an advertising ecosystem that fuels free online products and services. At the same time, some technology experts and privacy advocates have accused industry executives of stalling and acting in bad faith. Into this rancorous battle steps a new mediator, Peter Swire, a professor of law at Ohio State University and a former White House privacy official during the Clinton administration. On Wednesday, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, the international consortium that has been trying to develop technical Do Not Track standards, said that Mr. Swire would take over as co-chairman of its Tracking Protection Working Group.While parties on both sides welcomed the move, many said they were doubtful that Mr. Swire could bring opponents to agreement, especially at a time when some industry groups are questioning whether the W3C is an appropriate forum.On one hand, industry executives have an interest in protecting ''behavioral'' ads, marketing pitches that use data about an individual's online activities to tailor ads to that person. On the other hand, consumer advocates argue that Internet users should be able to limit that kind of online surveillance.Mr. Swire, a former chief counselor for privacy at the Office of Management and Budget, said he hoped to strike a balance that was palatable to both sides. He said he viewed a Do Not Track system as a kind of digital equivalent to the Do Not Call list, a national registry in the United States through which consumers may opt out of phone solicitations.''People can choose not to have telemarketers call them during dinner. The simple idea is that users should have a choice over how their Internet browsing works as well,'' Mr. Swire said in a phone interview. But he added: ''The overarching theme is how to give users choice about their Internet experience while also funding a useful Internet.''Still, Mr. Swire may not be able to overcome the bitterness that remains among the negotiating parties after months of public accusations, personal attacks and recriminations.Earlier this year at an event at the White House, industry representatives publicly committed to incorporating and honoring a browser-based Do Not Track system under certain conditions. The conditions included a requirement that individual users would actively choose to turn on a don't-track-me setting. Industry groups also said any system should still permit companies to collect information about users' browsing activities for market research and product development purposes.But after months of wrangling with consumer advocates, industry representatives now say the W3C is not an appropriate forum for them to work out policy details, arguing that the group's expertise is more technical than practical.In an online discussion forum for the working group, for example, senior industry executives have suggested that respected technology experts are out of touch with commercial reality.''The advocacy side of the group tends to lean toward absolutist terms and solutions,'' Shane Wiley, the vice president for privacy and data governance at Yahoo, wrote in a message in September to Ed Felten, a professor of computer science and public affairs at Princeton University. ''The real world isn't that easy even if it feels that way in a classroom or a small lab.''Then there are the technologists who say industry executives are playing down the privacy risks of online data-mining.''For want of a better metaphor: you are the climate change skeptic of computer privacy,'' Jonathan Mayer, a graduate student in computer science and law at Stanford University, wrote last month to Yahoo's Mr. Wiley. ''Unlike some of the more patient members of the group, I long ago ceased pretending you're negotiating in good faith.''Now the industry has begun an effort to distance itself from the W3C process and promote its own self-regulatory program that allows consumers to decline targeted advertising by installing opt-out buttons from dozens of member companies.''We've seen the W3C falter,'' said Mike Zaneis, the general counsel for the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry trade group. ''So industry is redoubling its efforts to come up with a meaningful standard for browser controls.''As the debate rages on, newer iterations of popular browsers like Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Google's Chrome have already installed Do Not Track settings for their users. But in the absence of accepted global standards for these systems, ad networks and data brokers are not yet honoring the don't-track-me browser flags. Even Microsoft's and Google's own ad services don't respond to such signals coming from their own browsers.Although Mr. Swire said he hoped to spur progress, for the moment Do Not Track browser settings have no more significance than emoticons.''Do Not Track is a work in progress,'' Mr. Swire said. ''So is the Internet.'' "
Adding to Rules for Online Privacy,"In a move intended to give parents greater control over data collected about their children online, federal regulators on Wednesday broadened longstanding privacy safeguards covering children's mobile apps and Web sites. Members of the Federal Trade Commission said they updated the rules to keep pace with the growing use of mobile phones and tablets by children.The regulations also reflect innovations like voice recognition technology, global positioning systems and behavior-based online advertising, or ads tailored to an individual Internet user. Regulators had not significantly changed the original rule, based on the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, or Coppa. That rule required operators of Web sites directed at children under 13 to notify parents and obtain their permission before collecting or sharing personal information -- like first and last names, phone numbers, home addresses or e-mail addresses -- from children.The intent of that was to give parents control over entities seeking to collect information about their children so that parents could, among other things, prevent unwanted contact by strangers.The new rule, unveiled at a news conference in Washington, significantly expands the types of companies required to obtain parental permission before knowingly collecting personal details from children, as well as the types of information that will require parental consent to collect.Jon D. Leibowitz, the chairman of the trade commission, described the rule revision as a major advance for children's privacy. ''Congress enacted Coppa in the desktop era and we live in an era of smartphones and mobile marketing,'' Mr. Leibowitz said. ''This is a landmark update of a seminal piece of legislation.''The agency's expanded privacy protections for children also represent the first step in a larger effort by a few regulators and legislators to give adult consumers some rights to control data collected about them.''The Coppa rule revisions which we are announcing today are a critical piece in our overall approach to how we deal with consumer privacy in this technological age,'' said Julie Brill, a member of the commission.Industry analysts said the new rule represented a partial victory for Web site operators, app developers and advertising networks because regulators watered down some of their original proposals to which companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Twitter had objected. Apple and Google, for example, opposed proposals that suggested they would be responsible for the data collected by children's apps sold in their app stores. Regulators have now clarified that general-interest app stores would not be held liable for that.Yet, few companies lent any support to the commission at its news conference; Viacom and Disney sent representatives, but other companies were absent.''What we've got here is an expansion of Coppa that some in the industry would say has gone too far,'' said Alan Friel, a lawyer who leads the media and technology practice at the firm of Edwards Wildman Palmer. ''But the F.T.C. has provided exceptions that continue to allow internal use of a child's data, including one-time use of contact information for facilitating promotions and send-a-friend e-mails.''In an era of widespread photo sharing, video chatting and location-based apps, the revised children's privacy rule makes clear that companies must obtain parental consent before collecting certain details that could be used to identify, contact or locate a child. These include photos, video and audio as well as the location of a child's mobile device.While the new rule strengthens such safeguards, it could also disrupt online advertising. Web sites and online advertising networks often use persistent identification systems -- like a cookie in a person's browser, the unique serial number on a mobile phone, or the I.P. address of a computer -- to collect information about a user's online activities and tailor ads for that person.The new rule expands the definition of personal information to include persistent IDs if they are used to show a child behavior-based ads. It also requires third parties like ad networks and social networks that know they are operating on children's sites to notify and obtain consent from parents before collecting such personal information. And it makes children's sites responsible for notifying parents about data collection by third parties integrated into their services.Collecting data to show children contextual ads based on the content of a site or app, however, will not require parental consent. ''The only limit we place is on behavioral advertising,'' Mr. Leibowitz said. ''Until and unless you get parental consent, you may not track children to create massive profiles'' for behavior-based ads.Stuart P. Ingis, a lawyer representing several marketing associations, said that reputable online marketers did not knowingly profile children to show them behavior-based ads. He added that industry guidelines prohibited the practice.He agreed with regulators that privacy protections for children online needed to keep pace with new technologies. But he said he was concerned that the restrictions on cookie-based identifiers might cause some children's sites to reduce their use of ad networks to avoid having to notify parents about data collection by those services.''There might be overreaction that would limit just general third-party collection of data, which is very useful to businesses and consumers,'' said Mr. Ingis, who represents the Direct Marketing Association and the Association of National Advertisers.The revised rule also clarifies requirements for sites that are not primarily directed at young children but whose audience may include them, like a Disney family site, for example. Those sites can now screen visitors by age, but they will be required to obtain permission from a parent to collect personal data about children under 13.Children's advocates generally welcomed the strengthened protections.''Clearly, this is a major step forward, but the devil is in the details,'' said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group in Washington.

"Data Law in Works, But Tech Booms in Europe","Europe may be on the brink of passing what some tech firms and entrepreneurs view as a stifling law on data protection and the rights of consumers to have their data destroyed. But the chatter at an annual tech conference in Munich where E.U. Commissioner Viviane Reding laid out those data privacy plans this week seemed to be that the Web is booming on a continent better known lately for austerity and cutbacks.In Europe, ""the eco-system for tech companies is growing very, very fast,"" said Niklas Zennström, a co-founder of Skype, at the DLD conference (Digital - Life - Design).Discreet about their business but selling and partying hard, a phalanx of venture capitalists from Silicon Valley graced the gathering. Although it took place in Bavaria, long the German region favored by tech giants such as Microsoft, the word ""Berlin"" was on quite a few venture capitalists' lips.According to them, the German capital, better known since reunification as an edgy place for artists, is gathering what one San Francisco visitor termed a ""critical mass"" of young techies, attracted by each other, relatively low rents, a reasonable cost of living, and a creative mood. Have you heard this? Are there other tech hotbeds in Europe, and beyond?. "
How to Safely Delete or Save Tax Documents Online,"It's tax time, which means millions of Americans are probably in the midst of collecting the many documents needed to prepare their returns.When I was going through this exercise last week, I had to download a 1099 form from my bank's Web site, which naturally included all sorts of sensitive information. So how do you virtually shred these documents after you are done with them? Or how would you securely save a sensitive document like a completed tax return?According to several computer security experts, there are several approaches to consider:Mac users have access to a nifty built-in feature that acts as a virtual shredder. It's called ""secure empty trash,"" which overwrites the data you want to delete, making it essentially impossible to recover, said Rich Mogull, an analyst and chief executive officer of Securosis, an independent security research and advisory firm. (Go into the Finder menu on the top of the screen, and select ""Secure Empty Trash."")  He said there was still some risk if the file had been saved on Time Machine - the Mac's backup system - but he said the odds were low that an attacker would look there.""To be honest, the odds of being exploited on a Mac are really low these days, especially if you've upgraded to Lion,"" he added, referring to one of the Mac's newer operating systems.Windows-based computers do not have an equivalent function, but Mr. Mogull said that ""emptying the recycle bin does a reasonable job unless the attacker is motivated to hunt around.""But that does not delete the data; it just allows it to be overwritten over time, which can take years. So if you want to take things a step further and overwrite your files, some experts recommended considering file shredding software. (I found some reviews on CNET.) ""It looks at the things you have deleted and it writes over them,"" said Nikki Junker, a victim adviser at the Identity Theft Resource Center. ""Even if they brought in the forensics team, it would be difficult to pull up that information.""Many people may simply delete their files and then do a final scrubbing before getting rid of their     computers. ""When you dispose of the computer or donate it, at that point, you want to use specialized software to wipe your hard drive clean,"" said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in San Diego, though he cautioned against waiting to delete your files securely if you are working on a laptop that you travel with. He said a number of products, known as disk wiping utilities or disk erasers, would do the job.One option is to save the files using an external hard drive  or a smaller USB thumb drive. You then have to decide how you want to store the drive securely. ""Do you want to put a password on it?"" Ms. Junker asked. ""Do you put it in the safety deposit box or the safe in your house?""You can also store your documents ""in the cloud"" - think Mozy or Carbonite - but you have to be comfortable with the company's security. ""You want to go to a reputable company that really has something to lose if they are breached,"" she said.It's also possible that if someone breaks into your computer, he or she may be able to recover those files, Mr. Mogull said, but the odds are really low.Nevertheless, Apple and Microsoft have encryption services built into their operating systems. Mac users can create a password-protected ""encrypted disk image"" - think of it as a secure storage container for a group of files (for instance, the files created by tax software). Alternatively, you can create a password-protected PDF file, which encrypts a single document. (When you click the ""Save as PDF"" button, there is a ""Security Options"" button that lets you set a password requirement for various functions, including opening and printing the document.)Windows 7, meanwhile, has a feature called ""BitLocker"" that willencrypt an entire drive, while its ""Encrypting File System"" will encrypt individual files.Mr. Stephens suggested encryption software as another option.Before doing taxes online, update all of your software to the latest version, since it often will include security patches. And if you use antivirus software, update that as well. And be sure your computer is password protected.Finally, do not leave financial documents, or credit card or Social Security numbers, in your e-mail.  ""If someone compromises your account, they may look in there,"" Mr. Mogull said. ""You should delete those sorts of messages, then go into your deleted items folder and delete them from there.""How do you save and delete tax documents with sensitive information? Please drop your thoughts in the comment section below. "
What Would You Pay for Privacy?," Not long ago, I sent a dozen friends an electronic invitation to a party. The invitation site offered me several choices, all entirely free: a range of attractive designs for events of various sorts, how many guests each of my guests could invite, whether the guest list would be public to other guests, and so on. There was one thing I would have to pay for, if I wanted it -- and that was to keep the invitation free of advertisements. It was a perfect microcosm of the bargain we make with the Web every day. Send me ads based on what you know about me (bachelorette party vs. child's birthday party) or take my money to keep my screen free of ads.That bargain was the topic of a fascinating study that asked how much we are willing to pay to keep our personal data to ourselves. The researchers, at the German Institute for Economic Research  and the University of Cambridge, turned up somewhat paradoxical results. While the vast majority of their guinea pigs - all in Germany, by the way, where concerns about personal data are perceived to be acute - cared about the collection of certain personal data by an online company, not many were willing to pay to protect it. The researchers invited 443 participants into a lab in Berlin. They could buy movie tickets from one of two online companies. Both companies asked for names, dates of birth, and e-mail addresses, since the tickets were delivered electronically. One company also asked for a mobile phone number - and that company charged 50 euro cents less for the tickets, or about 65 cents at current exchange rates. Fewer than one in three participants (29 percent) agreed to pay the extra money keep their cellphone number out of the hands of the online movie ticket company. Only 9 percent agreed to pay a premium to avoid getting marketing e-mails.  But if there was no price difference, more than 80 percent chose the company that collected less personal information. The research report, called ""Study on monetizing privacy: An economic model for pricing personal information,"" was released by the European Network and Information Security Agency in late February.A similar experiment done in the field by the same researchers turned up similar results. How much people care about the use of their personal data online is a matter of polarized debate, with one side arguing that privacy is dead and the other calling for legal protections to secure privacy. Empirical research on the subject is still in its infancy. Most studies ask for personal opinion, rather than measure the digital choices people make, and even there, the results usually find a gap between what people say and what they do about their privacy online. The latest survey from the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project also turned up this paradox. Nine out of 10 people surveyed on the telephone last month said they were satisfied with the performance of search engines. And yet 68 percent said they were ""not O.K."" with targeted advertising because they did not like their ""online behavior tracked and analyzed."" My own online party invitation turned out to be a case study of the choices we make with our everyday digital ephemera. It took less than an hour to create a delightful digital card and plug in my friends' e-mail addresses. Faced with the choice of paying an extra $10 to keep my invitation advertisement-free, I dithered. It would be easy and inexpensive, I thought, to follow Wikipedia's lead on this (the online encyclopedia is stubbornly ad-free). But then I thought about that little risk that accompanies the ease of digital consumption: Would my credit card information be safe with this online greeting card company?  The worrywart in me won out. I did not pay the extra $10. I chose to lob advertisements at my friends.  "
Lawmakers Ask Apple App Makers About Privacy," Two members of Congress are pushing ahead with an investigation into privacy issues in Apple's App Store. After contacting Apple earlier this month with questions about app privacy, the lawmakers have now sent letters to 34 app developers requesting information about their data-collection techniques.Representatives Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, and G.K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina, sent joint letters on Thursday to makers of social networking apps, including Foodspotting, Twitter, Turntable.fm and Path, among others.They said they chose the list of apps from the ""Social Networking"" subcategory within the iPhone Essentials area of Apple's iTunes App Store.On the Energy and Commerce Committee Web site, the two representatives wrote: ""Following recent reports that apps could collect address book information and photos without notice and consent from users of Apple's mobile devices, the members are seeking to better understand what, if any, information these particular apps gather, what they do with it, and what notice they provide to app users.""The letters also state that the information will be used to ""to begin building a fact-based understanding of the privacy and security practices in the app marketplace.""Apple did not respond to a request for comment about the letters.In the letters, the representatives cite reports from The New York Times revealing that apps can access users' photographs and address books. Mr. Waxman and Mr. Butterfield ask the app makers whether they have privacy policies in place, and if they have ever collected a user's address book, photo gallery or phone number, among other questions.The letters request written responses from the app makers by April 12.Google, too, is facing some scrutiny about app privacy. After a report in The Times earlier this month that Android apps can also secretly access photo libraries, Senator Charles E. Schumercalled for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate both Apple and Google regarding app privacy issues. "
Facebook Shares More About How It Uses Your Data,"How does Facebook use all the words, pictures and clicks of its 901 million users?A group of European college students first raised that question last year. The Irish Data Protection Office, which regulates all of Facebook's European data policies, took it up. On Friday, Facebook shared a bit more.""We're adding more examples and detailed explanations to help you understand our policies,"" Facebook's new chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, a veteran privacy lawyer in Washington, wrote, in a blog post. Facebook users can give feedback and talk to Ms. Egan on Monday in a video chat.The new explanations, available by clicking on the Help tab on the bottom of the Facebook home page,  include one on how cookies work on the site and what information application developers receive when you download an app on the Facebook platform. The explanations also inform users about who can see what kinds of posts on their timelines.""We also provide more information about how we use data to operate Facebook, to advertise, and to promote safety and security for Facebook users,"" Ms. Egan wrote.The changes come at a time when Facebook, as it goes to the public markets, will have to extract more value from its trove of personal data. In so doing, it may face more scrutiny from users and government regulators.Max Schrems, a 24-year-old Austrian college student who corralled other young European users of Facebook to bring the issue to the attention of government regulators, immediately issued a statement. ""We are of course extremely happy that we were able to get this multinational to change its worldwide policy with a couple of simple complaints,"" he wrote. "
Lawmakers Want to Know: What Are Those Drones Doing Up There?,"Who will keep an eye on the eyes in the sky?Representative Edward Markey, Democrat from Massachusetts, said he planned to introduce legislation that would compel those who seek a federal license to fly drones to spell out what they will do with the information they collect and how long they will hold on it.The Obama administration announced earlier this year that it would allow the Federal Aviation Administration, which is responsible for civilian airspace, to issue licenses to commercial drone operators and to make it easier for law enforcement and other government agencies to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles.Drone makers, who until now have sold drones to the United States military for its war efforts overseas, have lobbied to open up the civilian market within the United States. Drones are already used to monitor movement on the borders and by a few police and emergency services agencies around the country.The F.A.A. is drafting regulations on how drone licenses will be issued. Once they kick in, drones could be used in a variety of ways, including shooting Hollywood movies, monitoring oil spills and conducting criminal investigations. The prospect of drones being used for these purposes has fueled concerns about the possibility of ubiquitous surveillance, especially because the law currently protects the right to take pictures of anyone and anything in public.In June, Representative Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, introduced legislation that would compel law enforcement agencies to seek a search warrant before collecting information with a drone. His bill, co-sponsored by Austin Scott, Republican of Georgia, makes exceptions including on the border and in cases of terrorist investigations.The drone manufacturers lobby, meanwhile, is backing a voluntary code of conduct which includes a provision to ""respect the privacy of individuals.""Mr. Markey also said Wednesday that law enforcement agencies should strive to minimize what information they collect using unmanned aerial vehicles and how long they hold on it.The prospects of any imminent movement on Capitol Hill, though, seem to be minimal. Stubborn partisan divisions have so far doomed agreement on a bill that seeks to strengthen cybersecurity for the electrical grid, nuclear power plants and other critical infrastructure. "
Hulu Faces Privacy Test in Court,"Can a privacy law passed in the era of videotape rentals be applied in the era of Internet streaming? Hulu, the online video content provider, is about to face the test. A lawsuit filed in a federal court in California says Hulu violated its users' privacy by sharing their viewing history with companies that could in turn offer them tailored advertisements. The case rests on a 1988 law, the Video Privacy Protection Act, intended to protect the privacy of video rental records. It was passed by Congress after a newspaper obtained records of what movies the conservative Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork had rented, and published an article based on them. Hulu, which is owned by News Corporation, NBCUniversal, Providence Equity Partners and the Walt Disney Company, sought to have the case dismissed, noting that it is not a video rental business. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler concluded Friday that the law did not preclude application to ""new technologies for prerecorded video content"" and allowed the case to go ahead. Next comes the discovery of evidence and arguments. The judge has not yet ruled on the merits of the case.The plaintiffs will seek to prove in court that Hulu violated their privacy by letting third-party companies track their movements across the Internet without their consent. To do so, Hulu allowed an analytics company, KISSmetrics, to place a ""cookie"" or code on their computers that included names, location preferences and programs watched. That information was in turn conveyed to other companies, from advertising networks to analytics companies to Facebook. ""As to Facebook, Hulu included their Facebook IDs, connecting the video content information to Facebook's personally identifiable user registration information,"" the judge wrote. Hulu has since discontinued using KISSmetrics, after two separate academic studies reported on the practice last year.Hulu declined to comment on whether or how it continued to share video consumption records with third parties for advertising or other purposes. The case could have repercussions for other video streaming services. For instance, Netflix, which allows users to stream movies online, wants to team up with Facebook to allow its users to share what movies they watch with their Facebook friends. Both companies have acknowledged that the Video Privacy Protection Act presents a hurdle. Both are lobbying to overturn the law.  "
Daily Report: Germans Reopen Facebook Privacy Inquiry," German officials reopened an investigation into Facebook's facial recognition technology Wednesday, contending the social network giant was illegally compiling a vast photo database of users without their consent,reports Kevin O'Brien for The New York Times from Berlin.The investigation, which had been suspended in June, was restarted after repeated attempts to persuade Facebook to change its policies had failed, an official said. The social networking company uses analytic software to compile photographic archives of human faces, based on photos uploaded by Facebook's users. But instead of using an opt-in system, Facebook assumes users will want to use facial recognition and requires them to opt out instead. The system prompts users to ""tag,"" or identify, people in photos uploaded to the service. Johannes Caspar, the data protection commissioner in Hamburg who led Germany's investigation into Google's collection of personal Internet data siphoned from residential Wi-Fi routers, is leading the investigation. He said Facebook has maintained that the practice is legal in Ireland, where Facebook's European operation is incorporated.Irish officials are concluding a second audit of the company's data protection practices, said a spokeswoman for the Irish Data Protection Commission. The fine in Germany, however, is slight, about $30,000, should Facebook refuse to destroy its biometric database and alter its consent practices.  "
Part 3: Answers to Readers' Questions About Scholarships," The Choice has invited Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of FinAid.org and FastWeb.com, to answer reader questions about scholarships in the blog's Guidance Office, a forum for college applicants and their families seeking expert advice.  Mr. Kantrowitz is the author of ""Secrets to Winning a Scholarship."" Most recently he helped readers of The Choice navigate the Free Application for Federal Student Aid during his Fafsa Q. and A. series in January.  In this third installment of answers, Mr. Kantrowitz responds to questions about when and where to search for aid, whether financial need or applying early decision will affect your admissions chances, and the merits of hiring a financial consultant. His responses will continue each day throughout this week.  Readers may continue to post questions using the comments box below, or on the original post soliciting questions. (Please note that Wednesday is the last day to submit a question.)  Some questions, and answers, below have been edited, including for length and style. - Tanya Abrams  Never Too Early to Start a Scholarship Search  Q.  My oldest just entered sixth grade. Is it too early to start doing things to best position ourselves for a scholarship, and if not, what can we do now? Many thanks!- Joe Fogel A.  It is never too early to start searching for scholarships.There are many scholarships available to students in elementary school. For example, Jif peanut butter offers a scholarship for making a peanut butter sandwich, with a top prize of $25,000. There's also a scholarship for mibsters (children who play with marbles), the National Spelling and Geography Bees, the National History Day competition, and numerous art, writing and community service contests.None of the online scholarship matching services lists scholarships for children under age 13 because of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. This privacy law prohibits collecting personal information from underage children without verifiable parental consent. Matching a student with scholarships requires collecting personal information from the student. For example, the student's city, state and ZIP code are required for enforcing geographic restrictions. The only way to reliably verify parental consent online is with a credit card, which is antithetical to the nature of free scholarship matching services.Instead, the FinAid site, which does not require registration, includes a list of scholarships for children. To position a child for winning a scholarship, encourage the child to do well in school. The prospect of winning money can be a great motivator for improving academic performance. Also, encourage the child to pursue hobbies and other interests in depth.Do not force the child to do anything he or she doesn't want to do, as the child must be passionate about an activity to truly excel. Instead, enable your children to do what interests and excites them. The parent's role should be more about removing obstacles and getting out of the way than about steering the child in any particular direction. Where to Find Merit Aid  Q.  In answering a question about merit aid from highly selective schools, you say, ""There are, however, some exceptions to the rule. Duke University, for example, has been known to give out a limited number of merit scholarships, especially to top-ranked mathematics students. Colleges that are the next tier down in selectivity may also give out a limited number of non-need-based scholarships to help the institution achieve recruiting and financial goals."" My question is: How can we find out about these exceptions? Is there a resource besides searching each institution or departmental Web site?-Susan A.  In the book entitled ""The A's and B's of Academic Scholarships,"" (published by Octameron Associates) the author Anna Leider lists institutional merit-based aid at colleges and universities throughout the country.There are also resources available online. Fastweb includes institutional merit-based scholarships in the search results based on the set of colleges listed by the student in the personal background profile. MeritAid.com provides a searchable interface to academic scholarships offered by colleges and universities. FinAid.org includes a list of colleges offering full-tuition academic scholarships.The Times has also published an interactive list of more than 600 colleges and universities that award merit aid. The list includes the sticker price of the university's tuition and fees, the percentage of freshmen who receive merit aid, and the average amount of such aid that they receive.Many colleges and universities offer academic scholarships through the National Merit Scholarship Program.You'll be able to find which merit-based institutional scholarships are offered at most colleges and universities by visiting the school's Web site. Look on the Web pages for the financial aid office and the admissions office. Q.  What is the best way to find outside scholarships for kids already in college? My daughter receives some merit aid but has been told no matter how well she does, the amount will remain the same over the four years. I have a second child entering college in two years from now. Will he get more aid because we are paying so much for his sister? Does that somehow get factored in by colleges?- Brenda A.  Use one of the free scholarship matching services, some of which include scholarships for current college students, not just high school seniors. When evaluating a family's ability to pay for college, colleges do not consider amounts previously paid for a sibling's higher education. Rather, financial aid is based on a snapshot of the family's finances, which includes the family's income (based on the previous tax year) and the family's assets (as of the most recent statement prior to filing the Fafsa). So to the extent that the parent's assets are lower due to the previous child's college costs, they may qualify for more financial aid.Some colleges will, however, make adjustments to income for amounts the parents paid for private K-12 tuition for the student's siblings.The number of children in college at the same time can have a big impact on aid eligibility. The financial aid formulas divide the parent contribution portion of the expected family contribution approximately by the number of children in college. Applying Early Decision  Q.  My son is applying early decision for a few schools. Should the Fafsa and CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE be done early also, or should we wait for January to fill those out?- Kalpna Kapoor A.  There are two types of early admission: early decision and early action. Early decision commits a student to enrolling at the college if the college admits him. A student can apply early decision to only one college. Early action does not involve a commitment to enroll. However, some colleges prohibit students from applying early to more than one college.The Fafsa may not be filed before Jan. 1.The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE form may be filed before Jan. 1 and should be filed as early as possible. Most colleges require the form to be filed in late November or early December for early admission students.  Impact of Financial Need on Admission Chances  Q.  We are in the position where we may qualify for some aid but I am worried that it will hurt my daughter's chance of admission if I apply. How much does applying for aid affect admission chances?- Lisa A.  Ask the college whether it practices need-blind or need-sensitive admission. A need-blind college will admit a student without regard to financial need. A need-sensitive college will consider the student's ability to pay, especially if the student is in the gray middle. But even need-blind colleges may become need-sensitive when admitting students off the waiting list, since the remaining financial aid budget may be much smaller at that point. If you need financial aid to afford the college, then apply for financial aid. If you do not apply for financial aid, you will struggle to pay for the college. Don't assume that you can handle one year without assistance and then apply for financial aid in subsequent years. Some colleges will not award institutional grants to students who did not apply for financial aid the first year, unless there is clear evidence of a change in the family's financial circumstances. Financial Aid Consultants  Q.  Is there any value to working with a financial aid specialist such that they know the best ways to make the most of the Fafsa form? Or will we get the same result by completing the form on our own?- JR Godfrey A.  The main value in using a financial aid consultant is in hand-holding. It will not save you time, since you still need to supply the consultant with the same information you would have to provide on financial aid application forms. It won't save you much money after including the consultant's fees. It may lead to inaccurate results and may add delays in filing the financial aid application forms.There are no qualifications required for someone to call himself a financial aid consultant. The person offering the service may have no relevant experience or expertise, other than perhaps completing financial aid applications for his or her own children.  Often such services are marketed through a  free financial aid seminar held at a restaurant, hotel conference room or even rented space on a college campus. Families who use financial aid consultants should ask about the consultant's background and credentials. Consultants who have worked previously as a college financial aid administrator will be more reliable. Certified public accountants and certified financial planners can also give good advice, but this advice may be focused more on optimizing the tax impact than the financial aid impact. There are a variety of free resources for completing financial aid application forms:The U.S. Department of Education sponsors the Federal Student Aid Information Center (1-800-4-FED-AID), which can answer questions about completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (Fafsa).The Y.M.C.A. sponsors College Goal Sunday, which provides free help in completing the Fafsa on weekends in January, February and March.The FinAid Web site also provides some help about the Fafsa, including a list of the most common errors.There are more than 125 Ask Kantro columns about the FAFSA.The Choice also ran a Fafsa Q. and A. in January.The most common tips we provide on FinAid.org include saving money in the parent's name instead of the child's (or using a 529 college savings plan), minimizing capital gains and other income the tax year before the child enrolls in college and each subsequent year, and increasing the number of children enrolled in college at the same time.  Wednesday is the last day to pose a question to Mr. Kantrowitz.

"The Breakfast Meeting: Petraeus's Lost Privacy, and Colbert's Disappearing 'Super PAC'","The prominent people - including two generals atop the nation's security apparatus - swept up in the investigation of a private conflict between two women illustrate the threat to privacy when law enforcement officials begin examining online communications, Scott Shane reports. ""It's a particular problem with cyberinvestigations - they rapidly become open-ended because there's such a huge quantity of information available and it's so easily searchable,"" said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, adding, ""If the C.I.A. director can get caught, it's pretty much open season on everyone else."" The Washington Post brought in a new top editor, Martin Baron of The Boston Globe, to succeed its current editor, Marcus Brauchli, Christine Haughney reports. The move comes as The Post faces industrywide pressures on profitability, with readers abandoning print newspapers for digital formats. But it is also said to stem from tensions between Mr. Brauchli and Katharine Weymouth, the publisher of The Post and granddaughter of Katharine Graham, in part over newsroom cuts pushed by Ms. Weymouth. Mr. Brauchli will be staying on as a vice president of The Washington Post Company.The man who accused Kevin Clash, the voice and puppeteer of the ""Sesame Street"" character Elmo, of an under-age sexual relationship has recanted, his lawyer said on Tuesday, Brian Stelter and Elizabeth Jensen report. Sesame Workshop, the organization that produces ""Sesame Street,"" said in a statement: ""We are pleased that this matter has been brought to a close, and we are happy that Kevin can move on from this unfortunate episode."" The organization did not say when - or even whether - Mr. Clash would return to work at ""Sesame Street."" On Sunday, he took a leave of absence when it became clear that TMZ would be publishing an article on the claim. Stephen Colbert's satirical experiment with ""super PACs"" has taken a final twist, Nick Corasaniti writes on The Caucus blog. As was explored on his show on Monday, Mr. Colbert shut down his super PAC - Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow - and made its remaining almost $800,000 ""disappear"" to a new 501c4 group through an Internal Revenue Service loophole, as explained by his lawyer, a former Federal Election Commission chairman, Trevor Potter.

"Britain Looks at Online ""Personalized Pricing""","Are online companies engaging in differential pricing, the practice of selling the same product at different prices to different customers?The Office of Fair Trading in Britain, a government agency overseeing business competition and consumer protection, aims to find out. The agency, the British equivalent of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, has opened an investigation looking at whether companies use data collected about online consumers -- like their browsing histories -- to charged people ""personalized pricing."" ""We want to investigate whether firms use data to modify prices offered to consumers, if this is harmful, where the boundaries of acceptable conduct are, and if consumer protection legislation is being breached,"" the agency said in a statement last week.In particular, the British agency said it intended to look at how companies collect information about consumers' browsing histories, purchases, demographics and digital devices, as well as how they may use all that data to personalize products and prices. The agency said it also would examine the trade in consumer data, including ""whether there are business models which are primarily based on gathering and selling data and, if so, whether they are clear to consumers.""The British investigation comes as information resellers -- companies that collect, share or sell, and analyze consumer data -- in the United States are already under intense scrutiny.In the House, under the auspices of the Bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, began investigating data brokers in June. Last month, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, also opened an investigation into the industry. At the same time, the Government Accountability Office has started its own examination of information resellers.In a statement, the British agency said it did not have evidence that companies were charging people higher prices after collecting data about their online activities. But regulators said they were concerned that consumers' unease about online data-mining could erode their trust and use of e-commerce.""The ways in which data is collected and used is evolving rapidly,"" Clive Maxwell, the chief executive of the Office of Fair Trading, said in a news release. ""It is important we understand what control shoppers have over their profile and whether firms are using shoppers' profiles to charge different prices for goods or services."" "
Facebook Likely to End Experiment With Democracy,"A half-million Facebook users have told the social network they do not want the company to change its privacy policy. Sounds impressive, right? Well, the only way that crowd will get its way and the status quo remain intact is if an additional 300 million people vote thumbs down before Monday. Odds of that happening? About zero. Facebook says the changes to the policy are minor and beneficial for users. One concerns the integration of Instagram data with Facebook; another changes the filters for managing incoming messages. Privacy watchdogsdisagree.So do those who bothered to vote: Shortly before noon Pacific time on Friday, 476,718 were against the proposed changes. A mere 68,884 were in favor.But the really interesting change is that Facebook is proposing to end this system of direct voting, which was implemented in early 2009 after a major privacy flap. ""If we are trying to move the world to being more open and transparent and to get people to share more information, having an open process around this is ultimately the only way to do that,"" Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, said at the time in a conference call.The problem was that more than 30 percent of all Facebook users had to vote against a proposal for it to be binding. In the last vote, in June, the no's outweighed the yeses by a ratio of six to one, but the total votes were less than one half of 1 percent of the users. That made the vote simply advisory. And so Facebook went ahead and implemented the changes anyway.There has been relatively little commentary, much less outrage, about the new changes. One notable exception was Michael Phillips, who wrote a much-quoted piece in BuzzFeed,""The End of the Facebook Democracy"": ""By repealing Facebook Suffrage, Facebook abandons a fundamental norm -- that its users are citizens in a community, and not simply datapoints on an advertising algorithm. The vote may be quixotic, but if Facebook remains the indispensable social network, you'll want to be able to tell your grandchildren you fought for Facebook freedom.""Some users are trying to take their privacy into their own hands. They are reproducing the following text as a status update:""In response to the new Facebook guidelines, I hereby declare that my copyright is attached to all of my personal details, status updates, messages, photos, videos and all other personal content that I post or have posted, online, as a result of the Berne Convention, on my personal profile page, or anyone else's page, For commercial use of the above, MY WRITTEN CONSENT IS NEEDED AT ALL TIMES WITH NO EXCEPTION.""Perhaps this makes them feel better. But in reality,it has no legal standingat all. "
IHT Quick Read: Dec. 8," NEWS Germany's economy is slowing and will probably stagnate in 2013, the country's central bank said Friday, sharply cutting its forecast for growth. Considering ""the difficult economic situation in some euro area countries and widespread uncertainty, economic growth will be lower than previously assumed,"" said the Bundesbank, which now expects G.D.P. to expand by just 0.4 percent next year.  David Jolly reports. The secretary of Italy's largest political party said Friday that the technocratic government of Prime Minister Mario Monti had run its course, paving the way toward early elections. Angelino Alfano told the lower house of Parliament that his People of Liberty party would not bring down the government, but he made clear that it would no longer support Mr. Monti, who has headed an emergency government for more than a year. Elisabetta Povoledo reports from Milan.The death toll in the southern Philippines from Typhoon Bopha rose past 450 on Friday with more than 500 still missing, amid assertions that climate change, deforestation, poor planning and other factors had worsened the catastrophe. Floyd Whaley reports from Manila.European data protection officials are drafting plans to censure Google over its online privacy policy if the company does not meet the demands of regulators to revise it.  In a meeting this week of the E.U.'s 27 national data protection officials, the group mapped a preliminary strategy, including the possibility of testing Google's compliance with national privacy laws in countries like Ireland, Belgium and Finland, where the company operates data centers.  Kevin J. O'Brien reports. ARTS The ground-breaking show ""Bernini: Sculpting in Clay,"" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was inspired by three scholars who studied models that served as steps to the execution of some of the 17th-century sculptor's most famous works.    Souren Melikian reviews the show. WINE Some wine glasses look good on the shelf, others double as vases, and a small but growing number excel at the job for which they were intended: maximizing the enjoyment of wine.  For this trend we can largely thank an Austrian glass maker named Riedel, which pioneered the concept of designing glasses for different kinds of wine. Eric Pfanner reports from Kufstein, Austria. SPORTS With the prominent performances of Germany's three Bundesliga participants in this season's UEFA Champions League, speculation about where this conglomerate of contemporary continental challengers came from has been rife. Admiration from the four corners of the sport has ascended upon the league like never before. Stefan Bienkowski reports. "
Instagram Does an About-Face," 11:14 p.m. | Updated  SAN FRANCISCO - In the aftermath of the uproar over changes to Instagram's privacy policy and terms of service earlier this week, the company did an about-face late Thursday.In a blog post on the company's site, Kevin Systrom, Instagram's co-founder, said that where advertising was concerned, the company would revert to its previous terms of service, which have been in effect since October 2010. ""Rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed,"" he wrote, ""we are going to take the time to complete our plans, and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work."" Users had been particularly concerned by a clause in Instagram's policy introduced on Monday that suggested Instagram would share users' data - like their favorite places, bands, restaurants and hobbies - with Facebook and its advertisers to better target ads.They also took issue with an update to the company's terms of service that suggested users' photos could be used in advertisements, without compensation and even without their knowledge.The terms of that user agreement said, ""You agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your user name, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata) and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.""Following a reaction that included customers defecting to other services, Mr. Systrom told Instagram users on Tuesday that the new policy had been misinterpreted. ""It is our mistake that this language is confusing,"" he wrote, and he promised an updated agreement.That statement apparently was not enough. With more people leaving the service, the company, which Facebook bought for $735 million this year, reacted again by returning to the old rules.Acknowledging those concerns late Thursday, Mr. Systrom wrote: ""I want to be really clear: Instagram has no intention of selling your photos, and we never did. We don't own your photos - you do.""Mr. Systrom said the company would still be tweaking its privacy policy to quell users' fears that their photos might pop-up on third-party sites without their consent.But Mr. Systrom did not clarify how Instagram planned to monetize its service in the future. Facebook is under pressure to make Instagram earn income.""It's a free service - they have to monetize somewhere,"" said John Casasanta, a principal at Tap Tap Tap, the maker of Camera+, a photo-filter app that has shunned advertising and instead charges users for premium features. ""The days of the simple banner ads are gone. Their user data is too valuable.""It was unclear whether reverting its terms of service would be enough to satisfy high-profile users like National Geographic, which stopped using its Instagram account in light of the moves, or other users who have aired their grievances on Twitter and Facebook.The controversy has driven traffic and new users to several other photo-sharing applications.Pheed, an Instagram-like app that gives users the option to monetize their own content by charging followers to see their posts, gained more users than any other app in the United States on Thursday. By Thursday morning, Pheed had jumped to the ninth most downloaded social-networking app in Apple's iTunes store, just ahead of LinkedIn.O. D. Kobo, Pheed's chief executive, said Thursday morning that subscriptions to the service had quadrupled this week and that in the last 24 hours users had uploaded 300,000 new files to the service - more uploads than any other 24-hour-period since Pheed made its debut six weeks ago.Another runaway success was Flickr, Yahoo's photo-sharing service, which redesigned its app last week to make it easier to share photos on Twitter. In a stroke of good fortune, it released the app to positive reviews just as Instagram announced it would no longer sync with Twitter, a Facebook rival.The day before Instagram announced changes to its terms of service, Flickr's mobile app was ranked at around 175 in Apple's overall iTunes app charts. Since that day, the application skyrocketed to the high 20s.Of course, most of these services are still tiny compared to Instagram, which claims to have more than 100 million members who have uploaded upward of 5 billion photos using its service. And it was unclear if the services' newfound members had also deleted their Instagram accounts or were merely dabbling in other offerings. But the migration, whether temporary or permanent, was a reminder of the volatility of success and that the fall to bottom can sometimes be as swift as the rise to the top.Facebook and Instagram declined to say whether they had seen any significant number of account deletions or if they were concerned about losing ground in the photo-sharing market to rivals. Some photo apps took direct aim at Instagram. Camera+ even went so far as to include a snide, holiday-themed reference to Instagram's stumbles in an app update on Wednesday.""We'll never do shady things with your shared pics, because it just isn't right,"" the update noted. ""On that note, happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"" "
Daily Report: F.T.C. Broadens Rules on Children's Online Privacy,"  In a move intended to give parents greater control over data collected about their children online, federal regulators on Wednesday broadened longstanding privacy safeguards covering children's mobile apps and Web sites, Natasha Singer reports in Thursday's New York Times. Members of the Federal Trade Commission said they updated the rules to keep pace with the growing use of mobile phones and tablets by children. The regulations also reflect innovations like voice recognition, location technology and behavior-based online advertising, or ads tailored to an individual Internet user.Regulators had not significantly changed the original rule, based on the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, or Coppa. That rule required operators of Web sites directed at children under 13 to notify parents and obtain their permission before collecting or sharing personal information - like first and last names, phone numbers, home addresses or e-mail addresses - from children.The intent of that was to give parents control over entities seeking to collect information about their children so that parents could, among other things, prevent unwanted contact by strangers.The new rule, introduced at a news conference in Washington, significantly expands the types of companies required to obtain parental permission before knowingly collecting personal details from children, as well as the types of information that will require parental consent to collect.Jon D. Leibowitz, the chairman of the trade commission, described the rule revision as a major advance for children's privacy. ""Congress enacted Coppa in the desktop era and we live in an era of smartphones and mobile marketing,"" Mr. Leibowitz said. ""This is a landmark update of a seminal piece of legislation."" "
A New Policy On Privacy From Google,"8:15 p.m. Updated Google said Tuesday that it would revise its privacy policies and terms of service, to make them shorter and more readable and to change the way Google can use information that users provide.To alert users about the changes, which take effect March 1, Google plans to undertake its biggest notification effort ever via e-mail and announcements on its various sites, according to a person briefed on Google's plans.Though the announcement comes two weeks after Google was hammered by critics for the way it integrated Google Plus posts into search results, Google said that it had been working on the new policies for a long time and that recent events had nothing to do with the timing. Still, the biggest change in the new policies goes to the heart of privacy concerns about Google's new search feature. Google Plus posts that appear in search results are only from people whom Google users have chosen to follow on Google Plus and who have shared specific items with them or made them public. But critics said that it violated users' privacy because when people posted on Google Plus, they did not know that the posts would show up in search results.The new privacy policy makes clear that for people logged into a Google account, Google can use information shared on one service in other Google services.''If you're signed in, we may combine information you've provided from one service with information from other services,'' Alma Whitten, Google's director of privacy for product and engineering, wrote in a company blog post. ''In short, we'll treat you as a single user across all our products, which will mean a simpler, more intuitive Google experience.''The change will also allow Google to do other useful things, Ms. Whitten wrote, such as letting a user know she might be late for a meeting based on her calendar and current location, or correcting the spelling of a friend's name in a Google search.Last year, Google settled with the Federal Trade Commission over privacy misrepresentations it made related to Buzz, a social networking tool. It agreed to start a privacy program, submit to audits and pay a fine for any future misrepresentations. One watchdog group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said this month that it thought Google's new social search tool violated that agreement.Google also shrank and rewrote its privacy policies and terms of service - documents that on many Web sites are known for being too long, convoluted and bogged down by legalese. Google's main privacy policy, which had more than 70 separate documents for various products, will now cover 60 products in one document. A dozen, like Wallet or Chrome, will still have separate privacy policies. The terms of service are also consolidated and explain legal terms.Between now and March 1, as Google notifies users of the changes, they will be able to view and compare the old and new policies.Google's new efforts build on changes it made to simplify its privacy policy in 2010. Other companies, like Facebook, have also tried to shorten their policies, as industry regulators demand clearer and more concise statements.Google emphasized that its core privacy guidelines will not change. For instance, it does not sell personal information or share it externally except in the case of a valid court order, and it allows data liberation, which means Google users can export information to other services.The changes come a week after Google unveiled an ad campaign in United States newspapers, magazines, Web sites and subways to educate people about privacy. The campaign had already been running in Europe, where Google has faced more criticism and investigation of its privacy practices.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Q&A: Staying Secure On the Road,"Q.Is hotel Wi-Fi safe to use?A.Studies (including one a few years ago by Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration) have shown that many hotel networks are not always secure, so assume the worst for any public network. Fake access points designed to mimic the name of a hotel's network have also been known to fool users and snag personal information. Earlier this month, the Internet Crime Complaint Center (a joint effort by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the White Collar Crime Center) warned consumers about guests' laptops becoming infected with malicious software through pop-up windows offering fraudulent program updates over hotel Internet connections.Intruders can intercept data sent back and forth on unprotected wireless networks, so you should never send information like financial account passwords, Social Security numbers or payment information over unsecure and unencrypted connections. If possible, try to use your company's virtual private network (if it has one) or a similar commercial service to keep your connections encrypted.If you do need to use a public wireless network, take precautions. Turn off the system's file-sharing feature and make sure your computer's firewall and antivirus software is turned on. Some Web sites also offer secure connections (also known as Secure Socket Layer) to encrypt traffic, so check to see if this is available; Facebook and Google are among the sites that offer this protection.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to QandA@ nytimes.com.

Daily Report: Microsoft Takes Down Botnets,"Microsoft employees, accompanied by United States marshals, raided two office buildings in Pennsylvania and Illinois on Friday, aiming to disrupt one of the most pernicious forms of online crime today: botnets, or groups of computers that help harvest bank account passwords and other personal information from millions of other computers. Nick Wingfield and Nicole Perlroth report in Monday's New York Times that the sweep was part of a civil suit brought by Microsoft in its increasingly aggressive campaign to take the lead in combating such crimes, rather than waiting for law enforcement agencies to act. The company's targets were equipment used to control the botnets, which criminals, known as bot-herders, use for ill intent. Microsoft was attacking its most complex target yet, known as the Zeus botnets. The creators of Zeus offer their botnet code for sale to others and, depending on the level of customer support and customization of the code that clients require, charge them $700 to $15,000 for the software.""Taking the disruption into the courthouse was a brilliant idea and is helping the rest of the industry to reconsider what actions are possible, and that action is needed and can succeed,"" said Richard Perlotto, director at the Shadowserver Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks data about tools used for online fraud and forms of computer crime.Jose Nazario, a senior security researcher at Arbor Networks, an Internet security firm, said that Microsoft's record against botnets had been a ""mixed bag"" and that some of its gains were only temporary. After an earlier action against a botnet known as Waledac, for example, the software behind it was modified slightly to create a new botnet.""You can take out a botnet, but unless you take down the coders and put the clients behind bars, they're just going to go ahead and do this again,"" Mr. Nazario said.

Criminals Exploit Stolen Customer Data From Stratfor," 2:46 p.m. | Updated    It began as a case of political hacktivism. Late last year, under the banner of the loose collective known as Anonymous, hackers broke into the systems of Stratfor Global Intelligence Service, a company that analyzes geopolitical risks worldwide. They stole the names, e-mail addresses and credit card numbers of thousands of its subscribers and posted them online for all to see.That information apparently became lucre for criminals with commercial goals. Stratfor customers began receiving e-mails from what, at first glance, looked like Stratfor. An attached PDF file came with what looked like Stratfor letterhead. It warned of the risk of ""harmful software"" and asked the user to download an antivirus program by clicking on an embedded link. As it turns out, the link downloaded a piece of malicious software. It was detected by Microsoft's Malware Protection Center, which posted about it on its blog this week. It's a classic example of what is known as social engineering --  tricking unsuspecting Internet users into downloading malware that can in turn be used to extract financial gain. The social engineering messages are often disguised as e-mails from friends and associates. And often they take advantage of current events or holidays, inviting unwitting users to click on links for greeting cards or celebrity photos.In this instance, the social engineering was aimed at the victims of a particular data breach, and it played into their fears. The letter said that ""we strongly discourage you to open e-mails and attachments from doubtful senders and urge you to check all emails and attachments with anti-virus."" Microsoft said the link actually downloads a password-stealing program. ""The link displayed in the e-mails appears legitimate at first glance, but looking closely at the target address, you notice that it doesn't originate from the address in the e-mail text,"" Microsoft points out in its blog post. ""Stratfor is based in Texas, United States, however the download URL is located somewhere in Turkey.""The hackers who targeted Stratfor claim to be affiliated with Anonymous. On Twitter feeds, the group said it planned to use the stolen credit card numbers to donate to charities, including WikiLeaks, the whistle-blower site, which Anonymous has worked to defend.On Feb. 7, Stratfor's president, George Friedman, issued a notice on the company's Facebook page warning subscribers not to open links in e-mails that appear to be sent by Stratfor. He went on to say that Stratfor itself would discontinue sending e-mails with links.""These spam e-mails may contain malware and attachments, and may attempt to lead you to Web sites that look like our own. They may also attempt to convince you to provide your private information,"" he wrote.   "
Malicious Software Attacks Security Cards Used by Pentagon," Chinese hackers have deployed a new cyber weapon that is aimed at the Defense Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and potentially a number of other United States government agencies and businesses, security researchers say. Researchers at AlienVault, a Campbell, Calif., security company, said on Thursday that they had uncovered a new variant of some malicious software called Sykipot that targets smart cards used by government employees to access restricted servers and networks. Traces of Sykipot malware have been found in cyberattacks dating back to 2006, but AlienVault's researchers say this is the first time Sykipot has compromised smart cards. The government uses smart cards to supplement employee passwords, which have proven easy to crack. By cracking smart cards, hackers eliminate the final hurdle between themselves and some of the government's most sensitive information. Mandiant, a security firm, first outlined smart card weaknesses in a January 2011 report and said it had investigated several attacks in which hackers used smart cards to crack into companies. The latest Sykipot strain offers a look at how hackers are compromising smart cards and indicates who they are after.   Researchers say this strain specifically targets smart card readers that run ActivClient, a program made by ActivIdentity, an identity authentication company based in Fremont, Calif.  ActivIdentity's smart cards are used by employees at the Defense Department, Department of Homeland Security, Coast Guard, Social Security Administration, Treasury Department and other government agencies, along with businesses including Monsanto, BNP Paribas and Air France. A representative for ActivIdentity said the appropriate person to respond was not available on Wednesday, and a Pentagon spokeswoman did not follow up on a request for comment.AlienVault's researchers say this particular strain has been used in more than a dozen attacks at least since March 2011. That date is embedded in the malware's code.Researchers believe Sykipot has its origins in China. Previous Sykipot strains have been traced to command-and-control servers in China, and the researchers said they discovered Chinese characters in a small snippet of code in this latest strain. Last December, Lockheed Martin drew attention to a previous Sykipot variant that used an Adobe vulnerability to infect victims' machines. In that case, hackers sent personalized emails to their victims, often from people they knew, persuading them to open a PDF attachment. The attachment then unleashed malicious code onto victims' machines that gave hackers access to their restricted network and servers. Adobe has since encouraged customers to use updated versions of its software. It did not respond to requests that it confirm that it had patched its previous vulnerability. Researchers said this new strain of Sykipot also used an e-mail campaign to lure victims into opening an infected PDF attachment. But unlike previous strains, they say this new strain also employs a keystroke logger that steals PIN numbers for smart cards. When a target inserts a smart card into an infected machine, hackers can log in to the server or network using their victim's smart card credentials and tell the malware where to go and what to steal. Exactly what Sykipot's architects have stolen is still not known. But given ActivIdentity's client list of defense agencies, security researchers say, it is now clear who the target is.    "
Apple Account Break-In Highlights Security Weakness," 8:14 p.m. Aug 6 | Updated 8:07 p.m. Aug. 6 | UpdatedThe break-in of a journalist's Apple iCloud account serves as a cautionary tale about how vulnerable people can be to malicious hackers, no matter how digitally sophisticated they are. Mat Honan, a seasoned technology writer, was spectacularly hacked over the weekend.On Friday evening, the password for Mr. Honan's iCloud account was reset. Later the bad guys broke into his Gmail account, and eventually they erased the data on his iPhone, iPad and MacBook Air using Apple's remote-wipe feature - a self-destruct mechanism of sorts designed for use when a device has entered the wrong hands. To make matters worse, they also gained access to his personal Twitter account, as well as the account belonging to the tech blog Gizmodo, where he used to work.Mr. Honan published a detailed account of the story on Wired. He says the hackers gained entry by phoning Apple's tech support and using some clever ""social engineering"" to let them bypass security questions. That may point to a weakness in Apple's identity verification process. But the root of the issue was brought to light when Evelyn M. Rusli and I reported on iTunes account hacks back in March: Apple encourages customers to use the same Apple ID and password for just about everything. That's a concern because iTunes is no longer just a music store; it's also a place to buy e-books, apps and TV shows. And the same credentials are used to log in to iCloud, Apple's cloud service, where confidential documents could be retrieved or a remote wipe done, as in Mr. Honan's case.A security expert pointed out back in March that this would be a problem:""Apple wants to pretend that everything is magic,"" said Alex Stamos, co-founder of iSEC Partners, a security firm. ""They need to admit that their products can be used by bad people to do bad things.""One problem, Mr. Stamos said, is that iTunes customers use a single account and password for access to all Apple services. For example, the same login can be used to download a $1 game or buy a $2,000 laptop through the Apple Store app. He said that Apple could adopt a two-step verification method like Google's. For example, if a user wanted to log in to the iTunes store on a new device, Apple could send a message to his iPhone containing a code, which he would enter to verify his identity.To be fair, iTunes is successful largely because it was one of the first friction-free ways to purchase digital content. But perhaps iTunes has grown too big and too powerful to be so simple.In a statement issued late Monday, Apple said that it had made a mistake when resetting Mr. Honan's Apple ID password because it had not completely followed protocol.""Apple takes customer privacy seriously and requires multiple forms of verification before resetting an Apple ID password,"" said Natalie Kerris, an Apple spokeswoman, in a statement. ""In this particular case, the customer's data was compromised by a person who had acquired personal information about the customer.  In addition, we found that our own internal policies were not followed completely. We are reviewing all of our processes for resetting account passwords to ensure our customers' data is protected.""However, Mr. Honan challenged the idea that an Apple employee had not followed protocol. He said a colleague was able to reset an Apple ID password by replicating the hacker's technique. "
NASA Says Staff Information Was on Stolen Laptop,"NASA alerted its staff this week to the theft of a laptop containing sensitive personal information for a large number of employees and contractors from a locked vehicle two weeks ago. Although the laptop was password-protected, the information stored had not been encrypted, which could give skilled hackers full access to the contents.In its notice to employees on Tuesday, the agency said: On October 31, 2012, a NASA laptop and official NASA documents issued to a Headquarters employee were stolen from the employee's locked vehicle. The laptop contained records of sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) for a large number of NASA employees, contractors, and others. Although the laptop was password protected, it did not have whole disk encryption software, which means the information on the laptop could be accessible to unauthorized individuals. We are thoroughly assessing and investigating the incident, and taking every possible action to mitigate the risk of harm or inconvenience to affected employees.This is not the first time NASA has suffered a serious breach. The agency has long been a target for cybercriminals looking to pilfer sensitive research. In 2004, computers at several NASA sites, including its Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., were breached. And as recently as last March, the company reported a breach that was also caused by a stolen laptop.Given its history, it is unclear why the agency has not stepped up its security practices. Beth Dickey, a NASA spokeswoman, said that in this most recent case, the employee's laptop had been scheduled to get a security upgrade.""The laptop was scheduled to receive encryption, as part of an ongoing, agency-wide effort to encrypt whole disks of all NASA computers,"" Ms. Dickey said. ""This one just hadn't been done yet.""NASA has said it plans to have all of its laptops running whole-disk encryption software by Dec. 21.The message was first posted by SpaceRef, a trade publication focused on space systems.

"Computer Virus Is Stealing Data Across Middle East, Report Says","9:09 p.m. Updated A complex computer virus has been pilfering confidential information from computers in the Middle East for at least two years, according to a security report released on Monday. The virus, called Flame, has been infecting computers in Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Sudan, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. It has been grabbing images of users' computer screens, recording their instant messaging chats, remotely turning on their microphones to record their audio conversations and monitoring their keystrokes and network traffic, according to a report by Kaspersky Labs, a Moscow-based security research firm.If the report's findings prove to be true, Flame would be the third major Internet weapon to have been discovered since 2010. The first, named Stuxnet, was intended to attack software in specialized industrial equipment, and was used to destroy centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility in 2010. The second virus, called Duqu, like Flame, performed reconnaissance. Security researchers believe Duqu was created by the same group of programmers behind Stuxnet.The researchers said Flame appeared to have been developed by a different group of programmers. It contains 20 times more code than Stuxnet and is much more widespread than Duqu. Researchers believe Duqu hit fewer than 50 targets worldwide. Kaspersky's researchers said they had detected Flame on thousands of computers belonging to individuals, private companies and universities across the Middle East.''Flame can easily be described as one of the most complex threats ever discovered,'' Alexander Gostev, the head of Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis team, wrote in a blog post on Monday. ''It's big and incredibly sophisticated. It pretty much redefines the notion of cyberwar and cyberespionage.''Researchers say they do not know who is behind the virus, but given its complexity and the geography of its targets, they said it was most likely being staged by a government. The authors of Stuxnet and Duqu are also unknown but their targets and digital evidence suggest to some researchers that they may have been part of a joint American-Israeli project to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.Kaspersky's researchers said the majority of computers infected with Flame were located in Iran. Like Duqu and Stuxnet, Flame infects machines through a known security hole in the Windows operating software.Researchers discovered Flame while investigating reports that another computer virus, called Wiper, had been erasing computer programs in Iran. The International Telecommunications Union, a United Nations agency, had asked Kaspersky's researchers to look into Wiper when they discovered that thousands more computers had been infected with Flame.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Thousands Of Passwords At Yahoo Are Exposed,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Another month, another major security breach.Yahoo confirmed Thursday that about 400,000 user names and passwords to Yahoo and other companies were stolen on Wednesday. A group of hackers, known as the D33D Company, posted online the user names and passwords for what appeared to be 453,492 accounts belonging to Yahoo, and also Gmail, AOL, Hotmail, Comcast, MSN, SBC Global, Verizon, BellSouth and Live.com users.The hackers wrote a brief footnote to the data dump, which has since been taken offline: ''We hope that the parties responsible for managing the security of this subdomain will take this as a wake-up call, and not as a threat.''The breach comes just one month after millions of user passwords for LinkedIn, the online social network for professionals, were exposed by hackers who breached its systems. The breaches highlight the ease with which hackers are able to infiltrate systems, even at some of the most widely used and sophisticated technology companies.Marcus Carey, a researcher at Rapid7, a security company found that among the data were some 106,000 Gmail e-mail addresses, 55,000 Hotmail e-mail addresses and 25,000 AOL e-mail addresses. Those e-mail accounts were not hacked; instead people had used their e-mail address as user names for a Yahoo service.Sucuri, a company that checks for malware, set up a Web site, labs.sucuri.net/?yahooleak, that lets concerned users check if their account details were compromised in the breach.Dana Lengkeek, a spokeswoman for Yahoo, said the compromised accounts belonged to Yahoo's Contributor Network, and that fewer than 5 percent of the passwords posted were still valid.Chris Gaither, a spokesman for Google, said Google immediately reset passwords for vulnerable Gmail accounts.The hackers claimed to have stolen the passwords using a hacking technique called an SQL injection, which exploits a software vulnerability.''We are fixing the vulnerability that led to the disclosure of this data, changing the passwords of the affected Yahoo users and notifying companies whose user accounts may have been compromised,'' Ms. Lengkeek said in the statement.Mr. Carey said it was unclear whether Yahoo's breach had been contained and noted that hackers could still be inside its systems.Computer security experts recommended that Yahoo users consider changing their passwords to other sites, as hackers tend to test those passwords across multiple sites.They were quick to chastise Yahoo for allowing hackers such an easy way into its systems. ''Why haven't organizations like Yahoo got it yet? SQL injection is a known attack,'' said Mark Bower, a vice president at Voltage Security. ''If what is stated is true, it's utter negligence to store passwords in the clear.''This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Blekko Works With Lavasoft on Spam-Free Search,"The search engine Blekko is not content to be the underdog. It wants to be your guard dog too.The start-up continues to embrace its motto as ""the spam-free search engine."" Since it began in November 2010, Blekko has tried to position itself as the safest of the three algorithmic search engines on the market, the others being giants -- Microsoft's Bing service and  that little company called Google.When Google reconfigured its search algorithm to weed out low-quality sites and content farms last year, Blekko took the mission one step further and adopted the herculean task of banning from its results 1.1 million Web sites that it deemed untrustworthy.And last May, after Yahoo reversed course and said that it would no longer anonymize search results and would instead join Bing and Google in keeping users' search logs for 18 months, Blekko took the opposite approach and announced it would start deleting users' search logs within 48 hours.Now, Blekko plans to take its motto one step further. On Friday, it will announce a partnership with Lavasoft, which makes security software that detects spyware and adware on users' PCs.Under the terms of the deal, Blekko will become the default search engine for Lavasoft users and will use Lavasoft's software to signal whether a site in its search results is trustworthy or not, using a red or green symbol.The goal, said Rich Skrenta, chief executive of Blekko, ""is to protect search especially in problematic categories like 'cash back credit cards' and 'free credit reports' where consumers can end up getting their identities stolen.""Blekko's pitch seems to be gaining traction. Last month, it claims 3.5 million unique visitors used the site for 100 million search queries. This time last year, 750,000 unique visitors used the service to conduct half as many queries. (People perform billions of searches each day on Google.) ""In the past, privacy was the domain of tin-foil hat people,"" said Mr. Skrenta. ""It's risen to the mainstream level where amateur consumers find it a more appealing hook."" "
Facebook Cancels Shortcut Over Concern for Security,"SAN FRANCISCO -- What was supposed to be a shortcut for Facebook users to log into their pages ended up exposing their e-mail addresses -- and, in some cases, potentially allowing access to their accounts as well. A Facebook spokesman said on Friday that the company had created the shortcut, called auto login, to let some users go directly to their pages by clicking on a Web link sent to their e-mail addresses. Once they clicked on the link, they could get into their accounts, rather than having to go to Facebook.com and log in.Some of the links required users to type their passwords, while others did not, the company said.On the Web site Hacker News, a technology discussion board, Matt Jones, an engineer at Facebook, said the company had offered the service for ''ease of use'' and never made the Web addresses ''publicly available.''But they did become publicly available, as the discussion on Hacker News revealed on Friday.The Facebook spokesman, Frederic Wolens, said some users may have posted the links on the Web, allowing anyone to search for them. Those links could give a stranger access to the Facebook pages connected to them, as well as the e-mail addresses of those users. Mr. Wolens said he had no explanation why someone would post the links.When Facebook found the problem, it discontinued the shortcut.The Hacker News thread said over one million Facebook accounts had been affected. Facebook could not confirm that figure on Friday afternoon.TrendMicro, a private security company that offers safety tools for Facebook users, said Web address shortcuts were inherently dangerous because they could ultimately end up on the Web.''Many, many hackers are targeting these portals because of the ubiquitous trust and use of them,'' said Tom Kellermann, vice president for cybersecurity at TrendMicro. He added, ''You don't take shortcuts through the woods in cyberspace.''The news of the security hole comes a week after a Bulgarian blogger, Bogomil Shopov, said he had bought 1.1 million Facebook users' names and e-mail addresses on the Web for $5. He found the information for sale on a marketplace site, gigbucks.com. The items are no longer available.Mr. Wolens of Facebook said the data had been acquired and compiled by someone who took whatever information Facebook users made public on their pages -- and from other publicly available data about those users.Mr. Kellermann of TrendMicro said the problem with the shortcut could explain how the names and e-mail addresses that Mr. Shopov had found became public. Facebook said the security flaw and the user data for sale had nothing to do with each another.''We have no reason whatsoever to believe that these two incidents are related,'' Mr. Wolens said. "
ID Theft Firms Criticized on 'Free Trial' Policies,"A new reporton identity-theft protection services says the most frequent complaint from customers concerns misleading trial offers.Customers sometimes didn't understand that they would have to pay once the trials ended, the report found, or had trouble reaching the companies to cancel the service.TheConsumer Federation of America, working with commercial providers of identity theft services, last year proposed voluntary ""best practices"" for the firms to follow in marketing their products. These companies offer a range of services, from credit report monitoring to correcting actual damage caused by an incident of identity theft.The best practices state, in part, that companies shouldn't misrepresent their ability to protect consumers from identity theft; that they should have clear, easily accessible privacy policies; and that they clearly explain how the service's features may help consumers.The federation recently completed a review of about 20 providers' Web sites to see how firms were doing in meeting the guidelines a year later.  It found that most of the services' Web sites did a ""fair job"" of complying with the guidelines, but there is still ""need for improvement,"" said Susan Grant, director of the federation's consumer protection division and leader of the project, in a news release.The full report looks at the sites and ranks their compliance with each of the voluntary guidelines. The researchers didn't actually test the services; rather, they tried to gauge how well the companies were doing in providing straightforward information to prospective customers.If the federation decided the company met the standard, it awarded a ""thumbs up"" symbol; if it needed some work, it got a hammer; and if it didn't meet the standard, it got a ""thumbs down.""The report found that some of the sites' marketing hype remains over the top, and may promise more than the company can deliver. ""While these services may alert consumers about possible identity theft quicker than they would discover it themselves,"" the report said, ""they can't prevent consumers' personal information from being stolen or detect identity theft in all circumstances.""But the most common complaint found during an online search had to with ""free trial"" offers, an area that wasn't directly addressed in the original guidelines.When the federation's researchers searched online for complaints, looking at sites like ripoffreport.com, it didn't find much concern about the quality of the identity theft services. (That isn't surprising, the report said, since ""the real test of these services is how well their alert systems and fraud assistance work when consumers become identity theft victims, and many will never experience that situation."")Rather, they found complaints about trial offers, in which companies offer their services free for a week or a month, after which customers are charged a fee. Customers often didn't understand that they had to cancel the service to avoid being charged a fee. And some said they did try to cancel but couldn't reach a company representative to do so. Still others said they never agreed to try the service in the first place.The federation recommends that identity theft service providers give customers 48 hours' notice that a free trial is ending, along with information about how to cancel if they wish and what the terms of the contract will be going forward, if they want to continue using it. And, the federation added, services should provide a quick, easy means of cancellation -- ""no endless busy signals, no multiple hoops to jump through.""Have you encountered problems when trying to cancel an identity-theft protection service?

Iran Confirms Attack by Virus That Collects Information,"TEHRAN -- The computers of high-ranking Iranian officials appear to have been penetrated by a data-mining virus called Flame, in what may be the most destructive cyberattack on Iran since the notorious Stuxnet virus, an Iranian cyberdefense organization confirmed on Tuesday.In a message posted on its Web site, Iran's Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center warned that the virus was dangerous. An expert at the organization said in a telephone interview that it was potentially more harmful than the 2010 Stuxnet virus, which destroyed several centrifuges used for Iran's nuclear enrichment program. In contrast to Stuxnet, the newly identified virus is designed not to do damage but to collect information secretly from a wide variety of sources. Flame, which experts say could be as much as five years old, was discovered by Iranian computer experts. In a statement about Flame on its Web site, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian producer of antivirus software, said that ''the complexity and functionality of the newly discovered malicious program exceed those of all other cyber menaces known to date.''The virus bears special encryption hallmarks that an Iranian cyberdefense official said have strong similarities to previous Israeli malware. ''Its encryption has a special pattern which you only see coming from Israel,'' said Kamran Napelian, an official with Iran's Computer Emergency Response Team. ''Unfortunately, they are very powerful in the field of I.T.''While Israel never comments officially on such matters, its involvement was hinted at by top officials there. ''Anyone who sees the Iranian threat as a significant threat -- it's reasonable that he will take various steps, including these, to harm it,'' said the vice prime minister and strategic affairs minister, Moshe Yaalon, in a widely quoted interview with Israel's Army Radio on Tuesday.In a speech Tuesday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not mention Flame specifically, but he did include computer viruses as one of five critical types of threats Israel faces, saying: ''We are investing a great deal of money in that, human capital and financial capital. I expect these investments to yield a great deal in the coming years.''Mr. Napelian said that Flame seemed designed to mine data from personal computers and that it was distributed through USB sticks rather than the Internet, meaning that a USB has to be inserted manually into at least one computer in a network.''This virus copies what you enter on your keyboard; it monitors what you see on your computer screen,'' Mr. Napelian said. That includes collecting passwords, recording sounds if the computer is connected to a microphone, scanning disks for specific files and monitoring Skype.''Those controlling the virus can direct it from a distance,'' Mr. Napelian said. ''Flame is no ordinary product. This was designed to monitor selected computers.''Mr. Napelian said he was not authorized to disclose how much damage Flame had caused, but guessed the virus had been active for the past six months and was responsible for a ''massive'' data loss. Iran says it has developed antivirus software to combat Flame, something that international antivirus companies have yet to do, since they have just become aware of its existence.''One of the most alarming facts is that the Flame cyberattack campaign is currently in its active phase, and its operator is consistently surveilling infected systems, collecting information and targeting new systems to accomplish its unknown goals,'' Alexander Gostev, chief security expert at Kaspersky Lab, said on the company's Web site.Those close to Iran's leaders said that the virus was tantamount to an attack.''I am no virus expert, and my computer seems to be working,'' said Sadollah Zarei, a columnist for the state newspaper, Kayhan, ''but I know this is covert warfare, aimed at weakening us.''

New Interest In Hacking As Threat To Security,"WASHINGTON -- During the five-month period between October and February, there were 86 reported attacks on computer systems in the United States that control critical infrastructure, factories and databases, according to the Department of Homeland Security, compared with 11 over the same period a year ago.None of the attacks caused significant damage, but they were part of a spike in hacking attacks on networks and computers of all kinds over the same period. The department recorded more than 50,000 incidents since October, about 10,000 more than in the same period a year earlier, with an incident defined as any intrusion or attempted intrusion on a computer network. The increase has prompted a new interest in cybersecurity on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are being prodded by the Obama administration to advance legislation that could require new standards at facilities where a breach could cause significant casualties or economic damage.It is not clear whether the higher numbers were due to increased reporting amid a wave of high-profile hacking, including the arrest last week of several members of the group Anonymous, or an actual increase in attacks.James A. Lewis, a senior fellow and a specialist in computer security issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a policy group in Washington, said that as hacking awareness had increased, attacks had become more common. He said that the attacks on the nation's infrastructure were particularly jarring.''Some of this is heightened awareness because everyone is babbling about it,'' he said of the reported rise in computer attacks. ''But much of it is because the technology has improved and the hackers have gotten better and people and countries are probing around more like the Russians and Chinese have.''He added: ''We hit rock bottom on this in 2010. Then we hit rock bottom in 2011. And we are still at rock bottom. We were vulnerable before and now we're just more vulnerable. You can destroy physical infrastructure with a cyberattack just like you could with a bomb.''The legislation the administration is pressing Congress to pass would give the federal government greater authority to regulate the security used by companies that run the nation's infrastructure. It would give the Homeland Security Department the authority to enforce minimum standards on companies whose service or product would lead to mass casualties, evacuations or major economic damage if crippled by hackers.The bill the administration backs is sponsored by Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. It has bipartisan support, and its prospects appear good. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, is sponsoring a more business-friendly bill that emphasizes the sharing of information and has fewer requirements for companies.Last week on Capitol Hill, Janet Napolitano, the secretary of Homeland Security; Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made their pitch to roughly four dozen senators about why they should pass the Lieberman-Collins bill.At a closed-door briefing, the senators were shown how a power company employee could derail the New York City electrical grid by clicking on an e-mail attachment sent by a hacker, and how an attack during a heat wave could have a cascading impact that would lead to deaths and cost the nation billions of dollars.''I think General Dempsey said it best when he said that prior to 9/11, there were all kinds of information out there that a catastrophic attack was looming,'' Ms. Napolitano said in an interview. ''The information on a cyberattack is at that same frequency and intensity and is bubbling at the same level, and we should not wait for an attack in order to do something.''General Dempsey told the senators that he had skipped a meeting of the National Security Council on Iran to attend the briefing because he was so concerned about a cyberattack, according to a person who had been told details of the meeting. A spokesman for General Dempsey said the chairman had ''sent his vice chairman to the meeting on Iran so that he could attend the Senate meeting and emphasize his concern about cybersecurity.''''His point was about his presence at the cyber exercise rather than a value judgment on the 'threat,' '' the spokesman, Col. David Lapan, said.Experts say one of the biggest problems is that no part of the government has complete authority over the issue. The Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency give the government intelligence on potential attacks, and the F.B.I. prosecutes hackers who break the law. The Department of Homeland Security receives reports about security breaches but has no authority to compel business to improve their security.''Nobody does critical infrastructure of the dot-com space where America now relies on faith healing and snake oil for protection,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''The administration wants it to be the Department of Homeland Security, but the department needs additional authorities to be effective.'' "
Hacking Case Based in China Is Given a Face,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A breach of computers belonging to companies in Japan and India and to Tibetan activists has been linked to a former graduate student at a Chinese university -- putting a face on the persistent espionage by Chinese hackers against foreign companies and groups.The attacks were connected to an online alias, according to a report to be released on Friday by Trend Micro, a computer security firm with headquarters in Tokyo.The owner of the alias, according to online records, is Gu Kaiyuan, a former graduate student at Sichuan University, in Chengdu, China, which receives government financing for its research in computer network defense.Mr. Gu is now apparently an employee at Tencent, China's leading Internet portal company, also according to online records. According to the report, he may have recruited students to work on the university's research involving computer attacks and defense. The researchers did not link the attacks directly to government-employed hackers. But security experts and other researchers say the techniques and the victims point to a state-sponsored campaign.''The fact they targeted Tibetan activists is a strong indicator of official Chinese government involvement,'' said James A. Lewis, a former diplomat and expert in computer security who is a director and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''A private Chinese hacker may go after economic data but not a political organization.''Neither the Chinese embassy in Washington nor the Chinese consulate in New York answered requests for comment.The Trend Micro report describes systematic attacks on at least 233 personal computers. The victims include Indian military research organizations and shipping companies; aerospace, energy and engineering companies in Japan; and at least 30 computer systems of Tibetan advocacy groups, according to both the report and interviews with experts connected to the research. The espionage has been going on for at least 10 months and is continuing, the report says.In the report, the researchers detailed how they had traced the attacks to an e-mail address used to register one of the command-and-control servers that directed the attacks. They mapped that address to a QQ number -- China's equivalent of an online instant messaging screen name -- and from there to an online alias.The person who used the alias, ''scuhkr'' -- the researchers said in an interview that it could be shorthand for Sichuan University hacker -- wrote articles about hacking, which were posted to online hacking forums and, in one case, recruited students to a computer network and defense research program at Sichuan University's Institute of Information Security in 2005, the report said.The New York Times traced that alias to Mr. Gu. According to online records, Mr. Gu studied at Sichuan University from 2003 to 2006, when he wrote numerous articles about hacking under the names of ''scuhkr'' and Gu Kaiyuan. Those included a master's thesis about computer attacks and prevention strategies. The Times connected Mr. Gu to Tencent first through an online university forum, which listed where students found jobs, and then through a call to Tencent.Reached at Tencent and asked about the attacks, Mr. Gu said, ''I have nothing to say.''Tencent, which is a privately managed and stock market-listed Internet company, did not respond to several later inquiries seeking comment.The attacks are technically similar to a spy operation known as the Shadow Network, which since 2009 has targeted the government of India and also pilfered a year's worth of the Dalai Lama's personal e-mails. Trend Micro's researchers found that the command-and-control servers directing the Shadow Network attacks also directed the espionage in its report.The Shadow Network attacks were believed to be the work of hackers who studied in China's Sichuan Province at the University of Electronic Science and Technology, another university in Chengdu, that also receives government financing for computer network defense research. The People's Liberation Army has an online reconnaissance bureau in the city.Some security researchers suggest that the Chinese government may use people not affiliated with the government in hacking operations -- what security professionals call a campaign.For example, earlier this year, Joe Stewart, a security expert at Dell SecureWorks, traced a campaign against the Vietnam government and oil exploration companies to an e-mail address that belonged to an Internet marketer in China.''It suggested there may be a marketplace for freelance work -- that this is not a 9-to-5 work environment,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''It's a smart way to do business. If you are a country attacking a foreign government and you don't want it tied back, it would make sense to outsource the work to actors who can collect the data for you.''The campaign detailed in the Trend Micro report was first documented two weeks ago by Symantec, a security firm based in Mountain View, Calif. It called the operation ''Luckycat,'' after the login name of one of the other attackers, and issued its own report. But Trend Micro's report provides far more details. The two firms were unaware that they were both studying the same operation.Trend Micro's researchers said they were first tipped off to the campaign three months ago when they received two malware samples from two separate computer attacks -- one in Japan and another in Tibet -- and found that they were both being directed from the same command-and-control servers. Over the next several months, they traced more than 90 different malware attacks back to those servers.Each attack began, as is often the case, with an e-mail intended to lure victims into opening an attachment. Indian victims were sent an e-mail about India's ballistic missile defense program. Tibetan advocates received e-mails about self-immolation or, in one case, a job opening at the Tibet Fund, a nonprofit based in New York City. After Japan's earthquake and nuclear disaster, victims in Japan received an e-mail about radiation measurements.Each e-mail contained an attachment that, when clicked, automatically created a backdoor from the victim's computer to the attackers' servers. To do this, the hackers exploited security holes in Microsoft Office and Adobe software. Almost immediately, they uploaded a directory of the victims' machines to their servers. If the files looked enticing, hackers installed a remote-access tool, or rat, which gave them real-time control of their target's machine. As long as a victim's computer was connected to the Internet, attackers had the ability to record their keystrokes and passwords, grab screenshots and even crawl from that machine to other computers in the victim's network.Trend Micro's researchers would not identify the names of the victims in the attacks detailed in its report, but said that they had alerted the victims, and that many were working to remediate their systems.A spokesman for India's Defense Ministry, Sitanshu Kar, said he was not aware of the report or of the attacks it described. Fumio Iwai, a deputy consul at the Japanese consulate in New York, declined to comment.As of Thursday, the campaign's servers were still operating and computers continue to leak information.''This was not an individual attack that started and stopped,'' said Nart Villeneuve, a researcher that helped lead Trend Micro's efforts. ''It's a continuous campaign that has been going on for a long time. There are constant compromises going on all time. These guys are busy and stay busy.'' "
Republicans Fail a Security Test,"Senate Republicans regularly promote themselves as the true custodians of national security. This claim seemed particularly hollow last week when they helped block a new measure aimed at protecting America's vulnerable computer networks from attack by, among others, potentially hostile foreign governments. The legislation would have required companies to share data about cyberattacks with the government, and would have created a framework for minimum security standards to toughen computer protections. But the Chamber of Commerce and other business interests said the rules would be too costly and intrusive, and the Republicans went along. The result was to postpone action until after the August recess, and even then the bill may go nowhere given the pressures of election-year politics.The cost of inaction is already high. Every day, China and other foreign governments, hackers and criminals are working to break into American computer networks. They have targeted major companies and military contractors; last year there were 200 attacks on vital infrastructure -- power plants, electric grids, refineries, transportation networks and water treatment systems.Most of these facilities are owned by the private sector, whose defenses are dangerously weak. Many companies do not even insist on secure passwords for computers. Nightmare scenarios include computer attacks that shut down the stock exchange, a nuclear power plant, the nation's rail system or all three at once.This is not scaremongering. Experts have long warned of the dangers. The Obama administration, including senior military leaders, lobbied hard for the bill, which was three years in the making and the product of a bipartisan effort. In the end, their common sense pleadings could not compete with the Chamber of Commerce, which has funneled millions of dollars to Republican political campaigns.In recent days the bill's principal Senate sponsors, including Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut independent, and Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, agreed to compromises, including a provision making the stricter security standards voluntary and giving industry an important role in framing them. These efforts were also unavailing.The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, insists that his fellow Republicans realize that the country faces a cybersecurity threat. (''We all recognize the problem,'' he said.) If that is true, he and his colleagues will have to find a way to resolve the differences and pass a credible bill. Otherwise, they will have left the nation at grave risk. "
A Hacker Brings Down GoDaddy,"7:48 p.m. | UpdatedA supporter of Anonymous, the loose confederation of rogue hackers, claimed responsibility on Monday for an attack that brought down GoDaddy, a Web hosting service, and its customers.GoDaddy's site was out for several hours Monday afternoon, as were many of the Web sites belonging to its 10.5 million customers, like the fantasy sports site Draftday and eBaum's World, a humor site.""We're aware of the issues affecting our site,"" Elizabeth Driscoll, a GoDaddy spokeswoman, said. ""We're still working to figure out what happened and determine the number of Web sites impacted."" The person behind the Twitter account @AnonymousOwn3r took responsibility for the attack and said all of GoDaddy's servers were knocked out with what is known as a distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS attack, in which a site is flooded with traffic until it collapses under the load.@film_girl I'm taking godaddy down bacause well i'd like to test how the cyber security is safe and for more reasons that i can not talk now- Anonymous Own3r (@AnonymousOwn3r) 10 Sep 12""When I do some DDoS attack, I like to let it down by many days,"" the person claiming responsibility said on Twitter. ""It can last one hour or one month.""This person said that he had conducted the attack alone and that it was not part of a broader Anonymous campaign. GoDaddy briefly became an target of Anonymous last December for its initial support of the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, a Congressional bill that would have made it possible for copyright owners to seek court orders to take sites offline for practicing or aiding piracy. GoDaddy withdrew its support of the bill after customers began transferring their Web sites to its competitors and hackers threatened to attack it.But one of the Twitter accounts most frequently associated with Anonymous, @AnonyOps, distanced the group from Monday's attack and said it was the work of one individual. ""He's either a newbie to activism and cutting his teeth by doing this, which is misguided, or he's trying to give Anons a bad reputation,"" the Twitter post said.Godaddy technician trips over ethernet cord, pulling it from edge router. Blames Anonymous.- Anonymous (@AnonyOps) 10 Sep 12Rich Miller, the editor in chief of Data Center Knowledge, an online publication that tracks the data center industry, said a shutdown at GoDaddy had widespread repercussions for the Internet.""This is potentially the largest kind of problem you could have on the Internet,"" Mr. Miller said. ""GoDaddy is the largest company in the domain industry thanks to its colorful Super Bowl commercials.""Mr. Miller estimated that GoDaddy managed 52 million domain names and hosted about 5 million Web sites on its servers. Its sheer size has made the company a ripe target for hackers, he said.GoDaddy was previously the target of two notable DDoS attacks, one in 2007 and another in 2009.GoDaddy customers vented their frustration on Twitter and elsewhere. Bob de Luna, a director of public information at the United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit health organization, said four domain names it had registered with GoDaddy had been down for several hours. He said that when he contacted GoDaddy's customer service line, a representative told him 750 people were waiting in line behind him. The representative told him that during service failures, a typical wait list was 20 people.GoDaddy's Web site was still down Monday evening, and the company said it would provide updates through its Twitter and Facebook accounts.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Hacking Group Attacks Weapons Maker," While many celebrated Valentine's Day on Tuesday, hackers celebrated a different holiday: the one-year anniversary of the uprising in Bahrain, sometimes called the February 14 Revolution. They attacked  Combined Systems, a company based in Jamestown, Pa., saying that the attack was in retaliation for sales by the company of chemical weapons ""to repress our revolutionary movements.""On Monday night, hackers who say they are members of the collective known as Anonymous claimed responsibility on Twitter for taking down the Web site of  Combined Systems. They also claimed to have stolen employee names, e-mails, addresses, passwords and client lists, and threatened the site's administrators that if they helped Combined Systems rebuild its Web site, they would expose those companies' client lists and e-mails as well.The hackers claimed to have been inside the company's network for some time but said they were forced to take down the site after Google alerted the company that a hacker had broken into its Web hosts. The hackers posted some of the stolen e-mails on the online bulletin board site Pastebin, including one e-mail, dated Feb. 10, from a Combined Systems Web developer who wrote, ""Looks like our Web hosts got hacked.""""It's clear the hackers did their research,"" said Jerry Irvine, a member of the National Cyber Security Task Force and chief information officer at Prescient Solutions. ""They had been grabbing information for a long time. I'm sure this company spends millions of dollars a year on security, protecting their manufacturing facilities so people can't come in and steal their product, but they let people come in and steal their e-mails and intellectual property. They need to spend as much protecting their I.T. parameters as they do their physical parameters.""Combined Systems did not respond to requests for comment. The company, which counts the Carlyle Group as an investor, describes itself as a ""tactical weapons company"" and has been accused by journalists and human rights groups of selling tear gas canisters and grenades to Arab governments.Last year, Amnesty International said Combined Systems had shipped a total of 46 tons of ammunition, including ""chemical irritants and riot control agents such as tear gas"" to Egyptian security forces.The attack on Combined Systems is part of a much broader campaign Anonymous has conducted recently against federal agencies and security groups. Last Friday, the group knocked the C.I.A. Web site offline.  A week earlier,  the group intercepted a conference call between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Scotland Yard and released a 16-minute recording of the call. Hours after that attack, the hackers took down the Web site and stole the e-mail of the law firm that had represented Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich, the soldier accused of killing 24 unarmed civilians in Haditha, Iraq, in 2005.As of Tuesday afternoon, the Combined Systems site was still down. "
Daily Report: Hacking Attacks Are Linked to Man at Chinese Firm,"  A breach of computers belonging to companies in Japan and India and to Tibetan activists has been linked to a former graduate student at a Chinese university, Nicole Perlroth writes on Friday in The New York Times. The case puts a face on the persistent espionage by Chinese hackers against foreign companies and groups.The attacks were connected to an online alias, according to a report released Friday by Trend Micro, a computer security firm with headquarters in Tokyo. The owner of the alias, according to online records, is Gu Kaiyuan, a former graduate student at Sichuan University, in Chengdu, China, which receives government financing for its research in computer network defense.Mr. Gu is now apparently an employee at Tencent, China's leading Internet portal company, also according to online records. Mr. Gu studied at Sichuan University from 2003 to 2006, when he wrote numerous articles about hacking under the names of ""scuhkr"" and Gu Kaiyuan. Those included a master's thesis about computer attacks and prevention strategies.

MasterCard and Visa Investigate Data Breach,"Visa and MasterCard are investigating whether a data security breach at one of the main companies that processes transactions improperly exposed private customer information, bank officials said Friday. The event highlighted a crucial vulnerability that could affect millions of credit card holders.The breach occurred at Global Payments, an Atlanta company that helps Visa and MasterCard process transactions for merchants. One bank executive estimated that about one million to three million accounts could be affected. That does not mean that all those cards were used fraudulently, but that credit card information on the cardholders was exposed. The bank official, who insisted on anonymity because the inquiry is at an early stage, said that Visa and MasterCard notified his company on Thursday, but that banks had been frustrated with the pace of disclosure by Global Payments. He said that Global Payments, which is one of the biggest transactions processors, had provided little information on where the breaches took place, how accounts were hacked and other details that could indicate which customers might be vulnerable.Banks said that when they could identify victims, they would notify them and replace credit cards, if necessary.While far from the largest breach of credit card data in recent years, the latest incident, which is being investigated by major banks and federal authorities as well as the card companies, underscores concerns about the vulnerability of electronic financial data.As financial services companies have improved security over the last year, criminals have aimed at a specific part of the credit card system: the payment processors that act as a bridge between banks and retailers. Security consultants say that the sophistication of these attacks is increasing.''Hackers are well aware that these systems don't have the same sophisticated levels of security as the banks,'' said Tom Kellerman, a vice president at Trend Micro, a computer security company. ''The payment processors have become their Achilles' heel.''Bank officials said they were told by Visa and MasterCard that the breach occurred sometime from late January to late February, and included what is known as Track 1 and Track 2 data. That includes details like names, card numbers, validation codes and in some cases, customer addresses.''Thieves are after high concentrations of credit card numbers, which makes payment processors the perfect target,'' said Tim Matthews, a director at Symantec, a security firm.The processors, including Global Payments, act as the plumbing from merchants to banks, authorizing millions of transactions each day.With each swipe of a credit card, the card number and other important financial information travels from the merchant to the third-party processors and then to Visa or MasterCard. The data is then forwarded to the bank that issued the card.The holy grail for hackers is the account information. The goal is to break the data's encryption as it travels through the payment processor system, said Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst with Gartner Research, a security firm.This is the second breach at Global Payments in the last 12 months, according to two individuals briefed on the investigations who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Another similar attack was disclosed by Heartland Payment Systems in 2009, a breach that began in 2007 and resulted in the exposure of data on 130 million credit cards. Heartland estimated that breach cost it $140 million in fines, settlements and legal fees.The new possible breach was reported Friday morning by a blog called Krebs on Security. Trading in Global Payments shares was halted around noon but the share price had already dropped 9.1 percent to $47.50.A spokeswoman for Global Payments declined to comment on whether hackers had struck before. In a statement on Friday afternoon, the company said it had identified ''unauthorized access into a portion of its processing system,'' and had asked for help from external experts in computer security and also contacted federal law enforcement. The Secret Service, which investigates credit card fraud, confirmed that it was looking into the breach.''It is reassuring that our security processes detected an intrusion,'' said Paul R. Garcia, the chief executive of Global Payments. ''It is crucial to understand that this incident does not involve our merchants or their relationships with their customers.''Electronic payment industry officials also said the latest data thefts were not evidence of a larger problem. ''These folks work night and day to secure their systems, but they are connected to millions of merchants around the country and nothing is absolutely foolproof,'' said Thomas Goldsmith, a spokesman for the Electronic Transactions Association, a trade group.MasterCard would not say how many cardholders might have been affected by the attack. The card companies also said they had alerted banks and law enforcement officials to the breach, and emphasized that their own systems had not been compromised.''We have alerted payment card issuers regarding certain MasterCard accounts that are potentially at risk,'' MasterCard said in a statement. A Visa representative said that ''there has been no breach of Visa systems.''Banking regulators have indicated they were also concerned about the vulnerability of third-party payment processors.''The payment processing industry has not been regulated to the degree that banks have, and that's a gap in regulation,'' said Carol R. Van Cleef, a partner at Patton Boggs, a law firm in Washington.The F.D.I.C. raised alarms about the potential vulnerability of third-party processors back in 2008. ''Payment processors pose greater money laundering and fraud risk if they do not have an effective means of verifying their merchant clients' identities and business practices,'' the agency said. "
How China Steals Our Secrets,"Richard A. Clarke, the special adviser to the president for cybersecurity from 2001 to 2003, is the author of ''Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It.''WashingtonFOR the last two months, senior government officials and private-sector experts have paraded before Congress and described in alarming terms a silent threat: cyberattacks carried out by foreign governments. Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the F.B.I., said cyberattacks would soon replace terrorism as the agency's No. 1 concern as foreign hackers, particularly from China, penetrate American firms' computers and steal huge amounts of valuable data and intellectual property.It's not hard to imagine what happens when an American company pays for research and a Chinese firm gets the results free; it destroys our competitive edge. Shawn Henry, who retired last Friday as the executive assistant director of the F.B.I. (and its lead agent on cybercrime), told Congress last week of an American company that had all of its data from a 10-year, $1 billion research program copied by hackers in one night. Gen. Keith B. Alexander, head of the military's Cyber Command, called the continuing, rampant cybertheft ''the greatest transfer of wealth in history.'' Yet the same Congress that has heard all of this disturbing testimony is mired in disagreements about a proposed cybersecurity bill that does little to address the problem of Chinese cyberespionage. The bill, which would establish noncompulsory industry cybersecurity standards, is bogged down in ideological disputes. Senator John McCain, who dismissed it as a form of unnecessary regulation, has proposed an alternative bill that fails to address the inadequate cyberdefenses of companies running the nation's critical infrastructure. Since Congress appears unable and unwilling to address the threat, the executive branch must do something to stop it.In the past, F.B.I. agents parked outside banks they thought were likely to be robbed and then grabbed the robbers and the loot as they left. Catching the robbers in cyberspace is not as easy, but snatching the loot is possible.General Alexander testified last week that his organization saw an inbound attack that aimed to steal sensitive files from an American arms manufacturer. The Pentagon warned the company, which had to act on its own. The government did not directly intervene to stop the attack because no federal agency believes it currently has the authority or mission to do so.If given the proper authorization, the United States government could stop files in the process of being stolen from getting to the Chinese hackers. If government agencies were authorized to create a major program to grab stolen data leaving the country, they could drastically reduce today's wholesale theft of American corporate secrets.Many companies do not even know when they have been hacked. According to Congressional testimony last week, 94 percent of companies served by the computer-security firm Mandiant were unaware that they had been victimized. And although the Securities and Exchange Commission has urged companies to reveal when they have been victims of cyberespionage, most do not. Some, including Sony, Citibank, Lockheed, Booz Allen, Google, EMC and the Nasdaq have admitted to being victims. The government-owned National Laboratories and federally funded research centers have also been penetrated.Because it is fearful that government monitoring would be seen as a cover for illegal snooping and a violation of citizens' privacy, the Obama administration has not even attempted to develop a proposal for spotting and stopping vast industrial espionage. It fears a negative reaction from privacy-rights and Internet-freedom advocates who do not want the government scanning Internet traffic. Others in the administration fear further damaging relations with China. Some officials also fear that standing up to China might trigger disruptive attacks on America's vulnerable computer-controlled infrastructure.But by failing to act, Washington is effectively fulfilling China's research requirements while helping to put Americans out of work. Mr. Obama must confront the cyberthreat, and he does not even need any new authority from Congress to do so.Under Customs authority, the Department of Homeland Security could inspect what enters and exits the United States in cyberspace. Customs already looks online for child pornography crossing our virtual borders. And under the Intelligence Act, the president could issue a finding that would authorize agencies to scan Internet traffic outside the United States and seize sensitive files stolen from within our borders.And this does not have to endanger citizens' privacy rights. Indeed, Mr. Obama could build in protections like appointing an empowered privacy advocate who could stop abuses or any activity that went beyond halting the theft of important files.If Congress will not act to protect America's companies from Chinese cyberthreats, President Obama must.

Victory Spurs Speculation on Bharara's Next Move,"With the conviction of Rajat K. Gupta, the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, has now secured the biggest scalp yet in the government's broad campaign against insider trading on Wall Street.A victory in a case that relied almost entirely on circumstantial evidence is sure to embolden prosecutors in their pursuit of hedge fund traders and their tippers.The government built its case against Mr. Gupta on evidence like the timing of phone and trading records, showing that incriminating wiretaps - like those used to powerful effect in the trial of Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge fund manager who received the tips from Mr. Gupta and who was convicted of insider trading last year - were not a requisite to convince a jury of guilt. But after nearly five years of investigations and 60 convictions of hedge fund traders and corporate executives, a question looms for Mr. Bharara and his team of federal prosecutors:Is it time to move on?Several top prosecutors have done just that. Christopher L. Garcia, who helped lead the government's widespread crackdown of insider trading, left in February. Jonathan R. Streeter, the lead prosecutor in the case against Mr. Rajaratnam, left earlier this year, as did Andrew Michaelson, who was crucial in bringing and prosecuting the Galleon case.And the Gupta trial is expected to be the last for the prosecutor Reed Brodsky, who also prosecuted Mr. Rajaratnam.Mr. Bharara himself appears to have shifted his focus - at least publicly - away from the prosecution of financial fraud. In recent months, cybercrime has become a top concern, with Mr. Bharara mentioning the subject with increasing frequency in articles and speeches, just as he had in past years with insider trading. Indeed, even as his office was busy trying Mr. Gupta, Mr. Bharara wrote an op-ed article in The New York Times, saying that he had ''come to worry about few things as much as the gathering cyberthreat.'' At a cybersecurity conference in January, he listed it as his top concern.''Of all the issues I face as United States attorney - and there are many, many things that I have to deal with that are scary - cyberthreat in all of its breadth, variety and complexity is what worries me the most, the absolute most,'' he told attendees.So far, his office has brought just a handful of such cases, and not all have been home runs. In January, prosecutors charged two Russians with stealing personal and financial information from United States citizens through the use of computer programs. Last year, an appeals court vacated the conviction of a Goldman Sachs computer programmer accused of stealing trading programs from the investment bank.It is unlikely, however, that insider trading investigations will grind to a halt anytime soon. Several cases remain outstanding, including the prosecution of Anthony Chiasson, a co-founder of the once-prominent hedge fund Level Global Investors. And examinations of other hedge funds continue, as the remnants and offshoots of the Rajaratnam investigation wend their way through the pipeline.The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also indicated there could be much more to come, potentially placing those inquiries at odds with Mr. Bharara's office. Top investigators at the bureau recently said the agency could pursue insider trading for the next five years. After spending years to crack the surface of Wall Street, authorities say they have a vast network of sources embedded among the inner circles of high finance that they can tap for new leads.At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission continues to bring civil cases, no matter how small. The agency recently charged a paralegal and her father in Montana who made $67,000 trading off confidential information.The crackdown on insider trading in recent years has drawn some criticism from those who question why big bank executives have not been charged over their actions in the financial crisis. While federal authorities have started investigations of the large banks, few have materialized into major criminal cases. Mr. Bharara, who became the United States attorney in Manhattan in 2009 after serving as chief counsel to Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, has bristled at such criticism, arguing that while the banks may have been irresponsible, that does not make their actions criminal.Whatever his plans now, insider trading prosecutions have served Mr. Bharara well during his tenure. When he arrived at the office, prosecutors were already preparing charges against Mr. Rajaratnam, the result of a sprawling, multiyear investigation into one of the world's most prominent hedge fund managers. Many of the charges brought by Mr. Bharara have been an outgrowth of that case.The successful prosecutions have created a glow of media attention around Mr. Bharara, who follows a long line of prominent people in the office, including Rudolph W. Giuliani. A Time magazine cover in February featured a close-up of Mr. Bharara with the headline ''This Man Is Busting Wall Street'' superimposed on it. The cover ruffled feathers among colleagues at the United States attorney's office and at the F.B.I., who felt Mr. Bharara was taking too much credit.Many inside the office do not expect Mr. Bharara to remain in his current position much longer. Some suspect he will soon follow his colleagues to a corporate law firm, where he would very likely command a multimillion-dollar salary. And there is speculation that he could find himself on the short list of candidates to replace Eric H. Holder Jr., the United States attorney general, if President Obama is re-elected and Mr. Holder leaves.Mr. Bharara, for his part, has said that he has the best job in the world and intends to keep it.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Hotel Group Charged Over Data Thefts,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Trade Commission charged Wyndham Worldwide and three hotel and resort affiliates on Tuesday with allowing three breaches of its corporate data files in two years, resulting in the electronic theft of the credit card data of hundreds of thousands of the hotel chain's customers. In a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in Arizona, the F.T.C. said that Wyndham, which through its affiliates manages and franchises Ramada, Days Inn and Super 8 hotels, among others, often stored consumers' credit card information in text files that were easily read by hackers. Three times from April 2008 to January 2010, intruders gained access to the company's computer systems, the agency said, and the company failed to take corrective measures after each of the first two breaches.The commission charged Wyndham, which says it cooperated with the investigation, with unfair and deceptive practices, violating Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Wyndham claimed on its Web site that it protected the personal data of its customers, the F.T.C. said.The F.T.C. does not have the authority to fine companies for violations of the F.T.C. Act, except in certain circumstances. It asked the federal court for an injunction to prevent further violations and for relief ''to redress injury to consumers,'' including restitution for losses.The F.T.C.'s complaint claimed more than $10.6 million in fraud losses. Wyndham, however, said it knew of no customers who suffered a financial loss because of the incidents.The first breach, in April 2008, affected more than 500,000 credit card accounts and resulted in the transfer of hundreds of thousands of account numbers and related data to an Internet domain registered in Russia.Two more breaches occurred in 2009, the F.T.C. said, each giving the intruders access to 50,000 or more consumer card accounts. The data was then used to make fraudulent charges on the consumers' accounts.''At the time of these incidents, we made prompt efforts to notify the hotel customers whose information may have been compromised and offered them credit monitoring services,'' said Michael Valentino, a spokesman for Wyndham Worldwide, the parent company of three other business units that were also charged.''To date, we have not received any indication that any hotel customer experienced a financial loss as a result of these attacks,'' Mr. Valentino said. ''Since these events, we have made significant enhancements to our information security, and have assisted franchised and managed Wyndham Hotels and Resorts-brand hotels in enhancing their information security.''He added: ''We regret the F.T.C.'s recent decision to pursue litigation, as we have fully cooperated in its investigation and believe its claims are without merit. We intend to defend against the F.T.C.'s claims vigorously, and do not believe the outcome of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our company.''In addition to the parent company, the F.T.C. also charged the Wyndham Hotel Group, which franchises and manages roughly 7,000 hotels under 12 brands, including Ramada, Days Inn and Super 8; Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, which licenses the Wyndham name to 75 independently owned hotels; and Wyndham Hotel Management.

"Paying Hackers, Military Forms Uneasy Alliance","This fall, 16 high schools in California started experimental workshops, billed as a kind of ''shop class for the 21st century,'' that were financed by the federal government. And over the next three years, the $10 million program plans to expand to 1,000 high schools, modeled on the growing phenomenon of ''hackerspaces'' -- community clubhouses where hackers gather to build, invent or take things apart in their spare time.But the money has stirred some controversy. The financing for the schools program is one of several recent grants that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, has made to build closer ties to hackers.Unlike the hackers who cripple Web sites and steal data, the people the government is working with are more often computer professionals who indulge their curiosity at their local hackerspace. But the financing has prompted criticism that the military's money could co-opt these workshops just as they are starting to spread quickly. There are about 200 hackerspaces in the United States, a sharp jump from the handful that existed five years ago. The workshops, with names like the Hacktory, Jigsaw Renaissance and Hacker Dojo, have incubated successful businesses like Pinterest, the social networking site, and are seen as hotbeds for recruiting engineers and computer scientists.''Magic comes from these places,'' said Peiter Zatko, a program manager at Darpa, who is reaching out to these workshops, looking for cutting-edge ideas in cybersecurity. His program has entered into 74 contracts, and about 40 projects have been completed, work that he said would have been stymied by traditional government bureaucracy. (Mr. Zatko made a name for himself as a respected hacker before joining the government -- he testified before a Senate committee in 1998, using the pseudonym Mudge, and told the panel that he could take down the Internet in 30 minutes.)When his government colleagues see the results of his program, ''their jaws just drop,'' Mr. Zatko said.Many people say that hackerspaces are promising incubators for innovation and should be cultivated. However, not everyone agrees that the Defense Department should be playing a role, especially in high school programs.''Having these programs in schools is fantastic, but the military calling the shots in American education?'' Mitch Altman, a co-founder of Noisebridge, a San Francisco hackerspace, said in an interview. ''I don't see that as a positive move,'' added Mr. Altman, who, in an online post, was among the first to take a stand against the program.The controversy over the government programs led to a tense session in a packed ballroom at the Hackers on Planet Earth conference this summer in New York, where recipients and critics of the Darpa financing gathered to discuss its implications.''If you grow a piece of celery in red water, it's going to be red,'' said Sean Auriti, who is known as Psytek at the hackerspace Alpha One Labs in Brooklyn, which he runs. ''I'm just wondering how this Darpa defense contract money is going to influence these projects.''And yet Mr. Auriti himself is benefiting from the Darpa money as a member of SpaceGambit, a consortium of hackerspaces that won a $500,000 grant for research in space exploration and colonization technologies. He said he hoped that the grant would help him build a mini-thruster to launch backpack-size satellites into orbit.But the debate over the financing has prompted him to establish a separate working group for the space research with Darpa. That way, none of his workshop's members will feel as though they are unwillingly participating in government work, he said.Some on the conference panel voiced concerns that Darpa financing would steer more hackers toward military projects. Mr. Altman, the Noisebridge co-founder, said he viewed the influence of military money as a threat because it would lead hackers to choose projects that might appeal to grant makers, as opposed to following their passions, however idiosyncratic.Everyone on the panel agreed that hackerspaces could provide an exciting model for hands-on technical education in schools, and Dale Dougherty, the founder of Maker Media, which caters to the do-it-yourself movement, said he believed that the high school program that his company was managing would do just that.''I think we're looking at science and technology as content, not experiences,'' Mr. Dougherty said. ''We're asking kids, 'Do you want to be an engineer?' and they don't know what that means. But if you ask them, 'What do you want to make?' they start thinking about doing something.''Darpa's Web site describes the program's goal as encouraging students to ''jointly design and build systems of moderate complexity, such as mobile robots, go-carts, etc., in response to prize challenges.''But Mr. Dougherty said that the fears about his program were unfounded, and that he wanted the students to work on projects of their choosing.''We're not asking kids to build weapons,'' he said.Darpa has a storied history of making long-shot bets and hoping that a handful of them will pay off. It financed the development of technologies that led to the creation of the Internet, GPS and stealth technology. This cluster of bets on low-cost, innovative manufacturing is part of a strategy by Darpa officials to reduce development times in a range of projects like armored vehicle construction and cybersecurity fixes.When Lt. Col. Nathan Wiedenman, a Darpa program manager, appeared in Army fatigues this May at a San Francisco-area do-it-yourself festival, Maker Faire, he said the agency's mission was to ensure that the United States would never again be surprised by the technical superiority of an enemy state, as it was when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik.''To push the bounds of new technology, we have to physically make things,'' he said.Colonel Wiedenman is managing both the grant for the high school program and a $3.5 million grant to the retail start-up TechShop (it is a bit like a Kinko's, but instead of copiers, members pay to user laser cutters). As part of that contract, Darpa employees will have access to TechShop's tools after midnight, when the doors are closed to the public, since Darpa has no lab space of its own.Matt Joyce, an early hackerspace member who has worked with NASA and has publicly voiced support for Darpa financing, said he believed that the agency's interest in hackerspaces was a sign of their growing importance. But he acknowledged that the government financing would continue to provoke debate, because questions about ethics often loom large for engineers, even in cases in which the government allows them to retain commercial rights to their inventions.''You never know when you build something where it might end up,'' he said. ''I think there's a lot of folks getting the Darpa funding, and a lot of people watching on the sidelines to see what happens.'' "
"At Davos, Discussions of a Global Data Deluge","DAVOS, Switzerland - Each year, a new theme reverberates through technology conferences around the world. A few years ago it was predictions of the coming wave of social media, location-based services and mobile, long before they became mainstream.Today's topic de jour: data. Lots of data.What makes the data discussion different than in previous years is that it is being discussed in high-profile nontechnology meetings too. This is clearly evident at this year's annual World Economic Forum.Meetings here this week include: ""From data to decisions: How are new approaches to data intelligence transforming decision-making?"" ""Data deluge and citizen science."" ""Incidents from digital crime to massive incidents of data theft are increasing significantly, with major political, social and economic implications."" ""How is big data being used to uncover individual and collective human dynamics?""The discussions are not confined to technology attendees either. Chancellors, bankers and educators meeting at the conference are being asked to discuss what the forum calls a growing data deluge and how to manage it.A 2012 report released by the World Economic Forum, titled, ""Big Data, Big Impact: New Possibilities for International Development,"" outlines some of the possibilities data can bring around the globe to business and education. It also warns of its potential privacy implications.The report says data is a new economic asset class, which touches all aspects of society, regardless of income or location.""Big data represents one of these seismic economic shifts that happens every 10 years,"" said Zach Bogue, co-founder of a stealth data investment fund called Data Collective, who was attending Davos. ""In some sense, this data has always existed, but until now the bandwidth, storage capability and compute power haven't existed to harness it.""Yet as there is talk of data, the discussion of privacy is not far behind.Earlier this week in Munich, Viviane Reding, the European justice commissioner, repeatedly talked about data in respect to privacy. Ms. Reding said there were 27 laws that apply to data in Europe, most of which date back more than a decade and don't properly protect consumers today.Ms. Reding outlined new regulations that were presented in Brussels on Wednesday and were designed to implement one sweeping data protection regulation that would apply to all of Europe.The new regulations are part of the discussion at Davos as these new rules would drastically affect the way companies operate and collect data. For example, one component of this legislation will require companies to communicate to users why they are collecting this data and how long it is being stored on company servers.Although the proposed data law being presented by Ms. Reding will apply to companies in Europe, it will clearly affect technology companies around the globe too, including Facebook, Twitter and Google in the United States.At the World Economic Forum, the discussion is also focusing on one of the toughest regulation challenges in regards to data collection: How to manage a balancing act between governments overseeing data collection and its actions stifling innovation. More importantly, regulators hope to figure out a global solution to data collection.As the World Economic Forum reports says: ""Concerted action is needed by governments, development organizations and companies to ensure that this data helps the individuals and communities who create it."" "
Disruptions: Casting a Ballot by Smartphone,"Last Tuesday, millions of Americans stood in long lines to cast their votes. While they waited, sometimes for several hours, many used their smartphones to pass the time.Some read articles about the election. Others updated their Twitter or Instagram feeds with pictures of the lines at the polls. And some took care of more private tasks, like sharing health information with their doctors, reading and editing confidential work documents, or paying bills and transferring money using banking applications.Once in the voting booth, they slipped their phones into their pockets and purses and, in many cases, picked up a pen and a piece of paper to cast their ballot.So at a time when we can see video shot by a robot on Mars, when there are cars that can drive themselves, and when we can deposit checks on our smartphones without going to a bank, why do most people still have to go to a polling place to vote?That's because, security experts say, letting people vote through their phones or computers could have disastrous consequences.""I think it's a terrible idea,"" said Barbara Simons, a former I.B.M. researcher and co-author of the book ""Broken Ballots: Will Your Vote Count?""Ms. Simons then ran through a list of calamitous events that could occur if we voted by Internet. Viruses could be used to take over voters' phones; rogue countries like Iran could commandeer computers and change results without our knowledge; government insiders could write software that decides who wins; denial-of-service attacks could take down the Internet on Election Day.""It's a national security issue,"" Ms. Simons said. ""We really don't want our enemies to be able to determine our government for us - or even our friends for that matter.""Of course, many of those concerns make sense. None of us want some evil autocrat picking the next president.But other countries allow citizens to vote via the Internet, or are experimenting with the idea. In 2005, Estonia started testing an online voting system and has since registered more than a million voters who now cast their ballots online. Italy plans to test an online voting system this year.Not the United States, the land of the free and the home of the smartphone.Ronald L. Rivest, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that for now, the best technology out there is the one we've been using.""Winston Churchill had a famous saying that democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried before,"" Mr. Rivest said. ""You can apply the same statement to paper ballots, which are the worst form of voting, but better than all the others that have been tried before.""Mr. Rivest, who is the R in the name of the RSA encryption system, which is used by government institutions and banks, said that if things went wrong on Election Day, chaos could ensue, because doubts about the results would rattle the foundations of our democracy.""One of the main goals of the election is to produce credible evidence to the loser that he's really lost,"" he said. ""When you have complicated technology, you really do have to worry about election fraud.""So what's the solution? Ms. Simons and Mr. Rivest both seemed certain that the best alternative was to stick with a technology that's a couple of thousand years old. ""Paper,"" they both said, as if reading from the same script. ""Paper ballots.""Voting by mail, which some cite as an option, lets people avoid the lines, but it is not so easy on the vote counters. In states where this is allowed, envelopes have to be opened and ballots sorted into precincts. Then the signature needs to be matched with that on the voter registration card. None of this is terribly efficient.So in 10, 20 or 100 years, when our cars have been replaced with self-flying spaceships, robots take our children to school, and our smartphones are chips in our heads, will we still be using a pen and paper to choose our president? I sure hope not.After Hurricane Sandy disabled power and transportation for many in New Jersey, the state announced that some people would be allowed to vote by e-mail. The entire operation was pulled together in three days. Although there were problems, the system worked for most.Digital voting could drive more Americans to the polls. According to a report released by the Census Bureau this year, nearly 50 million Americans didn't vote in the 2008 election. Millions of people said this was because they were out of town, had transportation problems or were too busy to get to the polls. Internet voting could let millions more people take part.There are, as the security experts point out, a litany of issues to confront before this happens, but it's not impossible.Alexander Keyssar, a professor of history and social policy at Harvard and author of the book ""The Right to Vote,"" added one more issue to the list: voter coercion, in which your boss or someone else bullies you into picking a candidate, perhaps right in front of them. But Mr. Keyssar said people might eventually have the option to vote via the Web.""I think it's something that the government should be looking to develop as a down-the-road option,"" he said, adding that in Brazil, one branch of a government group called the Federal Election Tribunal has the task of exploring digital voting technologies. ""We could have a similar tribunal here,"" he said.In his acceptance speech, President Obama acknowledged the problems of those who had to wait in long lines to vote, saying, ""By the way, we have to fix that.""There are more than twice as many mobile phones in the United States as there are people who voted during this last election. As one option to ""fix that,"" I'd vote for an app that allows me to cast my ballot from the privacy of my own home, rather than waiting in line to mark a piece of paper with a pen.

The Frightening Things You Hear at a Black Hat Conference,"Jacob Kepler/Bloomberg NewsHere is a look at some of the highlights and scarier happenings taking place at the annual Black Hat hacker conference in Las Vegas this week.WILL THE AUTHOR OF FLAME PLEASE STAND UP? Every year the Black Hat conference recognizes the security industry's biggest achievements and failures with the Pwnie Awards, which is sort of like the Oscars of hacking.There is an award for the year's most ""Epic Fail,"" ""Most Innovative Research,"" ""Epic Ownage"" and even ""Best Song."" It turns out there is a long tradition of hacker-written songs and raps, like ""Give It Some Salt, "" a nominated song that explains LinkedIn's password breach, in rap form. LinkedIn was also nominated for the ""Epic Fail"" award (""What has 2500 employees, over 90 million users, no C.S.O., and hates salt? This company."")But that honor ultimately went to F5 Networks, a security company, for a glitch in a popular security product. Typically, the winner of that Pwnie never shows up. But this year, an F5 employee walked to the podium, accepted the award, and even offered a few words of thanks. The final award for ""Epic Ownage"" went to the authors of Flame, the virus that spied on computers in Iran, which many believe to have been the work of the United States government. ""Is the author of Flame in the audience?"" Dino dai Zovi, a Pwnie judge, inquired. Nobody stood up.YOUR HOTEL ROOM IS NOT SAFE. NEITHER IS YOUR AIRPLANE. Every year at Black Hat, hackers disclose vulnerabilities they have discovered in widely used systems like batteries and Wi-Fi networks. This year, the vulnerabilities were a little scarier than most.In one talk, Cody Brocius, a security researcher, disclosed a loophole in hotel room locks made by Onity, whose locks are installed on more than four million hotel rooms globally. Mr. Brocius published his findings online, making it possible for just about any determined hacker to find his or her way into your hotel room.Even scarier: soon, it will be possible to spy on and mimic air traffic controllers. In a presentation on Wednesday, Andrei Costin, a graduate student at Eurecom, the French security institute, shared a number of loopholes in the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast system, which the government plans to swap with our current air traffic control system by 2020. Mr. Costin found that the new system's communications are not well encrypted - which makes eavesdropping  easy - and that it lacks the authentication necessary to keep someone from masquerading as an air traffic controller guiding your aircraft to landing.SOMEONE WON $200,000.Last year at Black Hat, Microsoft announced a new Blue Hat Prize for the person who could develop the best defensive technology for Windows. The goal, Microsoft said, was to encourage hackers to work on something larger than tracking down a one-off vulnerability. On Thursday night, Microsoft awarded its $200,000 prize to Vasilis Pappas, a Columbia University graduate student, for a defensive technology he developed, called ""kBouncer,"" which detects and prevents return-oriented programming attacks, a popular attack technique. Mr. Pappas, who was greeted with about 100 pounds of confetti, looked as if he might collapse from elation.ONLINE CENSORSHIP IS GETTING WORSE. ""The Internet is becoming less and less flat everyday,"" Dan Kaminsky said in a talk Wednesday. Mr. Kaminskyvaulted to fame in 2008 after he uncovered a dangerous flaw in the basic plumbing of the Internet. His next project: ridding the Internet of censorship. ""I.S.P.'s and governments are altering content on the Internet every day and, in most cases, it's done silently,"" he said. Mr. Kaminsky said he had been working with anticensorship groups to improve censorship detection by crowdsourcing it to a much larger pool of developers. ""My goal is not to run a censorship detection service but to provide what's already out there by funneling in a much larger data stream and doing it on a much larger scale.""THE THREAT WON'T BE UNDERSTOOD UNTIL A CYBERDISASTER. This year's Black Hat keynote speech was delivered by Shawn Henry, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's recently retired top cybercop. It was bleak. The attacks we know of are only ""the tip of the iceberg"" Mr. Henry said. He said the public won't comprehend the repercussions of a cyberattack until it affects something more tangible like their gas line or water supply. ""We knew about Osama bin Laden in the early '90s. After 9/11, it was a worldwide name,"" Mr. Henry said. ""I believe that type of thing can and will happen in the cyberenvironment. And I think after it does, people will start to pay attention.""HACKERS PARTY HARD. In the last 12 months, companies as diverse as Symantec, the security juggernaut, and LinkedIn, the social network, got hacked. And yet, you wouldn't know it by the scantily clad dancers and elaborate alcohol ice luges at Black Hat parties. At one party at Pure, the nightclub in Caesar's Palace, hackers and ""security suits"" mingled and posed for photos with dancers dressed in little more than a thin layer of mud. At another party at the Cosmopolitan's Marquee nightclub, hackers, security researchers and executives drank from a giant ice luge emblazoned with the word ""Microsoft."" One attendee bemoaned the self-congratulatory atmosphere: ""It's pathetic that we're celebrating an industry that is completely ineffective."" Said another: ""What are we supposed to do? Come to Vegas and sit alone, sober and depressed, in our hotel rooms?""""IT'S WORSE THAN MEXICO."" Behind the booze, dancing, prizes and women, there was a palpable despair. The consensus among security researchers, White Hat hackers, government types and executives alike is that the cyberthreats we face are only getting bigger and more pernicious. Some compared the situation to Mexico's drug war, with intrusions growing more brazen and no real headway being made to combat them.On Wednesday, Mario Vuksan, a security researcher, presented a new open source project to rally the townspeople. He said his File Disinfection Framework aims to create a platform for idealistic-minded hackers to help organizations and internet service providers clean up their systems after an attack. ""No single person or security company - I don't care how good you are - can clean up everything,"" Mr. Vuksan said over a beer the day after his presentation. ""And unless you completely disinfect a system, it will come back.""That was certainly the case in December after the F.B.I. helped the United States Chamber of Commerce clean up a monthslong cyberattack. Even after the chamber fixed its systems, a printer in one of its offices randomly started printing Chinese characters, and the group discovered that a thermometer in a chamber-owned apartment was communicating with an I.P. address in China. The goal of the File Disinfection Framework is to replicate the workings of the Black Hat hacker community, where hackers regularly put encrypted data - like six million LinkedIn passwords - online for others to crack.Only, to do it for good. ""We have far less people on our side,"" Mr. Vuksan said. ""But what other choice do we have? Do nothing?"" "
F.B.I. Director Warns Congress About Terrorist Hacking,"WASHINGTON -- A day after the authorities arrested several hackers from the Anonymous movement, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert S. Mueller III, warned members of Congress that terrorist groups might use hackers to attack the United States. ''Terrorists have shown interest in pursuing hacking skills,'' Mr. Mueller said Wednesday in written testimony to a House appropriations subcommittee reviewing the bureau's budget. ''And they may seek to train their own recruits or hire outsiders, with an eye toward pursuing cyberattacks. These adaptations of the terrorist threat make the F.B.I.'s counterterrorism mission that much more difficult and challenging.''Mr. Mueller said that the federal government must act swiftly to prevent such attacks and economic espionage from other countries because they pose a ''potentially devastating'' threat to the country's businesses and infrastructure.''We tend to focus on protecting our databases, protecting our infrastructure, which is absolutely an appropriate focus,'' he said. ''But we should not forget that you want to identify these individuals who are responsible for these crimes, investigate them, prosecute them and put them in jail for a substantial period of time.''Mr. Mueller has been particularly vocal over the past week about the issue of hacking and cybersecurity. Last Thursday at the RSA computer security conference in San Francisco, Mr. Mueller said that a terrorist had proclaimed in a recruiting video ''that cyberwarfare will be the warfare of the future.''Anonymous embarrassed the F.B.I. in February when it posted a 16-minute recording of a conference between the bureau and law enforcement officials in Europe about their joint investigation into the hackers. The group has supported the whistle-blower site WikiLeaks and has claimed responsibility for hacking the Web site of a law firm that represented a Marine accused of killing unarmed civilians in Haditha, Iraq, in 2005.On Tuesday, federal prosecutors in New York revealed that a leading hacker known as Sabu had been cooperating with the federal authorities, helping them to arrest several ''hactivists'' for Anonymous in the United States and Europe. Sabu was identified in court papers as Hector Xavier Monsegur, a 28-year-old who operated from a sixth-floor apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.Mr. Monsegur pleaded guilty in August to dozens of hacking charges. On Tuesday, charges against five others, including a man in Chicago and others in Britain and Ireland, were unsealed by the prosecutors in New York. "
Deterring Cyberthreats,"To the Editor:Those who watch the cybersecurity landscape closely will commend your Sept. 10 editorial ''A New Kind of Warfare'' for drawing attention to the precarious state into which cyberthreats might plunge two nations. While the article correctly identified that the focus of cybersecurity is now as much on offense as defense, it did not adequately explain why this change of focus is so important. Parallels with the nuclear arms race will help. Weaponry of phenomenal power is threatening lives on a mass scale and finds no match in terms of defenses. The only deterrent is the prospect of mutually assured damage on a catastrophic level.Governments are realizing that seemingly solid cybersecurity defenses are one step behind offensive developments. This explains why the United States, Israel, Britain and Germany have recently made small and subtle shows of cybercapabilities to act as a deterrent. They are informing would-be attackers that they have the capability to issue frightening reprisals.Cyberwarfare is not to be entered into lightly, and governments need to be more open about their capabilities. Disclosure is imperative to prevent attacks that may cost lives and potentially snowball into major global conflicts.JARNO LIMNELL Helsinki, Finland, Sept. 11, 2012The writer is director of cybersecurity at Stonesoft, a provider of network security systems. "
Even Big Companies Cannot Protect Their Data,"9:02 p.m. | Updated Barbara Scott just hit the trifecta of computer security breaches.Since the New Year, Ms. Scott has been a victim of three separate cyberattacks. Two weeks ago, the online auction site eBay said in an e-mail to her that there had been suspicious activity on her account. On Monday, she received an e-mail from Zappos and another from 6PM, two online shoe retailers owned by Amazon. Both messages alerted her that - once again - her information had been compromised.""It's disturbing,"" said Ms. Scott, who works in San Diego as a director at Redemtech, a technology services business. ""Companies have to do a better job protecting our privacy. You would think companies like eBay and Amazon have the financial backing and wherewithal to take the proper security measures.""The breaches at Zappos and 6PM may have compromised account information for 24 million customers - the largest breach of an online retailer since a series of cyberattacks against Sony last year that compromised 100 million customer accounts. The attacks point to an unsettling new world in which even the supposed stalwarts of the Internet - Amazon, eBay and even the security giants paid to keep hackers at bay - cannot seem to keep personal information safe.And when there is a security breach, the companies and computer security experts more often than not resort to telling their consumers that it is up to them to protect their data stored on the company's servers.Zappos's chief executive, Tony Hsieh, said Sunday that customer names, encrypted passwords, phone numbers, e-mail and mailing addresses and the last four digits of their credit card numbers might have been stolen in the attack. But he noted that the company quickly reset all passwords and that a separate database containing critical credit card information had not been breached.Mr. Hsieh- who wrote the book ""Delivering Happiness"" and regularly invites customers to tour Zappos' facilities - provided no explanation about why the data was vulnerable. He directed customers to an e-mail address because its customer service lines ""simply aren't capable"" of handling the number of expected customer inquiries.That response angered Eric Seftel, a Zappos customer, who posted a reply to Zappos' e-mail alert on The New York Times's Bits blog: ""That's it? That's how you respond to a security exposure that may require me to change my password on a large number of other sites to protect myself? That's how little you think of your customers, just drop this glib little note and wash your hands of the whole affair? You have a legal and moral obligation to protect my information.""In an e-mail to The New York Times on Monday, Mr. Hsieh said the company did have a security breach response plan in place before the attack but could not discuss the specifics or about how it was breached. ""Our plan specifically includes not disclosing details of our security processes or procedures,"" Mr. Hsieh said. ""Just like you would not expect a casino to disclose when the security guards change shifts.""The breaches at Amazon's sites, combined with several recent cyberattacks, could threaten to shake consumer confidence online. Over the year-end holidays, hackers who said they were members of the group Anonymous attacked the Web site of Strategic Forecasting, a research firm that specializes in security and intelligence. They dumped personal and payment details for thousands of subscribers.In a separate attack on India's military and intelligence servers two weeks ago, a different group of hackers managed to find and post a segment of source code belonging to Symantec, the largest security software company.""There are a lot of people that are going to seriously reconsider before they purchase anything else on the Internet,"" Jerry Irvine, a member of the National Cyber Security Task Force, said in an interview on Monday.The White House is working on a plan to increase consumers' confidence in the security of e-commerce sites. Its initiative, called the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, works with major vendors - like banks, technology companies and cellphone service providers - to adopt higher standards for the way companies verify user identities and store personal data online.But the program is less than a year old and, Mr. Irvine says, intended to be only one step in a larger process to protect customers' identities and personal information on the Web. ""These breaches are going to be an education for people to take a more layered approach to their security,"" he said.With companies unable to provide a good solution, many companies and security experts throw the burden back to consumers.""It is always a good practice to use different passwords on different Web sites,"" Mr. Hsieh advised. Mr. Irvine recommends that consumers protect their personal data more vigilantly. He suggests not using e-mail addresses as user names, creating a unique password for every Web site and refraining from saving personal and payment details online.""That is the only way you're going to be secure,"" Mr. Irvine said.Ms. Scott said she already used complex alphanumeric passwords and updated them on a regular basis. ""Beyond that, I guess I have to be more conscious about who I choose to do business with online,"" she said. ""How hard can it be to find a safe place online to buy shoes?"" "
Hackers Threaten to Post Source Code for Symantec Product,"Hackers have posted a file online that they claim is a confidential glimpse into Symantec's Norton Antivirus program and have threatened to release source code for the security giant's flagship antivirus product.The hacker group, which calls itself the Lords of Dharmaraja, posted a file on Pastebin that it said described the confidential workings of Symantec's Norton Antivirus threat-detection product. The documentation, and any source code, could be exploited by hackers to corrupt the antivirus program or write malicious code that circumvents Norton's product altogether. The original post is no longer on Pastebin, although there is a Google cache.The hackers claim to have discovered Symantec's source code in a hack they conducted on India's military and intelligence servers. In their online post, the hackers said, ""We have discovered within the Indian Spy Program source codes of a dozen software companies,"" which the hackers said had signed agreements with an Indian defense program and India's Central Bureau of Investigation.In an e-mail, a Symantec spokesman, Cris Paden, said the hackers' post was an outdated document from 1999 that ""explains how the software is designed to work (what inputs are accepted and what outputs are generated) and contains function names, but there is no actual source code present.""The hacker group threatened to release the actual source code for the Norton AntiVirus software later on. ""We are working out mirrors as of now,"" the hackers wrote in their post.Mr. Paden said Symantec was ""currently investigating that.""Symantec's Norton brand antivirus products make up the bulk of its sales to consumers, which totaled nearly $2 billion last year - a third of Symantec's revenue. If any part of its source code was exploited or tampered with, it could hurt Symantec's share price and bottom line.""If this document is from 1999, chances are the source code has changed a fair bit,"" said Robert Rachwald, director of security strategy at Imperva, an Internet security company. ""But if Symantec hasn't done any major overhauls, there may be some parts of the code that remain intact,"" he said, and someone could find a way to poke holes in it. "
Apple Stops Password Resets Over the Phone,"Apple on Wednesday said that  it had temporarily disabled the ability for customers to reset their AppleID passwords by contacting customer service over the phone, after a hacker used this technique to break in to a technology journalist's account over the weekend.The company said that for the time being, customers can do password resets on a Web site instead.""We've temporarily suspended the ability to reset AppleID passwords over the phone,"" said Natalie Kerris, an Apple spokeswoman, in a statement. ""We're asking customers who need to reset their password to continue to use our online iForgot system (iforgot.apple.com). This system can reset a password in one of two ways - either have a password reset sent to an alternate e-mail address already on record or challenge the customer to answer security questions they had previously set up. When we resume over the phone password resets, customers will be required to provide even stronger identify verification to reset their password.""This move comes after Mat Honan, a technology writer at Wired, reported that a hacker broke into his Apple iCloud account by calling Apple's tech support and providing the last four digits of his credit card, which they obtained by breaking into his account at Amazon.com. An earlier version of this post incorrectly described the way that the hackers obtained the last four digits of Mr. Honan's credit card number. They broke into his Amazon.com account; Amazon does not make that information public. "
Widespread Virus Proves Macs Are No Longer Safe From Hackers,"9:22 a.m. | Updated with site that has simpler instructions for identifying virus. For years, Mac users have been told that not only are they cooler than their PC counterparts, they are safer too. Apple has always held that computer viruses and malware dogged only its competitors. That is no longer the case.This week, security researchers discovered that a new computer virus had infected half a million Macs - about half of them in the United States. The virus is infesting the computers in the most surreptitious way possible: users need not manually click on any malicious links or manually download any malware to get infected. The program simply downloads itself. Once downloaded, the malware's creators gain a back door that gives them unauthorized access to the victim's computer. ""This is the largest scale attack on Mac OS X to date,"" said Roel Schouwenberg, a senior researcher at Kaspersky Lab, an antivirus software company, who has analyzed the malware. ""And much more sophisticated.""For now, the malware's creators appear to be using infested computers for click fraud, in which they manipulate clicks on a Web advertisement in exchange for kickbacks. But as with all malware, its creators can choose to use infected computers however they like. The malware infects computers in one of two ways. In some cases, users receive a pop-up prompt purporting to be from Adobe Flash asking them to install an update and type in their password - hence the Trojan's name, Fakeflash or Flashback. But in most cases, attackers appear to have exploited a loophole in Java software that automatically downloads the malware onto victims' machines without any prompting.Apple issued two security patches for Fakeflash this week and encouraged Mac users to run their software updates as soon as possible. For the technically astute, F-Secure, a Helsinki, Finland-based security firm,published instructions for how to identify Fakeflash and remove the virus manually. Doctor Web, the Russian security firm that first discovered the virus, has created a simple online tool that allows users to check if their Mac has been infected. Several security experts have criticized Apple as slow to react, considering that Oracle issued a fix to the Java security hole in February. Apple did not issue a fix until more than a month later. Doctor Web discovered that the virus was exploiting the loophole to infect Mac computers this week. Kaspersky Labs reverse-engineered the malware and began to intercept its communication on Wednesday. So far, it found 620,000 infected computers; about 301,000, are in the United States. An additional 95,000 computers are in Canada, with 47,000 in Great Britain and 42,000 in Australia.  Almost all - 98 percent - ran Mac's OS X operating system. This is hardly the first time Mac users have been hit by a Windows-style computer virus. Last year, security researchers discovered that a piece of malware, called Mac Defender, had targeted Apple machines. Intego, a security firm, discovered Mac Defender on May 2, 2011. It took Apple until May 31, 2011, to issue a fix.Security experts said Fakeflash was far more widespread and sophisticated than Mac Defender. Several cautioned that it might signal a new era in which Mac users become the new target for Windows-style malware attacks. Apple's growing share of the PC market simply makes it too juicy a target. ""Last year's attacks were a turning point - criminals realized they could make money targeting Apple users,"" said Mr. Schouwenberg. ""As Apple gains more market share, it will also see more attacks.""Adam J. O'Donnell, a security architect at Sourcefire, a computer security firm, wrote a report in 2008 predicting that digital criminals would start targeting Mac users with Windows-style malware attacks once Apple's share of the PC market reached 16 percent, assuming that Windows' antivirus solutions were at least 80 percent effective. He was not far off. Apple currently holds 12 percent of the PC market in the United States, according to Gartner, a research company, and antivirus software has reached 95 percent effectiveness, according to AV Comparatives, a nonprofit that audits antivirus software.  ""The problem is that the security industry has much less visibility into Mac OS X than Windows,"" said Mr. Schouwenberg. ""Mac users have been led to believe they're safe and turned off their paranoia filter. There is a lot of easy prey out there.""    "
Apple Tweaks Its 'We're Safe' Message and Antivirus Makers Take Notice,"It was a subtle tweak, but it didn't go unnoticed by antivirus software makers for long.In big bold letters on its Web site, Apple had bragged for years that its Mac computer ""Doesn't get PC viruses."" Then, two weeks ago, the company tweaked that wording to read simply: ""Built to be safe.""The modification was immediately called out by antivirus companies who said the language tweak was an official admission by Apple that its computers were no longer safe from the kind of hacker attacks common to PCs running Microsoft Windows.""I view the changes in the messages pushed out by their marketing department as some important baby-steps,"" Graham Cluley, a security expert at Sophos, wrote in a blog post. ""Let's hope more Apple Mac owners are also learning to take important security steps -- such as installing antivirus protection.""Apple has always marketed its computers as sleeker, more stylish and more secure than its Windows counterparts. But its security claims were partly discredited last April after security experts discovereda new piece of malware, called Flashback, had infected more than half a million Apple computers in the largest-scale attack on Apple's Mac OS X operating system to date.The malware, which infected Apple computers through a hole in Java software, had been infecting computers through especially nefarious means. Unlike most malware-which typically spreads when a user clicks on a malicious link or downloads a malicious attachment-Flashback simply downloaded itself without prompting.Apple released two security patches for the vulnerability and encouraged Mac users to run their software updates. That helped bring down the number of infected machinesfrom 600,000 to 140,000 within two weeks.  But it was not long before researchers discovered that a new variant of Flashback, called Flashback.s, was continuing to infect Mac users through the same vulnerability.Flashback was not the first time Macs had been targeted. In 2011, security experts discovered that a piece of malware, called Mac Defender, masquerading as anti-virus software was infecting Macs.Antivirus companies were quick to say the attacks heralded a new era in which Mac users were no longer safe. Windows computers have always been cyber criminals' preferred target simply because there have always been more of them. But as Apple expands its share of the PC market-it currently holds 12 percent of the PC market in the United States, up from a fraction of that only a few years ago-antivirus companies claim hackers are turning their attention to Mac users. Bigger market share means a bigger pool of targets making it worth the criminals' time to build the malware.Some security researchers have criticized those warnings as premature and say they are simply the latest case of antivirus companies hyping a threat to sell more antivirus software.""Two issues in two years is relatively minor compared with what happens in the Windows world,"" said Rich Mogull, the founder of Securosis, a security research company. ""Antivirus companies, in particular, can be pretty deceptive. They have been marketing Apple's immunity far more than Apple has and they are far more vulnerable. I no longer put stock in it."" "
Microsoft Raids Tackle Net Crime,"SEATTLE -- Microsoft employees, accompanied by United States marshals, raided two nondescript office buildings in Pennsylvania and Illinois on Friday, aiming to disrupt one of the most pernicious forms of online crime today -- botnets, or groups of computers that help harvest bank account passwords and other personal information from millions of other computers.With a warrant in hand from a federal judge authorizing the sweep, the Microsoft lawyers and technical personnel gathered evidence and deactivated Web servers ostensibly used by criminals in a scheme to infect computers and steal personal data. At the same time, Microsoft seized control of hundreds of Web addresses that it says were used as part of the same scheme.The sweep was part of a civil suit brought by Microsoft in its increasingly aggressive campaign to take the lead in combating such crimes, rather than waiting for law enforcement agencies to act. The company's targets were equipment used to control the botnets, which criminals, known as bot-herders, use for ill intent. Microsoft has a big interest in making the Internet a safer place. Despite inroads made by Apple and others in some parts of the technology business, Microsoft's Windows operating system still runs the vast majority of the computers connected to the Internet. The prevalence of its software has made Windows the most appealing target for online criminals, and the security holes they discover in the software are a persistent nuisance for Windows users.Microsoft's involvement in what had been considered largely a law enforcement function -- fighting computer crime -- is the brainchild of Richard Boscovich, a former federal prosecutor who is a senior lawyer in Microsoft's digital crimes unit. That group watches over fraud that could affect the company's products and reputation.Mr. Boscovich, who handled drug, computer and financial crime cases in Miami in his former job, devised a novel legal strategy to underpin the growing number of Microsoft's civil suits against bot-herders. Among other things, he argued that the culprits behind botnets were violating Microsoft's trademarks through fake e-mails they used to spread their malicious software.Mr. Boscovich said the Friday sweep was meant to send a message to the criminals behind the scheme, whose identities are unknown. ''We're letting them know we're looking at them,'' said Mr. Boscovich after participating in the Pennsylvania raid, in Scranton.Before Friday's sweep, Microsoft attacked three botnets in the last couple of years through civil suits. In each case, Microsoft obtained court orders that permitted it to seize Web addresses and computers associated with the botnets without first notifying the owners of the property. The secrecy was necessary, Microsoft argued, to prevent criminals from re-establishing new communications links to their infected computers.Some security experts said Microsoft's tactics had been effective, even if they had not eradicated the scourge of botnets.''Taking the disruption into the courthouse was a brilliant idea and is helping the rest of the industry to reconsider what actions are possible, and that action is needed and can succeed,'' said Richard Perlotto, director at the Shadowserver Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks data about tools used for online fraud and forms of computer crime.Mr. Perlotto and Microsoft said they did not see civil legal action against people who commit online crime as a replacement for law enforcement action, which can result in much stiffer criminal penalties. ''We equate this to a neighborhood watch,'' Mr. Boscovich said.Jose Nazario, a senior security researcher at Arbor Networks, an Internet security firm, said that Microsoft's record against botnets had been a ''mixed bag'' and that some of its gains were only temporary. After an earlier action against a botnet known as Waledac, for example, the software behind it was modified slightly to create a new botnet.''You can take out a botnet, but unless you take down the coders and put the clients behind bars, they're just going to go ahead and do this again,'' Mr. Nazario said.The computers that make up a botnet are usually conscripted without the knowledge of their owners, who unwittingly infect their machines after clicking on links in legitimate-looking e-mails for things like security updates from Microsoft and notices of tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service. Clicking those links takes users to Web sites that exploit security holes in their browsers or other programs on their computers.Criminals use the holes to install malicious programs that siphon personal information from the infected computers, like online bank account passwords and credit card numbers. They can also harness the infected machines to send millions of e-mail messages to other users on the Internet, including scam messages that help propagate the botnet. Sometimes botnets are rented to clients to send spam messages advertising products like counterfeit pharmaceuticals.On Friday, Microsoft was attacking its most complex target yet, known as the Zeus botnets. The creators of Zeus offer their botnet code for sale to others and, depending on the level of customer support and customization of the code that clients require, charge them $700 to $15,000 for the software, Microsoft said in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Brooklyn on March 19.That, in turn, has resulted in many variants of Zeus botnets, making them harder to combat. Most of them are aimed at perpetrating various financial scams against online victims. Mr. Boscovich of Microsoft said he had a ''high degree of confidence'' that the unnamed culprits behind Zeus were in Eastern Europe.To carry out the scams, they have hired people known as money mules to travel to different countries, including the United States, to set up bank accounts so they can receive transfers of stolen money from victims' accounts, Microsoft said in its complaint. Microsoft said that the Zeus botnets had enabled the theft of more than $100 million from victims since 2007 and that 13 million computers were infected with some form of software associated with it.Because of the financial fraud involved, Microsoft rallied support from two financial industry associations -- the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the National Automated Clearing House Association -- both of which filed court declarations endorsing Microsoft's sweep on Friday.Microsoft does not believe the operators of the facilities it raided on Friday, which rent space to clients on computers connected to the Internet, are in league with the people behind the botnets. And those operators said they had no idea that equipment inside their facilities was being used to issue commands to Zeus.''It's very difficult, unless they draw attention to themselves, to pick up on it,'' said Joe Marr, chief technology officer of BurstNet Technologies, the facility in Scranton that Microsoft entered Friday.Mr. Boscovich said he did not think the Friday sweep would be as big a blow to Zeus as Microsoft's previous actions against botnets, but he said it was just the beginning of actions aimed at raising the cost of doing business for the botnet's masterminds. ''The plan is to disrupt, disrupt, disrupt,'' he said. "
Israel Gets the Blame for Flame Virus,"LONDON - No prize for guessing who is getting the blame - or should that be the credit - for creating a new spyware super bug reported to have infected computers throughout the Middle East.""Nice one Israel. Proud of you!"" a reader posted on the Haaretz newspaper's Web site under a report about the ""most sophisticated cyber-weapon yet unleashed"" attacking computers in Iran, the West Bank, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.The new virus, called Flame, was identified on Monday by Kaspersky Labs, a security research firm in Moscow. Worm.Win32.Flame aka #TheFlame is professionally designed to carry out cyber espionage. Learn more: ow.ly/bckKA#malware- Kaspersky Lab (@kaspersky) May 28, 2012As Nicole Perlroth writes over at the Bits blog: ""If the report's findings prove to be true, Flame would be the third major Internet weapon to have been discovered since 2010.""An earlier virus, Stuxnet, was used to destroy centrifuges at an Iranian nuclear facility in 2010. The unidentified programmers behind Stuxnet were also credited with devising the Duqu virus, used for reconnaissance. Moshe Ya'alon, Israel's vice premier, fuelled speculation of Israeli involvement on Tuesday when he told Army Radio: ""Whoever sees the Iranian threat as a serious threat would be likely to take different steps, including these, in order to hurt them.""Israel is a country blessed with superior technology, he said, adding: ""These achievements of ours open up all kinds of possibilities for us.""Iran appeared to be the principal target of the new computer worm, described by Alexander Gostev, Kaspersky's head of research, as so big and sophisticated that it redefined the notion of cyberwar and cyberespionage.Nicole quotes researchers who said the complexity of the super bug, and the geography of its targets, suggested it was the work of a government.The earlier Stuxnet worm is credited with having slowed down Iran's nuclear program, which Israel, the United States and other states believe is geared towards producing a nuclear bomb.Intelligence and military experts have said the effectiveness of Stuxnet was tested at the Dimona nuclear complex in Israel in a joint U.S.-Israeli effort to undermine the Iranian program.Kaspersky, which discovered the Flame virus during research on behalf of the International Telecommunication Union, said it had so far found no similarities with Stuxnet and Duqu. However, ""the Flame malware looks to be another phase in this war,"" said Eugene Kaspersky, the research lab's chief executive.The International Telecommunication Union is the United Nations agency for information and communications technology. It was acting on reports that computers at Iran's oil ministry and its national oil company had been hit with malware that was stealing and deleting information from their systems. As with Stuxnet and Duqu, no government is likely to put its hand up. But some experts are already convinced about where responsibility lies.""The country that brought us Iranian nuclear assassinations, explosions at Iran missile bases, and Stuxnet, is at it again,"" wrote Richard Silverstein on Israel's liberal Tikun Olam Web site under the headline: ""Israel's new contribution to Middle East cyberwar.""""The goal is apparently to infiltrate the computers of individuals in Iran, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere who are engaged in activities that interest Israel's secret police, including military intelligence,"" Mr. Silverstein said, suggesting Israeli intelligence might even be using the worm to spy on its own citizens.

Hackers Interrupt Service at the C.I.A.'S. Web Site,"Hackers claimed responsibility for knocking the Web site of the Central Intelligence Agency offline on Friday, under the banner of the hacking collective Anonymous. By late Friday afternoon, the site was still unavailable. On Twitter, an account affiliated with Anonymous said it was responsible for the attack, which appeared to be one that involved bombarding the site with traffic until it ground to a halt, rather than an intrusion into the agency's computer systems.Anonymous has been conducting a broad campaign against federal agencies. The group intercepted a conference call between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Scotland Yard and released a 16-minute recording of the call last Friday. Hours after that attack, the hackers took down the Web site and stole the e-mail of the law firm that had represented Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich, the soldier accused of killing 24 unarmed civilians in Haditha, Iraq, in 2005.''This is going to happen more and more frequently - they're unstoppable,'' said Jerry Irvine, a member of the National Cyber Security Task Force. ''Why can't they be stopped? Because security technologies have not kept up with the extent of the vulnerabilities that exist.''Hackers affiliated with Anonymous stepped up their hacking campaign in the last month after federal authorities shut down Megaupload, a popular file-sharing site charged with copyright infringement.It was not clear whether Friday's attacks were tied to the Megaupload prosecution or how coordinated Anonymous's attacks are. On Friday, hackers also took down the Web site of the Mexican National Chamber of Mines and claimed to have stolen its e-mail. On the bulletin board Pastebin, the hackers said the attack was in retaliation for Mexican miners' ''extreme'' working conditions.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

U.S. Study Cites Worries on Readiness for Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON -- A study commissioned by President Obama to assess the nation's ability to respond to terrorist attacks and man-made and natural disasters has found that state and local officials have the most confidence in their public health and medical services but are the most concerned about whether agencies can respond to cyberattacks.The report, conducted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that state and local officials also felt unprepared to provide adequate housing in their communities after a disaster. Called the National Preparedness Report, the assessment is the first of its kind released by the federal agency and was intended to serve as a baseline for preparedness.In March 2011, Mr. Obama signed a directive ordering the federal government to release an annual report on the nation's response capacities, which have received intense scrutiny since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and Hurricane Katrina.The report said that the nation had a highly responsive health care system, in part because a significant majority of hospitals have the staff, training and capacity to deal with epidemics and other medical emergencies. All but three states said they had ''sufficient staffing capacity to work five 12-hour days for six to eight weeks'' in response to an epidemic.It also praised the coordination among federal, state and local officials for sharing information and intelligence, and the ability of the authorities to deploy lifesaving and life-sustaining operations quickly.But it was the report's findings about cybersecurity that appeared to be the most troubling, and they continued a drumbeat from the Obama administration about the need for Congress to pass legislation giving the Department of Homeland Security the authority to regulate computer security for the country's infrastructure.The report said that cybersecurity ''was the single core capability where states had made the least amount of overall progress'' and that only 42 percent of state and local officials believed that theirs was adequate.Although a little more than 80 percent of officials said they had adopted measures to address the issue, 45 percent said they did not have a formal program to prevent and respond to attacks.The report said that roughly two-thirds of those officials reported that they had not updated their ''information security or disaster recovery plans in at least two years.''The report did cite the Secret Service, which has been battered recently by a prostitution scandal, for ''dismantling some of the largest known cybercriminal organizations.'' The Secret Service, the report said, has dismantled the organizations using 31 task forces, including ones in Rome and London.The preparedness report said that a little less than two-thirds of the companies in the United States had sustained cyberattacks and that ''only 50 percent of owners and operators at high-priority facilities'' like electrical grids said that they reported such attacks.Since 2006, there has been a 650 percent increase in the number of reported cyberattacks in the United States, rising to 41,776 in 2010 from 5,503 in 2006, according to the report.The Obama administration is pushing a bipartisan bill in the Senate that would allow the Department of Homeland Security to issue regulations to protect ''critical infrastructure'' like power grids.Although the Senate has not voted on the bill, the House passed a bill last week that encourages intelligence agencies and businesses to share information about threats to computer systems -- something the Obama administration opposes because of civil liberties concerns.

Asleep at the Laptop,"Preet Bharara is the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.THE alarm bells sound regularly: cybergeddon; the next Pearl Harbor; one of the greatest existential threats facing the United States. With increasing frequency, these are the grave terms officials invoke about the menace of cybercrime -- and they're not understating the threat.Some cybercrime is aimed directly at our national security, imperiling our infrastructure, government secrets and public safety. But as the recent wave of attacks by the hacker collective Anonymous demonstrates, it also targets private industry, threatening the security of our markets, our exchanges, our bank accounts, our trade secrets and our personal privacy. With all the attention paid to the so-called fiscal cliff approaching at year's end, it is equally important to ask whether collective inaction has us simultaneously barreling toward a cybercliff of equal or greater height.As the United States attorney in Manhattan, I have come to worry about few things as much as the gathering cyberthreat. Law enforcement is racing to respond, filling its ranks and fortifying its defenses against cyber-malefactors. Businesses should worry, too. But my experience suggests that they are not doing nearly enough to protect themselves, their customers and their shareholders.Recently I met two executives from major companies who did not even know whom in law enforcement to contact in the event of a hack or intrusion. A few weeks ago, after a speech I gave about cybercrime, a board member of a significant Internet-based company took me aside and admitted, with some horror, that his company's board had not spent a single minute discussing cybersecurity.These troubling admissions reveal critically outdated thinking in the business community. But there is recourse, and the cliff can still be avoided.For one thing, large and small corporations alike must adopt a culture of disclosure. A bank would never think to delay reporting to the police a conventional robbery by a masked criminal wielding a gun and a note. But that is what institutions are still routinely doing after being compromised by anonymous criminals operating through the Internet.Corporations may wait days or even weeks and months, or never disclose the attacks at all, for fear of exposing proprietary information. But doing so makes it much harder to identify the perpetrator and prevent future economic injury. It also makes it harder to tell who the next victim might be, so that they might assess their own vulnerabilities and formulate solutions.Businesses should be assured that law enforcement will operate with the utmost sensitivity toward victims of cyberattacks. Prosecutors and agents have developed techniques to minimize disruptions to daily operations and to safeguard proprietary information. Where necessary, we can seek judicial orders to protect confidentiality. But to the extent that businesses remain allergic to the idea of promptly reporting cybercrime to law enforcement, they need to get over it.Second, every company needs to do a better job of creating and fostering a culture of security. A recent report by Verizon suggests that a stunning 97 percent of data breaches last year were avoidable. That's because even well-intentioned companies that are already spending large sums of money on high-tech security are overlooking the most fundamental precautions.In a way, they're overthinking the threat. We have a false impression that all hackers are hyper-sophisticated, digital versions of Tom Cruise rappelling down a building, ''Mission Impossible''-style. But the more mundane reality is that companies are most often breached by hackers walking down virtual hallways, looking for a single unlocked door. And the proverbial unlocked door can mean entry into the entire data network.In response, companies must start thinking ahead of the hack and locking their doors. It is simply no longer enough for company leaders to take a hands-off approach, leaving these matters to a few ''techies.'' Such an attitude practically invites a hack. Even simple measures -- like employee training and regular threat assessments -- can help companies avoid becoming the easy target.But the most important step is the most obvious and fundamental one: understanding the threat in a comprehensive, serious manner. Every member of a board or executive suite is duty bound to protect the institution against material risk, whether they currently possess particular expertise or not. And yet, how many companies have a concrete plan in place to deal with a hack? How many conduct independent audits of their cybervulnerabilities? The answer, many in my position fear, is too few.Some say we are outgunned. But in my view, it is less a matter of being outgunned than being simply outdated -- in our thinking and in our vision. Yes, there is an army of computer saboteurs, spies, thieves and nihilists who wish to do us harm. But we have an army, too, or at least the makings of one, which can draw from the best of law enforcement, intelligence, business and academia.I have no doubt that we could find the collective will to amass and mobilize our army once a true catastrophe strikes -- just as we did after Pearl Harbor and Sept. 11, 2001. The question is whether we can do so before that happens. "
New Revisions Weaken Senate Cybersecurity Bill,"WASHINGTON -- Despite warnings of a potentially crippling cyberattack, a group of lawmakers led by Senator John McCain has successfully weakened bipartisan legislation that the Obama administration said was crucial to protecting computer systems responsible for operating the nation's critical infrastructure.Strong opposition from Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, and others on behalf of the business community forced Democratic and Republican supporters of the legislation to drop provisions that would have given the federal government the power to enforce minimum standards on systems that run power plants, air traffic control systems, dams and similar facilities. The Senate will debate the measure next week, even though the changes have raised new questions about its effectiveness.''The key to successfully fighting this threat is not adding more bureaucrats or forcing industries to comply with government red tape,'' Mr. McCain said Friday in a statement that announced that he and seven other Republican senators had introduced their own bill that calls for more information sharing among companies. ''Instead, we must leverage the ingenuity and innovation of the private sector in partnership with the most effective elements of the federal government to address this emerging threat.''Original versions of the bill, which was first drafted in 2009, called for giving the Department of Homeland Security the power to enforce minimum cybersecurity standards on infrastructure computer systems that, if damaged, would lead to mass casualties or economic loss.But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business lobbyists strongly objected, saying that such regulations would create a costly and cumbersome process.The measure now before the Senate makes the minimum standards optional, dealing a significant setback to the administration, which had made legislation to safeguard computer systems a top national security priority this year. In April, the House passed its own version of the cybersecurity bill that encourages businesses and intelligence agencies to share information about attacks and threats to computer systems. Senate backers of the measure say their hope now is to pass the legislation and get into talks with the House. Even more attempts to change the Senate measure are expected.James A. Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a cybersecurity expert, said the revised Senate measure did not provide any new powers to the federal government to protect computer systems of critical infrastructure.''If it is passed, nobody will notice it,'' he said. ''You can do everything in the bill with an executive order.''Dr. Lewis added: ''The same way you wouldn't say that we don't need the F.A.A. because we can rely on incentives and a voluntary approach, we can't rely on incentives and voluntary action for cybersecurity. Every day the risk gets bigger, it is not only countries but politically motivated individuals who can just download this stuff. A lot of us hoped Congress would have done better than this.''Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the independent from Connecticut who sponsored the measure as chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and the committee's ranking member, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said Friday that they were caught off guard by the determined opposition of Mr. McCain, who has for years made national security issues his priority.''He knows that I'm disappointed,'' Mr. Lieberman said, referring to Mr. McCain, one of his closest allies and friends in the Senate. ''His natural side, based on his whole history, is to do the best thing for security and not to be worried about other factors.''Tension between Mr. Lieberman and Mr. McCain bubbled to the surface on Wednesday at a closed-door meeting of senators and staff members about the legislation in the office of Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Congressional aides who attended the meeting and discussed the deliberations on the grounds that they would not be quoted by name.The staff members said Mr. Lieberman openly questioned Mr. McCain about why he was putting the interests of the Chamber of Commerce over national security and asked Mr. McCain what he would say if he blocked the bill and the nation suffered a catastrophic cyberattack.Mr. McCain, the staff members said, became visibly angry and shouted back at Mr. Lieberman, saying that his reputation on national security issues was unquestionable.In a telephone interview, Mr. Lieberman acknowledged that he had had a disagreement with Mr. McCain at the meeting but declined to discuss the specifics.''You'll have the most emotional arguments with the people you are closest to, and we are good friends and neither of us can conceal the fact that we don't agree on this issue,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''We agree on a lot of things, and whenever we disagree, he's wrong.''A spokesman for Mr. McCain did not return messages seeking comment.The White House has worked for much of the year to persuade members of Congress to pass cybersecurity legislation that would require minimum standards for computers at critical infrastructure facilities where a breach would cause significant damage.In March, high-ranking administration officials -- including Janet Napolitano, secretary of the Homeland Security Department; Robert S. Mueller III, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- provided a closed-door demonstration to roughly four dozen senators on what could happen if a cyberattack derailed the New York City electrical grid on a hot summer day. In an effort to underscore the seriousness of the threat, General Dempsey told the senators that he was so concerned about a cyberattack that he had skipped a meeting of the National Security Council on Iran to attend the briefing. The briefings gave new urgency to the legislation, which for years has been the subject of talks among senior lawmakers who include Senators Collins and Lieberman as well as Senator John D. Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the Commerce Committee.Ms. Collins said that while many high-ranking administration officials had been involved in lobbying members of Congress to pass the bill, she was disappointed that President Obama had not been more personally involved in raising awareness.''Other than writing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal and a call to both Joe Lieberman and me a couple of months ago, the president has been largely absent from the debate,'' she said.Ms. Collins said there might have been a different outcome for the bill ''if the president had been more active when we were under assault.''A White House spokeswoman declined to comment. "
Cybersecurity Bill Is Blocked by G.O.P. Filibuster,"WASHINGTON -- A cybersecurity bill that had been one of the Obama administration's top national security priorities was blocked by a Republican filibuster in the Senate on Thursday, severely limiting its prospects this year.The Senate voted 52 to 46 to cut off debate, falling short of the 60 needed to force a final vote on the measure, which had bipartisan support but ran into a fight over what amendments to the legislation could be proposed.Soon after the vote, the White House released a statement calling the outcome ''a profound disappointment.'' ''The politics of obstructionism, driven by special interest groups seeking to avoid accountability, prevented Congress from passing legislation to better protect our nation from potentially catastrophic cyberattacks,'' the statement said.The bill's most vocal opponents were a group of Republican senators led by John McCain of Arizona, who took the side of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and steadfastly opposed the legislation, arguing that it would be too burdensome for corporations.The bill would have established optional standards for the computer systems that oversee the country's critical infrastructure, like power grids, dams and transportation.In the hopes of winning over Mr. McCain and the other Republicans, the bill had been significantly watered down in recent weeks by its sponsors, led by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who made the standards optional. Original versions of the bill said the standards would be mandatory and gave the government the power to enforce them.Mr. Lieberman, the independent from Connecticut who is chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, and the bill's other sponsors, including the committee's ranking member, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, had worked for the past several years to pass cybersecurity legislation.At a meeting last week, Mr. Lieberman got into an argument with Mr. McCain, his closest ally and friend in the Senate, about his opposition to the bill. Mr. Lieberman questioned why Mr. McCain was doing the bidding of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and asked what Mr. McCain would say if the nation was crippled by a cyberattack.Mr. McCain angrily said his reputation on national security issues was unquestionable.The Obama administration had tried to sell members of Congress on the need for the legislation through closed-door briefings from high-ranking national security officials and pleas from officials who had served in President George W. Bush's administration about the looming threat of a catastrophic cyberattack.After the vote, Ms. Collins said it was a ''shameful day'' and expressed disappointment with her fellow senators who lacked ''a sense of urgency'' about a looming cyberattack.''We often hear the from members on both sides of the aisle, but particularly Republican members, that we need to be listening more to generals on the ground,'' Ms. Collins said. ''But listen to the generals who had responsibility in this area'' who told members of Congress ''over and over again'' that the nation was not prepared for a cyberattack.''I cannot think of another area where the threat is greater and we are less prepared,'' she said.The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said that ''no one doubts the need to strengthen our cyberdefenses.''''We all recognize the problem, that's really not the issue here,'' Mr. McConnell said.''It's the matter that the majority leader has tried to steamroll a bill,'' Mr. McConnell said, referring to Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada.Despite threats of a veto from President Obama, the House passed its own cybersecurity bill in April, which called for more information sharing between national security and intelligence agencies and businesses.The bill called for the government to provide businesses with classified information about cyberthreats and gave companies the option of sharing information about cyberthreats with the government. White House officials said the president opposed that bill because it called for too much information sharing between the government and businesses, which could have led to violations of Americans civil liberties.

Anonymous Says It Knocked C.I.A. Site Offline," Hackers claimed responsibility for knocking the Web site of the Central Intelligence Agency offline on Friday, under the banner of the hacking collective Anonymous. By late Friday afternoon, the site was still unavailable.On Twitter, an account affiliated with Anonymous said it was responsible for the attack, which appeared to be one that involved bombarding the site with traffic until it ground to a halt, rather than an intrusion into the agency's computer systems.Anonymous has been conducting a broad campaign against federal agencies. The group  intercepted a conference call between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Scotland Yard and released a 16-minute recording of the call last Friday. Hours after that attack, the hackers took down the Web site and stole the e-mail of the law firm that had represented Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich, the soldier accused of killing 24 unarmed civilians in Haditha, Iraq, in 2005.""This is going to happen more and more frequently - they're unstoppable,"" said Jerry Irvine, a member of the National Cyber Security Task Force. ""Why can't they be stopped? Because security technologies have not kept up with the extent of the vulnerabilities that exist.""Hackers affiliated with Anonymous stepped up their hacking campaign in the last month after federal authorities shut down Megaupload, a popular file-sharing site charged with copyright infringement. It was not clear whether Friday's attacks were tied to the Megaupload prosecution or how coordinated Anonymous's attacks are. On Friday,  hackers also took down the Web site of the Mexican National Chamber of Mines and claimed to have stolen its e-mail. On the  bulletin board Pastebin, the hackers said the attack was in retaliation for Mexican miners' ""extreme"" working conditions. "
Marriott Says It Stopped Ad Service Hidden in Wi-Fi,"Last week, the Courtyard by Marriott hotel in Midtown Manhattan was discovered to come with some hidden extras: The free Wi-Fi connection inserted lines of code for serving special ads into every Web page a guest visited. On Monday, Marriott International said it had investigated the situation and disabled this feature at two New York hotels: the Courtyard by Marriott as well as its sister, the Residence Inn.The company said in an e-mailed statement that it was not aware of the ad-serving practice, and the security of people's data was not at risk. It said it did not approve of this ad-servicing practice:As soon as we learned of the situation, we launched an investigation into the matter. Preliminary findings revealed that, unbeknownst to the hotel, the Internet service provider (ISP) was utilizing functionality that allowed advertising to be pushed to the end user. The ISP has assured the hotel that this functionality has now been disabled.While this is a common marketing practice with many Internet service providers, Marriott does not condone this practice. At no time was data security ever at risk.We will continue to look into this matter and find opportunities to remind our hotels of Marriott's high-speed Internet policies.The matter came to light last week when Justin Watt, a Web engineer with a background in making advertising tools, discovered that every Web page he visited was being rewritten with new code that could allow a company to inject its own ad banners. ""Imagine the U.S.P.S., or FedEx, for that matter, opening your Amazon boxes and injecting ads into the packages,"" Mr. Watt said in a previous interview.The lines of code contained references to ""rxg,"" which stands for Revenue Extraction Gateway, a service aimed at generating money from Internet access points. A company called RG Nets offers the service. RG Nets has not responded to multiple requests for an interview. "
The Early Word: Recess,In Today's Times:Washington Happenings: 
U.S. Requests Tougher Rules On Data Sales,"The government's chief consumer protection agency said on Monday that it intended to take direct aim at the vast industry that has grown up around the buying and selling of information about American consumers.The agency, the Federal Trade Commission, called on Congress to enact legislation regulating so-called data brokers, which compile and trade a wide range of personal and financial data about millions of consumers from online and offline sources. The legislation would give consumers access to information collected about them and allow them to correct and update such data.The agency also sent a cautionary signal to technology and advertising companies regarding a ''Do Not Track'' mechanism that allows consumers to opt out of having their online behavior monitored and shared. It warned that if companies did not voluntarily provide a satisfactory Do Not Track option, it would support additional laws that mandate it.The recommendations, part of a sweeping set of guidelines in an F.T.C. report on Monday, represent the government's latest move to address the issue of consumer privacy. On one side of the debate are data brokers like Experian and Acxiom, which collect and sell information, and the huge ecosystem of technology and online advertising companies -- including Google, Microsoft and Facebook -- that target consumers based on their personal preferences.On the other side are consumer groups and privacy advocates that are concerned about the volume of data being collected and how little control consumers have over that information.The government's Do Not Track efforts are likely to collide with the desire of companies to continue the lucrative business of collecting, using and sharing information about the people who use their services. Although these businesses say they support limits on using this information, they generally still want to be able to collect it.One official from a prominent technology company, who declined to be named because the discussions with the government were continuing, said that ''do not collect is basically death for online advertising.''But the trade commission said unequivocally that it believed consumers who said they did not want to be tracked meant just that -- no tracking at all. It said it would support legislation to require it.''Do Not Track from our perspective certainly means 'do not collect' -- not 'do not advertise back,' '' said Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the F.TC. ''If a real Do Not Track option doesn't come to fruition by the end of the year, there will be, I don't want to say a tsunami of support for Do Not Track legislation next Congress, but certainly a lot of support.''The F.T.C. said it intended to work with the White House and the Commerce Department on proposals they unveiled last month to develop voluntary industrywide codes of conduct that the F.T.C. can enforce.Mr. Leibowitz said the commission did not endorse any specific Congressional legislation, but he mentioned a bill introduced in the Senate in April 2011 by John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona. That bill seeks to require companies to tell consumers what data is being collected and allow them to opt out of the practice.At least two other bills have been introduced in Congress. But none of that legislation is likely to make it into law in this Congressional session, however, given the heavy schedule of pending matters and re-election campaigns.Many data broker companies say much of the information they collect is available from public documents like property and voter registration records. Companies can sell their data to a variety of clients, including marketers, telecommunications companies, retailers and political campaigns.Jennifer Barrett Glasgow, the chief privacy officer for Acxiom, said the focus on data brokers in the F.T.C. report was not a surprise. ''It's not an unreasonable request to have more transparency among data brokers,'' Ms. Barrett Glasgow said. The company collects data from public records, surveys and consumer purchasing behavior both online and offline.According to Ms. Barrett Glasgow, a little more than 15 percent of the company's overall revenue is based on data sales.In an e-mail, Ines Rodriguez Gutzmer, the director of corporate communications, said Acxiom's clients included ''seven of the top eight credit card issuers, four of the top five retail banks, six of the top 10 telecom/media companies, six of the top 10 retailers, eight of the top 10 automotive manufacturers'' and other industry leaders.Gerry Tschopp, the senior vice president for public affairs at Experian North America, said Experian was still reviewing the report but said ''we do provide consumers with choices, we comply with all applicable laws, follow established industry self-regulatory guidelines and use a variety of processes and procedures to safeguard consumer data.''Michael Zaneis, senior vice president and general counsel of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry trade group, said it was important that any data broker legislation not be so broad in scope that it would include ''virtually every publisher site, advertiser, ad network, or analytics firm'' that collects or shares data with other parties. This interconnection, he said, ''makes the digital economy work. We would not want to see legislation introduced that would harm the most fundamental operations of the Internet.''Consumer privacy advocates mostly favored the commission's final report. ''Data brokers buy, compile and sell a wealth of highly personal information about you, but there's no way to find out what they have or if it's correct,'' said John M. Simpson, the head of Consumer Watchdog, which advocates for digital privacy. ''That's why the F.T.C.'s call for legislation in this area is so important.''Jeffrey Chester, the head of the Center for Digital Democracy, said, ''In its call for Congress to enact legislation to rein in the data broker industry, the F.T.C. has opened up an important new 'front' in the battle to protect consumer privacy.''In its report on online privacy last month, the White House recommended that Internet companies that collect personal data and then sell or lease it to third-party brokers should ''prominently and explicitly'' tell consumers they do so and ''provide consumers with meaningful opportunities to prevent these disclosures.''The F.T.C. suggested that the guidelines should not affect small businesses that collect online data from fewer than 5,000 people and do not sell that data to third parties. It would also loosen the guidelines for companies that collect data for the purposes consistent with the context of a user's visit to a particular Web site. For example, if a user buys something on a Web site, the company would be able to collect data on that user and would not be required to offer consumers the option to opt out of data collection. "
"Facebook, Eye on Privacy Laws, Offers More Disclosure to Users","Facebook, seeking to address concerns about the personal information it collects on its users, said Thursday that it would provide any user with more about the data it tracks and stores.In a posting on its privacy blog, Facebook said the expanded archive feature would be introduced gradually to its 845 million monthly active users. It goes beyond the first archive made available in 2010, which has been criticized as incomplete by privacy advocates and regulators in Europe.The archive Facebook published two years ago gave users a copy of their photos, posts, messages, list of friends and chat conversations. The new version, Facebook said, includes previous user names, friend requests and the Internet protocol addresses of the computers that users have logged in from. More categories of information will be made available in the future, Facebook said. Online social networks offer free services to users and make money primarily through advertising, which can often be directed more effectively using the information the network has collected on them.Facebook, which is preparing for an initial public stock offering, most likely in May, has been trying to accommodate government officials in Europe, where privacy laws are more stringent than in the United States.Facebook's data collection practices have tested the boundaries of Europe's privacy laws. The social networking site, based in Menlo Park, Calif., is Europe's leading online network, according to comScore, a research firm in Reston, Va.In December, the Irish Data Protection Commission reached an agreement with Facebook, which runs its international businesses from offices in Dublin, to provide more information to its users and amend its data protection practices. ''We took up their recommendation to make more data available to Facebook users through this expanded functionality,'' the company said in a statement.Facebook agreed to make those changes by July. In Europe, 40,000 Facebook users have already requested a full copy of the data that the site has compiled on each of them, straining the company's ability to respond. Under European privacy law, the company must comply with the requests within 40 days.Max Schrems, the German law student who filed the complaint leading to the agreement with the Irish authorities, criticized Facebook's latest offer as insufficient.''We welcome that Facebook users are now getting more access to their data, but Facebook is still not in line with the European Data Protection Law,'' said Mr. Schrems, a student at the University of Vienna. ''With the changes, Facebook will only offer access to 39 data categories, while it is holding at least 84 such data categories about every user.''In 2011, Mr. Schrems requested his own data from Facebook and received files with information in 57 categories. The disclosure, Mr. Schrems said, showed that Facebook was keeping information he had previously deleted from the Web site, and was also storing information on his whereabouts, gleaned from his computer's I.P. address.Facebook's data collection practices are being scrutinized in Brussels as European Union policy makers deliberate on changes to the European Data Protection Directive, which was last revised in 1995. The commissioner responsible for the update, Viviane Reding, has cited Facebook's data collection practices in pushing for a requirement that online businesses delete all information held on individuals at the user's request.Ulrich Borger, a privacy lawyer with Latham & Watkins in Hamburg, said he thought it was unlikely that the European Union would enact laws that would significantly restrict the use of customized advertising, which is at the core of the business model for Web sites like Facebook. It is more likely, Mr. Borger said, that lawmakers would require Facebook and other networking sites to revise their consent policies to make them more easy to understand. But it was unlikely that Facebook would be legally prevented from using information from individuals who sign up for the service.''I don't see any fundamental change,'' Mr. Borger said. ''It comes back to the question of consent. They cannot go so far as to prohibit things that people are willing to consent to. That would violate an individual's freedom to receive services they want to receive.'' "
Following the Breadcrumbs on the Data-Sharing Trail,"WOULD you like to donate to the Obama campaign? Sign up for a college course? Or maybe subscribe to Architectural Digest?If you have ever felt inundated by such solicitations, by e-mail or by snail mail, you may have wondered what you did to deserve it.I did.I wondered how all those campaigns, companies and institutions got my number. And how much money data brokers behind the scenes might make by flipping my name and address.Turns out there's no easy way for consumers in the United States to track the data dealers who profile our spending, Web browsing and social media habits, the better to sell us stuff. Although the Federal Trade Commission issued a consumer privacy report last month urging companies that collect and share customer information to give people more notification and control over the proliferation of their personal details, the recommendations don't have the force of binding regulations. So, without a right to compel vendors to show me where my data goes, I decided to do some profiling of my own.I subscribed to a half-dozen print magazines last year, signing up for each with a different typo in my name or variation in my address. Then I collected the direct mail that resulted, tracking the solicitations back to the publishers who had shared my erroneous contact information.Admittedly, it was unscientific. But I figured this little off-line experiment might provide insight into an even more opaque world -- online behavioral targeting -- where ad networks deliver tailored marketing pitches to people based on their location, search queries, online purchases and the like.Here are the results:Natawsha, the name under which I had subscribed to Wired and The New Yorker, got hit up for a donation to Literacy Partners, a tutoring company in Manhattan, and received a bulletin from the New-York Historical Society.Nafasha, who signed up for Fast Company, received solicitations from Forbes. The mangled address I had submitted to Foreign Policy received a cascade of mail from, among others, the World Monuments Fund, Barron's and the Kiplinger Letter. And a subscription to The New York Review of Books led to solicitations from the Central Park Conservancy, the New York Public Library and The New York Times -- and, on behalf of President Obama's 2012 campaign, an appeal from Michelle Obama.''It is revenue-producing for a publisher to collect subscribers' information and sell it,'' said Paul Stephens, the director of policy and advocacy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer group in San Diego. ''It's just information that is very valuable to advertisers who want to target individuals based on their interests.''INDEED, the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group, has estimated that spending on direct marketing in the United States reached $163 billion in 2011.Still, a report earlier this year from the White House, laying out a privacy bill of rights for consumers, implicates the decades-old practice of list-sharing, among others. The report says consumers have a right to expect that companies will collect, use and share information in ways consistent with the context in which people provided it.In other words, if you subscribe to a magazine, you might reasonably expect to receive offers from magazines owned by the same publishing house, said Nancy J. King, a privacy law expert who is an associate professor at Oregon State University's College of Business.''But you probably would not have expected a magazine to share your information with a political campaign'' that has inferred your political preferences from your choice of periodicals, Professor King said.Of course, publishers are hardly the only businesses sharing and selling consumer information. In the United States, with the exception of specific sectors like credit and health care, companies are free to use their customers' data as they deem appropriate. That means every time a person buys a car or a house, takes a trip or stays in a hotel, signs up for a catalog or shops online or in a mall, his or her name might end up on a list shared with other marketers. That can happen directly, or through middlemen known as list brokers and data brokers.The ultimate purpose of all this sharing and profiling is to personalize marketing, using analytics to predict the offers most likely to interest consumers based on their past behavior, says Linda A. Woolley, the executive vice president of Washington operations at the Direct Marketing Association.''Sometimes the analytics are right; sometimes they are wrong,'' Ms. Woolley said. ''The industry exists to try to perfect those guesses.''For those who'd rather not receive such offers, she said, the trade group offers a dedicated Web site, dmachoice.org, where people can opt out of getting all kinds of direct mail or specific categories of it, like credit card offers.But Christopher Olsen, the assistant director of privacy and identity protection in the Federal Trade Commission's bureau of consumer protection, said companies ought to notify their customers if they plan to share information about them with third parties -- rather than simply permitting people to opt out after the fact. Indeed, the agency's recent report calls on industry to be more transparent with consumers.''If your name is flying around the ether because you have subscribed to a magazine,'' Mr. Olsen said, ''you ought to understand who has got that information and whether you have a choice about its onward distribution.''ALTHOUGH all of the magazines contacted for this article said their subscribers could opt out, some publishers took a more active approach than others to notifying readers of their practices.Natalie Raabe, a spokeswoman for The Atlantic, for example, said the magazine occasionally allows companies it has screened to contact subscribers about products or services that may be of interest. But the magazine does not share subscriber addresses directly with these companies, she said; it uses a third party to administer the process.A spokeswoman for Conde Nast, publisher of The New Yorker, said it adhered to industry best practices and offered subscribers multiple ways to opt out.Diane R. Seltzer, list manager at The New York Review of Books, vets all proposals from companies that want to market to subscribers to ensure the offers are appropriate. Those making the cut are charged a rental fee of $105 per 1,000 names for one-time use, she said. The publication runs an ad in every issue, she added, notifying subscribers of this practice and explaining how to opt out.''We are very proactive in trying to keep subscribers happy,'' she said.In light of the new federal privacy reports, however, at least one publisher said it might halt, or at least further limit, the selling of its subscriber list.''I think media companies are going to have to tackle this issue,'' said David Rothkopf, the new chief executive of Foreign Policy. Two months into the job, he said, he had hired a new circulation director and intended to review his magazines' list-sharing policy: ''I think there are people out there who don't want to be part of some giant circulating mailing list.''E-mail: slipstream@nytimes.com "
Protecting Its Own Privacy,"Secrets spilled across the computer screen.After months of negotiation, Johannes Caspar, a German data protection official, forced Google to show him exactly what its Street View cars had been collecting from potentially millions of his fellow citizens. Snippets of e-mails, photographs, passwords, chat messages, postings on Web sites and social networks -- all sorts of private Internet communications -- were casually scooped up as the specially equipped cars photographed the world's streets.''It was one of the biggest violations of data protection laws that we had ever seen,'' Mr. Caspar recently recalled about that long-sought viewing in late 2010. ''We were very angry.''Google might be one of the coolest and smartest companies of this or any era, but it also upsets a lot of people -- competitors who argue it wields its tremendous weight unfairly, officials like Mr. Caspar who says it ignores local laws, privacy advocates who think it takes too much from its users. Just this week, European antitrust regulators gave the company an ultimatum to change its search business or face legal consequences. American regulators may not be far behind. The high-stakes antitrust assault, which will play out this summer behind closed doors in Brussels, might be the beginning of a tough time for Google. A similar United States case in the 1990s heralded the comeuppance of Microsoft, the most fearsome tech company of its day.But never count Google out. It is superb at getting out of trouble. Just ask Mr. Caspar or any of his counterparts around the world who tried to hold Google accountable for what one of them, the Australian communication minister Stephen Conroy, called ''probably the single greatest breach in the history of privacy.'' The secret Street View data collection led to inquiries in at least a dozen countries, including four in the United States alone. But Google has yet to give a complete explanation of why the data was collected and who at the company knew about it. No regulator in the United States has ever seen the information that Google's cars gathered from American citizens.The tale of how Google escaped a full accounting for Street View illustrates not only how technology companies have outstripped the regulators, but also their complicated relationship with their adoring customers.Companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple supply new ways of communication, learning and entertainment, high-tech wizardry for the masses. They have custody of the raw material of hundreds of millions of lives -- the intimate e-mails, the revealing photographs, searches for help or love or escape.People willingly, at times eagerly, surrender this information. But there is a price: the loss of control, or even knowledge, of where that personal information is going and how it is being reshaped into an online identity that may resemble the real you or may not. Privacy laws and wiretapping statutes are of little guidance, because they have not kept pace with the lightning speed of technological progress.Michael Copps, who last year ended a 10-year term as a commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission, said regulators were overwhelmed. ''The industry has gotten more powerful, the technology has gotten more pervasive and it's getting to the point where we can't do too much about it,'' he said.Although Google thrives on information, it is closemouthed about itself, as the Street View episode shows. When German regulators forced the company to admit that the cars were sweeping up unencrypted Internet data from wireless networks, the company blamed a programming mistake where an engineer's experimental software was accidentally included in Street View. It stressed that the data was never intended for any Google products.The F.C.C. did not see it Google's way, saying last month the engineer ''intended to collect, store and review'' the data ''for possible use in other Google products.'' It also said the engineer shared his software code and a ''design document'' with other members of the Street View team. The data collection may have been misguided, the agency said, but was not accidental.Although the agency said it could find no violation of American law, it also said the inquiry was inconclusive, because the engineer cited his Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination. It tagged Google with a $25,000 fine for obstructing the investigation.Google, which has repeatedly said it wants to put the episode behind it, declined to answer questions for this article.''We don't have much choice but to trust Google,'' said Christian Sandvig, a researcher in communications technology and public policy at the University of Illinois. ''We rely on them for everything.''That reliance has built an impressive company -- and a self-assurance that can be indistinguishable from arrogance. ''Google doesn't seem to think it ever will be held accountable,'' Mr. Sandvig said. ''And to date it hasn't been.''When Street View was introduced in 2007, it elicited immediate objections in Europe, where privacy laws are tough. The Nazis used government data to systematically pursue Jews and other unwanted groups. The East German secret police, the Stasi, similarly controlled data to monitor perceived enemies.''In the United States, privacy is a consumer business,'' said Jacob Kohnstamm, chairman of the Dutch Data Protection Authority. ''In Europe, it is a fundamental rights issue.''Germany was a hotbed of protest. In Molfsee, a town of 4,800 people on the Baltic Sea, the deputy mayor, Reinhold Harwart, organized a group of residents in a protest.''The main feeling was: Who gives Google the right to do this?'' Mr. Harwart, now 74, said in a recent interview. ''We were outraged that Google would come in, invade our privacy and send the data back to America, where we had no idea what it would be used for.''Google offered few clues. After French privacy regulators inspected a Street View car in early 2010, the company was forced to explain that the cars were collecting information about household's Wi-Fi networks -- in essence, how they connected to the Internet -- to improve location-based services.Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counselor, wrote in a blog post on April 27, 2010, that the company had not previously revealed this part of Street View because, ''We did not think it was necessary.'' But he said only technical data about networks was being collected, not the actual content sent out.Still, German regulators, particularly Mr. Caspar, the data protection commissioner for Hamburg, were alarmed. Google, Mr. Caspar noted, had said nothing about collecting Wi-Fi data when negotiating permission for Street View.Mr. Caspar wanted to inspect a Street View car. Google first said it didn't know where they were, so it couldn't produce them. Then, on May 3, it allowed a technical expert in Mr. Caspar's office to see a vehicle. But the hard drive with data was missing.Faced with the Germans' persistence, Google published a post, on May 14, 2010, saying it had been prompted to ''re-examine everything we have been collecting.'' It turned out that Google was collecting e-mails and other personal data after all.For a company like Google, which thrives on data, more is always better.''The Google privacy officers are going to look at this and say, 'It's not illegal, maybe no one is ever going to be the wiser, and meanwhile we'll have stored the data away in some big database,' '' said Helen Nissenbaum, a privacy expert at N.Y.U. ''We're so enthralled with data, and the good it can bring, that we might overlook any problems.''Mr. Caspar asked to see the hard drive. Google said handing it over could expose it to liability for violating German telecommunications law, which prohibits network operators and other data managers from disclosing the private communications of their clients.This made no sense to Mr. Caspar, who explained that as data protection commissioner he was empowered to receive the data. Finally, in autumn 2010, the company yielded and gave Mr. Caspar the hard drive. By this point, Hamburg prosecutors had opened a criminal investigation.Google was equally resistant with the American authorities.Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's attorney general at the time, announced in late June 2010 that he and attorneys general from more than 30 other states had begun an investigation. Like the Europeans, they asked for the data. For months.''Google resisted providing more information, even in the face of its acknowledgment that the collection was a mistake,'' Mr. Blumenthal recalled in a recent interview.Google argued that its data scooping was legal in the United States. But it told regulators it could not show them the data it collected, because to do so might be breaking privacy and wiretapping laws.In December 2010, Mr. Blumenthal issued a civil investigative demand -- the equivalent of a subpoena -- and threatened further legal action if he did not get results. Then he became Connecticut's junior senator and his successor, George Jepsen, took over.No formal settlement was ever reached.Some of those who were involved in the case are mystified.''I cannot think of a single other multistate case that just disappeared,'' said one former state regulator who asked not to be named since he did not want to be seen as bashing his former colleagues. ''Individual state investigations, yes. But to start up a multistate and not end it with at least a consent judgment or even some token resolution is very unusual.''A spokeswoman for Mr. Jepsen said the inquiry was still ''active and ongoing.'' Mr. Jepsen declined to be interviewed.''The legal platform has not kept pace with the technology platform,'' Mr. Blumenthal said. ''So the investigative effort was done with less legal ammunition than might otherwise exist.''The same was true of other challenges to Street View.Citizens in several states filed suits against Google, saying the company had violated federal wiretapping laws through Street View. These suits were consolidated into a class action in San Francisco.Google moved for dismissal, arguing that because it had picked up information only from unencrypted networks, it had not broken the law. In a significant loss, a federal judge said what the company was doing might be more akin to tapping a phone and allowed the suit to proceed. But he let Google appeal immediately, saying these were novel questions of law. The case may eventually end up at the United States Supreme Court.In Germany, Mr. Caspar's effort has also ground to a stop. He is waiting for prosecutors to file the criminal charges. If they do not, he said he would file his own administrative charges.As for the engineer at the center of the controversy, Marius Milner lives in Palo Alto, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley, and apparently still works for Google.

French Agency Faults Google for Reply on Policy,"PARIS -- Already facing scrutiny from antitrust authorities and privacy regulators on a variety of fronts, Google was criticized Wednesday by French data protection authorities, who accused the company of being insufficiently forthcoming in an investigation of its new privacy policy. On behalf of the 27 member states of the European Union, the French data protection agency, the National Commission for Computing and Liberties, known as C.N.I.L., is investigating a privacy policy that Google instituted across the range of its online services this year.In February, it asked Google to delay adoption of the new policy, saying it had ''deep concerns'' about whether it complied with European law. Google instituted the new system anyway.After a meeting with Google executives on Wednesday, the commission said the company's answers to a questionnaire about the new policy had not addressed some of its concerns, including the sharing of data across different Google services.''The C.N.I.L. reiterates its concerns about the purposes and the breadth of these combinations as well as their legal basis,'' the agency said in a statement.''The C.N.I.L. welcomes Google's collaboration but regrets that the answers are often incomplete or approximate,'' it added.The panel said it had sent a new questionnaire to Google, giving it a deadline of June 8. After that, the agency will send its recommendations to the European Commission's data protection panel, which is scheduled to report back to Google by mid-July.Google said in a statement: ''We have received the C.N.I.L.'s follow-up questions, and we are reviewing them. We are confident that our privacy notices respect the requirements of European data protection laws.''When Google announced the new policy, it billed it as a way to streamline and simplify the privacy practices it employs worldwide across about 60 different online services.

Congress To Examine Data Sellers,"In a move that could lay bare the inner workings of the consumer data industry, eight members of Congress have opened a sweeping investigation into data brokers -- companies that collect, collate, analyze and sell billions of details annually about consumers' offline, online and mobile activities for marketing and other purposes.Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, co-chairmen of the Bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus, along with six other lawmakers, sent letters of inquiry on Tuesday afternoon to nine leading industry players. In the letters, the legislators requested extensive information about how the companies amass, refine, sell and share consumer data. Data brokers often collect details about people's financial, retail and recreational activities to help clients like airlines, automakers, banks, credit card issuers and retailers retain their best customers and woo new ones.The letter's recipients included marketing services firms like Acxiom and Epsilon; consumer reporting agencies like Experian and Equifax, which have separate credit reporting and consumer analytics divisions; Fair Isaac, now known as FICO, the credit scoring services company; and Intelius, a company that offers reverse phone look-up and background check services. The letter gave the companies three weeks to respond.The Congressional inquiry heightens the scrutiny of a largely unregulated industry whose companies sell their services to third parties, rarely interacting directly with consumers.In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission began its own investigation into the practices of more than a dozen data compilers. One of those companies, Spokeo, recently agreed to settle charges with the government that it had violated federal law by selling consumers' personal data for employment screening. Enforcement actions against several other data brokers are pending, the agency said.Now Mr. Markey says he wants the Congressional investigation to further expose data broker practices, saying some had the potential to affect people's access to education, health care, employment or economic opportunities.But Mr. Markey's ultimate goal is to determine whether legislators should enact a law regulating the industry. Unlike consumer reporting agencies, which are required by federal law to show people their own credit reports and allow them to correct errors, information brokers are not currently required to show consumers information collected about them for marketing purposes.''We have gone from an era of data keepers to this new era where data reapers are able to create very complex profiles of every American,'' Mr. Markey said in a telephone interview.He said he was particularly troubled by data broker programs that categorize individual consumers as desirable or undesirable sales prospects, often without their knowledge and consent, a practice that he said raised privacy concerns. ''I'm hoping to ratchet up the transparency so we can foster a system of oversight and consumer control over their data.''The privacy caucus's letter was prompted by an article last month in The New York Times about Acxiom, based in Little Rock, Ark. Mr. Markey's office gave The Times a copy of the letter.Jennifer Barrett Glasgow, the chief privacy officer of Acxiom, said company executives had testified before Congress numerous times to inform legislators about the steps they take to protect consumers. ''We are happy to provide whatever information we can to further inform interested parties,'' she said.Other industry representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The privacy caucus does not have subpoena power. But Mr. Markey said other industries, like cellphone carriers, had complied with his requests in the past. He said he expected similar cooperation from data brokers.The letter asked each company to provide a list of all of its sources of data; a list of the specific kinds of consumer information, including ethnic, race or religious data, it collects; descriptions of the data collection methods used, like tracking of social network or mobile phone activity; explanations about each product and service the company has marketed to third parties since January 2009, and the type of data used in such products and services; details about whether any of the products or services are federally regulated; explanations about the security measures used to protect consumer data; as well as descriptions of the opt-out, data access, correction and deletion options the company offers consumers.The direct marketing industry already offers consumers choices about managing marketing pitches sent through the mail. Digital marketers have a program for people who wish to opt out of receiving online ads tailored to their behavior.But Mr. Markey said consumers also needed greater access to data collected about them so they could make more informed choices.''You have to make sure that the values of the physical world accompany the transition to the virtual, digital world,'' he said.

"Citing Deep Data Collections, Senator Opens Inquiry of Information Brokers","The multibillion-dollar data brokerage industry, a growing force in online marketing, is drawing intensified government scrutiny.On Wednesday, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, opened an extensive investigation of nine leading information brokers. Because Americans now conduct much of their daily business online, the senator said he was concerned that ''an unprecedented amount'' of personal, medical and financial information about people could be collected, mined and sold, to the potential detriment of consumers.''An ever-increasing percentage of their lives will be available for download, and the digital footprint they will inevitably leave behind will become more specific and potentially damaging, if used improperly,'' Mr. Rockefeller, who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, wrote in letters to the data brokers. ''It is critical that we understand what information companies like yours are already collecting and selling.'' Linda A. Woolley, the acting chief executive of the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group, called the senator's investigation ''a baseless fishing expedition.''''I hope Senator Rockefeller understands what he's tampering with,'' she said in an e-mailed statement.The Senate investigation represents the second Congressional inquiry into the industry's practices this year. In July, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, co-chairmen of the Bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus, began a House inquiry into data compilers, which is ongoing. And the Federal Trade Commission has been looking into the practices of about a dozen major data brokers.Data brokers collect a wide variety of information from public sources and third parties, including details like consumers' financial status, race or ethnicity, buying history, hobbies, health concerns, travel preferences, Internet providers and social networks.The companies often use the information for a practice called ''database marketing'' -- that is, using data mining to help clients like retailers, banks and airlines tailor marketing pitches to their best customers or identify potential new ones.Collecting, analyzing and selling such information for marketing purposes is perfectly legal. Indeed, it's a huge business. Some data brokers have said they maintain several thousand details on the majority of adults in the United States.But some legislators and regulators say they are concerned that neither they nor consumers know the extent of the material that data brokers collect; whom they disclose or sell it to; and exactly what they are doing with it.Unlike consumer reporting agencies, which are required by federal law to show people their own credit reports and allow them to correct errors, data brokers are not required to show consumers information collected about them for marketing purposes.Earlier this year in a report on protecting consumer privacy, the F.T.C. urged the industry to create a centralized Web portal where consumers could learn about companies' practices and their options for controlling information collected about them. The agency also recommended that Congress pass legislation giving people access to information that data brokers hold about them. Underlying regulators' efforts is their concern that some information brokers could create financial dossiers about individuals that are akin to credit reports and use them to unfairly exclude individual consumers from certain offers or charge some people higher prices than others.''There are data brokers whose marketing lists may not cross the line into credit reports but come very close,'' said Julie Brill, a member of the F.T.C. ''The question is whether the lists are being used for marketing purposes or for something very close to credit purposes.''Industry representatives say that data-based marketers use consumer marketing data for legitimate commercial practices, not for regulated purposes like making offers of credit or insurance.They add that collecting marketing data benefits consumers because it allows companies to send people offers for products and services they are interested in. It also increases efficiency because companies know ahead of time not to send pitches for, say, lawn mowers to people who live in apartments.''Consumers love getting what they want -- information, products, benefits, upgrades -- when they want it,'' said Ms. Woolley of the Direct Marketing Association. ''There is no evidence that data-driven marketing harms consumers in any way.''On Wednesday, Mr. Rockefeller sent letters of inquiry to established database marketers like Acxiom, headquartered in Little Rock, Ark.; credit reporting agencies like Experian and Equifax, which have separate marketing arms; and newer companies, like Rapleaf and Datalogix, that specialize in helping companies pursue online and mobile consumers.Mr. Rockefeller asked each company to provide extensive business details about its data collection operations since Jan. 1, 2009.Scott Howe, the chief executive of Acxiom, said the company looked ''forward to continuing to work with the Congress to help the members gain a deeper understanding of Acxiom's business and how people and the economy benefit from the appropriate use of data.''In an e-mail, Demitra L. Wilson, a spokeswoman for Equifax, said the company is not a data broker and that the only a small portion of its business involves unregulated, aggregated data about consumers.And Gerry Tschopp, a spokesman for Experian, said the company welcomed the opportunity to discuss ''the benefits of the appropriate use of consumer data'' with legislators.Representatives of Datalogix and Rapleaf did not immediately respond to e-mail and phone requests for comment.Mr. Rockefeller asked the companies to respond by Nov. 2. "
Microsoft Expands Gathering and Use of Data From Web Products,"Microsoft instituted a policy on Friday that gives the company broad leeway over how it gathers and uses personal information from consumers of its free, Web-based products like e-mail, search and instant messaging.Almost no one noticed, however, even though Microsoft's policy changes are much the same as those that Google made to its privacy rules this year.Google's expanded powers drew scathing criticism from privacy advocates, probing inquiries from regulators and broadside attacks from rivals. Those included Microsoft, which bought full-page newspaper ads telling Google users that Google did not care about their privacy, an accusation it quickly denied.The difference in the two events illustrates the confusion surrounding Internet consumer privacy. No single authority oversees the collection of personal information from Web users by Internet companies. Though most companies have written privacy policies, they are often stated in such broad, ambiguous language that they seem to allow virtually any use of customers' personal information. Web companies like Microsoft and Google have been moving aggressively to expand their abilities to gather and sort information about individuals' habits and interests -- even as Congress, federal regulators and the Obama administration have been seeking ways to protect Internet users against unwanted privacy incursions.Microsoft's policy, which it calls its Services Agreement, allows it to analyze customer content from one its free products and use it to improve another service -- for example, taking information from messages a consumer sends on Windows Live Messenger and using it to improve messaging services on Xbox. Previously, that kind of sharing of information between products would not have been allowed under Microsoft policies, which limited the use of data collected under one of its products to that product alone.Microsoft has promised, however, that it will not use the personal information and content it collects to sell targeted advertising. It will not, for example, scan a consumer's e-mails to generate ads that might interest the user. Google does that, and expanding its ability to draw on that content was part of the reason Google changed its privacy policy this year.But the new Microsoft policy does allow for such targeted advertising. Microsoft promised not to do so in blog posts and e-mails informing its customers about the change, but not in the formal policy. That has some privacy advocates nervous.''What Microsoft is doing is no different from what Google did,'' said John M. Simpson, who monitors privacy policy for Consumer Watchdog, a California nonprofit group. ''It allows the combination of data across services in ways a user wouldn't reasonably expect. Microsoft wants to be able to compile massive digital dossiers about users of its services and monetize them.''Jack Evans, a Microsoft spokesman, says the company's plans are benign. He differentiates between the Services Agreement, also known as the terms of use, that was changed on Friday and the company's Privacy Policy, which was last updated in April.''Over the years, we have consistently informed users that we may use their content to improve the services they receive,'' Mr. Evans said in a written statement. ''For instance, we analyze content to improve our spam and malware filters in order to keep customers safe. We also do it to develop new product features such as e-mail categorization to organize similar items like shipping receipts in a common folder, or to automatically add calendar invitations.''However,'' he added, ''one thing we don't do is use the content of our customers' private communications and documents to create targeted advertising. If that ever changes, we'll be the first to let our customers know.''Microsoft's new services agreement affects only its free, Web-based products, not the software programs that individuals and companies buy off the shelf for home or business use. It covers Hotmail, and its related e-mail service, Outlook.com, but not the Outlook e-mail and calendar program that is individually loaded onto computer hard drives and widely used by corporations. Bing, its search engine, is covered, but Internet Explorer, its browser, is not.Microsoft's pledge not to use the data from its Web services to target advertising has some credibility, given the company's broader privacy initiatives. The company has said it will include a ''do not track'' feature in its new Internet Explorer 10 Web browser that prevents online advertising companies from monitoring the browsing habits of users so they can target promotions. Microsoft has made ''do not track'' the default setting on the new version of Explorer, a move that has caused a firestorm among online advertising companies.Microsoft's push to provide better privacy protections for consumers comes at a time when its efforts in Internet advertising have sputtered. Online advertising remains a small fraction of Microsoft's overall business, accounting for $2.6 billion, or about 3.5 percent, of the company's revenue during its last fiscal year, which ended June 30, according to Microsoft's filings with securities regulators.But it is easy to see how Microsoft customers might be confused, because the different divisions of Microsoft that draft and oversee its user agreements and privacy policies did not anticipate that the changes in the services agreement would raise privacy questions.The drafters of the service agreement, a more technical bunch, thought the changes were so small that they were mentioned in August in a specialty ''Volume Licensing'' blog dedicated to commercial customers, but seemingly nowhere else on Microsoft's vast array of corporate Web sites.Microsoft also sent an e-mail about the change in late August to all of its 325 million Hotmail users. But those notices became the subject of nervous online chatter when some users learned that a similar message, using the same template, was being used by hackers to distribute harmful malware. Online message boards warned against even opening the messages.Inside Microsoft, officials were focused not on whether the policy changes affected privacy but rather on a different change, one that limits the ability of Microsoft customers to sue the company, including in a class action, over its products. The new agreement requires the use of binding arbitration.Mr. Evans said the change put in place on Friday in the Services Agreement ''did not alter our existing privacy policies.'' Those policies include a 4,000-word main policy and at least 16 related product-specific privacy policies.That itself is an example of how users cannot possibly know what Internet companies are doing with their personal information, said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer protection group based in Washington.''No one understands how all this data is being put together and being used,'' he said. ''All of these companies are in a digital arms race to tie together all the information they have about individuals. For companies like Google and Microsoft, the real goal is to expand market share.'' "
Data-Gathering via Apps Presents a Gray Legal Area,"BERLIN -- Angry Birds, the top-selling paid mobile app for the iPhone in the United States and Europe, has been downloaded more than a billion times by devoted game players around the world, who often spend hours slinging squawking fowl at groups of egg-stealing pigs.While regular players are familiar with the particular destructive qualities of certain of these birds, many are unaware of one facet: The game possesses a ravenous ability to collect personal information on its users. When Jason Hong, an associate professor at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, surveyed 40 users, all but two were unaware that the game was storing their locations so that they could later be the targets of ads.''When I am giving a talk about this, some people will pull out their smartphones while I am still speaking and erase the game,'' Mr. Hong, an expert in mobile application privacy, said during an interview. ''Generally, most people are simply unaware of what is going on.''What is going on, according to experts, is that applications like Angry Birds and even more innocuous-seeming software, like that which turns your phone into a flashlight, defines words or delivers Bible quotes, are also collecting personal information, usually the user's location and sex and the unique identification number of a smartphone. But in some cases, they cull information from contact lists and pictures from photo libraries.As the Internet goes mobile, privacy issues surrounding phone apps have moved to the front lines of the debate over what information can be collected, when and by whom. Next year, more people around the world will gain access to the Internet through mobile phones or tablet computers than from desktop PCs, according to Gartner, the research group.The shift has brought consumers into a gray legal area, where existing privacy protections have failed to keep up with technology. The move to mobile has set off a debate between privacy advocates and online businesses, which consider the accumulation of personal information the backbone of an ad-driven Internet.In the United States, the data collection practices of app makers are loosely regulated, if at all; some do not even disclose what kind of data they are collecting and why. Last February, the California attorney general, Kamala D. Harris, reached an agreement with six leading operators of mobile application platforms that they would sell or distribute only mobile apps with privacy policies that consumers could review before downloading.In announcing the voluntary pact with Amazon, Apple, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Research in Motion, whose distribution platforms make up the bulk of the American mobile app market, Ms. Harris noted that most mobile apps came without privacy policies.''Your personal privacy should not be the cost of using mobile apps, but all too often it is,'' Ms. Harris said at the time.But simple disclosure, in itself, is often insufficient.The makers of Angry Birds, Rovio Entertainment of Finland, discloses its information collection practices in a 3,358-word policy posted on its Web site. But as with most application makers around the world, the terms of Rovio's warnings are more of a disclaimer than a choice.The company advises consumers who do not want their data collected or ads directed at them to visit the Web site of its analytics firm, Flurry, and to list their details on two industry-sponsored Web sites. But Rovio notes that some companies do not honor the voluntary lists.As a last resort, Rovio cautions those who want to avoid data collection or ads simply to move on: ''If you want to be certain that no behaviorally targeted advertisements are not displayed to you, please do not use or access the services.''Despite multiple requests by phone and Internet over five days, Rovio did not respond to questions.Policy practices like Rovio's often do little to inform consumers. Most people simply click through privacy permissions without reading them, said Mr. Hong, the Carnegie Mellon professor. His institute is developing a software tool called App Scanner that aims to help consumers identify what types of information an application is collecting and for what likely purpose.In Europe, lawmakers in Brussels are planning to bring Web businesses for the first time under stringent data protection rules and to give consumers new legal powers, the better to control the information that is being collected on them.Proposed revisions to the European Union's General Data Protection regulation now before the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee of the European Parliament would require Web businesses to get explicit consent from consumers to collect data. A proposal would also give consumers the ability to choose what information an app can store on them without losing the ability to use the software.But the drafting of the revisions, which are not expected until late 2013 at the earliest, has set off a concerted lobbying battle by global technology companies, most of which are based in the United States, to weaken the consent requirements, which could undermine the advertising-financed business models that drive many free applications. "
European Governments Staying Out of the Cloud,"BERLIN -- Providers of cloud services in Europe are having problems selling to some of their biggest potential customers: national governments.Concerns that data collected by government agencies could ultimately be sold to third parties has prompted some entities to postpone efforts to move their databases to the cloud, making Europe a far less promising market for such services than the United States.In October, the House of Lords in Britain delayed a plan to let government agencies combine their databases to improve voter registration rolls. Some had already moved data to the cloud, and mixing information with the cloud-based databases was considered too risky.''In the end, the House of Lords basically decided to take a go-slow approach,'' said Lord Reid, a member of the chamber. The fears may be well-founded. According to SafeGov, a Washington-based group that advises governments on cloud services, the privacy policies of companies like Microsoft and Google do not precisely lay out how they would protect government data from being sifted for information on individuals, which is particularly valuable to advertisers and other marketers.SafeGov is urging both companies to pledge publicly not to mine government data and to include clauses binding them to that promise in their contracts. Microsoft and Google, in statements, insist they have done so, but questions persist.''We have spent a lot of time looking at the privacy policies of the cloud providers in the public sector,'' said Jeff Gould, an expert for SafeGov and the chief executive and research director of Peerstone Group, an information technology consultancy. ''Our conclusion is that some of them have policies that whether by design or accident, allow them to conduct data mining of user information for purposes not related to the public-sector mission.''That uncertainly has some European governments seeking extra assurance before moving their data onto the cloud.In September, the Norwegian data protection regulator, Datatilsynet, allowed two cities, Narvik and Moss, to use Google Apps and Microsoft's Office 365, but only if the companies stipulated they would refrain from mining data. The towns must also arrange independent audits to ensure that the information is handled properly.In the United States, a range of American companies, including Lockheed Martin, I.B.M., Oracle, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Google, Amazon.com and Microsoft, are now serving government agencies.The U.S. government will spend $4.7 billion on cloud computing services and associated infrastructure in 2013, according to Market Research Media, which is based in San Francisco. By 2018, annual spending on cloud services will grow to $10 billion, or about 11 percent of U.S. government spending on information technology, the firm estimates.Breaking into the government market is ''a dream'' of any information technology firm, said Daniel Miller, an analyst with Market Research Media. ''Microsoft and Amazon are there with just a tip of one leg. Google is only making inroads. Why would these companies compromise years of hard work for some mythical and doubtful mining benefits?''Concerns in Europe over the sanctity of public data in the cloud surfaced in October after the data protection regulator in France, CNIL, criticized what it said were inadequacies in Google's privacy policy. The agency criticized Google's practice of tying together data on individuals from across its services, which the regulator said could be mined for commercial purposes. Google has said its policy conforms to European law.But the regulator's warning will put skittish European governments even more on edge, said Lord Reid, who served as Britain's home, defense and Northern Ireland secretaries under Prime Minister Tony Blair. Lord Reid is also a principal for the Chertoff Group, a Washington-based consulting firm set up by the former U.S. secretary of homeland security, Michael Chertoff.''I think there has been a recognition that the cloud offers great efficiencies,'' Lord Reid said. ''There has also been an awareness of the vulnerabilities and potential misuses.''Karen Evans, the chief information officer for the U.S. government from 2003-09, said most cloud service companies had been reluctant to give ironclad, verifiable guarantees that they were refraining from mining government data in the cloud. While there are stringent certification guidelines for companies that sell cloud services to the U.S. government, Ms. Evans said there lacked regular, independent auditing to make sure companies abided by the rules.''If you ask, they all say they are meeting the government's rules,'' said Ms. Evans, who is a co-founder of SafeGov. ''Microsoft says they are. Google says they are. You have everybody saying, 'Yes, we are doing this.' What you don't have is a procedure in place to check every year.''Representatives for Microsoft and Google said the companies were meeting the requirements in U.S. government contracts that protect the public's data, and that each company inserted binding language in contracts that prohibited data mining.''What goes in a contract is what matters,'' said Stephen McGibbon, the Microsoft chief technology officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He emphasized that Microsoft charged governments for the cloud services, and did not finance them through advertising.Microsoft is ''75 percent of the way'' toward providing a trustworthy guarantee to government clients, said Mr. Gould of SafeGov. Microsoft has posted a statement on its Web site pledging to refrain from mining the data that government clients enter into its Office 365 cloud service.But Mr. Gould said that was only a ''marketing promise'' that needed to be elevated into a legally binding privacy policy.SafeGov is more critical of Google, saying the ad-driven nature of the company's business carried more risks for governments, Mr. Gould said.''The data mining business model accounts for 98 percent or more of their revenue,'' he said. He added that SafeGov had no fundamental objection to Google's approach but that there needed to be a clear line between advertising-supported services and services provided for a fee.Google, in a statement, said its government cloud customers, which include the U.S. General Services Administration and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, have vouched for the integrity of its service and handling of data. But the company declined to state that its government contracts barred the company from mining data.''Our government customers have refuted these false claims,'' Google said in its statement. ''Enterprise customers using Google Apps for Government have individual contracts that define how we handle and store their data. The confidentiality and security obligations provided in our contracts supersede the Google Privacy Policy.''Dan Cruz, a spokesman for the U.S. General Services Administration, said the government's contract with Google includes strong privacy controls.''Not only are there strong security and privacy provisions in the contract, but G.S.A. assesses compliance through control testing and periodic audits,'' Mr. Cruz said.In reporting this article, the International Herald Tribune was provided with a memo asserting that many of SafeGov's partners had direct or indirect business dealings with Microsoft.Microsoft Government, the public sector arm of Microsoft, is listed as a SafeGov ''partner'' on the group's Web site. Mr. Gould, the SafeGov expert, said he had served in the past as a consultant to Microsoft, but also to I.B.M., S.A.P. and Oracle, among others. The Chertoff Group, which where Lord Reid is a principal, is also a member of SafeGov.Mr. Gould rejected the suggestion that SafeGov was a Microsoft front group, motivated by competitive reasons to criticize Google.''Look, we have never made a secret that Microsoft is one of our partners, but SafeGov does not work directly or indirectly for Microsoft,'' Mr. Gould said.He noted that SafeGov was criticizing not just Google, but Microsoft, and to an extent, Facebook, which does not provide services to U.S. government agencies but is used informally by many schools.The issue, he said, is that Microsoft and Google ''have allowed a certain amount of ambiguity to creep into their public statements on the issue of data mining.''''We think that both of them can and should correct the record,'' Mr. Gould said, ''and that doing so will not only not harm their business models, but will help public sector customers all over the world to have confidence that cloud computing is safe and reliable.'' "
Law Students in Austria Challenge Facebook Policy,"BERLIN -- An Austrian student group said Tuesday that it planned to challenge Facebook's privacy policies in Irish court, alleging that the social networking giant had failed, despite repeated requests and formal complaints made by its members, to adapt to the restrictions of European data protection law.The group, which calls itself Europe vs. Facebook, said it would begin collecting donations to challenge the policy in Ireland, where the company's European business is incorporated. Max Schrems, an Austrian law student at the University of Vienna who organized the effort, said Facebook had no interest in adapting its service to meet stricter European privacy requirements.''We have been pursing this for more than a year with Facebook, but the company has done only about 10 percent of what we had asked them to do,'' said Mr. Schrems, 25. ''Therefore, we are preparing to go to court.'' Facebook, in a statement, said its European privacy policy had been vetted and approved by Irish regulators and was in compliance with European law.''The way Facebook Ireland handles personal data has been subject to thorough review by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner over the past year,'' the company said. ''Nonetheless, we have some vocal critics who will never be happy whatever we do and whatever the D.P.C. concludes.''Mr. Schrems's group, which he said was made up of about 10 students at the University of Vienna, filed 22 complaints in 2010 with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland, which regulates Facebook's European business because it is incorporated there.As a result of those complaints, the regulator conducted a public audit of Facebook's privacy policies. In September it announced an agreement with the company that required, among other changes, that Facebook shorten the time it retained consumer data and refrain from building a photo archive on individuals without their prior consent.But Mr. Schrems said in an interview that Facebook was still violating European law in many areas, including a requirement that Facebook provide users who request it with a full copy of all the data the company has collected on them. Mr. Schrems, a Facebook user since 2007, said he requested his own summary file from Facebook in 2010.The company, whose global headquarters is in Menlo Park, California, responded by creating a self-service tool for users to extract the data, which Mr. Schrems said supplied him only with information going back to 2010. In addition, he alleged that Facebook's privacy policy, which users are required to agree to before they can use the service, is too broad and violates European law.''It is basically a collection of American legalese, which is intentionally vague and gives the company adequate leeway to do basically anything they want with your data,'' Mr. Schrems said.Thilo Weichert, the data protection supervisor for the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which has also brought legal action against Facebook, said he supported the Austrian student group's efforts.''Facebook's policy is much too vague and broad and does not conform with German or European law,'' Mr. Weichert said in an interview. ''We think that European privacy officials need to take common action on this.''Mr. Weichert issued an administrative order in August 2011 that barred businesses in the state, which is located along Germany's northern border with Denmark, from using Facebook's social plug-ins like the Like button and Fan pages. The rationale for the order: Those applications collect information on users without their consent by inserting cookies, which track individual computers, through a user's Web browser.In November of last year, Mr. Weichert sued several local business organizations, including the state's own Industrie- und Handelskammer, the equivalent of the local chamber of commerce, for creating their own fan pages on Facebook. The chamber and businesses that have not been identified have challenged that suit, which is pending in court in Kiel.The privacy policies of Facebook, Google and some other U.S.-based Web companies have come under increasing criticism in Europe.European and national laws increasingly demand that consumers first give their explicit, prior consent before their data can be used for targeted advertising. In October, the French privacy regulator, the Commission on Information Technology and Liberties, or CNIL, released a critical analysis of the new consolidated privacy policy that Google adopted earlier this year, which combines information on individuals from the range of Google's services. CNIL said the policy did not adhere to many aspects of European law.At the time, Google said that it would study the regulator's analysis but that it believed its policy conformed with European data protection law. European privacy law is enforced at the national level and regulators in general are limited in their ability to levy fines against large companies for violations.Regulators in Britain and Ireland are more supportive of the privacy policies of U.S.-based Web companies than the authorities on the Continent, and that has led to a fragmented handling of the issue in Europe.Despite the differences, Mr. Weichert predicted that European regulators would come together to press U.S. Web businesses to adhere to European law. ''I think it is in our interests to do this,'' Mr. Weichert said.Mr. Schrems said his group planned to send the Irish regulator a formal letter asserting that the regulator's audit of Facebook was unsatisfactory and allowed the company to operate in Europe without adhering to E.U. data protection law. The regulator will then be required to decide on the group's challenge, which Mr. Schrems expects to happen early next year. Only then could the student group go to court, with a case appealing the regulator's ruling.Mr. Schrems estimated that it would cost &#x20ac;100,000 to &#x20ac;300,000 to pay for the lawsuit, depending on the extent of the appeals in Ireland. The group created Crowd4privacy.org, a site to accept donations. Mr. Schrems said he was only reluctantly pursuing legal action against Facebook after trying to convince it to change its ways.At the urging of the Irish regulator, Mr. Schrems met last February for seven hours in Vienna with Richard Allan, a Facebook director of policy in Europe and a member of the British House of Lords, plus another Facebook executive from California. The Facebook officials, Mr. Schrems said, told him that the company understood his concerns but was like a big ocean tanker that was slow and difficult to turn around quickly.''These policy people seemed to understand our concerns but they weren't able to get people within the company to make the changes,'' Mr. Schrems said. ''That is why we plan to go to court.''This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
F.T.C. Plans To Examine Data Broker Practices,"It's getting tougher to be a data broker.Companies that collect, analyze and sell billions of details about the activities of consumers for marketing purposes have increasingly found themselves under government scrutiny this year.The latest salvo comes from the Federal Trade Commission, which said on Tuesday that it had opened an inquiry into the practices of nine companies that collect and resell or analyze consumer data.The agency issued 15-page administrative subpoenas to the information resellers. The orders require each company to provide extensive details about how it collects consumer data and how it uses, stores, analyzes and shares that data. The agency also asked for information about whether the company allows consumers to see and correct the records held about them. After it reviews this information, the agency plans to issue a report to advise lawmakers on whether more regulation is needed; data brokers are currently largely unregulated.The F.T.C.'s inquiry seeks far more comprehensive details than similar investigations this year in Congress. And executives at the companies may be more forthcoming about their practices with regulators because, unlike Congressional inquiries that often make their results public, the F.T.C. keeps the specifics it gathers confidential.The subpoenas went to, among other companies, Acxiom of Little Rock, Ark., one of the world's largest information resellers, which manages customer databases for major banks, automakers and retailers; eBureau, a company in St. Cloud, Minn., which, on behalf of clients like credit card companies, lenders, insurers and educational institutions, evaluates and scores online consumers in the market for those companies' products; Intelius, a company in Bellevue, Wash., which offers people-search look-up services and background checks; and Peek-You, a company that analyzes social media sentiment.''We are going to get a huge amount of data,'' David C. Vladeck, the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the F.T.C., said in a phone interview on Tuesday. ''We are going to get answers.''In an e-mail, Jennifer Barrett Glasgow, the chief privacy officer of Acxiom, said the company had not yet received the F.T.C.'s letter, but was looking forward to cooperating with the inquiry. ''We consider this request as an avenue to promote a better understanding of why what we do is vital for the American economy as it creates enormous value for people and businesses while respecting and protecting consumers' interests,'' she wrote.Gordon Meyer, the chief executive of eBureau, wrote in an e-mail that the consumer scoring company ''welcomes the opportunity to describe, to the F.T.C., its practices and the benefits we provide to businesses as well as consumers.''Representatives of other companies did not return e-mails seeking comment.Companies and organizations in the United States spend more than $2 billion a year on third-party data about individuals, according to a report last year on personal identity management from Forrester Research, a market research firm. That figure does not include spending on market research and customer data analytics, the report said.Industry representatives argue that their practices benefit consumers. Data brokers, they say, collect information about individuals' purchasing histories, estimated salaries, property ownership, family size, leisure pursuits -- and sometimes also their race or ethnicity, age, gender, health concerns, online browsing history and social networks -- to help marketers tailor pitches to a person's demonstrated tastes. When these bespoke ad systems work properly, the companies argue, marketers can identify male Southern Californians who surf and show them ads for board shorts even as they avoid sending coupons for ski vacations to people who prefer Alaskan cruises.But, as consumers conduct more of their personal and commercial lives online, that type of data collection has been steadily increasing, fueled by new online surveillance techniques and more sophisticated analytics. Some companies, for example, have compiled several thousand different pieces of information on a majority of adults in the United States. Regulators say they are concerned that such comprehensive data collection could be used to profile, score or segment consumers, with the potential to unfairly limit the kinds of financial, insurance, health, education or other marketing offers certain consumers receive.Mr. Vladeck of the F.T.C. offered one possibility he worried about: a hypothetical consumer who buys a deep-fat fryer online may get typecast by data broker systems as a health risk, and then is passed over for marketing pitches for insurance or other services.''Data brokers aggregate huge amounts of data on individuals and have the capacity to create powerful profiles combining information about what you do offline and online,'' Mr. Vladeck said. ''We worry that this information may be used in ways that could be harmful to consumers.''Industry representatives disagreed, saying that their ethics guidelines prohibited companies from using consumer marketing data for eligibility decisions like credit, insurance or employment. Targeted marketing pitches based on data collection about an individual, they added, do not limit a consumer from seeking out financial, insurance or other services on their own.''It changes what comes to you, what you will see in a banner ad or an ad along the side of your Web searches,'' said Jerry Cerasale, senior vice president for government affairs at the Direct Marketing Association, an industry trade group. ''But it doesn't create a barrier for you to look elsewhere.''In March, the F.T.C. issued a report on consumer privacy, calling on data brokers to make their practices clearer to the public. Some legislators and regulators say they are taking a harder look at the industry because of practices that are opaque to consumers.Unlike consumer reporting agencies, for example, which are required by federal law to show consumers their credit reports and allow them to correct errors in their own records, data brokers who collect and sell consumer information for marketing purposes are not required to give individuals access to the records those companies hold about them. In a report earlier this year, the F.T.C. asked Congress to consider enacting regulations to give consumers some rights to data collected about them.Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who opened an examination of the industry in July, along with Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, said the investigations would help legislators and regulators develop a system of oversight, giving consumers more access to and control over data collected about them.''Consumers should have the right to know what is being collected about them, notice that the information is going to be used for purposes other than originally intended, and the right to say no,'' he said. '' 'Knowledge, notice and no,' that has always been my motto.'' "
Daily Report: Google's Big-Name Lobbyist,"Google increasingly finds itself under scrutiny from lawmakers in Washington. Now it is hoping that a former lawmaker will help out on that front. The company announced on Thursday that it had hired Susan Molinari, the former Republican congresswoman from New York, as its Washington lobbyist, Eric Lichtblau reports on the Caucus blog.A lobbyist since 1999, Ms. Molinari replaces Alan Davidson, who announced last year that he was leaving Google after building its Washington lobbying shop into an influential $11 million-a-year operation. Google has moved more aggressively in recent years to shape legislation that affect its search engine and Internet businesses. Like many corporations, it  has looked to strengthen its Republican ties since the party took over control of the House last year.Talking Points Memo noted that Google was facing pressure from politicians and regulators over a big change to its privacy policies that goes into effect March 1. Google is consolidating user information and privacy policies from its various services like YouTube and Gmail. ""The Google office in Washington has not had someone with the visibility of a former member of Congress, and with her understanding of the complexities of the legislative process,"" John Sununu, who served in the House at the same time as Ms. Molinari, told Politico.

One Woman's Data Trail Diary,"As part of The Agenda, The Times's look at major issues facing the next administration, we have been examining the trade-offs, more than a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks, between security and privacy and civil liberties. Some readers have written in about the electronic data trail that all of us leave as we go about our lives, using the Internet and carrying smartphones.Heidi Boghosian, a New Yorker and author of a book on surveillance scheduled for publication next year, ""Spying on Democracy: A Short History of Government/Corporate Collusion in the Technology Age,"" agreed to try to document her own data trail on one recent day. Her account, below, is nothing extraordinary - and that's the point. It is impossible to live in urban, wired America without leaving clues about ourselves, our movements and our views everywhere. And it is all but impossible to be certain who is looking at the resulting data or video and how much of it is accessible to federal, state or local government.Ms. Boghosian is executive director of the National Lawyers Guild, a group of self-described radical lawyers and law students founded in 1937, and between her day job and her book research, she thinks far more than most people about surveillance and privacy. But the exercise of documenting her day was nonetheless informative, she said.""Definitely, for me, going through the process reinforced my sense of the role corporations play in our daily lives,"" she said. ""And I don't think most people realize the extent to which corporations cooperate in turning over personal information to the government.""Here is the record she made: A Day of Surveillance:(1) 8:30 a.m.: Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) in hallway permits private landlord to monitor departure of tenant from apartment building at 173 Avenue A, New York, N.Y. A sign is posted alerting tenants that their actions are being monitored.(2) City-owned video surveillance camera, mounted atop a streetlight pole, records pedestrian and vehicular traffic on corner of Avenue A and 11th Street.(3) 9:45 a.m.: Internet Protocol-based, closed-circuit television CCTV/video surveillance camera at Chase Bank A.T.M. on Second Avenue and 10th Street records clear image of person withdrawing money. I.P. video surveillance footage probably transmitted to a central monitoring room and digitally stored (allowing for advanced search techniques), or viewed over the Internet. Intelligent I.P. cameras with video analytics such as motion sensors, facial recognition and behavioral recognition are used to identify abnormal activity in and around banking locations.(4) 10 a.m.: Customer Loyalty Card at East Village coffee shop Café Pick Me Up, Avenue A and 9th Street, likely allow the business to track and predict customer spending habits.(5) 10:30 a.m.: iPhone (with G.P.S. tracking) in owner's back pocket allows phone owner's movement and location to be tracked (by government, if cellphone provider gives access) through day and evening, even if phone is turned off, as phone owner walks to Astor Place subway stop.(6) 10:45 a.m.: Passed by ""smart sign"" (digital billboard with cameras that gauges demographics of passers-by) that delivers ads tailored to the demographics of the passer-by.(7) 10:45 a.m.: CCTV in NY subway system monitor boarding #6 subway line to work.(8) 11:11 a.m.: CCTV in elevator records ride to ninth-floor office in office building. Building security guard has four cameras behind front desk showing elevator, stairways and hallways.(9) 11:20 a.m.: Facebook software tracks user activities on sites on Internet after logging in and reading a few comments. ""Tag Suggestions"" feature employs facial recognition technology and suggests name tags after uploading photos.(10) 11:30 a.m.: Cookies on Internet monitor all Internet searches throughout day on range of subjects; ads appear on screen related to items purchased on line (athletic shoes, face cream).(11) 1 p.m.: Credit card at Macy's Department store, used for quick purchase, has embedded RFID (Radio Frequency ID) chip, tracking consumer spending habits and providing that information to big business.(12) 1:15 p.m.: Shoes in Macy's new shoe store all have RFID chips (unique identifier linked to database) in them.(13) 1:30 p.m. Downloaded iTunes onto iPhone. Online music providers may share personal information with third parties.(14) 2 p.m.: Video cameras and motion detectors in local supermarket track physical movements of customers (allegedly to aim for improved customer service) as customer drops in to pick up some fruit for lunch.(15) 2:30 p.m.: Social security number and driver's license information, required by Fulton Street Verizon cellular store winds up in Verizon's digital database, as customer switches from AT&T. Allegedly needed Social Security number to conduct credit check even though customer has had a landline account with Verizon for many years.(16) 3:30 p.m.: I.P. address may have been included on a bar code on a digital coupon while registering for at hotelcoupons.com to get a discount hotel deal.(17) 4 p.m.: Continuous, systematic desktop monitoring surveillance of personal use of business computer to access site to order shoes could have been conducted had employer installed software to monitor my real time actions, purportedly to avoid discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuits that may result from inappropriate e-mails sent within company.(18) 6 p.m.: Dropped by anti-fracking protest on West 14th Street. Unmarked police van with tinted windows probably had NYPD Technical Assistance Response Unit (TARU) personnel recording protest activities, especially because several Occupy protesters were present. TARU provides investigative technical equipment and tactical support to all N.Y.P.D. bureaus and also provides assistance to other city, state and federal agencies. The unit employs several forms of computer forensics.(19) 7:30 p.m.: CCTV cameras inside East Village restaurant while meeting friend for dinner after the protest.(20) 9:30 p.m.: Surveillance cameras on several buildings passed on way home is captured on tape.(21) 10 p.m.: Final check of Gmail, and a few Google searches, allow Google to collect even more data on consumer habits and personal interests.

The Data-Mining Industry Kicks Off a Public Relations Campaign,"The Direct Marketing Association, a trade group in Manhattan, introduced a $1 million public relations campaign on Monday morning with a lofty title: the ""Data-Driven Marketing Institute.""The purpose of the effort is to buff the image and forestall regulation of the consumer data-mining industry. This industry consists of business-to-business companies, known as data brokers, that collect, share, analyze and sell information about consumers' online and off-line behaviors in order to tailor marketing pitches to them.According to a statement, the trade group intends to promote such targeted marketing to lawmakers and the public ""with the goal of preventing needless regulation or enforcement that could severely hamper consumer marketing and stifle innovation"" as well as ""tamping down unfavorable media attention."" As part of the campaign, the group plans to finance academic research into the industry's economic impact, said Linda A. Woolley, the acting chief executive of the Direct Marketing Association.The group planned to announce the campaign during its annual conference in Las Vegas. It comes as legislators in both the United States House and the Senate have opened investigations into the practices of leading data brokers. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission is also investigating certain firms and has called on the industry to increase transparency. Some legislators, regulators and privacy advocates have said they are worried that unregulated collection of marketing data about people's personal, health and or financial concerns had the potential to result in unfair pricing or inferior service for some consumers.Ms. Woolley said the industry's public relations effort was intended to counteract those concerns.""We want to set the record straight on what we think has been a lot of mischaracterization of what we do and to explain the benefits of data-driven marketing to consumers,"" Ms. Woolley said.One issue the campaign is not designed to address, however, is a recommendation from the F.T.C. earlier this year that the industry set up a public Web portal where consumers could learn about the practices of data brokers and about consumer choices for accessing or deleting information collected about them. Ms. Woolley said so many different types of companies collected or used consumer data for marketing purposes that a public Web portal would be unfeasible.Still, when consumers learn that third-party companies may collect information about their purchasing records and tastes, at least some people say they would like to be able to see the marketing records data brokers hold about them and have some control over them, said Chuck Teller, the founder of Catalog Choice, a company that helps consumers limit the catalogs, coupons and other direct-mail pitches they receive.About 67 percent of people who answered a recent e-mail questionnaire sent out by his company said they felt it was very important for them to be able to see the information that data brokers collected about them, while about 78 percent said they felt it was very important to be able to opt out of the distribution and sale of information about them, Mr. Teller said.""It's pretty clear that consumers want to opt out of the use of their data by companies they don't do business with,"" Mr. Teller said. "
Romney and Obama Campaigns Leaking Web Site Visitor Data,"The presidential campaign sites BarackObama.com and MittRomney.com have recently ratcheted up their use of third-party Web trackers. These are companies, like ad networks and data brokers working on behalf of the campaigns, that collect information about users' online activities to show political ads to people tailored to their own interests and beliefs.Spokesmen for each campaign have separately said that their own campaign had put safeguards in place to protect that user data, as Charles Duhigg and I reported in an article published in The New York Times on Oct. 28.But now a new study by Jonathan Mayer, a graduate student in computer science and law at Stanford University, reports that both sites are leaking information about site visitors to a number of third-party trackers operating on their pages.Several pages on the Obama site included a user's personal information in the page title at the top of the page or in the URL address, Mr. Mayer said, thereby giving third parties operating on the site the opportunity to collect identifying data. The information flowing to third parties, he said, variously included the username; the proper name under which a person registered; and their street address and ZIP code.On the Romney site, Mr. Mayer said, he found that a number of pages included the user's name in the page title. Many pages also included a unique numerical ID number in the URL, which flowed to third parties, he said.""Are the campaigns identifying their supporters to third-party trackers? Are they directly undermining the anonymity properties that they are so quick to invoke?"" Mr. Mayer wrote in a blog post published on Thursday morning. ""Yes, they are.""In an e-mail, Adam Fetcher, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, wrote that, regardless of the kinds of data that flows from the site to its third-party partners, the campaign does not allow those trackers to use the voter data collected on the site for any other clients or purposes.""We do not provide any personal information to outside entities for their commercial use or for reasons other than what's related to the work they do with us,"" Mr. Fetcher wrote, ""and we stipulate that third party partners not use data collected on the site for other purposes.""A spokesman for the Romney campaign did not return an e-mail request seeking comment.Mr. Mayer tested the Obama and Romney sites by registering as a user and examining the page codes and layouts that resulted as he visited the sites.In registering for the Obama site with his e-mail address, for example, Mr. Mayer found that the site by default assigned him a username that was the first part of his e-mail address. On certain pages on the site, he reported, that username appeared in the URL, thereby sharing part of his e-mail address with ten tracking companies operating on the page. Because many consumers tend to use the same e-mail address or username on many sites, leaking such data could allow third parties to link other public accounts on the Web to individual users, Mr. Mayer said.Meanwhile, after Mr. Mayer found that the Romney site leaked his member ID number in the URL, he logged out and then immediately tried to access his own information on the site using that ID number - a tactic a third party who collected that data could hypothetically use. When he used that ID number on the site without being logged in, the site showed a message that said ""Access Denied."" At the same time, he said, the very same ""access denied"" page leaked more information on that page: the name under which he had registered.I registered on both campaign sites on Wednesday night and had a similar experience.The Obama site automatically assigned me a user name -nsinger - taken from my e-mail address that was visible in the URL on various pages. Using a tracker identification program called Ghostery, I found four different trackers that could collect that information.On the Romney site, certain pages leaked the ID number I had been assigned in the URL. Other pages, I noted, leaked my ZIP code or state in the URL.Advertising industry executives have long argued that third-party tracking is beneficial to online consumers because it helps brands show relevant digital ads. They also argue the data collection about online consumers is ""anonymous"" because the third parties do not collect identifying information like people's names and home addresses.But Mr. Mayer said his study, and previous research by other computer experts, indicated that many sites leak users' personal information to third parties - challenging the claims about ""anonymous"" data.""I think that for both campaigns this leakage is likely totally inadvertent,"" Mr. Mayer said in a phone interview. ""But claiming this tracking data is anonymous just ignores the reality.""He also took a reporter to task for failing to sufficiently investigate the campaigns' claims about their data protection practices.""The Gray Lady also deserves a light rap on the knuckles for insufficiently scrutinizing the campaigns' anonymity assertions,"" Mr. Mayer wrote.Point taken.

The Instagram Muddle,"Our story so far: Instagram, the filter-and-share photo app that was recently bought by Facebook for $1 billion, changed its privacy policy on Monday. The new one says: ""You agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you."" Wow. So you do beautiful, creative photography - and Instagram gets to sell it to advertisers without a nickel to you.The Web went nuts. Instructions for canceling your Instagram account burned up the Internet. Indignation and outrage were everywhere.I had a hunch nobody at Instagram was really that stupid. This sort of thing happens every few months: someone reads the fine print of Google's terms of services, or Apple's, or Microsoft's, and discovers what seems to be an outrageous ""we own you"" statement buried in the legalese. Google, or Microsoft, or Apple, apologizes, saying, ""That's not what we meant - that's just what our lawyer put in there, and we'll change it."" And life goes on.And sure enough: On Tuesday, Instagram's co-founder Kevin Systrom responded to the outrage with a blog post that says, in essence, ""that's not what we meant.""""It was interpreted by many that we were going to sell your photos to others without any compensation,"" he wrote. ""This is not true and it is our mistake that this language is confusing. To be clear: it is not our intention to sell your photos. We are working on updated language in the terms to make sure this is clear.""So what did he mean? ""We want to create meaningful ways to help you discover new and interesting accounts and content while building a self-sustaining business at the same time."" I have no idea what that means, either. I've read the post six times, and nothing he says translates into English.In any case, it's clear that Instagram is owning up to its ""misinterpreted"" language, and vows to change it before the policy takes effect next month. Well, fine. But honestly - how could anyone, in this age of hyper-privacy-awareness, think that he could get away with such an inflammatory choice of words? Who could possibly have missed the probability of ""misinterpretation""? What kind of reaction did he expect? Maybe once you've got $1 billion in your bank account, you lose just a little touch with reality.  "
Instagram's Loss Is a Gain for Its Rivals,"One app's loss is another app's gain.The uproar over changes to Instagram's privacy policy update Monday has helped a number of photo-sharing applications garner unprecedented amounts of traffic and new users.Pheed, an Instagram-like app that gives users the option to monetize their own content by charging followers to see their posts, gained more new users than any other app in the United States. By Thursday morning, Pheed had jumped to the ninth most downloaded social networking app in Apple's iTunes store, just ahead of LinkedIn. O.D. Kobo, Pheed's chief executive, said subscriptions to the service had quadrupled this week and that in the last 24 hours users had uploaded 300,000 new files to the service -- more uploads than any other 24-hour-period since Pheed first debuted six weeks ago.In the wake of user uproar, Instagram announced late Thursday that it was reverting to its original terms of service agreement.By then, competitor apps were already gaining momentum. Another runaway success has been Flickr, Yahoo's photo-sharing service, which redesigned its app last week to make it easier to share photos on Twitter just as Instagram announced it would no longer sync with the Facebook rival.The day before Instagram first announced changes to its terms of service, Flickr's mobile app was ranked at around 175 in Apple's overall iTunes app charts. Since then, the application has skyrocketed to the high-20s.Florian Meissner, one of the founders of a photo-sharing service in Berlin called EyeEm, said that he also began noticing an increase in the flow of new users around the time that Instagram began shutting down its Twitter integration last week.But usage skyrocketed on Tuesday, after Instagam first released its new terms of service. Mr. Meissner did not share how many people flocked to the app but said that daily sign-ups had increased by a thousand percent and were still climbing.Starmatic, a start-up that takes its influence from the toy Kodak camera of the same name, also said that the volume of photographs funneling through the application was at an all-time high this week.""Starmatic has benefited from a massive buzz and arrival of disappointed Instagramers,"" said Jean-Philippe Evort, one of the founders of Starmatic, in an e-mail.Parker Emmott, the co-founder of Waddle, a private group photo-sharing service, said the company had not updated or marketed its service since early August but noticed an unexpected spike in usage this week.""Everybody wants privacy and control, but nobody wants to do any extra work to have it,"" Mr. Emmott said. ""Instagram's changes seem to have helped push the privacy curve forward.""Some photo apps took direct aim at Instagram. One photo filter app, Camera+, even went so far as to include a snarky, holiday-themed reference to Instagram's stumbles in an app update Wednesday.""We'll never do shady things with your shared pics because it just isn't right,"" the app's update noted. ""On that note, Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!""For now, Camera+ allows users to apply filters to photographs and share them across other platforms, including Instagram. But John Casasanta, a principal at Camera+ maker Tap Tap Tap, said the app was planning to incorporate its own sharing features in coming months.When it does, Mr. Casasanta said Camera+ would not sell user data or incorporate ads, but would continue to make money charging users a small fee -- currently 99 cents -- to use premium features. Mr. Casasanta said that model had worked well and expected Camera+ to make its ten millionth sale next week.Of course, most of these services are still tiny compared to Instagram, which claims to have more than 100 million members who have uploaded roughly 5 billion photos using its service. And it's not clear if their newfound members have also deleted their Instagram accounts or are merely dabbling in other offerings. But the migration, whether temporary or permanent, is a reminder of the volatility of success and that the fall to bottom can sometimes be as swift as the rise to the top.Facebook and Instagram declined to say whether or not they had seen any significant number of account deletions or if they were concerned about losing a foothold in the photo-sharing market to rivals.

Iran Suggests Attacks on Computer Systems Came From the U.S. and Israel,"Iran reported a number of new cyberattacks on Tuesday, saying foreign enemy hackers tried in recent months to disrupt computer systems at a power plant and other industries in a strategically important southern coastal province as well as at a Culture Ministry information center.Accounts of the attacks in the official press did not specify who was responsible, when they were carried out or how they were thwarted. But they strongly suggested that the attacks had originated in the United States and Israel, which have been engaged in a shadowy struggle of computer sabotage with Iran in a broader dispute over whether Iran's nuclear energy program is for peaceful or military use. Iran has been on heightened alert against such sabotage since a computer worm known as Stuxnet was used to attack its uranium enrichment centrifuges more than two years ago, which American intelligence officials believe caused many of the machines to spin out of control and self-destruct, slowing the Iranian program's progress.Stuxnet and other forms of computer malware have also been used in attacks on Iran's oil industry and Science Ministry under a covert United States effort, first revealed in January 2009, that was meant to subvert Iran's nuclear program because of suspicions that the Iranians were using it to develop the ability to make atomic bombs. Iran has repeatedly denied these suspicions.The latest Iranian sabotage reports raised the possibility that the attacks had been carried out in retaliation for others that crippled computers in the Saudi Arabian oil industry and some financial institutions in the United States a few months ago. American intelligence officials have said they believe that Iranian specialists in cybersabotage were responsible for those attacks, which erased thousands of Saudi files and temporarily prevented some American banking customers from gaining access to their accounts.Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta cited those attacks in an Oct. 11 speech in which he warned of America's vulnerability to a coordinated computer warfare attack, calling such a possibility a ''cyber-Pearl Harbor.''The Iranian Students' News Agency said the country's Passive Defense Organization, the military unit responsible for guarding against cyberattacks, had battled a computer virus infection of an electric utility and other unspecified manufacturing industries in southern Hormozgan Province, home to a large oil refinery and container port in the provincial capital of Bandar Abbas.The news agency quoted Ali Akbar Akhavan, the head of the Passive Defense Organization's provincial branch, as saying that ''with timely measures and the cooperation of skilled hackers in the province, the progress of this virus was halted.'' It was unclear whether any Iranian targets had been damaged.Iran's Fars News Agency said a cyberattack had also been made against the information center of the Headquarters for Supporting and Protecting Works of Art and Culture, a part of the Culture Ministry, and that the attack had been ''repelled by the headquarters' experts.''The Fars account said the attack originated in Dallas and was routed to Iran via Malaysia and Vietnam. It did not elaborate on the significance of that information, but noted that a broad array of Iranian targets had recently come under cyberattacks that were ''widely believed to be designed and staged by the U.S. and Israel.''News of the latest cyberattacks came as Western economic sanctions on Iran have been tightening, while diplomatic negotiations aimed at resolving the nuclear dispute have remained basically stalled since June. There are expectations that a resumption of those negotiations will be announced soon, possibly next month. "
Securing An Android Device,"Q.Do I need to get an antivirus program for my Android tablet? How much of a threat is out there? A.The amount of malicious software aimed at mobile operating systems like Android is growing. Although Google scans its app store regularly for malicious apps, malware has entered it before.Security-software businesses, which have a considerable interest in the topic, issue regular studies that include sections on threats to mobile devices. Companies like McAfee, Symantec and Lookout have reports online that will give you an idea what is out there.Installing a security app on your tablet may help protect against certain threats. Some programs designed for tablets and smartphones include recovery and remote-wipe features that you can activate to protect your personal information if your device gets lost or stolen. If you are shopping, there are plenty of Android security apps around. Norton, McAfee, Trend Micro, Avast, Kaspersky, AVG, Webroot and others now offer security software for mobile devices.

Rise Is Seen in Cyberattacks Targeting U.S. Infrastructure,"ASPEN, Colo. -- The top American military official responsible for defending the United States against cyberattacks said Thursday that there had been a 17-fold increase in computer attacks on American infrastructure between 2009 and 2011, initiated by criminal gangs, hackers and other nations.The assessment by Gen. Keith B. Alexander, who heads the National Security Agency and also the newly created United States Cyber Command, appears to be the government's first official acknowledgment of the pace at which America's electricity grids, water supplies, computer and cellphone networks and other infrastructure are coming under attack. Those attacks are considered potentially far more serious than computer espionage or financial crimes. General Alexander, who rarely speaks publicly, did not say how many attacks had occurred in that period. But he said that he thought the increase was unrelated to the release two years ago of a computer worm known as Stuxnet, which was aimed at taking down Iran's uranium enrichment plant at Natanz.When the worm inadvertently became public, many United States officials and outside experts expressed concern that it could be reverse-engineered and used against American targets. General Alexander said he saw no evidence of that.General Alexander, as head of the N.S.A., was a crucial player in a covert American program called Olympic Games that targeted the Iranian program. But under questioning from Pete Williams of NBC News at a security conference here, he declined to say whether Stuxnet was American in origin; the Obama administration has never acknowledged using cyberweapons.General Alexander said that what concerned him about the increase in foreign cyberattacks on the United States was that a growing number were aimed at ''critical infrastructure,'' and that the United States remained unprepared to ward off a major attack. On a scale of 1 to 10, he said, American preparedness for a large-scale cyberattack is ''around a 3.'' He urged passage of legislation, which may come to a vote in the next week, that would give the government new powers to defend private computer networks in the United States. The legislation has prompted a struggle as American companies try to avoid costly regulation on their networks, and some civil liberties groups express concern about the effect on privacy.General Alexander said that the administration was still working out rules of engagement for responding to cyberattacks. Because an attack can take place in milliseconds, he said that some automatic defenses were necessary, as was the president's involvement in any decisions about broader retaliation.He confirmed that under existing authorities, only the president had the power to authorize an American-directed cyberattack. The first such attacks occurred under President George W. Bush.The Pentagon has said previously that if the United States retaliated for an attack on its soil, the response could come in the form of a countercyberattack, or a traditional military response.General Alexander spoke in a 75-minute interview at the Aspen Security Forum at the Aspen Institute here. The New York Times is a media sponsor of the four-day conference. Another conference speaker, Matthew Olsen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, addressed the escalating ''hot war'' between Israel and Iran and Iranian-backed groups like Hezbollah.Iran has blamed Israel for assassinations of several of its nuclear scientists. Israel has accused Hezbollah operatives backed by Iran of carrying out the suicide bombing last week that killed five Israeli tourists and a local bus driver in Bulgaria.The United States has said Iran was behind a thwarted plot last fall to kill Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.''Both with respect to Iran and Hezbollah, we're seeing a general uptick in the level of activity around the world in a number of places,'' Mr. Olsen said.Mr. Olsen did not address the Bulgaria attack, but he said the plot to kill the Saudi envoy in Washington ''demonstrated that Iran absolutely had the intent to carry out a terrorist attack inside the United States.''

Hackers Step Up Attacks After Megaupload Shutdown," Last week, after Wikipedia, Reddit and Boing Boing voluntarily blacked out their Web sites to protest proposed antipiracy legislation, hackers began their own  blackouts with attacks on dozens of sites across the Internet.The hacking attacks escalated Thursday after federal authorities shut down Megaupload, a popular file-sharing site charged with copyright infringement. By Monday, hackers affiliated with the loose collective Anonymous had at various times taken down the Web sites of the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the White House, the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, the United States Copyright Office, CBS.com, Warner Music and Universal Music in retaliation. On Monday evening, they took down the Federal Trade Commission's OnGuardOnline.gov Web site, briefly defacing the site with their own Anonymous logo, contact details for various F.T.C. officials, and a message. ""If SOPA/PIPA/ACTA passes we will wage a relentless war against the corporate Internet, destroying dozens upon dozens of government and company Web sites,"" it read, referring to the acronyms for the Stop Online Piracy Act in the House, the Protect Intellectual Property Act in the Senate and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, a multinational effort to curb piracy.In posts on Twitter, some hackers called the campaign #OpMegaupload. Others called it World War Web. The main Anonymous Twitter account called it ""the largest attack ever by Anonymous,"" citing more than 5,600 people involved, though another Anonymous attack on PayPal last year, in retaliation for PayPal's blocking of donations to WikiLeaks, reportedly involved some 7,000 people.Hackers' cyberweapon of choice, in most cases, was a Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), a simple open-source application that requires very little technical know-how to use. Once the application is downloaded - either voluntarily or via a malicious link - the LOIC recruits computers into a ""botnet,"" or a network of computers that floods a designated Web site with traffic until it crashes.Hackers have been luring computers into the attack with malicious links on Twitter, says Carl Herberger, a vice president for security solutions at Radware. The links direct unsuspecting users to a site on PasteHTML.com, a free and anonymous code-hosting site, that sets off Javascript code instructing users' computers to direct the Anonymous LOIC at a predesignated target.  ""The attackers don't know they're attacking,"" Mr. Herberger said. ""It's very dynamic and the only way to stop the attack is to absorb it, or find its origin. But in this case anyone can become a attacker and unless you can find the user, you can't stop the attack.""The attacks, while not technically sophisticated, are nearly impossible to thwart. The best a targeted company can hope for is to get between its Web site and the proxy site, in this case the page on PasteHTML.com. But blocking the attack is nearly impossible because of the ""immeasurable sites"" on the Internet on which Anonymous can post the Javascript code, Mr. Herberger says.The better option, he says, is to invest in application layer protections that can absorb a flood of Anonymous traffic, or what is called a distributed denial of service or DDoS attack.  In the past, Anonymous has announced its targets before an attack. Such was the case with PayPal and with Sony last March, when Anonymous attacked Sony's PlayStation Network in retaliation for lawsuits against PlayStation hackers.That, Mr. Herberger says, at least gave targets an opportunity to step up their application layer protections. The recent attacks on the Justice Department, F.B.I., R.I.A.A., M.P.A.A. and others were not advertised beforehand. ""They only knew after the fact,""  Mr. Herberger said.  But the attacks do raise questions about why the White House, Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and others are not better prepared to absorb a DDoS attack.Anonymous, Mr. Herberger says, is changing its modus operandi. ""They would typically file their grievances, issue an ultimatum and then, if that ultimatum was not met, begin their attack. Now, they are not making their targets as public beforehand.""The only Web site that was warned this time around was Sony.  Last week, Anonymous hackers announced they would be taking aim at Sony on Monday in retaliation for Sony's initial support of SOPA. A few days later, Sony's Web site said it was undergoing ""routine scheduled maintenance"" for 13 hours. On Monday, Anonymous announced on its YouTube channel that its Sony attack had been thwarted.But without knowing a site is a target beforehand, it is difficult to prepare for an attack.Mikko Hypponen, an influential security expert and chief research officer at the F-Secure Corporation, based in Helsinki, Finland, said the best advice is: ""Don't become a target. Don't ignore groups like Anonymous. Don't make them get mad at you. Take them seriously."" "
"In Cyberattacks on Banks, Evidence of a New Weapon","How were amateur hackers able to take down some of America's largest banks?  And who were they?Those were some of the bigger mysteries of last week's cyberattacks on Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, PNC, the New York Stock Exchange and others, that caused intermittent Internet outages and delays in online banking.A group claiming Middle Eastern ties, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters, took credit for the attacks online. They claimed to have taken the banks' Web site down using basic online applications. But security researchers said those methods were far too amateur to have been effective.Indeed, representatives for PNC, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo all said that while they had systems in place to fend off such ""denial of service"", or DDoS, attacks-in which hackers bombard a site with traffic until it falls offline-in this case, the volume of traffic was simply ""unprecedented.""""They must have had help from other sources,"" said Jaime Blasco, a security researcher at AlienVault, who investigated the attacks.Those sources, it turns out, were data centers around the world that had been infected with a sophisticated form of malware that can evade detection by antivirus solutions. The attackers used those infected servers to simultaneously fire at American financial services companies until they fell offline.""That method has never been used to this degree before,"" said Carl Herberger, a vice president at Radware, who has been investigating the attacks on behalf of many of the victims. ""By infecting data servers, the attackers were given the horsepower and commercial grade capabilities to affect a massive attack.""Typically DDoS attacks are deployed through an application-like the one hackers claimed to use in their online postings--or botnets, networks of infected zombie computers and devices that do hackers' work for them.In this case, hackers infected data centers first. The malware they used was designed to encrypt itself in order to hide from antivirus solutions-- defending against such malware is a little like fighting an invisible man.  The attacks infected data servers all over the world and then instructed the servers to simultaneously fire at each bank until they took each Web site offline.Mr. Herberger said Radware traced one of the infected servers back to Saudi Arabia. That does not mean, however, that the attacks originated in Saudi Arabia because the infection could have originated anywhere.Mr. Herberger said it was still unclear who was behind the attack. Interestingly, he said Radware's researchers did not find any evidence that the attackers used any of the attack tools hackers posted online. ""From our vantage point, those tools were not used,"" he said.Among remaining unknowns were how these servers were infected in the first place, how widespread the infection rate is, and--perhaps most troubling of all--whether the servers could be leveraged to inflict more damage on another  target tomorrow.""We don't have great answers,"" Mr. Herberger said. ""Until we inoculate this tool, we can't stop the bullets from being fired, we can only try to limit the bullet's impact.""He added, ""It's the classic chess game that is security."" "
Daily Report: Researchers Find Clues in Flame Virus," Security experts have only begun to examine the thousands of lines of code that make up Flame, a data-mining computer virus that has been designed to steal information from computers across the Middle East, Nicole Perlroth reports in Thursday's New York Times. But already digital clues point to its creators and capabilities.Researchers at Kaspersky Lab, which released a report about the virus on Monday, believe Flame was written by a different group of programmers from those who created other malware directed at computers in the Middle East, particularly those in Iran. But Flame appears to be part of the state-sponsored campaign that spied on and eventually set back Iran's nuclear program in 2010, when a digital attack destroyed roughly a fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.Flame, these researchers say, shares several notable features with two other major programs that targeted Iran in recent years: Duqu and Stuxnet. Because both were written on the same platform and share many of the same fingerprints in their source code, researchers believe both were developed by the same group of programmers. Researchers have cited intriguing bits of digital evidence that point to a joint American-Israeli effort to undermine Iran's efforts to build a nuclear bomb.For example, researchers at Kaspersky Lab tracked the working hours of Duqu's operators and found they coincided with Jerusalem local time. They also noted that Duqu's programmers were not active between sundown on Fridays and sundown on Saturdays, a time that coincides with the Sabbath when observant Jews typically refrain from secular work. In other Flame news, the Associated Press reports that technicians had to cut off links between Iran's oil ministry and the Internet in their efforts to contain the virus. And MSNBC looks into why the virus was written a programming language most commonly used for video games: ""Why would a nation-state trying to commit secret espionage toy with video game software?"" "
Security Bills Bruised by Lingering Fight,"The ghosts of two doomed antipiracy bills hang over a new and unrelated issue on Capitol Hill: proposed legislation to help secure the nation's nuclear plants, water systems and other essential infrastructure from hackers and terrorists.In both houses of Congress, legislation is gaining steam that would authorize the federal government to regulate the security of privately owned critical infrastructure, much of which is controlled by Internet-connected systems and susceptible to being hacked. The legislation is already riven by competing interests and fears.National security interests want the government to be able to collect and analyze information from private companies about how they protect themselves from attack. Those companies are skittish about government regulation generally. Civil liberties advocates warn against excessive information-gathering by the state in the name of computer security. And members of Congress are wary of taking any steps that could infuriate the Internet lobby, which scored a surprise victory against would-be antipiracy laws last month.Representative Dan Lungren, Republican of California, who recently introduced a computer security bill, acknowledged that Capitol Hill had learned some lessons about the new political muscle of technology companies and their users.''One of the things we learned is that we have to raise the debate such that no one believes things are being done behind closed doors,'' Mr. Lungren said in a phone interview.A Congressional aide who did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, put the lessons of the antipiracy efforts more bluntly. Some members, the aide said, ''were kind of scarred by that experience and don't want to go down any road where they are viewed as regulating the Internet.''In fact, the latest network security bills do not regulate the Internet, and it is not clear whether they will gain popular traction, either for or against.The Senate computer security bill is expected to be introduced as early as Friday by Joseph I. Lieberman, Susan M. Collins and John D. Rockefeller IV. It would give the Department of Homeland Security regulatory authority over those essential services companies where an attack could jeopardize human life or national security. It would compel critical infrastructure companies and government agencies to share information about threats and breaches, and would give the government power to impose sanctions on companies that run afoul of the law.Details of the bill are still being negotiated. A hearing on it is scheduled for next week.The House version of the bill, which Mr. Lungren proposed in December and is expected to come before a full committee in coming weeks, allows Homeland Security to lay out performance standards on security, but does not give it explicit powers to regulate.Kevin Richards, vice president for government affairs at TechAmerica, a trade group that represents large government contractors like Lockheed Martin, said its members were wary of the government's telling them what to do. ''When it comes to the tech community and Capitol Hill, we look at two cardinal rules,'' Mr. Richards said. ''First is, 'Do no harm.' Second is, 'Beware unintended consequences.' ''The government, he suggested, would do better to focus its energies on improving its own security. ''It's important for our community to remain flexible and nimble in how we respond to the evolving cyberthreat,'' he said. ''The government should lead by example when it comes to securing its network.''Neither the private sector nor government agencies have been immune to attacks. Large government contractors like Lockheed Martin and Booz Allen Hamilton have suffered from embarrassing intrusions in recent months, along with the security agency RSA and even the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Security researchers have repeatedly pointed to gaping holes in the way industrial systems are protected, including those that handle power grids and oil rigs. The vulnerabilities are all the more worrisome as more and more of these systems are connected to the Internet. Passwords can be weak. Data can be transmitted without encryption. Hackers can remotely turn machines on and off, or tweak critical processes by adjusting valves.''Failure to properly control or restrict access to these elements can lead to catastrophic accidents,'' Paul Ferguson, a researcher with TrendMicro, a security firm, concluded recently in a blog post on his company's site.The best-known computer attack on an industrial system used a computer worm called Stuxnet, and appears to have been aimed at Iran's nuclear arms program. Some evidence indicates that it was a joint project of the United States and Israel.James A. Lewis of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research organization, worried that industry lobbying would produce a watered-down law that would do little to deter attacks.''The ideology of the market that dominates American politics, that government 'is the problem,' puts us at a disadvantage, because it's certainly not true for defense,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''A weak bill guarantees a hit.''The Obama administration has been nudging Congress to act on digital security, an issue that seems to garner rare bipartisan energy.James R. Clapper, director of national intelligence, told a rare open hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee last week that ''market incentives'' had kept both the private and public sector from being able to keep up with increasingly sophisticated online attackers. ''Cyberthreats pose a critical national and economic security concern,'' he said in testimony.One of the sticking points in any security legislation is likely to be who can look at the information that private industry reveals about its own vulnerabilities and breaches. The intelligence community is keen to have access to it. Others are keen to keep it out of their reach.One civil liberties group in Washington warned that companies and their customers might become worked up if they discovered that intelligence agencies were trying to extract as much information as possible in the name of security.''I think there is a risk in moving too fast to authorize sharing of so much information that it puts privacy at risk and upsets a lot of the same people who spoke out'' against the antipiracy legislation, said Gregory T. Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group that is supported by the technology industry. "
Daily Report: Security Issues Break Up Symantec-Huawei Venture,"  Less than four years after Huawei Technologies and Symantec teamed up to develop computer network security products, the joint venture is being dismantled, Nicole Perlroth and John Markoff report in Tuesday's New York Times. Symantec feared that the alliance with Huawei, a major Chinese telecommunications company, would prevent it from obtaining United States government classified information about online security threats.According to two people briefed on the deal, Symantec's decision was a pre-emptive political maneuver timed to coincide with the United States government's efforts to share more classified cyberthreat information with the private sector. People with knowledge of the venture said Huawei had already laid off several workers in Huawei Symantec's Silicon Valley offices this month and planned to move its entire operation out of the United States.As online espionage proliferates, the United States government has grappled with how best to share its classified cyberthreat intelligence with the private sector.  Symantec worried that its ties to Huawei would be a disadvantage when it came to being the recipient of classified threat information, according to these people.Security-related concerns are hurting Huawei's growth elsewhere. Australia has blocked it from bidding on contracts in the $38 billion Australian National Broadband Network, citing security concerns, Reuters reported.  The Australian plan is the largest infrastructure project in the country's history.  "
Internet Shutdown Reported Across Syria,"Last Updated, 5:37 p.m. Internet access disappeared across Syria on Thursday, and commercial air traffic was halted, prompting antigovernment activists to warn that the authorities might be planning to escalate their crackdown against the country's raging uprising. Only residents with their own satellite connections to the Internet could access the Web, activists said. Disruptions to phone service were also reported. The network service provider Akamai posted a chart on Twitter showing the sudden drop off in Internet connections in Syria.Akamai traffic data supports @renesys observation (http://t.co/uxC2ZhTo) that Syria is effectively off the Internet http://t.co/haNHwb5y - StateOfTheInternet (@akamai_soti)29 Nov 12In a blog post reporting the shutdown, Jim Cowie, the chief technology officer of Renesys, a company based in New Hampshire that tracks Internet traffic, wrote:Starting at 10:26 UTC (12:26pm in Damascus), Syria's international Internet connectivity shut down. In the global routing table, all 84 of Syria's IP address blocks have become unreachable, effectively removing the country from the Internet.A network engineer for CloudFlare, a San Francisco company that helps defend Web sites from cyber attacks, recorded video of network routes being withdrawn as the Web was cut off. A post on the company's blog explained, ""Syrian Telecommunications (AS29386) is represented by the red dot in the middle of the video. The lines represent routes to the Syrian upstream providers.""Arbor Networks, a company in Lexington, Mass., that provides tools for monitoring the performance of networks, confirmed that it, too, documented the sudden disappearance of Internet traffic to and from Syria on Thursday between 10:00 and 11:00 U.T.C. (12 p.m. and 1 p.m. local time in Syria). According to Arbor, ""a snapshot taken from the vantage point of 246 network operators around the world,"" showed traffic dropped ""to virtually nothing."" An updated graph posted on Arbor's Web site showed that, the Internet was still off at on Thursday night at 11 p.m. local time in Syria.Google reported that access to all of its services inside Syria was down, and an Internet security expert named Chris Ginley told Wired's Danger Room blog, ""Syria is offline.""A representative of EgyptAir in Cairo told The Times that flights to Damascus, the Syrian capital, were suspended indefinitely and it was not clear when they would resume again.

Seems radar communications equipment has been shut.http://t.co/Xi1OkTjI- NMSyria (@NMSyria)29 Nov 12There were conflicting reports of the reason for the airport shutdown. An antigovernment activist in Beirut said that the airport in Damascus, the capital, had been closed cut for two days as rebel fighters edged ever closer, while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that the airport was shut because of a fierce government counteroffensive. State media had reported that it was closed for maintenance purposes, but the activist said the shutdown was because of ""hit-and-run"" strikes by rebels intending to force the closure of the facility.In an update on the Web shutdown, Mr. Cowie added:Looking closely at the continuing Internet blackout in Syria, we can see that traceroutes into Syria are failing, exactly as one would expect for a major cutoff. The primary autonomous system for Syria is the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment; all of their customer networks are currently unreachable.Now, there are a few Syrian networks that are still connected to the Internet, still reachable by traceroutes, and indeed still hosting Syrian content. These are five networks that use Syrian-registered IP space, but the originator of the routes is actually Tata Communications. These are potentially offshore, rather than domestic, and perhaps not subject to whatever kill-switch was thrown today within Syria. Opposition activists outside the country, who have relied on the Internet to distribute video documenting the uprising, scrambled to chart the contours of the communications disruption.Syrians abroad please call Syrian Mobiles phones and landlines.

Internet access was also cut in Libya last year during the revolt that toppled Col. Muammar el-Qadaffi.Fighting has been especially intense around Damascus over the past two weeks with rebels seizing air bases and weapons there. Rebels have put the government under increasing pressure in recent weeks taking oil fields in eastern Syria and a major air base outside Aleppo and demonstrating their increasing ability to shoot down aircraft. Rebel advances are gradually forcing the government to shrink the area it seeks to control and some analysts have speculated that if the Syrian government felt its core interests were threatened -- if, for instance, Aleppo was in danger of being cut off from Damascus or the rebels succeeded in ringing the capital -- the military might start an even more desperate crackdown ""Deliberately or not the rebels could be forcing the regimes hand "" said Yezid Sayigh a military analyst at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.

Manhattan Prosecutor to Centralize Efforts Against Cybercrime,"Many criminals in the city are becoming more sophisticated, like using high-tech tools for identity theft and other forms of computer crimes. The city's response? Become more tech savvy than the criminals.                The Manhattan district attorney's office on Tuesday announced plans for the construction of a cybercrime lab, which will centralize efforts to target crimes and criminals involving the use of technology. The lab, to be housed in the district attorney's office, will be staffed by about 50 current employees, including computer forensic staff members, specialized prosecutors, analysts and investigators. The City Council provided about $4.2 million to pay for construction of the lab, said the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., at a news conference on Tuesday at City Hall, where he was joined by the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn.               Ms. Quinn said, ""In this day and age, we need to be as sophisticated as criminals are, using every tool we can to fight these complex crimes that are often taking place on the Internet - the new crime scene of the modern age.""                The facility is expected to be completed by the end of 2013 and will expand on the efforts of the Manhattan Cybercrime and Identity Theft Bureau, which currently handles much of the forensic analysis of cellphones, smartphones, computers and other electronic devices.               Holding up a bank card scamming machine that criminals use to steal credit card information from A.T.M.'s, Mr. Vance said the device was one example of the kind of technology that is increasingly being used to commit crimes.                The district attorney's office said it sees about 200 to 300 new identity theft cases in Manhattan every month, and the number of computers analyzed in criminal cases rose by 195 percent from 2010 to 2011.                            ""Our office, in order to do its job, needs to stay ahead of the curve,"" Mr. Vance said. ""Things are happening at Internet speed. As we figure out how to combat individuals who are utilizing this type of relatively unsophisticated but nonetheless tricky and effective trickery, they're moving onto something else."" "
Dropbox Investigating After Spam Attack,"Dropbox is investigating reports that a security breach at the cloud-storage service caused its users to receive spam messages.The problem surfaced Monday after Dropbox users complaining about spam messages sent to e-mail addresses reserved exclusively for their Dropbox accounts. The e-mails were scams camouflaged as messages from gambling sites.None of the data customers keep in Dropbox was at risk of exposure, the company said.The company hired outside security experts to perform forensics and spent the better part of the last 36 hours investigating. But by Wednesday afternoon, it had yet to uncover evidence of a breach.In a blog post, the company said it was taking a number of added security measures while it continued to investigate the source of the spam. One possibility is that the e-mail addresses were posted in a document on Dropbox that was made publicly available for spammers to see.Some users questioned whether a half hour Dropbox outage Tuesday was tied to the problem. But in its blog post, Dropbox said it ""was incidental and not caused by any external factor or third party.""Last year, a loophole made it possible for anyone to log into any Dropbox account so long as they had the e-mail address of the user. The company attributed the issue, which lasted for several hours, to a problem with a software update.But the glitch was a wake-up call. Not just for the cloud-storage start-up but for a number of large companies whose employees now use the service to store sensitive corporate information.By making Dropbox cheap and easy to download,  the service has successfully seeped under the door of some of the most closely guarded companies, including Apple and NASA, because their employees use it for files. Its widespread acceptance inside companies has helped Dropbox acquire some 50 million users. "
Smartphone Security Blankets,"Security -- for the information on your smartphone, as well as for the device itself -- is a hot topic these days. The truth is you're packing a lot of sensitive information on your phone, and you should keep it safe. When it comes to physical security, iPhone users would do well to download Find My iPhone, a free app from Apple that allows you to visit a Web site and see your (lost, stolen or misplaced) phone on a map. You can then sound an alarm, send a message that will pop up on its screen, lock the phone or erase all your data.Android does not have an exact equivalent, but there are plenty of alternatives. A free app called Lookout offers the find-my-phone feature and also scans downloaded apps for ''malware'' and backs up your data on its servers. The paid version allows you to wipe the data from your phone remotely and will monitor your phone's Web browser, warning you if you visit unsafe Web sites. (A version of the free app is available for Apple devices.)Then there is your coffee shop's WiFi network. Anyone with minimal technical expertise can snoop on people using shared wireless networks, harvesting passwords and other personal data. Lookout's apps will warn you when you've logged on to an unsecure network, but cannot protect you once you're there.In order to protect yourself on such networks, you can use a virtual private network, or V.P.N. This turns all your activity into unintelligible nonsense to anyone trying to read along with you from across the Starbucks. It also keeps Web sites from tracking you and, if you're traveling, allows you to get access to sites that may be blocked in other countries.These are priced more like computer programs than smartphone apps. PandaPowVPN is a basic tool for Android, and costs $84 annually, or $9 a month. If you have an iPhone, the simplest V.P.N. app is probably Hotspot Shield, which costs $1 a month or $10 annually. (AnchorFree, which makes the app, says it will be available for Android soon.) AnchorFree says its app pays for itself by compressing your data, helping you stay within the limits of a data plan. This should also make browsing faster, but I can't say I noticed a difference.The distinguishing feature, though, is it automatically kicks in each time you start browsing, as opposed to other V.P.N. apps that require you to start them up manually. This matters, because even if you decide you want a V.P.N. app, you want to spend approximately zero time thinking about it. For the most part, that was true of Hotspot Shield, though occasionally it took a while to connect or temporarily lost connection without warning. I found myself having to turn the app on and off sometimes, which involved fiddling with my phone's settings.If even reading about the settings on your phone drives you insane, then it is probably best to stay away from a V.P.N. app. But if you're the type who can't resist checking your bank balance from your corner bar, the hassle may be preferable to the risk.Have a favorite New York City app?

How Two Amateur Sleuths Looked for FinSpy Software,"On Thursday, one day after security researchers disclosed that FinSpy, an elusive, off-the-shelf surveillance software, was spying on computers and mobile phones from servers in as many as 15 countries, the servers began to go dark.One by one, servers in Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia and Mongolia disappeared. Another in Bahrain went down then appeared to quickly reincarnate elsewhere.The article on Friday in The New York Times outlines the use of the software around the world. The tale of how the two sleuths discovered it is an interesting one. Here are more of the details.On Friday, as Americans head out the long weekend, Bill Marczak and Morgan Marquis-Boire will be glued to their computers screens, analyzing malware samples and watching as servers in Turkmenistan, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates continue to track unsuspecting targets.Both have day jobs. Mr. Marquis-Boire, 32, works as a security engineer at Google. Mr. Marczak, 24, is earning his Ph.D. in computer science at the University of California-Berkeley. And until a few months ago, they had never met. In May, a journalist asked the two of them to take a look at some suspicious e-mails sent to three Bahraini activists, one based in London, one in Washington and a third in Manama, Bahrain's capital.What followed was four months of painstaking forensics work that - with every new clue - pointed to the widespread use of a sophisticated, off-the-shelf cyberespionage tool by governments like Qatar and Brunei that hgave questionable track records on human rights.Theirs is yeoman's work. The spyware is so targeted in scope that the two are treading where antivirus giants - like Symantec and McAfee - will not go. But the spyware is invasive enough, and sly enough, that Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak have given up their nights and weekends to find out who is being tracked on the other end.The two discovered that the e-mails sent to the Bahrani activists all reported back to the same command-and-control server in Bahrain. They found that the spyware could grab images of computer screens, record Skype chats, turn on cameras and microphones and log keystrokes. But what made it especially sophisticated was how well it flew under the radar. Its creators had specifically engineered it to elude antivirus makers like Kaspersky Lab, Symantec, F-Secure and others.But their most intriguing finding was a small but telling word embedded in the spyware's code: ""FinSpy.""FinSpy is one product in a larger FinFisher surveillance product line sold by Gamma Group, a British company that says it sells monitoring software to governments to track criminals.FinSpy first gained attention in March 2011 after Egyptian protesters raided the state's security offices and discovered a Gamma Group proposal to sell FinSpy to Egypt's security forces for 287,000 euros, or $353,000.Nine months later, Wikileaks published leaked Gamma Group brochures that summarized what FinSpy could do: record e-mail, instant messages and Skype chats, spy on Web cameras and microphones, log keystrokes and circumvent 40 different antivirus systems - precisely the same functions of the spyware Mr. Marczak and Mr. Morgan-Boire discovered in Bahrain. The company says it is used by governments to track criminals.But the apparent use of the spyware to spy on Bahraini activists - none of whom had any criminal history - suggested it had been used to focus on dissidents.That was the conclusion Mr. Marczak and Mr. Marquis-Boire came to when they published their initial findings with the Citizen Lab of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto last July.Since then, the two have started collecting malware samples from other security researchers as well as activist groups who suspect that they may have been tracked with FinSpy, too.The two have spent the last month studying those samples from their respective apartments and sharing their findings through encrypted chat and e-mail services. Occasionally, they meet over coffee to share their findings in person.They were helped by a computer researcher at Rapid7 who identifies himself as Claudio Guarnieri, who took a close look at the command-and-control server in Bahrain and found that when he sent it an unexpected message, it responded: ""Hallo Steffi."" It turned out to be an important clue.Rapid7, based in Boston, scoured the Internet to see if other servers returned the same message and found 11 I.P. addresses in 10 more countries: Indonesia, Australia, Qatar, Ethiopia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Mongolia, Latvia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States, where an Amazon-hosted server appeared to be running FinSpy. Amazon did not return requests seeking more information about that I.P. address. But Mr. Marczak said that the server appeared to be a proxy that conceals traffic for another server.The Gamma Group denied that the servers Rapid7 discovered were running FinSpy. ""FinFisher servers would not respond in such a way and would not be able to be fingerprinted with such a technique,"" said Martin J. Muench, a Gamma Group managing director. ""None of our server components send out strings like 'Hallo Steffi.'""Using a different fingerprinting method, Mr. Marczak and Mr. Marquis-Boire also scanned the Internet and stumbled on many of the same servers as Rapid7. In one case, Mr. Marquis-Boire discovered a sample that was speaking to the server Rapid7 had identified in the Czech Republic. ""I was holding the other end of what they had found,"" Mr. Marquis-Boire said.On Wednesday, the researchers announced one of their biggest discoveries yet. They discovered new mobile versions of the spyware that had been customized for Apple's iOS, Google's Android, Windows Mobile, Nokia's Symbian and BlackBerry's mobile operating systems.Each could monitor calls, text messages, e-mails and, in the case of BlackBerry, read BBM messages. They could also steal a user's address book, transmit a target's location and spy on third-party applications like WhatsApp, a popular, free texting app.One of the more intriguing tidbits to come out of the research by Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak was a familiar name: Johnny Debs.They said that the version of the spyware that focused on Nokia's Symbian system infected phones through a fake software update. But software updates - even fake ones - require certification. The certificate had been signed by an employee at a company called Cyan Engineering. A Web site for Cyan Engineering was registered anonymously and clicks led to several ""Under Construction"" messages.But the researchers noted that Cyan Engineering Services also appeared as the registrant for a second Web site, www.it-intrusion.com. That Web site was registered by somebody by the name of Johnny Geds, a name that had popped up once before.That name - Johnny Debs - was listed as Gamma Group's sales contact on the FinSpy proposal uncovered in the raid on Egypt's security headquarters.Asked about the possible connection, Mr. Meunch confirmed Johnny Debs is a sales employee at Gamma Group but did not elaborate.

Q&A: Be Cautious With Free Software,"Q.Is it safe to install freeware and shareware on my computer?A.Freeware (free software) and shareware (programs that can be downloaded free to use on a limited basis or with a donation request) range from being perfectly fine to acting as a delivery mechanism for spyware. In general, shareware from established companies that offer trial versions of their programs to test out are O.K.For example, some freeware security products like the free versions of AVG Anti-Virus or Avast! are basic, no-frills editions of the company's commercial product. Microsoft Security Essentials is another freeware antivirus option for Windows users. (Having an updated security program on your computer before you download anything from the Internet is a very good idea.)Other types of freeware and shareware are not as well documented. Some ""free"" programs are free because they have bundled in advertisements and unwanted add-ons that get installed alongside the program you actually wanted to try. Certain programs have been known to install toolbars, change the browser's homepage and break other applications you have installed on the computer.Perhaps the best way to find safe, useful programs is to do stick with reputable shareware sites like CNet's Download.com or Tucows.com. Even with established sites that claim to scan for viruses and spyware, however, read the user reviews and do some online research on any program you are considering. If the free software affects the computer in a negative way, the comments section on its download page (and other online forums) will most likely be filled with complaints, rants and warnings about not installing it.

A New Variant of Malware Takes Aim at Mac Users,"Earlier this month, security researchers discovereda new piece of malwarehad infected more than half a million Apple computers in what was the largest-scale attack on Apple's Mac OS X operating system to date.The malware spread through a security hole in Java software that let its creators download a malicious program onto victims' machines without prompting. Users did not even have to click a malicious link for their computers to be infected. The program simply downloaded itself.Apple released two security patches for the vulnerability and encouraged Mac users to run their software updates as soon as possible. Within two weeks, the number of infected computers dropped from 600,000 to 140,000, according to Symantec.On Monday, however, researchers at Intego, another computer security firm, discovered that a new variant of the malware, called Flashback.S, continued to spread through the same Java vulnerability. Security researchers said the variant was ""actively being distributed in the wild"" and noted that the malware deletes traces of itself on victims' machines to avoid detection.The original Flashback variant used infected computers for click fraud, in which clicks on a Web advertisement are manipulated in exchange for kickbacks. Intego researchers did not say what the new variant of Flashback is being used for. But as with all malware, its creators can choose to use infected computers however they like.This is not the first time that Mac users have been hit by a Windows-style computer virus. Last year, security researchers discovered that a piece of malware, called Mac Defender, was aimed at Macs until Apple released a patch at the end of May 2011.Several cautioned that it signaled a new era in which Mac users become the new target for Windows-style malware attacks. Windows computers were a frequent target for attacks because there had always been more of them. Now, security researchers say, Apple's growing share of the PC market has put a target on its back.In 2008, Adam J. O'Donnell, a security architect at Sourcefire, a computer security firm, predicted that digital criminals would take aim at Mac users with Windows-style malware attacks once Apple's share of the PC market reached 16 percent, assuming that Windows' antivirus solutions were at least 80 percent effective.Apple currently holds 12 percent of the PC market in the United States, according to Gartner, a research company.

The Secret Lives of Dangerous Hackers,"WE ARE ANONYMOUSInside the Hacker World of LulzSec, Anonymous, and the Global Cyber InsurgencyBy Parmy Olson498 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $26.99.In December 2010 the heat-seeking Internet pranksters known as Anonymous attacked PayPal, the online bill-paying business. PayPal had been a conduit for donations to WikiLeaks, the rogue whistle-blower site, until WikiLeaks released a huge cache of State Department internal messages. PayPal cut off donations to the WikiLeaks Web site. Then PayPal's own site was shut down, as Anonymous did what it did best: exaggerate the weight of its own influence.But, according to ''We Are Anonymous,'' by Parmy Olson, the London bureau chief for Forbes magazine, it had taken a single hacker and his botnet to close PayPal. ''He then signed off and went to have his breakfast,'' she writes. Even so, Anonymous made it seem like the work of its shadowy horde. ''We lied a bit to the press to give it that sense of abundance,'' says the figure named Topiary, one of the best sources in ''We Are Anonymous,'' a lively, startling book by Ms. Olson that reads as ''The Social Network'' for group hackers.As in that Facebook film the technological innovations created by a few people snowball wildly beyond expectation, until they have mass effect. But the human element -- the mix of glee, malevolence, randomness, megalomania and just plain mischief that helped spawn these changes -- is what Ms. Olson explores best.''Here was a network of people borne out of a culture of messing with others,'' she writes, ''a paranoid world whose inhabitants never asked each other personal questions and habitually lied about their real lives to protect themselves.''The story of Anonymous and its offshoots is worth telling because of the fast and unpredictable ways they have grown. Anonymous began attracting attention after it attacked the Church of Scientology in 2008; subsequent targets have included Sony's PlayStation network, Fox television and ultimately the C.I.A. The Homeland Security Department expressed its own worries last year.Ms. Olson provides a clear timeline through Anonymous's complicated, winding history. She concentrates particularly on how it spun off the smaller, jokier group LulzSec. ''If Anonymous had been the 6 o'clock news, LulzSec was 'The Daily Show,' '' she writes.The breeding ground for much of this was 4chan, the ''Deep Web'' destination ''still mostly unknown to the mainstream but beloved by millions of regular users.'' The realm of 4chan called /b/ is where some of this book's most destructive characters spent their early Internet years, soaking up so much pornography, violence and in-joke humor that they became bored enough to move on. Ms. Olson, whose evenhanded appraisals steer far clear of sensationalism, describes 4chan as ''a teeming pit of depraved images and nasty jokes, yet at the same time a source of extraordinary, unhindered creativity.'' It thrived on sex and gore. But it popularized the idea of matching funny captions with cute cat photos too.''We Are Anonymous'' also captures the broad spectrum of reasons that Anonymous and LulzSec attracted followers. Some, like Topiary -- who turned out to be Jake Davis, an outwardly polite 19-year-old from a sheep-farming community on the remote Shetland Island called Yell, who was arrested in 2011 -- were in it for random pranks and taunting laughs. This book does not shy away from the raw language its principals used, as when Topiary told one victim: ''Die in a fire. You're done.'' Other participants had political motivations. The New Yorker calling himself Sabu began as a self-styled revolutionary and was instrumental in getting Anonymous to invade the Web sites of top government officials in Tunisia.A pivotal part of this book concerns the arrest of Sabu, the unveiling of his real identity as Hector Monsegur, and the F.B.I.'s subsequent use of him as an informant. Sabu's dealings with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks are also described. Ms. Olson notes how Sabu ''suddenly seemed very keen to talk to the WikiLeaks founder once his F.B.I. handlers were watching.''Ms. Olson regards it as inevitable that neither Anonymous nor LulzSec could reconcile the divergent goals of its participants. Bullying jokesters and politically oriented hacktivists may share sophisticated knowledge of how to manipulate the Web and social media, but each faction became an embarrassment to the other. Topiary told Ms. Olson about his own long-distance contact with Mr. Assange, whom he describes as both intrigued by the saboteurs' potential and critical of their silly side. (After sifting through 75,000 e-mails from a digital security firm, Topiary bashfully admits, one of the things that most interested him was an e-mail from the chief executive's wife saying, ''I love when you wear your fuzzy socks with your jammies.'' )The most startling conversation in ''We Are Anonymous'' was arranged by the author: an in-the-flesh meeting between Topiary and a person she calls William, since he remains unidentified.William personifies the dehumanizing effects of cybercrime, and he knows it. One of his specialties is extorting pornographic pictures and then putting them to damaging use. ''We split up several boyfriends and girlfriends and appalled many people's mothers,'' he recalls, about the Facebook tricks the book describes in detail. ''I'd be lying if I said there was any great reason,'' he adds. ''I don't feel guilty, it makes me laugh, and it wastes a night.''Together they confirm the worst suspicions about the power of sophisticated but untethered Internet manipulation. ''You could inspire some 15-year-old, or someone with a 15-year-old's mind-set, to hate whoever you want them to hate,'' William says.Postscript: May 31, 2012, ThursdayAfter this article was published, PayPal contacted The Times to take issue with the statements in the book that say the hackers shut down its Web site. Jennifer Hakes, a senior manager in corporate communications, said that as a result of the attacks in December 2010, ''PayPal was never down.'' "
Cyberattack On Saudi Firm Disquiets U.S.,"The hackers picked the one day of the year they knew they could inflict the most damage on the world's most valuable company, Saudi Aramco.On Aug. 15, more than 55,000 Saudi Aramco employees stayed home from work to prepare for one of Islam's holiest nights of the year -- Lailat al Qadr, or the Night of Power -- celebrating the revelation of the Koran to Muhammad.That morning, at 11:08, a person with privileged access to the Saudi state-owned oil company's computers, unleashed a computer virus to initiate what is regarded as among the most destructive acts of computer sabotage on a company to date. The virus erased data on three-quarters of Aramco's corporate PCs -- documents, spreadsheets, e-mails, files -- replacing all of it with an image of a burning American flag. United States intelligence officials say the attack's real perpetrator was Iran, although they offered no specific evidence to support that claim. But the secretary of defense, Leon E. Panetta, in a recent speech warning of the dangers of computer attacks, cited the Aramco sabotage as ''a significant escalation of the cyber threat.'' In the Aramco case, hackers who called themselves the ''Cutting Sword of Justice'' and claimed to be activists upset about Saudi policies in the Middle East took responsibility.But their online message and the burning flag were probably red herrings, say independent computer researchers who have looked at the virus's code.Immediately after the attack, Aramco was forced to shut down the company's internal corporate network, disabling employees' e-mail and Internet access, to stop the virus from spreading.It could have been much worse. An examination of the sabotage revealed why government officials and computer experts found the attack disturbing. Aramco's oil production operations are segregated from the company's internal communications network. Once executives were assured that only the internal communications network had been hit and that not a drop of oil had been spilled, they set to work replacing the hard drives of tens of thousands of its PCs and tracking down the parties responsible, according to two people close to the investigation but who were not authorized to speak publicly about it.Aramco flew in roughly a dozen American computer security experts. By the time those specialists arrived, they already had a good handle on the virus. Within hours of the attack, researchers at Symantec, a Silicon Valley security company, began analyzing a sample of the virus.That virus -- called Shamoon after a word embedded in its code -- was designed to do two things: replace the data on hard drives with an image of a burning American flag and report the addresses of infected computers -- a bragging list of sorts -- back to a computer inside the company's network.Shamoon's code included a so-called kill switch, a timer set to attack at 11:08 a.m., the exact time that Aramco's computers were wiped of memory. Shamoon's creators even gave the erasing mechanism a name: Wiper.Computer security researchers noted that the same name, Wiper, had been given to an erasing component of Flame, a computer virus that attacked Iranian oil companies and came to light in May. Iranian oil ministry officials have claimed that the Wiper software code forced them to cut Internet connections to their oil ministry, oil rigs and the Kharg Island oil terminal, a conduit for 80 percent of Iran's oil exports.It raised suspicions that the Aramco hacking was retaliation. The United States fired one of the first shots in the computer war and has long maintained the upper hand. The New York Times reported in June that the United States, together with Israel, was responsible for Stuxnet, the computer virus used to destroy centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility in 2010.Last May, researchers discovered that Flame had been siphoning data from computers, mainly in Iran, for several years. Security researchers believe Flame and Stuxnet were written by different programmers, but commissioned by the same two nations.If American officials are correct that Shamoon was designed by Iran, then clues in its code may have been intended to misdirect blame. Shamoon's programmers inserted the word ''Arabian Gulf'' into its code. But Iranians refer to that body of water as the Persian Gulf and are very protective of the name. (This year, Iran threatened to sue Google for removing the name Persian Gulf from its online maps.)After analyzing the software code from the Aramco attack, security experts say that the event involved a company insider, or insiders, with privileged access to Aramco's network. The virus could have been carried on a USB memory stick that was inserted into a PC.Aramco's attackers posted blocks of I.P. addresses of thousands of Aramco PCs online as proof of the attack. Researchers say that only an Aramco employee or contractor with access to the company's internal network would have been able to grab that list from a disconnected computer inside Aramco's network and put it online.Neither researchers nor officials have disclosed the names of the attackers involved. Saudi Aramco said in a statement that it was inappropriate to comment amid an investigation. The company further stated that it does not comment on rumor or speculation.American intelligence officials blame Iran for a similar, subsequent attack on RasGas, the Qatari natural gas giant, two weeks after the Aramco attack. They also believe Iran engineered computer attacks that intermittently took America's largest banks offline in September, and last week disrupted the online banking Web sites of Capital One and BB&T.Multiple requests for comment from Iran's interests office in Washington and to Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York brought no response.The finger-pointing demonstrates the growing concern in the United States among government officials and private industry that other countries have the technology and skill to initiate attacks. ''The Iranians were faster in developing an attack capability and bolder in using it than we had expected,'' said James A. Lewis, a former diplomat and cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''Both sides are going through a dance to figure out how much they want to turn this into a fight.''More than two months after the Aramco attack, the company continues to deal with the aftermath. Still, this month employees were not able to gain access to their corporate e-mail and internal network for several days. Until the company's executives decide its systems are secure, employees can no longer access Aramco's internal network remotely.The attack, intelligence officials say, was a wake-up call. ''It proved you don't have to be sophisticated to do a lot of damage,'' said Richard A. Clarke, the former counterterrorism official at the National Security Council. ''There are lots of targets in the U.S. where they could do the same thing. The attacks were intended to say: 'If you mess with us, you can expect retaliation.' '' "
Daily Report: Facebook Plans to Name Names in Fight Against Worm,"  The computer worm known as Koobface was a menace to Facebook users over the past few years, and it played a role in sharpening Facebook's defenses against attackers of all kinds. Now Facebook is planning to disclose the names of the men it believes are behind the worm, Riva Richmond reports in Tuesday's New York Times.The five men may have pulled in millions of dollars with their scheme, which involved infecting the computers of social-network users, then selling them fake antivirus software or hijacking their Web searches on behalf of marketers. They have been hiding in plain sight in St. Petersburg, Russia, according to investigators at Facebook and several independent computer security researchers, and have taken vacations to places like Monte Carlo, Bali and Turkey, judging from photographs posted on social network sites.  Though their identities have been known to many for years, law enforcement has apparently done little to shut them down. After The Times's story was posted online, the security firm Sophos published its own report about Koobface, which identifies the same perpetrators as Facebook. The report runs through the mistakes the hackers made in setting up their infrastructure and dissects the clues to their identities that they left online. "
Preparing for DDoS Attacks or Just Groundhog Day," A ""distributed denial of service"" attack - or what security gurus call a DDoS attack - is a little like what happens to Groundhog.org on Groundhog Day.For 364 days out of the year, nobody cares about groundhog fun facts. And then on Groundhog DayBOOM! Third-graders, Bill Murray fans and TV weather newscasters flock to the site to see what the sleepy, plague-resistant, 15-pound creature's shadow might mean for the winter's forecast. For years, Groundhog.org would inevitably crash on the only day every year that Americans care most about their groundhogs.The same is true for a Web site undergoing a DDoS attack. For most days of the year, a site can accommodate a predictable flow of traffic. But flood it with unexpected traffic for a day and you'll knock it offline. In the last month, DDoS attacks have crashed the Web sites of the Central Intelligence Agency, Citigroup, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the White House. The Shadowserver Foundation, which tracks botnets, witnessed more than 300 DDoS attacks across the Web last Tuesday alone.A number of companies help Web sites fight against DDoS attacks and unexpected traffic, including Akamai, Limelight and Level 3 Communications. But their services can be prohibitively expensive. Akamai, which serves NBC, Reuters, BBC and other large news sites, starts its listing price at $15,000 a month, and charges more for sites with large amounts of traffic.It would not make sense for sites like Groundhog.org or Stratfor, the intelligence group hit by hackers over the holidays, to fork over tens of thousands of dollars a month on the infrastructure to sustain one day of traffic a year, or an unexpected cyber attack.CloudFlare, a San Francisco start-up, offers a similar service on the cheap. It distributes a site's traffic across its many data centers and can quickly recognize and filter out a DDoS attack before it hits a company's network. It offers basic services for free and charges more for premium services like additional security or site management. Most customers pay $20 a month, though its largest enterprise customers pay as much as $2,000 a month.Matthew Prince, CloudFlare's chief executive, said his company was able to cut costs because of the plummeting cost of bandwidth - the amount of data that can be accommodated in a given amount of time - and because it used ""extremely efficient"" microprocessors.CloudFlare says it costs the company $7.68 to serve a million page views, which includes bandwidth and hardware costs. By comparison, Mr. Prince estimates that Facebook - which is considered particularly data savvy given the amount of traffic it handles - spends 10 times that much. Mr. Prince claims that based on his analysis of Facebook's monthly active users and costs from its S-1 filing, and a DoubleClick estimate of Facebook page views, Facebook spends $79 per one million clicks.CloudFlare was started in September 2010. Less than two years later, it can count Groundhog.org, Metallica and Stratfor as customers. (Stratfor enlisted the service after its recent cyberattack). Two months ago, the Committee to Protect Journalists asked CloudFlare to protect MakaAngola.org, a site that reports on government corruption in Angola, from repeated efforts to knock the site offline with DDoS attacks. Mr. Prince said some of CloudFlare's first customers surprised him. Turkish escort services were among the first to sign up. He learned their sites were frequent targets for DDoS attacks from Turkey's religiously minded hackers.Mr. Prince said CloudFlare's network experiences ""more traffic than Amazon, Wikipedia, Zynga, Twitter, Bing and AOL combined"" and claimed the service was signing up 1,500 new customers a day -- which is all the more astonishing when you consider that CloudFlare has yet to hire one salesperson or spend one dollar on marketing.Apparently, hackers are doing their marketing for them.

IBM Turns to Big Data Algorithms for Computer Security,"As oxymorons go, ""corporate security"" falls somewhere in  between ""wedded bliss"" and ""light beer.""Businesses spend billions of dollars each year on firewalls, applications and antivirus software in a desperate attempt to ward off hackers and yet, even the companies, like Symantec and RSA, that sell ""security solutions"" can't keep themselves hacker-free.The crux of the problem is that businesses have taken a piecemeal approach to security.  They use antivirus software to weed out malware and firewalls to keep the bad guys out, but none of these systems communicate with each other in an intelligible way. When meaningful messages do emerge, it's often too late - trade secrets are long gone or customers' credit card data has already been compromised.I.B.M. is now the latest company to attempt to take a more holistic approach to corporate security using ""Big Data."" On Wednesday, the company will roll out QRadar, its new security intelligence platform, to track corporate vulnerabilities in real time and cross-reference unusual activity with I.B.M.'s X-Force database, the world's largest repository of threat and hacker information.According to I.B.M.,  I.T. managers using I.B.M.'s platform will now be able to see - in seconds - if someone has gained access to a proprietary database after repeated log-in failures, or if an employee, or perhaps a botnet, is transmitting corporate information to a Gmail account or to a country the company does not do business in. Using I.B.M.'s X-Force database, I.T. managers can see if an employee is sending that information to personal e-mail because that person is going on vacation, or if something more nefarious is going on.I.B.M. is hardly the first company to tackle security in real time. A number of companies already do this. Solera Networks, AccessData and Niksun all market similar services that look for patterns or telltale signs among large amounts of unstructured data in order to flag vulnerabilities before a security breach occurs, or spot a breach as it is happening.But I.B.M. has the advantage of being the world's largest supplier of I.T. systems. I.B.M. acts as the eyes and ears for more than 4,000 clients and witnesses more than 13 billion security ""events"" a day. The company thinks it can use those insights to spot viruses and the warning signs of an attack before they occur.""Significant attacks don't happen out of the blue,"" says Brendan Hannigan, I.B.M.'s general manager of security systems. ""A bank robber picks a target and conducts extensive surveillance before they rob a bank. The same is true in technology. There are a variety of things hackers need to do before they go after specific assets.""In the evolving threat landscape, companies can average as many as a hundred million potentially devastating ""security events"" a day. An event could constitute one too many failed log-in attempts, or evidence that an employee's computer is communicating with a database unrelated to the person's immediate job function. But without the appropriate context, it is nearly impossible for I.T. managers to know the difference between an anomaly and an attack.""We're hitting 10 million security incidents a day. That's not a lot,"" said Virgil Vaduva, an enterprise security architect  for a large retailer and I.B.M. client. (He asked not to name the company because he did not have permission to identify it.) ""Larger organizations can hit hundreds of millions of events per day. There's no way humans can sift through that amount of data. QRadar can sift through that in seconds.""QRadar grew out of I.B.M.'s strategic acquisition in October of Q1 Labs, a security intelligence company run by Mr. Hannigan. The acquisition gave I.B.M. access to a powerful new analytics tool and gave Q1 Labs access to a wealth of data from a broad range of companies around the world that, in turn, made its analytical capabilities that much stronger. As part of the acquisition, I.B.M. moved more than 2,000 employees out of their jobs into a new security division run by Mr. Hannigan.""Businesses tackle security in bits and pieces, but nobody has been able to pull the thread from beginning to end,"" Mr. Hannigan said. ""This is the first time companies will have a truly holistic sense of what's going on."" "
U.S. Military Hunts for Safe Smartphones for Soldiers," The military has long needed computers that are tough enough on the outside to withstand the rough and tumble of the battlefield. Now, with the proliferation of smartphones and tablets in the hands of soldiers, those devices also have to be strong on the inside. They are loaded with contacts, location information and all kinds of military-grade applications, so it can be deadly for a soldier to lose a mobile device or have its data leak out unwittingly.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, has now assigned  Invincea, a company based in Fairfax, Va.,  to fortify Android-based phones and tablets so they are safe in soldiers' hands. The $21 million grant to the company is a window into how pervasive networked technologies have become in the military - and the market that has opened up to secure them.  Part of the problem, said Anup Ghosh, a professor at George Mason University and the founder of Invincea, is that soldiers often want to use their mobile devices to communicate with families back home, and to entertain themselves when they can. And so military applications sit side by side with games, social networking apps and other distractions. The risks can be unexpected. Soldiers playing games on an Army base in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, can easily and unknowingly transmit the names of their friends. A piece of malware can penetrate the operating system and suck out location information. At the same time, mobile devices are beginning to change the work and lives of soldiers as they have for everyone else, as the Department of Defense acknowledged in a strategy paper earlier this month. ""Through faster access to information and computing power from any location, field units can maneuver unfamiliar environments with real time mapping and data overlay capabilities; soldiers can identify friendly forces; engineers can take pictures of mechanical parts for immediate identification and replacement ordering; and military health care providers can diagnose injuries and remotely access lab results while away from hospital premises,"" the department's chief information officer, Teresa Takai, wrote.The strategy paper called for ""a wireless security architecture that mitigates the risk of mobile device exploitation while leveraging new and emerging technical capabilities."" Invincea's first project for Darpa was to protect soldiers' smartphones from loss and theft. It developed software that encrypts files in the operating system and fills up the memory of a lost device with random, useless data; on a standard phone, wiping your data can still leave behind enormous amounts of information. That software is already being used by more than 3,000 soldiers stationed in Afghanistan.Its next project is to make sure that malware doesn't get in through an application, and that sensitive data does not get out. It is working on creating a virtual environment in which applications can run. In other words, it is trying to trick an ordinary application  -- Facebook or  Words With Friends -- into thinking that it is running in the phone's operating system, when it is actually sequestered in a separate virtual environment. The application, in that way, can be prohibited from gaining access to certain information: the phone's location, for instance, or the contacts that it contains.  It can also be kept from gaining root privileges to the phone's operating system and  taking over the device. That is especially important these days, as tools of war are also contained in those same devices, including applications that identify enemy and friendly forces.  ""By separating untrusted apps and content we are preventing the compromise of the operating system,"" Mr. Ghosh said.  "
Virus Seeking Bank Data Is Tied to Attack on Iran,"A security firm said Thursday that it had discovered what it believed was the fourth state-sponsored computer virus to surface in the Middle East in the last three years, apparently aimed at computers in Lebanon.The firm, Kaspersky Lab, said that the virus appeared to have been written by the same programmers who created Flame, the data-mining computer virus that was found to be spying on computers in Iran in May, and that it might be linked to Stuxnet, the virus that disrupted uranium enrichment work in Iran in 2010.The latest virus, nicknamed Gauss after a name found in its code, has been detected on 2,500 computers, most in Lebanon, the firm said. Its purpose appeared to be to acquire logins for e-mail and instant messaging accounts, social networks and, notably, accounts at certain banks - a function more typically found in malicious programs used by profit-seeking cybercriminals.The researchers said the target banks included several of Lebanon's largest - the Bank of Beirut, Blom Bank, Byblos Bank and Credit Libanais - along with Citibank and the online payment system PayPal.""We have never seen any malware target such a specific range of banks,"" Costin Raiu, Kaspersky's director of global research and analysis, said in an interview. ""Generally, cybercriminals target as many banks as possible to maximize financial profit, but this is a very focused cyberespionage campaign targeting certain users of online banking systems.""Lebanon experts said that an American cyber espionage campaign directed at Lebanon's banking system would seem to be a plausible possibility, given Washington's concerns that the country's banks are being used as a financial conduit for the Syrian government and for Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party.""The United States has had a number of Lebanese banks under the microscope for a while,"" said Bilal Y. Saab, a Lebanon expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, who said the banks ""operate much like Swiss banks"" in terms of secrecy. ""A computer virus could completely undermine that,"" he said.Researchers at Kaspersky Lab, based in Moscow, said they found the Gauss virus while analyzing the Flame virus in June. Flame is a reconnaissance tool that can capture images of a user's computer screen, record e-mail and chat sessions, turn on microphones remotely and monitor keystrokes and network traffic. It can infect an offline computer through a USB stick or a Bluetooth connection.Kaspersky's researchers said they were confident that Gauss was the work of the same hands as Flame, because the two viruses were written in the same language (known as C++) on the same platform and shared some code and features. Different people probably wrote Doqu and Stuxnet, the first two state-sponsored viruses to surface in recent years, they said, but all four were probably commissioned by the same state-sponsored entity.""There is absolutely no doubt that Gauss and Flame were printed by the same factories,"" Mr. Raiu said. ""An early version of Stuxnet used a module from Flame, which shows they are connected. Stuxnet was created by a nation-state - it simply could not have been designed without nation-state support - which means Flame and Gauss were created with nation-state support as well.""Kaspersky Lab has declined to speculate on which nation-states were responsible. The New York Times reported in June, based on interviews with officials in several countries, that Stuxnet was jointly developed by the United States and Israel.Security experts not connected with the lab were less sure that a government was behind Gauss. ""It's a fairly large leap, in terms of deductive reasoning, to assume that because they share a common architectural platform, this variant is also state-sponsored,"" said Will Gragido of RSA, a security firm, who has studied Flame but has not yet analyzed Gauss. ""It's possible the code was made available underground and repurposed or reused by cybercriminals.""Kaspersky researchers said Gauss contained a ""warhead"" that seeks a very specific computer system with no Internet connection and installs itself only if it finds one. ""It's done in such a clever way that security researchers cannot analyze it, because they don't know the decryption key that unlocks the true purpose of that program,"" Mr. Raiu said. "
Got Gauss? Tool Helps Spot Lebanon-Focused Virus on PCs," Want to know if your computer is infected with Gauss? This computer virus that has been stealing login credentials for e-mail, social networks, instant messaging and bank accounts has some quirky qualities that make it easy to spot.Among its more mysterious elements is a custom font it installs on infected machines. The font, called Palida Narrow, has a fake copyright notice and includes Western, Baltic and Turkish symbols.For now, researchers said the font appears to have no malicious purpose. It may simply be a marker to help attackers -- and now security researchers -- keep track of infected machines.In the last 24 hours, both Kaspersky Lab, the firm that first discovered Gauss, and Crysys, a Hungarian firm that discovered Doqu - another cyberespionage tool that was used to spy on computers in Iran -  have put out online tools that search for Palida Narrow on users' machines. If the font turns up, the likelihood that Gauss has compromised a machine is high.Knowing who has been infected would serve security researchers well. To date, Kaspersky has found 2,500 infected machines - the vast majority in Lebanon - but that is just from Kaspersky's customer base.Of those, Gauss's intended targets appear to be clients of Lebanese banks - the Bank of Beirut, Blom Bank, Byblos Bank and Credit Libanais - along with some online banking clients of Citibank and PayPal, the mobile payment system.But Kaspersky is limited in what it can learn about the virus's geographic distribution because the attackers shut down Gauss' command-and-control center last month.

Hackers Lay Claim to Saudi Aramco Cyberattack,"Unknown computer hackers claim they forced the world's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, to quarantine its oil production systems from infected PCs inside the company last week. They threatened to attack the company again this Saturday.The hackers said that on Aug. 15, they unleashed a malicious virus into Saudi Aramco, the Saudi government-owned oil company,  in retribution for what they said was the government's support for ""oppressive measures"" in the Middle East.The hackers, who call themselves ""Cutting Sword of Justice,"" said the virus had destroyed some 30,000 - or three-quarters - of all of Saudi Aramco's computers. That's a remarkable claim, but to prove it, on Friday, they posted blocks of what they claimed were the infected I.P. addresses on Pastebin, a Web site often used by hackers to post data from cyberattacks.Saudi Aramco did not return a request seeking clarification. In a statement on its Facebook page, the company confirmed that its computer network had experienced ""a sudden disruption"" on Aug. 15 - the day hackers claimed to have attacked its network - and afterward had ""isolated all its electronic systems from outside access as an early precautionary measure."" It said the disruption appeared ""to be the result of a virus that had infected personal workstations"" but said the virus ""had no impact whatsoever on any of the company's production operations.""Displeased with that response, hackers said in a new Pastebin post on Thursday that they planned to deploy another cyberattack on Saudi Aramco at 5 p.m. this Saturday. ""You will not be able to stop it,"" they wrote.The Saudi Aramco attack would be the first significant use of malware in a so-called hacktivist attack, in which hackers target a company for activist reasons rather than for profit. In the past, hacktivists have used application or distributed denial of service - DDoS - attacks in which they clog a Web site with traffic until it falls offline.""Hacktivists rarely use malware,"" said Rob Rachwald, director of security at Imperva, a security company based in Redwood City, Calif. ""The fact that they used malware is a spooky trend. If other hacktivists jump on this it could be very, very dangerous.""Mr. Rachwald added that the attack highlighted the ineffectiveness of the antivirus solutions that are supposed to protect computer systems against malware threats. ""Antivirus is a vestige of the past,"" Mr. Rachwald said.The use of malware triggered several theories on the Internet that the real culprit behind the Saudi Aramco attack was Iran. Tehran and the Saud family government have sparred recently over the latter's pledge to make up for any cut in Iranian oil exports as a result of American- and European-imposed sanctions. "
"Among Digital Crumbs from Saudi Aramco Cyberattack, Image of Burning U.S. Flag","The computer virus that may be responsible for a cyberattack on Saudi Aramco was intended to overwrite computers with an image of a burning American flag.Just hours after an unknown group of computer hackers took credit for a cyberattack on the world's largest oil company last Wednesday, security researchers at Symantec received a sample of the malware that may be responsible. The malware, named Shamoon after a word that appeared in its code, was designed to spy on computers and then overwrite critical files with a small parcel of a larger image of a burning United States flag.The hackers said that on Aug. 15, at 4:08 a.m. they unleashed malware that they said destroyed some 30,000 - or three-quarters - of all of Saudi Aramco's computers. Researchers discovered that the time they mentioned-4:08 a.m.- appeared as a timer in Shamoon's code that instructed the virus to only execute after 4:08 a.m.""Our analysis confirmed that what we were looking at was exactly what the hackers were talking about-- there was a hard-coded entry to only execute after 8 a.m. GMT-it matched their claim,"" said Vikram Thakur, a principal response manager at Symantec, a computer security firm.Mr. Thakur said that Shamoon was designed to overwrite computers with the image of the burning flag and report back the I.P. addresses of infected computers to a computer inside the same network that was not connected to the Internet. It was unclear how that computer was initially compromised.Last Friday, to add proof to their claims that they erased 30,000 computers, hackers posted blocks of what they claimed were the infected I.P. addresses on Pastebin, a Web site often used by hackers to dump data from cyberattacks.Saudi Aramco did not return a request for clarification about whether those I.P. addresses belonged to its network.""The only entity who can confirm that is Aramco, but looking at all the evidence-and what we've seen publicly reported-it seems extremely likely,"" said Mr. Thakur.The hackers, who called themselves ""Cutting Sword of Justice,"" said they attacked Saudi Aramco to avenge what they said was the Saudi government's support for ""oppressive measures"" in the Middle East. "
Connecting the Dots After Cyberattack on Saudi Aramco,"Publicly released detailsof a cyberattack on Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, appear to confirm reports that critical data on three-quarters of the company's PCs was replaced with the image of a burning American flag.In a statement on Sunday, Khalid al-Falih, Aramco's chief executive, said Aramco had restored its main internal network services after they were ""impacted on Aug.  15, 2012, by a malicious virus that originated from external sources and affected about 30,000 workstations.""That  seemed to confirm a version of events put forth by the hackers who had claimed responsibility for the attack. The hackers, who called themselves Cutting Sword of Justice, said that they had slipped a malicious virus into Saudi Aramco on Aug. 15 that destroyed 30,000 computers.To support their claim, they posted blocks of what they claimed were the infected I.P. addresses to Pastebin, a Web site often used by hackers to post data from such attacks. The group said it had attacked the government-owned oil company in retribution for what it said was the Saudi government's support for ""oppressive measures"" in the Middle East.The attack was the first significant use of malware by so-called hacktivists - hackers who attack for political reasons rather than for profit. Hacktivist groups like LulzSec and Anonymous typically  recruit volunteers to flood a Web site with traffic until it goes offline. In this case, hackers used a malicious virus that was intended to inflict more harm.Security researchers at Symantec, the computer security firm, said that hours after the attack, they received a sample of the virus they believe was responsible. The virus, named Shamoon after a word in its code, was designed to overwrite critical files with an image of a burning American flag. The researchers discovered instructions in Shamoon's code, what is known as a ""kill timer,"" to attack at 4:08 a.m. on Aug. 15 -- the same time hackers said they had destroyed Saudi Aramco's computers.Symantec's researchers said that they had received the sample of malware from an outside security researcher who discovered it on a computer ""in the Middle East."" They declined to identify that researcher or specify the country or organization where the virus was found. But Vikram Thakur, a senior researcher with Symantec's response team, said it was ""extremely likely"" that Shamoon was used in the attack on Saudi Aramco.Shamoon tells compromised computers to report their infection back to one I.P. address. That I.P. address, Symantec's researchers say, belongs to a computer in the same network as other compromised computers but not connected to the Internet. They said it was unclear how that computer had been initially infected. The fact that it was not connected to the Internet lends credence to reports that the attack may have been facilitated by a Saudi Aramco employee.Mr. al-Falih acknowledged that the company had been attacked before.""Saudi Aramco is not the only company that became a target for such attempts, and this was not the first nor will it be the last illegal attempt to intrude into our systems,"" he said. ""We will ensure that we will further reinforce our systems with all available means to protect against a recurrence of this type of cyberattack."" "
Microsoft Finds PCs That Ship Pre-Infected," One more thing to worry about: Your brand-spanking-new computer could be infected with a virus that will raid your online bank account.On Thursday, Microsoft said it had discovered several new computers, fresh from Chinese factory floors, that carried a particularly pernicious computer virus  -- one capable of invading bank accounts, starting computer attacks and creating back doors that allow criminals to have their way with infected machines. Microsoft's digital crime researchers purchased 20 new computers from different cities in China and discovered that four of them had been infected with viruses. In each case, the computers were running counterfeit versions of Windows software that were infected with the virus.That virus, called Nitol, reported back to a command and control center hosted by the Web domain 3322.org, which is registered to Bei Te Kang Mu Software Technology. That domain, Microsoft's researchers say, hosts 500 different strains of  malware. Some are capable of switching on a victim's microphone or Web camera. Others record victims' keystrokes, giving cybercriminals access to their log-in credentials and online bank accounts.Microsoft got permission from a United States court to take down the network of Nitol-infected computers. The takedown was part of a civil suit brought by Microsoft in its increasingly aggressive campaign -- called Project MARS, for Microsoft Active Response for Security -- to take the lead in combating digital crime, rather than waiting for law enforcement to act.Using similar legal means, Microsoft took down four other botnets -- or networks of infected computers -- in the last few years. In each case, Microsoft obtained a court order that allowed it to seize Web domains and computers associated with the botnets without first notifying the owners of the property. The court gave Microsoft permission to seize the 3322.org domain on Monday.""This action will significantly reduce the impact of the menacing and disturbing threats associated with Nitol and the 3322.org domain, and will help rescue people's computers from the control of this malware,"" Richard Boscovich, a senior lawyer in Microsoft's digital crimes unit, said  in a blog post. Peng Yong, the owner of Bei Te Kang Mu Software Technology, told The Associated Press that he was not aware of his domain's seizure by Microsoft and that his company had a ""zero tolerance"" policy toward illegal activity on the domain. But he added that with 2.85 million domain names, his company ""cannot exclude that individual users might be using domain names for malicious purposes.""

"Hackers May Have Had Help With Attacks on U.S. Banks, Researchers Say"," The hackers claiming responsibility for cyberattacks on American banks over the past week must have had substantial help to disrupt and take down major banking sites, security researchers say.Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, U.S. Bancorp, Wells Fargo and PNC all experienced disruptions and delays on their banking sites over the past week because of denial of service or DDoS attacks, in which hackers clog a Web site with data requests until it slows or collapses under the load.A hacker group, which calls itself the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters, took credit for the attacks in online posts. They enlisted volunteers for the attacks with messages on various sites. On one blog, they called on volunteers to visit two Web addresses that would cause their computers to instantly start flooding targets - including the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Bank of America - with hundreds of data requests each second. This week, hackers asked volunteers to attack banks according to a defined timetable: Wells Fargo on Tuesday, U.S. Bancorp on Wednesday and PNC on Thursday.Representatives for Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank and PNC all confirmed Wednesday that their Web sites had experienced disruptions because of unexpected volumes of traffic. Both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq saw a slowdown, but no serious disruption, on their Web sites.Security researchers say the attack methods being peddled by hackers - the custom-built Web sites - were too basic to have generated the disruptions.""The number of users you need to break those targets is very high,"" said Jaime Blasco, a security researcher at AlienVault who has been investigating the attacks. ""They must have had help from other sources.""Those additional sources, Mr. Blasco said, would have to be a well-resourced group, like a nation state, or botnets - networks of infected zombie computers that do the bidding of cybercriminals. Botnets can be rented via black market schemes that are common in the Internet underground, or loaned out by cybercriminals or governments.Last week, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said in an interview  that he believed the attacks on the banks were being sponsored by Iran's government.Mr. Blasco said security researchers had noticed an increase in the use of botnets out of Iran recently. But he said he had not been able to track the origin of the attack to Iran. Attacks can be routed through various I.P. addresses to mask their true origin, making attribution ""nearly impossible,"" Mr. Blasco said.In the hackers' post, they said their attacks were not sponsored by Iran, and said they ""strongly reject the American officials' insidious attempts to deceive public opinion.""They said they conducted the attacks in retaliation for a video, made by amateur filmmakers in the United States, that mocks the Prophet Muhammad.""Insult to the prophet is not acceptable, especially when it is the last prophet Muhammad,"" the hackers said in their post.They pledged to continue to attack American banking sites and targets in other countries, including France, Israel and the United Kingdom, until the video was pulled offline. "
Anonymous Attacks Israeli Web Sites,"After Israel killed a top military commander of Hamas on Wednesday, Anonymous, the loose affiliation of hackers, retaliated with a series of attacks on Israeli Web sites.In a coordinated action that began at 3 a.m. New York time Thursday, hackers attacked Web sites belonging to the Israel Defense Forces, the prime minister's office, Israeli banks, airlines and security companies by flooding them with Web traffic, in a campaign they called #OpIsrael. Though hackers boasted on Twitter that they had taken some 40 Israeli sites offline, Radware, a computer security company, said that in all but a few cases they were unsuccessful. But they did take down a blog page belonging to the I.D.F. and replaced the home page of what they said was a private Israeli surveillance and security company with an image of Gaza in flames and the following message: ""Stop bombing Gaza! Millions of Israelis & Palestinians are lying awake, exposed and terrified.""According to Radware, the hackers utilized very basic attack tools like a Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), a simple open-source application that requires very little technical know-how. Once the application is downloaded - either voluntarily or via a malicious link - the application recruits computers into a botnet, or a network of computers, that floods a designated Web site with traffic until it slows or collapses under the load.The hackers have recruited volunteers on Twitter, in Internet Relay Chat and on Pastebin, a site frequently used by Anonymous to publicize such attacks.The attacks, while not technically sophisticated, can be difficult to thwart. The best the owner of a site under attack can hope for is to get between the targeted site and the attacking site. But blocking the attack is nearly impossible because of the innumerable sites on the Internet on which Anonymous can post their attack tools.Instead, some sites will invest in defenses that can absorb the flood of Anonymous traffic.But even then, so-called hacktivists - hackers who attack for political reasons rather than profits - have found ways around such security before. In September, a group of hackers caused intermittent outages at several American banks, by infecting powerful Web servers around the globe with malware, and then using them to simultaneously fire unprecedented amounts of traffic at each bank until it slowed or collapsed.In a message posted on Pastebin, the hackers said:Anonymous does not support violence by the I.D.F. or by Palestinian Resistance/Hamas. Our concern is for the children of Israel and Palestinian Territories and the rights of the people in Gaza to maintain open lines of communication with the outside world. "
Cyber Attacks From Iran and Gaza on Israel More Threatening Than Anonymous's Efforts,"Anonymous, the loose coalition of hackers waging war on Israeli Web sites, is the least of Israel's cyber problems. Its campaign against Israel is a minor annoyance compared with a wave of cyber attacks that have hit the country over the last year from Iran and Gaza.Since Wednesday - when Israel began air strikes into Gaza-Anonymous hackers have retaliated with millions of hacking efforts on Israeli government and private business sites, intermittently taking hundreds offline, defacing some with anti-Israel messages, deleting Web databases for others and dumping thousands of citizens' usernames and passwords online. The campaign, which hackers have dubbed #OpIsrael, is essentially the digital equivalent of a business getting hit with graffiti; it is a costly nuisance, but eventually databases can be recovered, messages removed and sites come back online. Israeli officials say the vast majority of the hacking efforts over the last week on government sites - some 44 million tries by one official's count - have been unsuccessful, with the exception of one site that went ""wobbly for a few minutes,"" the Israeli finance minister, Yuval Steinitz, told reporters, before recovering.Attacks from Iran and Gaza are another matter.In July, security researchers at Kaspersky Lab and Seculert, two computer security firms, discovered that a strain of malware had infected Israeli companies. Many of those companies handle critical infrastructure, like the country's energy and water supplies, computer and telecom networks. The malware, which the researchers named ""Mahdi"" after a command in its code, appears to have originated in Iran. Elements of the code were written in Farsi, dates in the malware's code were formatted according to the Persian calendar, and the domains used in the attacks were registered to Islamic Azad University in Tehran. The term ""Mahdi"" may have also been a clue; for Shiites, Mahdi is a messianic figure.The malware was designed to spy on computers by copying images and files, grabbing screenshots and using infected computers as recording devices to record users' conversations. While many companies have been able to scrub the malware from their systems, security researchers say Mahdi is still actively spying on computers, predominantly in Israel, but also in Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and the United States.More recently, Israel was forced to take its police department offline two weeks ago after security experts discovered that many of the department's computers had been infected with a remote-access tool, or RAT, which gives attackers realtime control of victims' machines. The RAT appeared to be an off-the-shelf variation that can be bought on public sites for as little as $50.After some investigation, researchers at Norman, a computer security firm in Fairfax, Va., noted that the  attacks originated from command-and-control centers in Gaza and that the same servers had been spying for over a year, first on computers in Palestine and then in Israel.As far back as October 2011, the same command-and-control center had been used to spy on Palestinians. Palestinians received targeted e-mails, written in Arabic, that compelled them to click links that, when opened, gave  attackers full access to their computers. The e-mails often baited victims with politically relevant topics. One  discussed last year's exchange of an Israeli soldier for Palestinian prisoners. Another included a video critical of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's treatment of Palestinians.Then this year, in May, the same group of attackers shifted their target to Israel from Palestine. Israelis received e-mails, in English and Hebrew, that also discussed politically relevant topics,  like Mitt Romney's supposed support for an Israeli airstrike on Iran. The e-mails also compelled recipients to click links that deployed the RAT.Researchers have stopped short of blaming the attacks on any one group, but Aviv Raff, the chief technology officer of Seculert, said the content of the e-mails and the location of the command-and-control centers made clear that the attacks originated in Palestine.Compared with those campaigns, Anonymous's attacks on Israeli Web sites almost seem innocuous. And by Tuesday morning, six days after the group announced #OpIsrael, the collective's campaign already showed signs of dissent.Some Anonymous members took to Twitterto decry another member who had included an anti-Semitic screed alongside a data spill of thousands of Israeli e-mail addresses. And another member who had participated in several Anonymous campaigns in the past said he was abstaining this time around.""I haven't thrown my full weight and support behind #OpIsrael because its goals may be dubious,"" the hacker wrote in a direct message on Twitter. ""That said, I only have influence. Not control. I throw my influence around from time to time, but that's the only tool I have."" "
Researchers Find Clues In Malware,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Security experts have only begun examining the thousands of lines of code that make up Flame, an extensive, data-mining computer virus that has been designed to steal information from computers across the Middle East, but already digital clues point to its creators and capabilities.Researchers at Kaspersky Lab, which first reported the virus Monday, believe Flame was written by a different group of programmers from those who had created other malware directed at computers in the Middle East, particularly those in Iran. But Flame appears to be part of the state-sponsored campaign that spied on and eventually set back Iran's nuclear program in 2010, when a digital attack destroyed roughly a fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges. ''We believe Flame was written by a different team of programmers but commissioned by the same larger entity,'' Roel Schouwenberg, a security researcher at Kaspersky Labs, said in an interview Wednesday. But he would not say which governments he was speaking of.Flame, these researchers say, shares several notable features with two other major programs that targeted Iran in recent years. The first virus, Duqu, was a reconnaissance tool that researchers say was used to copy blueprints of Iran's nuclear program. The second, Stuxnet, was designed to attack industrial control systems and specifically calibrated to spin Iranian centrifuges out of control.Because Stuxnet and Duqu were written on the same platform and share many of the same fingerprints in their source code, researchers believe both were developed by the same group of programmers. Those developers have never been identified, but researchers have cited intriguing bits of digital evidence that point to a joint American-Israeli effort to undermine Iran's efforts to build a nuclear bomb.For example, researchers at Kaspersky Lab tracked the working hours of Duqu's operators and found they coincided with Jerusalem local time. They also noted that Duqu's programmers were not active between sundown on Fridays and sundown on Saturdays, a time that coincides with the Sabbath when observant Jews typically refrain from secular work.Intelligence and military experts have said that Stuxnet was first tested at Dimona, an Israeli complex widely believed to be the headquarters of Israel's atomic weapons program.According to researchers at Kaspersky Lab, which is based in Moscow, Flame may have preceded or been designed at the same time as Duqu and Stuxnet. Security researchers at Webroot, an antivirus maker, first encountered a sample of Flame malware in December 2007. Researchers believe Duqu may have been created in August 2007. The first variant of Stuxnet did not appear on computers until June 2009.Like Duqu, Flame is a reconnaissance tool. It can grab images of users' computer screens, record e-mails and instant-messaging chats, turn on microphones remotely, and monitor keystrokes and network traffic. Even if an infected device is not connected to the Internet, Flame is capable of spreading to other devices by looking for Bluetooth-enabled devices nearby or Internet-connected devices in a local network, according to researchers at Kaspersky Lab.Flame also shares a quirkier trait with Duqu: an affection for American movie characters. Flame's command for communicating with Bluetooth-enabled devices is ''Beetlejuice.'' An e-mail that infected an unnamed company with Duqu last year was sent by a ''Mr. Jason B.'' -- which researchers believe is a reference to Jason Bourne of the Robert Ludlum spy tales.It will take more time for computer security researchers around the world to discover more. Flame contains 20 times more code than Stuxnet and is much more widespread than Duqu. Researchers at Kaspersky Lab said they have detected Flame on hundreds of computers and predict that the total number of infections could be more than a thousand.Unlike Duqu and Stuxnet, security researchers say, Flame is remarkable in that it has been able to evade discovery for five years -- which was impressive given its size. Most malware is a couple hundred kilobytes in size. Flame is 20 megabytes. ''It was hiding in plain sight,'' said Mr. Schouwenberg. ''It was designed in such a way that it was nearly impossible to track down.''Researchers noted that Flame spreads through more conservative means. Researchers say that while Stuxnet had the ability to replicate autonomously, Flame can spread from machine to machine only when prompted by the attacker.Iran confirmed Tuesday that computers belonging to several high-ranking officials appear to have been penetrated by Flame.Researchers are still trying to figure out whether the virus has Stuxnet-like sabotage capabilities.Already, some evidence suggests Flame may be capable of wiping out a computer's hard drive. Researchers at Symantec, an American security firm that has also studied the virus, said Flame references a specific file previously associated with a separate virus, called Wiper, which Iranian officials said had erased data on hard drives inside its oil ministry last month. Researchers are trying to learn whether Wiper was not a virus but one of Flame's command modules.''This is the third such virus we've seen in the past three years,'' Vikram Thakur, a Symantec researcher, said in an interview Tuesday. ''It's larger than all of them. The question we should be asking now is: How many more such campaigns are going on that we don't know about?'' "
Microsoft Battles the Botnets,"WASHINGTON -- A customer in Shenzhen, China, took a brand new laptop out of its box and turned it on for the first time. But as the screen lit up, the computer began taking on a life of its own. The machine, directed by a virus hidden in its hard drive, started searching the Internet for another computer.The laptop, supposedly in pristine, direct-from-the-factory condition, had instantly become part of an illegal global network capable of attacking Web sites, looting bank accounts and stealing personal data. For years, online investigators have warned consumers about the dangers of opening or downloading files sent by e-mail from unknown or suspicious sources. Now, they say, malicious software and computer code could be lurking on computers before the bubble wrap even comes off.The shopper in this case was part of a team of Microsoft researchers in China investigating the sale of counterfeit software. They suddenly had been introduced to malware called Nitol. The incident was described in court documents unsealed Thursday in a U.S. court in Virginia. The records describe a new front in a legal campaign against cybercrime being waged by Microsoft, the maker of the Windows operating system, which is the biggest target for viruses.The documents are part of a computer fraud lawsuit filed by Microsoft against a Web domain registered to a Chinese businessman named Peng Yong. The company says that domain is a focal point for illicit Internet activity. It is home base for Nitol and more than 500 other types of malware, making it the largest single repository of infected software that Microsoft executives have ever encountered.Mr. Peng, the owner of an Internet services company, said he was not aware of the Microsoft lawsuit and denied the allegations, saying his company did not tolerate improper conduct on the domain, 3322.org. Three other unidentified individuals accused by Microsoft of establishing and operating the Nitol network are also named in the suit.What emerges most vividly from the court records and interviews with Microsoft officials is a disturbing picture of how vulnerable Internet users have become, in part because of weaknesses in computer supply chains. To increase their profit margins, some computer manufacturers and retailers may use counterfeit copies of popular software products to build machines more cheaply. Plugging the holes is nearly impossible, especially in less regulated markets like China, and that creates opportunities for cybercriminals.''They're really changing the ways they try to attack you,'' said Richard Boscovich, a former U.S. government prosecutor and a senior attorney in Microsoft's digital crimes unit.And distance does not confer safety. Nitol, for example, is an aggressive virus found on computers in China, the United States, Russia, Australia and Germany. Microsoft has even identified servers in the Cayman Islands controlling Nitol- infected machines. All these compromised computers become part of a botnet -- a collection of compromised computers -- which is one of the most invasive and persistent tools of cybercrime.Nitol, meanwhile, appears poised to strike. Infection rates have peaked, according to Patrick Stratton, a senior manager in Microsoft's digital crimes unit who filed a document in the court case explaining Nitol and its connection to the 3322.org domain.For Microsoft, pursuing cybercriminals is a smart business. Its Windows operating system runs most of the computers connected to the Internet. Victims of malware are likely to believe their problems stem from Windows instead of a virus they are unaware of, and that damages the company's brand and reputation.But more than Microsoft's image is at stake when counterfeit products are tainted by rapidly spreading malware, Mr. Boscovich said. ''It's more than simply a traditional intellectual property issue,'' he said. ''It's now become a security issue.''The investigation by Microsoft's digital crimes unit began in August 2011 as a study into the sale and distribution of counterfeit versions of Windows. Microsoft employees in China bought 20 new computers from retailers and took them back to a home with an Internet connection.They found forged versions of Windows on all the machines and malware preinstalled on four. The one with Nitol, however, was the most alarming because the malware was active.''As soon as we powered on this particular computer, of its own accord without any instruction from us, it began reaching out across the Internet, attempting to contact a computer unfamiliar to us,'' Mr. Stratton said in the document filed with the court.Mr. Stratton and his colleagues also found Nitol to be highly contagious. They inserted a thumb drive into the computer and the virus immediately copied itself onto it. When the drive was inserted into a separate machine, Nitol quickly copied itself onto it.Microsoft examined thousands of samples of Nitol, which has several variants, and all of them connected to command-and-control servers associated with the 3322.org domain, according to the court records.''In short, 3322.org is a major hub of illegal Internet activity, used by criminals every minute of every day to pump malware and instructions to the computers of innocent people worldwide,'' Microsoft said in its lawsuit.Mr. Peng, the registered owner of 3322.org, said he had ''zero tolerance'' for the misuse of domain names and worked with Chinese law enforcement whenever there were complaints. Still, he said, his huge customer base made policing difficult.''Our policy unequivocally opposes the use of any of our domain names for malicious purposes,'' Mr. Peng said in a private chat via Sina Weibo, a service like Twitter that is popular in China. ''We currently have 2.85 million domain names and cannot exclude that individual users might be using domain names for malicious purposes.''But past warnings by other online security firms have been ignored by Mr. Peng, Mr. Boscovich said. The 3322.org domain accounted for more than 17 percent of malicious Web transactions worldwide in 2009, according to Zscaler, a computer security firm in San Jose, California. In 2008, the Russian security company Kaspersky Lab reported that 40 percent of all malware programs linked, at one point or another, to 3322.org.Judge Gerald Bruce Lee of U.S. District Court, who is presiding in the case, granted a request from Microsoft to begin steering Internet traffic that has been infected by Nitol and other malware away from 3322.org to a special site called a sinkhole. From there, Microsoft can alert affected computer users to update their anti-virus protection and remove Nitol from their machines.Since Judge Lee issued the order, more than 37 million malware connections have been blocked from 3322.org, according to Microsoft.

10 Arrested In Theft Of Web Data,"International authorities, with some help from Facebook, have arrested 10 people accused of operating a network of infected computers that stole personal information from millions of victims.The Justice Department said Tuesday night that the F.B.I. and international agencies were helped in their investigations by Facebook, whose users were among those targeted by the malware, or malicious software, over the last several years.The agencies arrested people from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Britain, Croatia, Macedonia, New Zealand, Peru and the United States, the F.B.I. said. The suspects used a chain of infected computers to form what was known as the Butterfly botnet, which spread a piece of malicious software called Yahos, officials said. Versions of the software have long been trafficked among criminals who spread it over social networks and by other means, compromising the security of infected PCs and letting criminals steal personal data, including credit card numbers.In a statement, the Justice Department said variants of this kind of software had infected about 11 million computers and caused more than $850 million in losses. A Justice Department official said those figures referred to the cumulative damage from the long-running problem, not a measure of the damage done by the people who were arrested.Mark Hammell, Facebook's Internet threat researcher, said the company had begun investigating suspicious behavior on its service two years ago. The malware had hijacked some users' accounts and posted links on their friends' Facebook pages. A person who clicked on those links could download the software and infect his computer.Facebook's researchers reverse-engineered the software to understand how it worked, and eventually traced some of its activities to computer servers controlled by the suspects. That helped Facebook determine the identities of some of the people involved in the crime ring, Mr. Hammell said.''We realized we didn't have the ability to stop it completely, and at that point, we decided the best response was to escalate this to law enforcement,'' he said in an interview. Two of the people who were arrested were the original authors of the malware, he noted. Facebook said its users made up only a small percentage of those who were infected.Security firms and social networks are generally on the lookout for this particular form of malware, and software to detect and eliminate it has been available for years. The Justice Department urged computer users to take common-sense measures, like antivirus scanning, to guard against the risk of infections, and said people who suspect they have been victimized should file a complaint with the F.B.I.'s Internet crime complaint center at ic3.gov.Facebook said users who were concerned about being infected could check their computers at on.fb.me/infectedMSE. The malware does not infect Apple computers, Facebook said.Manos Antonakakis, director of academic research at Damballa, a company that specializes in fighting botnets, said the size of the Butterfly botnet was significant. It was more than double the size of the last major botnet that authorities took down last November, one that used a piece of malware called DNSChanger that had infected an estimated four million computers.''This is a major achievement for law enforcement,'' he said, ''and we look forward to many things like this, so we can effectively tackle emerging botnets out there.''But Dr. Antonakakis said the estimate of 11 million infected machines was probably high, because a computer could be counted as a new device each time it connected to a different network, like the Wi-Fi at a Starbucks or a home router.The $850 million figure may also be high given that credit card companies typically wipe out fraudulent charges.Peter G. Neumann, principal scientist at SRI International, an engineering research laboratory, was less excited about the arrests. He said that defeating this particular botnet did not solve the fundamental problem of computer security being too weak. Anybody could easily take the same software and create the botnet again, he said.''You're solving a problem that wouldn't exist if the systems were designed properly,'' he said. "
"Convenient, but How Secure?","According to a survey commissioned by the American Bankers Association last year, 62 percent of Americans preferred to do their banking online rather than at a branch or ATM. Banks and their online customers also lost more than $2 billion in 2010 because of payment card scams, fraudulent wire transfers and other Internet swindles, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as reported by The Financial Times. Losses have declined from their peak of $8 billion in 2006, as banks have gotten better at preventing fraud. But criminals aren't giving up and regulators have decided that current security systems based on passwords, tokens and cookies aren't strong enough.Starting this month, they want financial institutions to add a new layer that detects unusual patterns of activity -- like a volley of transfers to an account in Russia -- in real time. Too many banks are not yet up to speed with the new guidelines. Regulations limit losses for individual victims of a cyberstrike to $500, forcing the bank to cover the balance. But businesses are not covered, and small companies are especially vulnerable because they move more cash around than individuals and cannot afford high-technology defenses.New malware has been designed to get around the security fixes of recent years. Qakbot, which has been infecting computers since 2009, downloads from infected Web sites and piggy backs on legitimate online transactions to evade the security provided by one-time, changing passwords. The Zeus trojan propagates through spam and is estimated to have infected 3.6 million computers in the United States. It waits for users to log on to their bank accounts and steals their information as they type it. It can even replace the bank's Web pages with its own on the victim's browser to entice the user to divulge even more information.If the new guidelines fail to stem the tide of online fraud, regulators have suggested additional possible measures: Banks could require customers to authorize transactions through two devices, like a computer and a phone; they could limit the size or number of transactions allowed; and they could block connection to bank servers from unknown or suspect Internet addresses.Regulators will need to push bankers to improve security, especially at community and regional banks whose systems lag far behind those at large multinational institutions. The safety instructions are guidelines -- not make-or-break rules -- that will figure among many others when regulators evaluate the general safety and soundness of banks' operations. That may not be enough.The Financial Times reported that a poll of bankers done by a bank technology firm in November suggested that 40 percent of banks weren't even aware that regulators want them to adopt new measures to detect anomalous online transactions.

Taxpayers Warned to Beware of E-Mails From I.R.S.,"Tax season is finally coming to a close: Tuesday is the deadline for filing your federal income tax return.While the Internal Revenue Service encourages electronic filing of returns, it doesn't yet make use of e-mail or social media tools to begin communication with taxpayers, because of security concerns.The agency says that is important to keep in mind in light of recent tax-related phishing schemes that try to lure taxpayers into visiting fictitious Web sites and providing sensitive financial information.Earlier this year, for instance, a phishing scam sent out e-mails purporting to be from the I.R.S., announcing a fake ""early filing"" deadline and high penalty for missing it. The e-mail directed users to a bogus Web site that tried to mimic the official I.R.S. site, and asked them for personal and financial information, like bank account numbers and birth dates.In response, the I.R.S. emphasizes that it ""does not initiate contact with taxpayers by e-mail or any social media tools to request personal or financial information."" Further, it says, the agency doesn't ""send e-mails stating you are being electronically audited or that you are getting a refund.""""This includes any type of electronic communication, such as text messages and social media channels,"" the agency says.So what should you doif you get a suspicious e-mail that claims to be from the I.R.S.?Don't reply to the e-mail, the agency advises. And don't click on any links included in the message, or open any attachments. Doing so can make your computer vulnerable to viruses or other attacks. Rather, forward the e-mail, as is, to phishing@irs.gov Then delete the e-mail from your account.Similarly, if you discover a Web site that appears to be fraudulent, you can send the url to the same e-mail address.Have you ever received suspicious e-mails that appeared to be from the I.R.S.?

Daily Report: First Step in Overhaul of E-Mail Privacy Law,"   The Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill on Thursday that would strengthen privacy protection for e-mails, Charlie Savage reports on Friday in The New York Times. The bill would require law enforcement officials to obtain a warrant from a judge in most cases before gaining access to messages stored in individual accounts. The bill is not expected to make it through Congress this year and will be the subject of negotiations next year with the Republican-led House. But the Senate panel's approval was a first step toward an overhaul of a 1986 law that governs e-mail access and that is widely seen as outdated.Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the committee, was an architect of the 1986 law and is leading the effort to remake it. He said at the meeting on Thursday that e-mails stored by third parties should receive the same protection as papers stored in a filing cabinet in an individual's house.""Like many Americans, I am concerned about the growing and unwelcome intrusions into our private lives in cyberspace,"" Mr. Leahy said. ""I also understand that we must update our digital privacy laws to keep pace with the rapid advances in technology.""Mr. Leahy held a hearing about two years ago on whether and how to update the 1986 law, called the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. But the effort has moved slowly, in part because some law enforcement officials have opposed restricting an investigative tool now used increasingly. "
"Cisco to Buy NDS, a Video Services Firm, for $5 Billion","6:43 p.m. | Updated Cisco Systems said on Thursday that it planned to buy the NDS Group, a provider of content streaming and security software, for about $5 billion to help expand its next-generation video services.By buying NDS, which has  British Sky Broadcasting and DirecTV among its customers, Cisco is hoping to augment its Videoscape streaming platform. The company has been focusing on its video offerings as it works to bolster lagging growth in its core networks business.NDS, which is owned by the private equity firm Permira and the media giant News Corporation, focuses on providing systems that let companies stream content to a variety of devices. Among its biggest attractions is its content protection, which is important to media companies.The transaction represents a sizable return for Permira, one of Europe's largest private equity firms. It bought NDS with News Corporation in 2009 for $3.6 billion. Since then, the software company has sold off noncore businesses and expanded into fast-growing markets like China and India.Permira is expected to make roughly $2 billion on the sale, based on calculations from regulatory filings by NDS. That would more than double the private equity firm's initial $900 million investment three years ago.The sale to Cisco also represents a shift in strategy. Late last year, NDS announced plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange through an initial public offering, which was expected to raise up to $100 million. Yet despite renewed optimism in the United States financial markets, Permira and News Corporation have decided to sell the company to an industry buyer.The deal is Cisco's biggest since the company acquired Tandberg, another video company, for about $3 billion in 2009.""Our strategy has always been driven by customer need and on capturing market transitions,"" John T. Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, said in a statement. ""Our acquisition of NDS fits squarely into this strategy, enabling content and service providers to deliver new video solutions that leverage the cloud and drive new monetization opportunities and service differentiation.""NDS, based in Staines, England, has about 5,000 employees and has operations in five countries. Its chairman, Abe Peled, will become a senior vice president and chief strategist for Cisco's video and collaboration group.Cisco was advised by JPMorgan Chase and Centerview Partners and the law firm Fenwick & West, while NDS was advised by the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.

The Boom in Enterprise I.P.O.'s,"David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News While the impending giant public offering of Facebook gets most of the attention, enterprise technology companies keep attracting the money. On Friday, Proofpoint, a maker of corporate security software, began trading at $16.85 a share, 30 percent above its initial public offering price of $13. The stock was expected to price in the $10 to $12 a share range. Another company, the network software maker Infoblox, opened at $22.57, about 40 percent above its $16 IPO price. Infoblox had an expected initial public stock offering price of $12 to $14.On Thursday, Splunk, a data analysis company, had its debut. It closed at $35.48 a share, up 109 percent from an IPO price of $17. Splunk initially expected to price at $8 to $10, before that range was increased to $11 to $13.You may not have heard of Proofpoint, Infoblox or Splunk, and that may be the point: as we have written before, the low-profile companies that sell to businesses generally perform better than the companies that count on the loyalty of a fickle public for revenues. The game maker Zynga is flat from its December opening, while the corporate collaboration software maker Jive Software is up 70 percent over about the same period. A security company named Impervia is up 67 percent since its initial offering in November; Groupon, which came out a few weeks later, is off 56 percent.Many of the consumer companies have much larger market capitalizations than the enterprise companies, so one-to-one comparisons can deceive. Even after their initial pops, all three of this week's enterprise initial offerings will together have a market capitalization less than 10 percent of the $100 billion that Facebook is expected to garner next month.A somewhat larger enterprise company, Palo Alto Networks, is expected to go out next week. The biggest enterprise I.P.O. of the year, among start-ups, will probably be Workday, some time in the summer. Even these will be dwarfed by Facebook. That doesn't matter to an investor who got in early on an enterprise stock, however. Upside is upside.There are probably 10 more big tech initial public offerings coming this year, said  John Connors, a partner at Ignition Partners in Seattle, and an investor and board member in Splunk. He cited ServiceNow, which automates corporate information technology processes; INRIX, a provider of traffic information; and Tableau, an analytics and business intelligence providerbased in Seattle.""The last 10 years have been consumer tech successes, companies like Google, and Yahoo compared with its opening price, or Amazon and Apple,"" Mr. Connors said. ""Now a lot of the approach to computing from open source is finding its way to reforming business, and that market is enormous.""Enterprise companies tend to be attacking big, established markets where revenues are dependable. Online consumer companies are big and flashy, but they generally stake out new territory that is harder to value. The hype can easily outrun the real revenues. "
Bank Data-Theft Suspect Allowed Out of Jail,"MADRID -- The Spanish National Court on Tuesday granted conditional freedom to a former HSBC employee wanted by the Swiss authorities in the theft of secret data on tens of thousands of private bank accounts. The former employee, Hervé Falciani, a French-Italian citizen, was arrested in July in Barcelona on an international warrant after the Swiss accused him of stealing the data and breaching the country's banking secrecy laws. He had previously fled Switzerland for France, which bought the data from Mr. Falciani and distributed relevant parts of it to countries including Germany, Spain and the United States.The National Court ordered Mr. Falciani's release from a Madrid jail because he had already been held there for several months and it could still take a considerable length of time to rule on the extradition request. Mr. Falciani will have to report to the Spanish police every three days and his passport has been confiscated.Mr. Falciani is alleged to have stolen the customer data five years ago, while working in the information technology department of HSBC's private banking subsidiary in Geneva.Switzerland's extradition request presented a dilemma for Spain, given that the Spanish authorities had used the HSBC data against holders of secret bank accounts including Emilio Botín, the chairman of Banco Santander, and 11 relatives.The National Court eventually closed the case against the Botíns without filing any charges because the family had normalized its tax situation before the fraud investigation was announced. People close to the family said the Botíns paid about &#x20ac;200 million, or $265 million, in back taxes. "
Obama Order Sped Up Wave Of Cyberattacks Against Iran,"This article is adapted from ''Confront and Conceal: Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power,'' to be published by Crown on Tuesday.WASHINGTON -- From his first months in office, President Obama secretly ordered increasingly sophisticated attacks on the computer systems that run Iran's main nuclear enrichment facilities, significantly expanding America's first sustained use of cyberweapons, according to participants in the program.Mr. Obama decided to accelerate the attacks -- begun in the Bush administration and code-named Olympic Games -- even after an element of the program accidentally became public in the summer of 2010 because of a programming error that allowed it to escape Iran's Natanz plant and sent it around the world on the Internet. Computer security experts who began studying the worm, which had been developed by the United States and Israel, gave it a name: Stuxnet.At a tense meeting in the White House Situation Room within days of the worm's ''escape,'' Mr. Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, Leon E. Panetta, considered whether America's most ambitious attempt to slow the progress of Iran's nuclear efforts had been fatally compromised.''Should we shut this thing down?'' Mr. Obama asked, according to members of the president's national security team who were in the room. Told it was unclear how much the Iranians knew about the code, and offered evidence that it was still causing havoc, Mr. Obama decided that the cyberattacks should proceed. In the following weeks, the Natanz plant was hit by a newer version of the computer worm, and then another after that. The last of that series of attacks, a few weeks after Stuxnet was detected around the world, temporarily took out nearly 1,000 of the 5,000 centrifuges Iran had spinning at the time to purify uranium.This account of the American and Israeli effort to undermine the Iranian nuclear program is based on interviews over the past 18 months with current and former American, European and Israeli officials involved in the program, as well as a range of outside experts. None would allow their names to be used because the effort remains highly classified, and parts of it continue to this day.These officials gave differing assessments of how successful the sabotage program was in slowing Iran's progress toward developing the ability to build nuclear weapons. Internal Obama administration estimates say the effort was set back by 18 months to two years, but some experts inside and outside the government are more skeptical, noting that Iran's enrichment levels have steadily recovered, giving the country enough fuel today for five or more weapons, with additional enrichment.Whether Iran is still trying to design and build a weapon is in dispute. The most recent United States intelligence estimate concludes that Iran suspended major parts of its weaponization effort after 2003, though there is evidence that some remnants of it continue.Iran initially denied that its enrichment facilities had been hit by Stuxnet, then said it had found the worm and contained it. Last year, the nation announced that it had begun its own military cyberunit, and Brig. Gen. Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's Passive Defense Organization, said that the Iranian military was prepared ''to fight our enemies'' in ''cyberspace and Internet warfare.'' But there has been scant evidence that it has begun to strike back.The United States government only recently acknowledged developing cyberweapons, and it has never admitted using them. There have been reports of one-time attacks against personal computers used by members of Al Qaeda, and of contemplated attacks against the computers that run air defense systems, including during the NATO-led air attack on Libya last year. But Olympic Games was of an entirely different type and sophistication.It appears to be the first time the United States has repeatedly used cyberweapons to cripple another country's infrastructure, achieving, with computer code, what until then could be accomplished only by bombing a country or sending in agents to plant explosives. The code itself is 50 times as big as the typical computer worm, Carey Nachenberg, a vice president of Symantec, one of the many groups that have dissected the code, said at a symposium at Stanford University in April. Those forensic investigations into the inner workings of the code, while picking apart how it worked, came to no conclusions about who was responsible.A similar process is now under way to figure out the origins of another cyberweapon called Flame that was recently discovered to have attacked the computers of Iranian officials, sweeping up information from those machines. But the computer code appears to be at least five years old, and American officials say that it was not part of Olympic Games. They have declined to say whether the United States was responsible for the Flame attack.Mr. Obama, according to participants in the many Situation Room meetings on Olympic Games, was acutely aware that with every attack he was pushing the United States into new territory, much as his predecessors had with the first use of atomic weapons in the 1940s, of intercontinental missiles in the 1950s and of drones in the past decade. He repeatedly expressed concerns that any American acknowledgment that it was using cyberweapons -- even under the most careful and limited circumstances -- could enable other countries, terrorists or hackers to justify their own attacks.''We discussed the irony, more than once,'' one of his aides said. Another said that the administration was resistant to developing a ''grand theory for a weapon whose possibilities they were still discovering.'' Yet Mr. Obama concluded that when it came to stopping Iran, the United States had no other choice.If Olympic Games failed, he told aides, there would be no time for sanctions and diplomacy with Iran to work. Israel could carry out a conventional military attack, prompting a conflict that could spread throughout the region.A Bush InitiativeThe impetus for Olympic Games dates from 2006, when President George W. Bush saw few good options in dealing with Iran. At the time, America's European allies were divided about the cost that imposing sanctions on Iran would have on their own economies. Having falsely accused Saddam Hussein of reconstituting his nuclear program in Iraq, Mr. Bush had little credibility in publicly discussing another nation's nuclear ambitions. The Iranians seemed to sense his vulnerability, and, frustrated by negotiations, they resumed enriching uranium at an underground site at Natanz, one whose existence had been exposed just three years before.Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, took reporters on a tour of the plant and described grand ambitions to install upward of 50,000 centrifuges. For a country with only one nuclear power reactor -- whose fuel comes from Russia -- to say that it needed fuel for its civilian nuclear program seemed dubious to Bush administration officials. They feared that the fuel could be used in another way besides providing power: to create a stockpile that could later be enriched to bomb-grade material if the Iranians made a political decision to do so.Hawks in the Bush administration like Vice President Dick Cheney urged Mr. Bush to consider a military strike against the Iranian nuclear facilities before they could produce fuel suitable for a weapon. Several times, the administration reviewed military options and concluded that they would only further inflame a region already at war, and would have uncertain results.For years the C.I.A. had introduced faulty parts and designs into Iran's systems -- even tinkering with imported power supplies so that they would blow up -- but the sabotage had had relatively little effect. General James E. Cartwright, who had established a small cyberoperation inside the United States Strategic Command, which is responsible for many of America's nuclear forces, joined intelligence officials in presenting a radical new idea to Mr. Bush and his national security team. It involved a far more sophisticated cyberweapon than the United States had designed before.The goal was to gain access to the Natanz plant's industrial computer controls. That required leaping the electronic moat that cut the Natanz plant off from the Internet -- called the air gap, because it physically separates the facility from the outside world. The computer code would invade the specialized computers that command the centrifuges.The first stage in the effort was to develop a bit of computer code called a beacon that could be inserted into the computers, which were made by the German company Siemens and an Iranian manufacturer, to map their operations. The idea was to draw the equivalent of an electrical blueprint of the Natanz plant, to understand how the computers control the giant silvery centrifuges that spin at tremendous speeds. The connections were complex, and unless every circuit was understood, efforts to seize control of the centrifuges could fail.Eventually the beacon would have to ''phone home'' -- literally send a message back to the headquarters of the National Security Agency that would describe the structure and daily rhythms of the enrichment plant. Expectations for the plan were low; one participant said the goal was simply to ''throw a little sand in the gears'' and buy some time. Mr. Bush was skeptical, but lacking other options, he authorized the effort.Breakthrough, Aided by IsraelIt took months for the beacons to do their work and report home, complete with maps of the electronic directories of the controllers and what amounted to blueprints of how they were connected to the centrifuges deep underground.Then the N.S.A. and a secret Israeli unit respected by American intelligence officials for its cyberskills set to work developing the enormously complex computer worm that would become the attacker from within.The unusually tight collaboration with Israel was driven by two imperatives. Israel's Unit 8200, a part of its military, had technical expertise that rivaled the N.S.A.'s, and the Israelis had deep intelligence about operations at Natanz that would be vital to making the cyberattack a success. But American officials had another interest, to dissuade the Israelis from carrying out their own pre-emptive strike against the Iranian nuclear facilities. To do that, the Israelis would have to be convinced that the new line of attack was working. The only way to convince them, several officials said in interviews, was to have them deeply involved in every aspect of the program.Soon the two countries had developed a complex worm that the Americans called ''the bug.'' But the bug needed to be tested. So, under enormous secrecy, the United States began building replicas of Iran's P-1 centrifuges, an aging, unreliable design that Iran purchased from Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani nuclear chief who had begun selling fuel-making technology on the black market. Fortunately for the United States, it already owned some P-1s, thanks to the Libyan dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.When Colonel Qaddafi gave up his nuclear weapons program in 2003, he turned over the centrifuges he had bought from the Pakistani nuclear ring, and they were placed in storage at a weapons laboratory in Tennessee. The military and intelligence officials overseeing Olympic Games borrowed some for what they termed ''destructive testing,'' essentially building a virtual replica of Natanz, but spreading the test over several of the Energy Department's national laboratories to keep even the most trusted nuclear workers from figuring out what was afoot.Those first small-scale tests were surprisingly successful: the bug invaded the computers, lurking for days or weeks, before sending instructions to speed them up or slow them down so suddenly that their delicate parts, spinning at supersonic speeds, self-destructed. After several false starts, it worked. One day, toward the end of Mr. Bush's term, the rubble of a centrifuge was spread out on the conference table in the Situation Room, proof of the potential power of a cyberweapon. The worm was declared ready to test against the real target: Iran's underground enrichment plant.''Previous cyberattacks had effects limited to other computers,'' Michael V. Hayden, the former chief of the C.I.A., said, declining to describe what he knew of these attacks when he was in office. ''This is the first attack of a major nature in which a cyberattack was used to effect physical destruction,'' rather than just slow another computer, or hack into it to steal data.''Somebody crossed the Rubicon,'' he said.Getting the worm into Natanz, however, was no easy trick. The United States and Israel would have to rely on engineers, maintenance workers and others -- both spies and unwitting accomplices -- with physical access to the plant. ''That was our holy grail,'' one of the architects of the plan said. ''It turns out there is always an idiot around who doesn't think much about the thumb drive in their hand.''In fact, thumb drives turned out to be critical in spreading the first variants of the computer worm; later, more sophisticated methods were developed to deliver the malicious code.The first attacks were small, and when the centrifuges began spinning out of control in 2008, the Iranians were mystified about the cause, according to intercepts that the United States later picked up. ''The thinking was that the Iranians would blame bad parts, or bad engineering, or just incompetence,'' one of the architects of the early attack said.The Iranians were confused partly because no two attacks were exactly alike. Moreover, the code would lurk inside the plant for weeks, recording normal operations; when it attacked, it sent signals to the Natanz control room indicating that everything downstairs was operating normally. ''This may have been the most brilliant part of the code,'' one American official said.Later, word circulated through the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog, that the Iranians had grown so distrustful of their own instruments that they had assigned people to sit in the plant and radio back what they saw.''The intent was that the failures should make them feel they were stupid, which is what happened,'' the participant in the attacks said. When a few centrifuges failed, the Iranians would close down whole ''stands'' that linked 164 machines, looking for signs of sabotage in all of them. ''They overreacted,'' one official said. ''We soon discovered they fired people.''Imagery recovered by nuclear inspectors from cameras at Natanz -- which the nuclear agency uses to keep track of what happens between visits -- showed the results. There was some evidence of wreckage, but it was clear that the Iranians had also carted away centrifuges that had previously appeared to be working well.But by the time Mr. Bush left office, no wholesale destruction had been accomplished. Meeting with Mr. Obama in the White House days before his inauguration, Mr. Bush urged him to preserve two classified programs, Olympic Games and the drone program in Pakistan. Mr. Obama took Mr. Bush's advice.The Stuxnet SurpriseMr. Obama came to office with an interest in cyberissues, but he had discussed them during the campaign mostly in terms of threats to personal privacy and the risks to infrastructure like the electrical grid and the air traffic control system. He commissioned a major study on how to improve America's defenses and announced it with great fanfare in the East Room.What he did not say then was that he was also learning the arts of cyberwar. The architects of Olympic Games would meet him in the Situation Room, often with what they called the ''horse blanket,'' a giant foldout schematic diagram of Iran's nuclear production facilities. Mr. Obama authorized the attacks to continue, and every few weeks -- certainly after a major attack -- he would get updates and authorize the next step. Sometimes it was a strike riskier and bolder than what had been tried previously.''From his first days in office, he was deep into every step in slowing the Iranian program -- the diplomacy, the sanctions, every major decision,'' a senior administration official said. ''And it's safe to say that whatever other activity might have been under way was no exception to that rule.''But the good luck did not last. In the summer of 2010, shortly after a new variant of the worm had been sent into Natanz, it became clear that the worm, which was never supposed to leave the Natanz machines, had broken free, like a zoo animal that found the keys to the cage. It fell to Mr. Panetta and two other crucial players in Olympic Games -- General Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Michael J. Morell, the deputy director of the C.I.A. -- to break the news to Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden.An error in the code, they said, had led it to spread to an engineer's computer when it was hooked up to the centrifuges. When the engineer left Natanz and connected the computer to the Internet, the American- and Israeli-made bug failed to recognize that its environment had changed. It began replicating itself all around the world. Suddenly, the code was exposed, though its intent would not be clear, at least to ordinary computer users.''We think there was a modification done by the Israelis,'' one of the briefers told the president, ''and we don't know if we were part of that activity.''Mr. Obama, according to officials in the room, asked a series of questions, fearful that the code could do damage outside the plant. The answers came back in hedged terms. Mr. Biden fumed. ''It's got to be the Israelis,'' he said. ''They went too far.''In fact, both the Israelis and the Americans had been aiming for a particular part of the centrifuge plant, a critical area whose loss, they had concluded, would set the Iranians back considerably. It is unclear who introduced the programming error.The question facing Mr. Obama was whether the rest of Olympic Games was in jeopardy, now that a variant of the bug was replicating itself ''in the wild,'' where computer security experts can dissect it and figure out its purpose.''I don't think we have enough information,'' Mr. Obama told the group that day, according to the officials. But in the meantime, he ordered that the cyberattacks continue. They were his best hope of disrupting the Iranian nuclear program unless economic sanctions began to bite harder and reduced Iran's oil revenues.Within a week, another version of the bug brought down just under 1,000 centrifuges. Olympic Games was still on.A Weapon's Uncertain FutureAmerican cyberattacks are not limited to Iran, but the focus of attention, as one administration official put it, ''has been overwhelmingly on one country.'' There is no reason to believe that will remain the case for long. Some officials question why the same techniques have not been used more aggressively against North Korea. Others see chances to disrupt Chinese military plans, forces in Syria on the way to suppress the uprising there, and Qaeda operations around the world. ''We've considered a lot more attacks than we have gone ahead with,'' one former intelligence official said.Mr. Obama has repeatedly told his aides that there are risks to using -- and particularly to overusing -- the weapon. In fact, no country's infrastructure is more dependent on computer systems, and thus more vulnerable to attack, than that of the United States. It is only a matter of time, most experts believe, before it becomes the target of the same kind of weapon that the Americans have used, secretly, against Iran. "
Expert Issues A Cyberwar Warning,"MOSCOW -- When Eugene Kaspersky, the founder of Europe's largest antivirus company, discovered the Flame virus that is afflicting computers in Iran and the Middle East, he recognized it as a technologically sophisticated virus that only a government could create.He also recognized that the virus, which he compares to the Stuxnet virus built by programmers employed by the United States and Israel, adds weight to his warnings of the grave dangers posed by governments that manufacture and release viruses on the Internet.''Cyberweapons are the most dangerous innovation of this century,'' he told a gathering of technology company executives, called the CeBIT conference, last month in Sydney, Australia. While the United States and Israel are using the weapons to slow the nuclear bomb-making abilities of Iran, they could also be used to disrupt power grids and financial systems or even wreak havoc with military defenses. Computer security companies have for years used their discovery of a new virus or worm to call attention to themselves and win more business from companies seeking computer protection. Mr. Kaspersky, a Russian computer security expert, and his company, Kaspersky Lab, are no different in that regard. But he is also using his company's integral role in exposing or decrypting three computer viruses apparently intended to slow or halt Iran's nuclear program to argue for an international treaty banning computer warfare.A growing array of nations and other entities are using online weapons, he says, because they are ''thousands of times cheaper'' than conventional armaments.While antivirus companies might catch some, he says, only an international treaty that would ban militaries and spy agencies from making viruses will truly solve the problem.The wide disclosure of the details of the Flame virus by Kaspersky Lab also seems intended to promote the Russian call for a ban on cyberweapons like those that blocked poison gas or expanding bullets from the armies of major nations and other entities.And that puts the Russian company in a difficult position because it already faces suspicions that it is tied to the Russian government, accusations Mr. Kaspersky has constantly denied as he has built his business.While Russian officials have not commented on the discovery of Flame, the Russian minister of telecommunications gave a speech, also in May, calling for an international cyberweapon ban. Russia has also pushed for a bilateral treaty with the United States.The United States has agreed to discuss such a disarmament treaty with the Russians, but has also tried to encourage Russia to prosecute online crime, which flourishes in this country.The United States has long objected to the Russian crusade for an online arms control ban. ''There is no broad international support for a cyberweapon ban,'' says James A. Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''This is a global diplomatic ploy by the Russians to take down a perceived area of U.S. military advantage.''Russia, many security experts note, has been accused of using cyberwarfare in disputes with Estonia and wars in Georgia.Mr. Kaspersky said that at no point did he cooperate with the Federal Security Agency, the successor agency to the K.G.B., as the Flame virus was not a threat to Russian citizens.Kaspersky Lab, he said, felt justified exposing the Flame virus because the company was working under the auspices of a United Nations agency. But the company has been noticeably silent on viruses perpetrated in its own backyard, where Russian-speaking criminal syndicates controlled a third of the estimated $12 billion global cybercrime market last year, according to the Russian security firm Group-IB.Some say there is good reason. ''He's got family,'' said Sean Sullivan, an adviser at F-Secure, a computer security firm in Helsinki. ''I wouldn't expect them to be the most aggressive about publicizing threats in their neighborhood for fear those neighbors would retaliate.''Last year, Mr. Kaspersky's 19-year-old son was kidnapped by criminals demanding a ransom. The kidnappers did not appear to have ties to any of Russia's online criminal syndicates, but Mr. Sullivan says, ''It was probably a wake-up call.''Some computer security firms say Mr. Kaspersky's researchers have hyped Flame. It is too early, his critics say, to call the virus a ''cyberweapon'' and to suggest it was sponsored by a state.Joe Jaroch, a vice president at Webroot, an antivirus maker, says he first encountered a sample of Flame in 2007. He says he did not publicize the discovery because he did not consider the code sophisticated. ''There are many more dangerous viruses out there,'' he said. ''I would be shocked if this was the work of a nation state.''Mr. Sullivan, from F-Secure, said: ''It's interesting and complex, but not sleek and stealthy. It could be the work of a military contractor -- Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and other contractors are developing programs like these for different intelligence services. To call it a cyberweapon says more about Kaspersky's cold war mentality than anything else. It has to be taken with a grain of salt.''Whether the skepticism is authentic or professional jealousy, no one doubts the Kaspersky Lab's skills. Mr. Kaspersky studied cryptography at a high school that was co-sponsored by the K.G.B. and Russia's ministry of defense, and later took a job with the Russian military. He started tracking computer viruses as a side project in 1989, after his work PC was infected with one. In 1997, he co-founded Kaspersky Lab with his wife at the time, Natalya, in their Moscow apartment.The headquarters of the team that unraveled Flame is an open-plan office of cubicles overlooking a park on the edge of Moscow. Mr. Kaspersky eschews suits and his researchers wear Converse shoes and tattered jeans, much as their counterparts in the United States do. A Darth Vader mask adorns one desk.Talent also abounds. The Belarussian virus hunter who first found the Stuxnet virus in 2010, Sergei Ulasen, now works for Kaspersky Lab.Today, the company is one of Russia's most recognizable exports. It commands 8 percent of the world's software security market for businesses, with revenue reaching $612 million last year.Yet Mr. Kaspersky says he often has to dispute suggested ties to Russia's security services. Analysts say suspicions about the firm's Russian roots have hindered its expansion abroad.''The U.S. government, defense contractors and lots of U.S. companies won't work with them,'' said Peter Firstbrook, director of malware research at Gartner, a research firm. ''There's no evidence that they have any back doors in their software or any ties to the Russian mafia or state. It's a red herring, but there is still a concern that you can't operate in Russia without being controlled by the ruling party.''Mr. Kaspersky said his company tackled Flame upon the request of the International Telecommunication Union, an agency of the United Nations. He assigned about three dozen engineers to investigate a virus that was erasing files on computers at Iran's oil ministry. Kaspersky researchers, some of whom had analyzed suspected United States and Israeli viruses that destroyed centrifuges in Iran's nuclear program two years earlier, were already following up on complaints from Iranian clients that Kaspersky's antivirus software was not catching a new type of malware on their systems, Kaspersky officials said.''We saw an unusual structure of the code, compressed and encrypted in several ways,'' Vitaly Kamlyuk, a researcher on the team that cracked the virus.It was the first virus to look for Bluetooth-enabled devices in the vicinity, either to spread to those devices, map a user's social or professional circle, or steal information from them. The program also contained a command called ''microbe'' that silently turned on users' microphones to record their conversations and sent audio files back to the attackers. It was clearly not a virus made by criminals.''Antivirus companies are in a not easy situation,'' Mr. Kaspersky said. ''We have to protect our customers everywhere in the world. On the other hand, we understand there are quite serious powers behind these viruses.''Even though finding viruses first is usually a boon for antivirus companies, cracking Flame, Mr. Kaspersky said, might hurt his business in one regard. ''For the next five years, we can forget about government contracts in the United States.'' "
Google Issues New Warning for State-Sponsored Attacks,"Starting Tuesday, look out for an unusual warning atop your Gmail inbox, Google home page or Chrome browser. It will not mince words: ""Warning: We believe state-sponsored attackers may be attempting to compromise your account or computer.""Google said it planned to issue the warning anytime it picks up malicious--possibly state-sponsored--activity on a user's account or computer. How does Google know whether an attack is state-sponsored? It won't say.""We can't go into the details without giving away information that would be helpful to these bad actors, but our detailed analysis-as well as victim reports-strongly suggest the involvement of states or groups that are state-sponsored,"" Eric Grosse, Google's vice president of security engineering, wrote in a blog post.The announcement is timed just one week after security researchers discovered Flame, a massive, data-mining virus, had been spying on computers in the Middle East-- predominantly in Iran-- for at least the last four years.Researchers say they believe the Flame virus is sponsored by the same entity that commissioned Stuxnet, a virus co-sponsored by the United States and Israel, that destroyed thousands of Iranian centrifuges in 2010.

"In Attack on Vatican Web Site, A Glimpse of Hackers' Tactics","SAN FRANCISCO -- The elusive hacker movement known as Anonymous has carried out Internet attacks on well-known organizations like Sony and PBS. In August, the group went after its most prominent target yet: the Vatican.The campaign against the Vatican, which did not receive wide attention at the time, involved hundreds of people, some with hacking skills and some without. A core group of participants openly drummed up support for the attack using YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. Others searched for vulnerabilities on a Vatican Web site and, when that failed, enlisted amateur recruits to flood the site with traffic, hoping it would crash, according to a computer security firm's report to be released this week.The attack, albeit an unsuccessful one, provides a rare glimpse into the recruiting, reconnaissance and warfare tactics used by the shadowy hacking collective.Anonymous, which first gained widespread notice with an attack on the Church of Scientology in 2008, has since carried out hundreds of increasingly bold strikes, taking aim at perceived enemies including law enforcement agencies, Internet security companies and opponents of the whistle-blower site WikiLeaks. The group's attack on the Vatican was confirmed by the hackers and is detailed in a report that Imperva, a computer security company based in Redwood City, Calif., plans to release ahead of a computer security conference here this week. It may be the first end-to-end record of a full Anonymous attack.Though Imperva declined to identify the target of the attack and kept any mention of the Vatican out of its report, two people briefed on the investigation confirmed that it had been the target. Imperva had a unique window into the situation because it had been hired by the Vatican's security team as a subcontractor to block and record the assault.''We have seen the tools and the techniques that were used in this attack used by other criminal groups on the Web,'' said Amichai Shulman, Imperva's chief technology officer. ''What set this attack apart from others is it had a clear timeline and evolution, starting from an announcement and recruitment phase that was very public.''The Vatican declined to comment on the attack. In an e-mail intended for a colleague but accidentally sent to a reporter, a church official wrote: ''I do not think it is convenient to respond to journalists on real or potential attacks,'' adding, ''The more we are silent in this area the better.''The attack was called Operation Pharisee in a reference to the sect that Jesus called hypocrites. It was initially organized by hackers in South America and Mexico before spreading to other countries, and it was timed to coincide with Pope Benedict XVI's visit to Madrid in August 2011 for World Youth Day, an international event held every other year that regularly attracts more than a million Catholic youths.Hackers initially tried to take down a Web site set up by the church to promote the event, handle registrations and sell merchandise. Their goal -- according to YouTube messages delivered by an Anonymous figure in a Guy Fawkes mask -- was to disrupt the event and draw attention to child sexual abuse by priests, among other issues.The videos, which have been viewed more than 77,000 times, include a verbal attack on the pope and the young people who ''have forgotten the abominations of the Catholic Church.'' One calls on volunteers to ''prepare your weapons, my dear brother, for this August 17th to Sunday August 21st, we will drop anger over the Vatican.''Much as in a grass-roots lobbying campaign, the hackers spent weeks spreading their message through their own Web site and social sites like Twitter and Flickr. Their Facebook page called on volunteers to download free attack software and implored them to ''stop child abuse'' by joining the cause. It featured split-screen images of the pope seated on a gilded throne on one side and starving African children on the other. And it linked to articles about sexual abuse cases and blog posts itemizing the church's assets.It took the hackers 18 days to recruit enough people, the report says. Then the reconnaissance began. A core group of roughly a dozen skilled hackers spent three days poking around the church's World Youth Day site looking for common security holes that could let them inside, the report says. Probing for such loopholes used to be tedious and slow, but the advent of automated tools made it possible for hackers to do this while they slept.In this case, the scanning software failed to turn up any gaps. So the hackers turned to a brute-force approach -- a so-called distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attack that involves clogging a site with data requests until it crashes. Even unskilled supporters could take part in this from their computers or smartphones.''Anonymous is a handful of geniuses surrounded by a legion of idiots,'' said Cole Stryker, an author who has researched the movement. ''You have four or five guys who really know what they're doing and are able to pull off some of the more serious hacks, and then thousands of people spreading the word, or turning their computers over to participate in a DDoS attack.''Over the course of the campaign's final two days, Anonymous enlisted as many as a thousand people to download attack software, or directed them to custom-built Web sites that let them participate using their cellphones. Visiting a particular Web address caused the phones to instantly start flooding the target Web site with hundreds of data requests each second, with no special software required, the report says.On the first day, the denial-of-service attack resulted in 28 times the normal traffic to the church site, rising to 34 times the next day. Hackers involved in the attack, who did not identify themselves, said through a Twitter account associated with the campaign that the two-day effort succeeded in slowing the site's performance and making the page unavailable ''in several countries.'' Imperva disputed that the site's performance was affected and said its technologies had successfully siphoned the excess data away from the site.Anonymous moved on to other targets, including an unofficial site about the pope, which the hackers were briefly able to deface.Imperva executives say the Vatican's defenses held up because, unlike Sony and other hacker targets, it invested in the infrastructure needed to repel both break-ins and full-scale assaults.Researchers who have followed Anonymous say that despite its lack of success in this and other campaigns, recent attacks show the movement is still evolving and, if anything, emboldened. Threatened attacks on the New York Stock Exchange and Facebook last autumn apparently fizzled. But the hackers appeared to regain momentum in January after federal authorities shut down Megaupload, a popular file-sharing site.In retaliation, hackers affiliated with Anonymous briefly knocked dozens of Web sites offline, including those of the F.B.I., the White House and the Justice Department. At one point, they were able to eavesdrop on a conference call between the F.B.I. and Scotland Yard.''Part of the reason 'Op Megaupload' was so successful is that they've learned from their past mistakes,'' said Gabriella Coleman, an associate professor at McGill University who has studied Anonymous. Professor Coleman said the hackers had been using a new tool to better protect their anonymity. ''Finally people felt safe using it,'' she said. ''That could explain why it was so big.''In recent weeks, Anonymous has made increasingly bold threats, at one point promising to ''shut the Internet down on March 31'' by attacking servers that perform switchboard functions for the Internet.Security experts now say that a sort of open season has begun. ''Who is Anonymous?'' asked Rob Rachwald, Imperva's director of security. ''Anyone can use the Anonymous umbrella to hack anyone at anytime.''Indeed, in the last six months, hackers have attacked everything from pornography sites to the Web portals of Brazilian airlines. And some hackers have been accused of trying to extort money from corporations -- all under the banner of Anonymous.''Anonymous is an idea, a global protest movement, by activists on the streets and by hackers in the network,'' the hackers said through the Twitter account. ''Anyone can be Anonymous, because we are an idea without leaders who defend freedom and promote free knowledge.'' "
Consumers Leery of Online Shopping with Tablets and Phones,"Even as Internet shopping becomes almost routine, consumers still worry about online fraud and are especially leery of shopping with tablets or smartphones, a survey finds.While 88 percent of connected adults said they regularly shopped or conducted financial transactions online, two-thirds said they believed more fraud occurred online than when shopping in person.Most ( 81 percent) considered their computer to be the most secure means of Internet shopping. Just 7 percent trusted their smartphone and 3 percent trusted their tablet for secure online purchases.Jeff Liesendahl, senior vice president of Accertify, said in an email that it made sense that consumers trusted their computers more, since ""trust in newer devices is based on perception and historically lags more established technology.""The survey was conducted by Wakefield Associates for Accertify Inc., a unit of American Express that provides fraud prevention services. The survey included 1,000 adults with access to a smartphone, and Internet access on a computer. Participants were contacted between Nov. 30th and Dec. 1 using random-digit telephone dialing. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percent.The survey also found that responses differed by age. Older consumers - those over 55 - tend to be more trusting of online transactions, the survey noted. Fifty-five percent of older consumers believe that more fraud occurs when shopping online than in person, compared with 76 percent for those aged 18 to 24.Do you shop online using a tablet or smartphone? Why or why not? "
Readers Respond: Password Hygiene and Headaches,"My article on Thursday about password hygiene prompted many e-mails from readers, some detailing their own struggles with online security, others ready with tips the experts missed.One reader, Sean Hulbert, e-mailed to say he had spent 20 years in the security industry and occasionally ""taunted hackers"" to crack his passwords. ""To this day, I have not been hacked,"" he wrote. His secret? The Alt key.In addition to the experts' tip that a long passphrase - such as a song lyric or movie quote - should be used instead of a password and using only the first letter or letters of each word in the phrase, Mr. Hulbert said he makes his password stronger by translating the result using the Alt key. For example, assuming the site allows passwords with special characters, he might take this line from the film ""The Princess Bride"" - ""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.""- and convert it into the 15 character password: ""HmNiImYkMfPtDie."" Holding down the Alt key (on a Mac) as you type would make that password: Óµ~^^µÁ[#x2da]Âf[#x220f]Î^´.Hack that!Another reader, Roger Bohl, wrote to say he memorizes the same basic password for every online account but tweaks it for each account by adding two or three letters based on his own simple algorithm. For example, he may start with ""HmNiImYkMfPtDie"" as his password for every account. Then he may add three or more letters based on the name of the vendor but amended slightly - maybe three letters down from the alphabet. So for Amazon, he may convert Ama to Dpd (""D"" being three letters down the alphabet from the letter ""A"", ""p"" being three letters down from ""m"" and so on) to make it: HmNiImYkMfPtDieDpd. For Chase, it might be: HmNiImYkMfPtDieFkd.""Not unbreakable,"" Mr. Bohl conceded. ""But better than using a common password and easier to use than a list - and you don't have to carry it with you.""Many readers expressed frustration with the suggestion that they needed different passwords for every single site.  ""Your suggestion to never use the same password twice is impractical,"" wrote Daniel Dunn. ""Why not, instead, reuse the same password in contexts where it really doesn't matter if I am hacked?""Indeed, while many experts advise against it, some concede that they will use a ""throwaway"" password for sites that do not store personal or financial information, like a recipe forum.""I use a common browser/e-mail/password combination for what I perceive as low or no risk uses,"" wrote Steve Patriquen. ""I then ratchet up on complexity of my security based on the escalating risk.""David Ziegelheim appreciated the tip about using different Web browsers for different Web activities, but thought it could be taken one step further. ""It should really be coupled with a recommendation to delete all cookies on a regular basis,"" Mr. Ziegelheim wrote. ""For a browser dedicated to financial transactions the cookie should be deleted minimally every time the browser is closed.""Those most critical of the article were - unsurprisingly - password protection software vendors like AgileBits, which sells 1Password software. AgileBits took issue with the fact that both cybersecurity experts cited in the story, Jeremiah Grossman and Paul Kocher, said they did not trust password protection software because they did not write it themselves, and because if their computer is stolen, hackers could access all their passwords.""There is a very, very small handful of people who can get away with saying that they will only trust a password management system that they build themselves,"" the company wrote in a blog post. ""You should definitely not trust a password management system that you develop yourself.""As for what happens to passwords if a computer is stolen, AgileBits said it designed its 1Password software with that possibility in mind. ""We've made it very, very difficult for password cracking systems, such as John the Ripper, to recover your Master Password.""The only people more angered by our password guide than AgileBits were devotees of Bruce Schneier, the security technologist and author.""I remain skeptical of any article in this space that doesn't quote or at least refer to Bruce Schneier,"" one reader wrote on Twitter. (Indeed, it should be noted that Mr. Schneier designed Password Safe, a password management software that, like LastPass, SplashData and AgileBits, stores passwords in an encrypted file that you can unlock with one master password.)Finally, many readers (and even my editor) said that after hearing about my own harrowing experience with my computer's webcam, they too were now covering their webcam's lens with masking tape.

Police Inquiry Prompts New Speculation on Who Leaked Climate-Change E-Mails,"For two years, the mystery has endured: who set out to undercut climate scientists by publishing more than 1,000 of their private e-mails on the Internet?The original e-mails, released in 2009 on the eve of a high-stakes United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen, sowed doubts about the scientists' research and integrity and galvanized skeptics who challenge the scientific consensus that global warming is under way. It set off six separate official inquiries, all of which cleared the researchers of scientific misconduct.Then the controversy receded. Yet recently, speculation about the identity of the person who leaked the messages has surged with the release of new e-mails and signs that a police inquiry is under way in Britain.In November, just before another major international climate conference opened, this time in Durban, South Africa, another round of e-mails between the scientists were distributed online. Like those released in 2009, they were part of a trove taken from a computer server at the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia in England; as before, the e-mail hijacker alerted the public to the e-mails in comments posted on various blogs. But November's leaker left additional clues behind as well. Not much -- an encrypted file and a note ending in what seemed to be a taunt -- but enough to revive fervent speculation about what sort of person might be behind the stunt.The note, somewhat cryptic, seemed to suggest that efforts to fight global warming siphoned money from worthy causes like fighting poverty. ''Every day nearly 16,000 children die from hunger and related causes,'' it said.Then the note's author seemed to dangle a challenge for hackers and programmers, saying that even though he was releasing 5,000 e-mails, ''The rest, some 220,000, are encrypted for various reasons.''''We are not planning to publicly release the pass phrase,'' the note added coyly.The stunt was enough to jump-start a police investigation that had long seemed dormant.In December, citing a request from British law enforcement, the Justice Department asked that Automattic, the parent company of the blog host WordPress.com, preserve three days of digital logs for three blogs where the links to the latest e-mails first appeared. In a raid in Leeds, England, the police also confiscated laptops from the home of one blogger; he says the police have told him that he is not a suspect.The note, the encrypted file and the fresh signs of police interest have inspired musings on both sides of the climate divide.Kert Davies, the research director of the environmental group Greenpeace, suggested that the note was ''a strong clue on the predisposition of the hacker.''''It smells a lot like a certain quadrant of the denier community,'' he said. ''They pretend to be concerned that we are impeding development in poor countries. Only certain think tanks think that way and play that way'' -- mostly in Europe, he said.Some have noted that in 2009, the online trickster used the initials R.C. and linked to a zip file named ''FOI2009,'' an apparent reference to Freedom of Information statutes in both Britain and the United States.(Much of the criticism of climate scientists at the University of East Anglia centered on delays in responding to Freedom of Information requests, usually from climate skeptics, for access to all of their data and even their e-mails.)This time, he signed his blog comments simply as ''FOIA,'' a common nickname for the leaker in online discussions of the e-mail affair.Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington and a frequent spokesman for climate change skeptics, said the encryption of the file had challenged his thinking on FOIA's identity.Previously, he said, he had assumed the leaker was an employee of the University of East Anglia who had been troubled by the denial of requests for the prompt public release of scientists' full data and e-mails under Britain's Freedom of Information Act.But a principled commitment to open information is not in keeping with an encrypted file, Mr. Ebell said. So he suspects a different kind of intelligence is at work.''It is very suggestive of someone who has thought through how to cause the con men at the C.R.U. the maximum possible anxiety,'' he said, referring to the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. ''It is like knowing your building has a bomb in it that could be detonated at any time.''Yet Brendan DeMelle, executive director of DeSmogBlog, a Web site devoted to debunking what it describes as misinformation campaigns by deniers of climate change, suggests that the encrypted file is merely a desperate attempt to distract people from the fact that the scientists were vindicated.''It is sort of bait,'' he said. ''It raises questions on what else is out there. In the end, uncertainty is their product.''The three blogs where comments were submitted alerting the online community to the new e-mails are all known for their critiques of the work of climate scientists.Asked if he had any clues to the leaker's identity, Steve McIntyre, the Canadian blogger who runs climateaudit.org, said, ''I don't know who it is and I can't think of any reason why anyone would think I did.'' He has not been contacted by any law enforcement entity, he said.Roger Tattersall, a Web content manager at the University of Leeds who had two laptops confiscated by British police constables last month, did not shed light on the mystery, either. ''I do not wish to issue a denial, because it invites the assumption that there is an accusation or suspicion,'' said Mr. Tattersall, who authors a blog known as Tallbloke's Talkshop. He added, ''The police have stated that I am not a suspect.''In an e-mail provided by Mr. Tattersall to The New York Times, his lawyer emphasized that his client would have cooperated with the police without their needing a search warrant. The Norfolk constabulary, which carried out the raids, refused to comment on the raid or any investigation.Jeff Condon, the author of a blog called The Air Vent, said he had no idea who posted the links to the e-mails on his blog.Yet he said he found it interesting that for the most part, the phantom posted links on blogs like his own, where many of those who commented seem conversant in technology.''Most of my readers are college graduates, 50 percent have Ph.Ds,'' he said. ''This is the kind of people that the guy who dropped the links'' sought to reach, he said.Still, Mr. Condon said he did not believe that ''FOIA'' is a serious person. At times, he said, he has assumed that the leaker is a mischievous student.''No adult with sensitive information would release it that way,'' he said. ''It's pranklike behavior.''Yet among scientists whose e-mails were released and whose research practices were then investigated, the signs that an investigation is afoot have revived hopes that the e-mail thief will ultimately be unmasked.''It seems to me the authorities wouldn't have acted without some actionable intelligence,'' said Michael Mann, a scientist at Pennsylvania State University who specializes in climate modeling and whose messages came in for particular scrutiny in 2009. ''They must know something that we don't yet know.'' "
Fighting Cyberbullies With Laws and Laughter,"LONDON - In what is being described as a landmark case, a British woman has secured a court order obliging Facebook to reveal the identity of ""cyberbullies"" who targeted her with an online campaign of ""vicious and depraved"" abuse.In a robust example of a victim fighting back, 45-year-old Nicola Brookes intends to use the information to mount a private prosecution against her tormentors.Ms. Brookes appears to have a strong case. As part of a months-long online attack, a fake Facebook profile was set up in her name that falsely portrayed her as a pedophile and a drug dealer. The U.S.-based social media giant removed the offending page but Ms. Brookes continued to be a target of online abuse.Her experience was one of innumerable cases of online bullying and ""trolling"" that in some cases has led to the suicide of those targeted.However, free speech advocates have warned against the dangers of an overreaction to a worldwide phenomenon that has grown alongside the expansion of the Internet. In the United States, proposals to control online media have raised First Amendment concerns.In Britain, the 1988 Malicious Communications Act makes it an offense to post indecent or grossly offensive material. However, many of the hundreds of investigations that have been pursued have run up against the problem of identifying the perpetrators.One successful prosecution last year involved a 25-year-old man who posted abusive comments on the Facebook tribute page of a dead teenager.In Ms. Brookes's case, Facebook has been cooperative. It did not contest her action in the London High Court and said it would hand over material that might help to locate the cyberbullies. ""There is no place for harassment on Facebook, but unfortunately a small minority of malicious individuals exist online, just as they do offline,"" according to a company spokesman quoted in British media.After a series of high-profile cases, the Cybersmile Foundation charity has been set up to raise awareness of the dangers lurking on the internet and to press for cyberbullying to be made a clearly defined criminal offense in Britain.There are concerns, however, that a public backlash against cyberbullying could create its own abuses.In March, a British student was jailed for 56 days for tweeting racist abuse of a popular black soccer player, Fabrice Muamba, who suffered an almost fatal heart attack during a match. Joan Smith, a columnist writing in The Independent newspaper in Britain, condemned the abuse as stupid and unfeeling, but also accused the court that sentenced the student of bowing to public opinion.""A custodial sentence is wildly excessive and has worrying implications for freedom of expression, which is too important a subject to be brushed aside on grounds of 'public outrage,' "" she wrote.The law is not, of course, the only way for victims of cyberbullying to fight back. The comedian Isabel Fay and fellow artists just posted a YouTube video featuring a song that ridicules online bullies who have targeted them.Viewed by almost 200,000 people since it was posted on Thursday, the clip is entitled Thank You Hater and is dedicated ""to hard working internet trolls everywhere."" View the video above and here.""Love ya,"" Ms. Fay says. ""Keep on trollin'!"" "
From Black Hat: Hackers Demonstrate N.F.C. Dangers,"Hackers can steal photos, text messages, surf the Web and even make phone calls from your smartphone simply with the wave of a hand, researchers at the annual Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas said Wednesday. Charlie Miller, a security researcher at Accuvant and serial smartphone hacker, demonstrated how easy it is for hackers to exploit near-field communication technology to take control of devices remotely. In front of a packed audience, he successfully hacked three smartphones using N.F.C.: a Samsung Nexus S, a Galaxy Nexus and a Nokia N9. In each case, he was able to access photos, send texts, browse the Internet and even make phone calls from the phones, without laying a finger on them. Near-field communication technology makes it possible for two devices to speak to each other when they are in close proximity. It can be used to, say, swap business cards virtually, play music on wireless speakers or pay for coffee with a smartphone. The technology is widely available internationally and is slowly being adopted in the United States. The mobile payments industry is banking on it. Google's mobile payments app, Google Wallet, lets users pay for items and redeem offers by tapping their phones to an N.F.C.-enabled terminal. New York taxicabs were early adopters of the technology. So were Samsung and Nokia. Smartphones that run Google's Android and Nokia's MeeGo operating systems are now N.F.C.-enabled and rumor has it that Windows and Apple smartphones will be next. N.F.C. was the hot buzzword at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona earlier this year and analysts predict that some 70 million smartphones sold this year will include the technology. Near-field communications is supposed to make our lives easier. But security researchers warn it will make hackers' lives easier too.Mr. Miller showed that by bringing an N.F.C. tag, equipped with a chip, in close proximity with an Android Nexus S phone he could send the phone's browser to a malicious Web site and, from there, access the phone's entire file directory and even install monitoring software. Google patched the bug Mr. Miller used in the 4.01 version of Android. But even with the fix, he showed how a relatively new Google feature, called Android Beam, in its Ice Cream Sandwich operating system allows for the same exploit. The feature, which lets users share contacts and directions by bringing two devices in close proximity, also makes it possible for hackers to take control of their Web browser and download malicious software from there. Hacking the Nokia N9 phone using near-field communication technology, Mr. Miller demonstrated, is a piece of cake. The Nokia N9's N.F.C. feature is not enabled by default. But once a user enables it, the phone starts accepting all connection requests, including from hackers. In his demonstration, Mr. Miller showed how he could exploit that feature to make phone calls, read texts and access photos.  "
The Breakfast Meeting: Hacking Charges and the Olympic Brand Police,"After months of inquiries and investigations, British police have charged eight people with phone hacking, including Andy Coulson, the prime minister's former press secretary, and Rebekah Brooks, the former editor of News of the World and a close confidante of News Corporation owner Rupert Murdoch. (The Guardian provides a full rundown of the charges here.) Both Mr. Coulson and Ms. Brooks were charged in connection with the phone hacking of the murder victim Millie Dowler. By coincidence, the Dowler family lawyer addressed the final day of the Leveson Inquiry yesterday.While the announcement of the charges surprised many in Great Britain, it didn't surprise many at News Corporation's offices. ""You don't get an indictment like this without a lot of preliminary discussions,"" one person with knowledge of the company's thinking told John Burns and Amy Chozick. ""They knew exactly, exactly what was coming and how bad it would look.""The London Olympics may be struggling to provide security and logistical support but the Games aren't lax in their crackdown on corporate crashers, like Nike, that want to capitalize on the spectacle without paying a small fortune to the organizing committee. The brand police already rounded up one suspect: a butcher in Weymouth, England, who put out a store display of sausages shaped like Olympic rings.The Olympics may be affecting another business - Netflix, which reported a profit of $6 million for the second quarter but warned that its subscription business might suffer because of the popularity of the Games. The company also said that the loss of DVD-by-mail subscriptions still outpaced new streaming subscriptions as the company struggles to remake its delivery system.Eight members of Congress have opened an investigation into data brokers - the companies that collect, analyze and sell consumer data both on and offline - including big players in the industry like Acxiom and Epsilon and some of the large consumer report companies.To the Victors Department: The Daily News, which has reaffirmed its New York tabloid roots under its new editor, Colin Myler, has made a bold hire. Alexander Hitchen, the National Inquirer reporter who broke the story of John Edwards's affair with Rielle Hunter, has joined The Daily News as photo director, according to Capital New York. Mr. Hitchen's previous photo work includes a stint at, you guessed it, News of the World.And finally, Weekly Reader, a staple of classrooms for most of the last century, is going away, according to its new publisher, Scholastic. The Reader, a digest of weekly news for school children, was famous for the accuracy of its presidential poll, which correctly predicted 13 of the past 14 elections.

Daily Report: Cybersecurity Bill Stalls,"A bill that is intended to shore up the nation's electronic defenses failed to advance in the Senate on Wednesday. That could lead President Obama to sign an executive order on the issue. A motion to force a vote on the bill fell short of the 60 votes needed to pass, with only 51 senators backing it, The Associated Press reported. The main stumbling block was the role that the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies should play in electronic defense.""The only other thing that can produce legislation is a major cybersecurity meltdown,"" Stewart Baker, a former assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security and a partner at the Steptoe & Johnson law firm in Washington, told Bloomberg News. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said that rushing a vote on the bill was ""eerily reminiscent of the conversation we had about Obamacare,"" The Hill reported:Some Republicans opposed the bill last time because the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it included burdensome regulations on businesses. Grassley said the bill still hasn't addressed those problems and that the vote was just a way for the Democrats to paint Republicans as obstructionists.""If we're truly serious about it, we'll treat [cybersecurity] with the seriousness it deserves,"" Grassley said. ""Are we to once again pass a bill so that then the American people can read it?The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that President Obama signed an executive order last month allowing the military to be more aggressive in thwarting online attacks:Presidential Policy Directive 20 establishes a broad and strict set of standards to guide the operations of federal agencies in confronting threats in cyberspace, according to several U.S. officials who have seen the classified document and are not authorized to speak on the record.

Dividing the 105th,"The Police Department's 105th Precinct runs along the city's border with Nassau County, from the northern reaches of Queens to Kennedy International Airport, in the south.Fourteen years after City Councilman Mark S. Weprin, Democrat of Queens, appealed to the Giuliani administration to split it in two, he is supporting legislation in Albany to do the same. ""Sadly, the situation has not changed,"" Mr. Weprin said in a recent statement.Back then, in 1998, Mr. Weprin was a state assemblyman and fighting to divide the 105th Precinct into two sections over residents' concerns that its boundaries were too vast to allow for effective police coverage - the precinct stretches about 12 miles from end to end. Today, as a city councilman, Mr. Weprin is still hoping the change can come about through bills introduced by State Senator Tony Avella and Assemblyman Edward C. Braunstein, both Democrats of Queens.""This is a battle worth fighting,"" Mr. Weprin said.Staying Safe OnlineThe Citizens Crime Commission of New York City has a new cybercrime feature on its Web site to help New Yorkers protect their computer systems and pocketbooks from hackers and identity thieves.In addition to primers on subjects like phishing (in which criminals try to steal personal information from someone online by posing as a well-known company or institution), and pharming (rerouting users to phony Web sites), the cybercrime page, a portal for information from the F.B.I., is chock full of sobering statistics. For example: 35 complaints are received per hour by the Internet Crime Complaint Center,  and United States businesses lost $4 billion to online fraud in 2008, at the peak of illegal computer hacking activities.Just before the new feature went up on the Crime Commission's Web site late last month, its president, Richard Aborn, moderated a panel discussion on cyber crime that was co-sponsored by the Crime Commission and the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University. ""Cybercrime is a product of the Internet age,"" Mr. Aborn said. ""It transcends geographic borders and legal jurisdictions, but unlike a dark alley late at night, the threat is far less obvious. The Crime Commission is proud to partner with the F.B.I. to make sure that individuals and businesses can protect themselves against this costly and serious crime.""Helping the Family of a Fallen OfficerA benefit is being planned for the four daughters of Officer Peter J.

LinkedIn Tweaks Calendar Feature to Stop Taking Meeting Notes,"On Tuesday, Bits reported that LinkedIn's mobile application for the iPhone and iPad contained an opt-in feature that transported sensitive information from users' calendars -- including meeting notes, dial-in information, passwords and participants' contact information -- back to its servers, without users' knowledge. Security researchers noted that the practice could prove problematic in cases where people inserted sensitive information, like confidential financial data or strategic plans, for instance, into those meeting notes.Asked about the practice, Julie Inouye, a company spokeswoman, said the company did not store the information and only used calendar entry data ""to match LinkedIn profile information about who you're meeting with so you have more information about that person.""But, security researchers, Yair Amit and Adi Sharabani, co-founders of Skycure Security, noted in a blog post that all LinkedIn would need to match up meeting participants with their LinkedIn profiles were ""unique identifiers of the people you are going to meet with, not all the details of your planned meetings.""The practice could be in violation of Apple's privacy guidelines, which expressly prohibit app makers from transmitting users' personal data without their permission.In response, LinkedIn said it would discontinue the practiceon Wednesday. ""We will no longer send data from the meeting notes section of your calendar event,"" Joff Redfern, LinkedIn's head of mobile products, wrote in a blog post. He added that the company would add a new ""learn more"" link to its app to tell users exactly how their calendar data will be used.In an interview Wednesday, Mr. Sharabani said LinkedIn had addressed only part of the problem.""They are still sending all the other elements of the meeting -- it's common for people to put dial-in phone numbers and passwords into the location field,"" he said. ""Why is LinkedIn sending these pieces of data? It should only send what they need -- there is no good reason why they need the subject of your meeting, location or dial-in information.""The revelation that LinkedIn transmits this information back to its Web servers came just one day before hackers posted a file of encoded LinkedIn passwords to a Russian hacker site, which appeared to have been stolen from LinkedIn's Web servers.""LinkedIn says it's not keeping this information, just sending it to their servers, but why send it at all?"" Mr. Sharabani said. ""They need to explain why they need this information. It's not enough to say they're not keeping it when hackers can break into their servers and keep it for themselves."" "
Microsoft Tries to Make Windows Updates Flame Retardant,"Like archaeologists on a dig, security researchers continue to unearth some interesting - some terrifying - facts about Flame, the virus aimed at computers in the Middle East.For one, Flame did what security professionals have nightmares about malware doing: mimicking Microsoft's Windows update mechanism and spreading through it.""Having a Microsoft code-signing certificate is the Holy Grail of malware writers. This has now happened,"" Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, the antivirus company in Helsinki, wrote in a blog post Monday.Parts of the malware were digitally signed with a valid Microsoft digital certificate, which makes it appear as if it is a harmless software update from Microsoft. What makes that so frightening, researchers say, is that some 900 million Windows computers get their updates from Microsoft Update.To prevent Flame's operators or future copycats from spoofing its certificates, Microsoft released an emergency security advisory, and patch, on Monday. But even without the patch, the company noted that the virus was so focused in its scope - it was aimed at computers in the Middle East  - that the chance of it spreading on a huge scale was unlikely.Another reason people need not worry: The virus is no longer spreading. On May 28, the same day researchers announced they had discovered Flame, its command-and-control centers - which had been operating for at least the last four years - went dark.Over the weekend, security researchers successfully intercepted contact between Flame's operators and infected computers and redirected their communication to a ""sinkhole"" operated by Kaspersky Lab, GoDaddy and OpenDNS, in order to glean more information about the attackers' methods and targets.Since then, researchers have tied the virus back to more than 80 different command and control servers, all set up by fake aliases, dating as far back as 2008. The names used to register the domains all sound northern European. Among them: Karel Schmid, Werner Goetz, Mark Ploder and Ivan Blix.Most domains were registered through GoDaddy, using fake addresses in Germany and Austria, many belonging to hotels, shops, organizations, doctor's offices, or made-up addresses, according to researchers at Kaspersky Lab.But the most intriguing discovery, so far, is that the virus did a remarkable job of hiding in plain sight. The virus is 20 megabytes in size - more than 20 times the size of most malware - but operated for at least four years, under little cover. Kaspersky Lab researchers noted that Flame's operators cloaked the virus with basic encryption techniques.That may say more about the limitations of antivirus industry than it does about attackers' skills - a point at least one expert was willing to acknowledge.""Flame was a failure for the antivirus industry,"" Mr. Hypponen wrote in a blog post Monday. ""We really should have been able to do better. But we didn't. We were out of our league, in our own game."" "
"Unable to Crack Computer Virus, Security Firm Seeks Help","Five days after a computer security firm disclosed the discovery of Gauss, a computer virus targeting computers in Lebanon, they issued a cry for help.Among Gauss's most puzzling components is an encrypted ""warhead"" that watches for a specific computer system with no Internet connection and installs itself only if it finds that configuration. The warhead has baffled security researchers at Kaspersky Lab, who first discovered the virus in June and have been unsuccessfully trying to crack its encryption code since.""Despite our best efforts, we were unable to break the encryption,"" Kaspersky researchers wrote in a blog post Tuesday. ""So today we are presenting all the available information about the payload in the hope that someone can find a solution and unlock its secrets. We are asking anyone interested in cryptology, numerology and mathematics to join us in solving the mystery and extracting the hidden payload.""Until they crack the encryption, it is difficult to say precisely what Gauss is after. Clues point to a sophisticated computer virus that may have been developed by the same nation state, or group of nation states, that developed Flame, the computer virus that was spying on computers in Iran as recently as last May, and possibly Stuxnet, the virus that disrupted uranium enrichment work in Iran in 2010.To date, Kaspersky's researchers have detected Gauss on 2,500 computers, most in Lebanon. Its purpose appears to be to acquire log-ins for e-mail and instant messaging accounts, social networks and, notably, accounts at some of Lebanon's largest banks - the Bank of Beirut, Blom Bank, Byblos Bank and Credit Libanais - along with Citibank and the online payment system PayPal.But the warhead, which has been wrapped in several layers of encryption, suggests the attackers may be after something larger. ""All the precautions used by the authors indicate that the target is indeed high-profile,"" the researchers wrote in their blog post.The researchers say Gauss's warhead is large enough to contain a ""Stuxnet-like"" function. The New York Times reported in June that Stuxnet was jointly designed by the United States and Israel to search for the industrial control system that powered Iran's uranium enrichment project, and was ultimately used to spin Iran's centrifuges out of control.If researchers are correct in assuming that Gauss is state-sponsored, it would be the first time such a virus had been found to include financial targets. Stuxnet, Flame and Doqu, another computer virus discovered in Iran, all appear to have been designed to spy on that country's nuclear program.Lebanon experts said previously that an American espionage campaign directed at Lebanese banks would make sense given United States concerns that Lebanon's banks have been used to back the Syrian government and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party. Last year, the United States Treasury identified a Lebanese bank, Beirut-based Lebanese Canadian Bank SAL, as a primary money-laundering facility for Hezbollah and Lebanese drug traffickers. "
"Ahead of Spyware Conference, More Evidence of Abuse"," This week, at ISS World Americas, an annual surveillance trade show in Washington, law enforcement agents from around the world will gather to learn about the latest in computer spyware. What they will not hear is how, in several cases, that software is being used by oppressive governments to keep tabs on political activists.On Thursday, executives from the Gamma Group, based in Hampshire, England, and Hacking Team, based in Milan, are scheduled to speak in consecutive presentations about their latest surveillance technologies. Both companies sell spyware to governments that they say is used exclusively for criminal investigations, but mounting evidence suggests that their spyware has been used to monitor dissidents.In August, an article in The New York Times outlined how spywaresold by the Gamma Group had been used to monitor Bahraini activists and spy on people via servers in more than a dozen countries -- many with questionable human rights records, like Brunei and Turkmenistan. At first, the Gamma Group denied that its software was being used this way. Then it said several copies of its spyware had been stolen.On Wednesday, Morgan Marquis-Boire, one of the first security researchers to discover Gamma spyware in e-mails sent to Bahraini activists, released new evidence suggesting that spyware sold by Hacking Team had also been used to monitor political activists.Such spyware gives governments that previously had no cybersurveillance programs a sophisticated plug-in monitoring operation that can track a citizen's location, record their every keystroke, read e-mails, social networking and instant messenger chats, and even remotely switch on a device's camera or microphone to record their conversations.The market for such technologies has grown to $5 billion from ""nothing 10 years ago,"" Jerry Lucas, president of TeleStrategies, the company behind ISS World, told The Times in August.In his most recent findings, Mr. Marquis-Boire, a security researcher with the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, said he had discovered Hacking Team's government-grade spyware included in a Microsoft Word attachment sent to a political activist in the United Arab Emirates, and also embedded in a link posted to a Moroccan news Web site.A member of Hacking Team's finance department said he was not aware of Mr. Marquis-Boire's findings and that executives at the company were not available for comment on Wednesday.In July, Ahmed Mansoor, an outspoken blogger from the United Arab Emirates and a member of the ""U.A.E. Five"" -- a group of Emirati activists jailed last year for criticizing government leaders -- opened a suspicious e-mail with a Microsoft Word attachment that, when opened, deployed spyware that could monitor his every keystroke, record his passwords, social networking and instant messenger chats and even his voice conversations through his computer's microphone. Mr. Mansoor told Bloomberg that because of that innocent mistake-- clicking on a malicious e-mail attachment-- he was inexplicably beaten by unknown assailants.That same month, a suspicious message was posted to a submission page on Mamkafinch.com, a Moroccan news Web site that has been critical of Morocco's government. The message, which was posted in French, translated roughly as: ""Please do not mention my name or anything I do. I do not want any shenanigans,"" and included a link that, if opened, took control of the person's device.Mr. Marquis-Boire said he had been able to match the spyware contained in both the e-mail attachment and malicious link to a demonstration copy of Hacking Team's spyware, which the company markets this way: ""Remote Control System is a stealth investigative tool dedicated to law enforcement and security agencies for digital investigations. It is an eavesdropping software which hides itself inside the target devices. It enables both active data monitoring and process control.""In the case of Mr. Mansoor, the spyware eavesdropped from a server that, as of August, was registered to a post office box in Abu Dhabi that matched the corporate headquarters of the Royal Group, a U.A.E. conglomerate. In the case of Mamfakinch, the spyware was controlled by an I.P. address hosted in Rabat, Morocco's capital.Executives at the Royal Group could not be reached for comment. A representative at Morocco's consulate in New York did not respond to a request for comment.The release of Mr. Marquis-Boire's findings is timed just one day before executives at the Gamma Group and Hacking Team are scheduled to take the stage at ISS World. On Thursday, Martin J. Muench, a Gamma Group managing director, will deliver a presentation titled ""Government I.T. Intrusion: Applied Hacking Techniques Used by Governments."" After his presentation, three Hacking Team executives will talk about their latest government-grade surveillance technology.Mr. Marquis-Boire said the timing of his release was coincidental. In an interview on Tuesday, he said, ""These companies say they only sell this spyware to governments and intelligence and law enforcement agencies, but the key takeaway is 'Know thy customer.' "" "
Keeping Cash Just in Case,"Earlier this year, I joked in a post that interest rates were so low on savings accounts that it might make sense to store cash under your mattress -- or at least somewhere safe in your home.But the recent ""denial of service"" attacks on big banks in the United States that temporarily blocked some customers from using their online accounts got us at Bucks wondering again: Is having some cash on hand, in case of an extended outage, a good idea? And how much is reasonable?The attacks, which struck a half-dozen large banks, including Bank of America and Chase, last month and, more recently, additional banks like Capital One, affected the banks' online accounts only. The banks' mobile banking applications and telephone banking systems, as well as their automatic-teller machines, weren't affected. So customers could still get cash from the A.T.M.'s. Mark Pipitone, a spokesman for Bank of America, had this to say in an e-mail: ""It's important to point out that most of our customers experienced no difficulties on 9/18. Our other channels, including mobile banking, banking centers and A.T.M.'s, were available and unaffected.""Chester Wisniewski, senior security adviser at the electronic security firm Sophos, said the A.T.M. networks that are run by the major banks are less vulnerable to cyberattackers because they are largely private systems that aren't exposed to the Internet. ""Is it likely that they could impact those A.T.M. networks? Largely, no,"" he said.Some private-label A.T.M.'s, like those in gas stations or convenient stores, might, in theory, be subject to similar, if less high-tech, ""denial of service"" attacks because they sometimes use telephone lines to reach their networks. So an organized attack could conceivably work by tying up phone lines, just as Internet attacks tie up Web sites by flooding them with traffic and slowing them so much that regular customers can't use them.So what about hiding some cash at home? I personally don't do it, even though there are now clever gadgets, like fake electrical outlets, that help make hiding places less obvious. I can barely remember to keep cash in my wallet for everyday purchases; never mind hoarding piles of it for some unlikely catastrophe.But Mr. Wisniewski said that especially since the attacks of 9/11, he is a proponent of having cash on hand, and he often travels with as much as $1,000 in his wallet. He doesn't like to say where he keeps it at his house, for obvious reasons, but he says he wants to have enough available to cover costs like food and transportation for a week or two, if necessary. (He's also a diabetic, so he likes to have two months of his medication on hand, too.) How much you feel safe keeping around is up to you, he said. ""It all depends on your personal level of paranoia.""One caveat about keeping it at home, he said, is that ""the better you are at hiding it, the more likely you are to forget where it is.""The major banks we contacted dodged the cash-on-hand question. They generally would prefer, after all, that you keep your cash with them.Wells Fargo and Chase referred me to tips from the Financial Services Roundtable, which largely focused on advice like using antivirus software on your computer and strong online passwords.Citibank didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.Have the recent denial-of-service attacks caused you to change your banking habits? How so?This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Facing Cyberattack, Iranian Officials Disconnect Some Oil Terminals From Internet","TEHRAN -- Iran disconnected several of its main Persian Gulf oil terminals from the Internet on Monday, local news media reported, as technicians were struggling to contain what they said were intensifying cyberattacks on the Oil Ministry and its affiliates.Iranian officials said the virus attack, which began in earnest on Sunday afternoon, had not affected oil production or exports, because the industry is still primarily mechanical and does not rely on the Internet. Officials said they were disconnecting the oil terminals and possibly some other installations in an effort to combat the virus. ''Fortunately our international oil selling division has not been affected,'' said a high-level manager at the Oil Ministry who asked not to be mentioned for security reasons. ''There is no panic, but this shows we have shortcomings in our security systems.''There were some reports that the virus had forced widespread Internet shutdowns. ''The ministry has disconnected all oil facilities, operations and even oil rigs from the Internet to prevent this virus from spreading,'' said another Oil Ministry official who asked to remain anonymous, because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the attack. ''Everybody at the ministry is working overtime to prevent this.'' His assertion about the extent of the shutdowns could not be independently verified.The Iranian Students' News Agency said that the virus, called ''wiper'' by its creator, had successfully erased information on hard disks at the Oil Ministry's headquarters, a hulking black glass skyscraper on Taleghani Street in central Tehran. The ministry appears to have been the initial target of the virus, which the Iranian authorities say they first noticed in March but apparently were unable to dismantle.The Web sites of several oil related institutions, like the National Iranian Oil Company, which handles most oil sales in the country, were down on Sunday and Monday. It was unclear whether the virus took the sites down or if they were switched off by the Oil Ministry.Two years ago, a computer worm called Stuxnet attacked Iranian nuclear facilities, knocking out an unknown number of centrifuges used for enriching uranium. While initially silent on the Stuxnet sabotage, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad eventually acknowledged that ''enemies'' had been successful in ''making problems'' by installing computer malware in industrial switches used to control the centrifuges, making them spin out of control at high speed. Iranian officials vowed at the time to erect better defenses against such attacks.No one has claimed responsibility for Stuxnet, but Israeli officials openly expressed glee over the attack. The United States has denied any involvement.Iran is among the world's largest oil producers, and any disruption in supply would rattle the markets, almost certainly sending prices soaring. Just one of the six oil terminals now disconnected from the Internet, on Kharg Island in the Persian Gulf, typically transfers about 80 percent of Iran's crude exports of 2.2 million barrels a day.While officials here emphasize that both production and sales of oil are continuing as normal, the semiofficial Mehr News Agency said that the attack was intensifying and that access to the internal communications systems of most prominent oil and gas companies had been intentionally cut. A special crisis center has been set up where experts from across the country are assisting in the fight against the virus, it quoted one such specialist working for the Oil Ministry as saying.The source of the cyberattack was still being investigated, an internal security official said. ''For now, nullifying these attacks is on our agenda,'' Hamdollah Mohammad Nejad, the head of the Oil Ministry's Passive Defense Office, told the Mehr News Agency.But many here were quick to blame Iran's leading antagonists, the United States and Israel, at a time of growing pressure on Iran over its nuclear program, which Tehran insists is peaceful but which Western powers say is a cover for developing weapons.''This attack was very limited and only made some interruptions for some hours in the administrative part of the oil ministry,'' said Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst and spokesman for the Islamic Coalition Party, close to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the nation's supreme leader. ''This is again an attempt to wage soft war by the West, and does not have any impact on our operations.''Other affected organizations include the National Iranian Oil Processing and Distribution Company, National Iranian Gas Company, Iranian Offshore Oil Company, Pars Oil and Gas, and many other companies functioning under the National Iranian Oil Company, which handles most oil sales in the country, Mehr reported.For Mohammad Reza Sabzalipour, president of the Tehran World Trade Center, the message of the virus attack was clear. ''The aim is to increase pressure so that Iran will compromise in the upcoming nuclear talks on May 23,'' he said. ''We are in a bloodless war. If the talks fail, Iran can expect much more of this.'' "
"Renewing a Debate Over Secrecy, and Its Costs","WASHINGTON -- In recent years, the United States has pioneered the use of two innovative weapons, drones and cyberattacks, that by many accounts have devastated Al Qaeda and set back Iran's nuclear effort.Now those programs are at the heart of a bipartisan dispute over secrecy, with Congressional Republicans accusing the Obama administration of leaking classified information for political advantage and Democrats lodging their own protests about high-level disclosures.Prompted in part by recent articles in The New York Times on the use of drones to carry out targeted killings and the deployment of the Stuxnet computer worm against the Iranian nuclear program, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees issued a joint statement on Wednesday urging the administration ''to fully, fairly and impartially investigate'' the recent disclosures and vowing new legislation to crack down on leaks. ''Each disclosure puts American lives at risk, makes it more difficult to recruit assets, strains the trust of our partners and threatens imminent and irreparable damage to our national security,'' said the statement, a rare show of unity.The protest focused on the dangers of leaks that the Congressional leaders said would alert adversaries to American military and intelligence tactics. But secrecy, too, has a cost -- one that is particularly striking in the case of drones and cyberattacks. Both weapons raise pressing legal, moral and strategic questions of the kind that, in a democracy, appear to deserve serious public scrutiny. Because of classification rules, however, neither has been the subject of open debate in Congress, even as the Obama administration has moved aggressively ahead with both programs.''The U.S. is embarked on ambitious and consequential moves that will shape the security environment for years to come, whether they succeed or fail,'' said Steven Aftergood, who studies government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. ''Secrecy cloaks not only the operations, but their justification and rationale, which are legitimate subjects of public interest.''Mr. Aftergood said drones and cyberattacks were ''extreme examples of programs that are widely known and yet officially classified.'' That, he said, has prevented informed public discussion of some critical questions. Should the United States be inaugurating a new era of cyberattacks? What are the actual levels of civilian casualties caused by the drone attacks, and what are the implications for national sovereignty?''Keeping these programs secret may have a value,'' said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor and Bush administration Justice Department official who writes about national security and the press. ''But there's another value that has to be considered, too -- the benefit of transparency, accountability and public discussion.''Leaks, and the policy dilemmas and political squabbles they inspire, are as old as the country. In 1778, a disclosure by Thomas Paine that the French were secretly supporting the American revolutionaries became the subject of an investigation led by the future first chief justice, John Jay.Nor has any party held a monopoly on the complications of managing secrecy. During the Bush administration, a leak investigation led to a perjury conviction for a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, an outspoken defender of government secrets.Even so, contradictory behavior on the secrecy front has been especially striking under the Obama administration.Mr. Obama campaigned for the presidency in 2008 by denouncing his predecessor's secret prisons and brutal interrogations, which were public knowledge only because of leaks of classified information to the news media. He began his term by pledging the most transparent administration in history.In office, however, he has outdone all previous presidents in mounting criminal prosecutions over such leaks, overseeing six such cases to date, compared with three under all previous administrations combined.Senator John McCain of Arizona, Mr. Obama's opponent in 2008, told reporters on Tuesday that administration officials were ''intentionally leaking information to enhance President Obama's image as a tough guy for the elections'' -- while at the same time prosecuting low-level officials for disclosures. On Wednesday, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, called that charge ''grossly irresponsible.''The administration's inconsistency, however, has been particularly evident on the drone program. Officials routinely give reporters limited information on strikes, usually on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Obama spoke explicitly about the strikes in Pakistan in an online appearance in January, arguing that they were precisely aimed at Al Qaeda.Yet the drone attacks in Pakistan are part of a C.I.A. covert action program designed to be ''deniable'' by American leaders; by law they are in the most carefully protected category of secrets that the government keeps. In court, the administration has taken the position that it can neither confirm nor deny the existence of such operations.''There's something wrong with aggressive leaking and winking and nodding about the drone program, but saying in response to Freedom of Information requests that they can't comment because the program is covert,'' Mr. Goldsmith said.Recently, responding to Freedom of Information Act lawsuits filed by The Times and the American Civil Liberties Union, Justice Department lawyers sought a delay, saying that secrecy rules about targeted killings were under discussion ''at the highest level'' of government. The government must say by June 20 what it will make public.Behind closed doors, administration officials have long discussed the disadvantages of official secrecy for a program that by definition is no secret from its Al Qaeda targets. Colleagues say that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has often complained that secrecy rules make it hard to rebut exaggerated claims of civilian casualties from drone attacks in Pakistan. Mr. Obama has authorized a series of speeches by his counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan; the attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr.; and other officials, offering a limited account of the legal justification and goals of the strikes.In a speech on April 30, Mr. Brennan kept the intelligence striptease going, acknowledging that ''the United States is the first nation to regularly conduct strikes using remotely piloted aircraft in an armed conflict.''More significantly, Mr. Brennan elaborated on the administration's argument that it was using the new weapon with extraordinary care, and mentioned a particular reason: with drones, as with cyberattacks, which he did not discuss, the United States is setting an example for the rest of the world.''President Obama and those of us on his national security team are very mindful that as our nation uses this technology, we are establishing precedents that other nations may follow,'' he said.The same might be said of the administration's decisions about what to reveal about its pathbreaking programs and what to keep secret.

One Man's Fight With Google Over a Security Warning," On New Year's Day, Robert Epstein woke to nine e-mails from Google. His Web site had been compromised by hackers, Google informed him, and until Dr. Epstein, a psychologist, cleaned up his site, Google would warn any would-be clickers to stay away.Their ensuing exchange offers a glimpse into the frustrating nature of Web site infections, which are increasingly widespread but hard to diagnose and cure. Dealing with them, or even dealing with an Internet giant's claim that it has spotted one, can cause even the most sensible people to throw up their hands and seek court injunctions.Dr. Epstein, a former editor in chief at Psychology Today, says his Web site, which offers free interactive mental health screening tests, can draw up to 5,000 visits a day. Now, four days after Dr. Epstein first heard from Google, a search for his site yields the digital equivalent of a skull and crossbones: ""This site may harm your computer,"" Google warns. Click on the link and another message pops up. This one does not mince words: ""Reported Attack Page! This web page at drrobertepstein.com has been reported as an attack page and has been blocked.""Dr. Epstein contacted his Web host and Google. The former could not find any evidence of malware but reset his site's configurations anyway. The latter would respond only in boilerplate. So Dr. Epstein responded to Google's e-mail, this time copying Larry Page, Google's chief executive; David Drummond, Google's legal counsel; Dr. Epstein's congressman; and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, Wired and Newsweek.""Dear nameless Google worker,"" Dr. Epstein's e-mail begins. ""Your company is continuing - initially through incompetence and now through negligence and malice - to do irreparable harm to my good name and reputation.""""I am not a spammer and I do not run 'attack sites,' as you have now been claiming to the world for three days,"" the e-mail continues. ""I demand that you unblock my websites immediately.""Google responded to Dr. Epstein (and the journalists), telling him that it had re-scanned his site and had found it was still infected and still redirecting users to a site known to host malicious code.""We understand that your site has been compromised against your will, but in the spirit of protecting users, we hope you understand that we will continue to display a warning for as long as we continue to detect malware on your site,"" it said.Dr. Epstein says Google's automated crawler is referring to a nonexistent page on his Web site. He now plans to seek a court order forcing Google to remove its warnings.The fact is, unbeknownst to their owners and administrators, hundreds of millions of Web sites have been programmed to infect visitors with malware. In one month in 2010, Symantec reported seeing 40 million Web attacks, on average, every day.""Mainstream Web sites are one of the primary ways computers are getting infected,"" said John Harrison, a project manager at Symantec. ""We've seen physicians' Web sites, news sites, even a Fortune 1,000 company infect visitors with malicious code.""Hackers troll the Web using automated software that looks for legitimate Web sites with security weaknesses. Once they find vulnerabilities, they  install  Web attack toolkits or redirect visitors to sites that host malicious code.""Anyone with a hundred dollars and basic computer skills can use these automated tools,"" Mr. Harrison said. ""They've lowered the barrier to entry, and they are getting harder and harder to track down.""Hackers have become so adept at covering their tracks, Mr. Harrison said, that it's getting more challenging for Web host providers and even skilled security researchers to track them down.In some cases, hackers will only redirect users to malicious sites if they come to the site through a particular search engine. Or they will serve up malicious code the first time a user clicks on a site and then never attack again, to confuse security experts.So what can the owner of  an infected Web site do? Mr. Harrison suggests working with the Web host provider, installing updated Internet security software and using stronger administrator passwords.Having exhausted those options, Dr. Epstein e-mailed Google demanding telephone numbers for Larry Page so he could let Mr. Page know his search engine had made a grave mistake.""Everything I'm getting back is automated or boilerplate. This is going nowhere,"" Dr. Epstein said. ""How can Google come between an Internet service provider and an end user? How did Google come to have so much power?"" "
Apple's New Security Features for the Mac,"Mountain Lion, the next version of Apple's Mac operating system, won't just adopt more of the iPad and iPhone's popular touchy-feely features. It will embrace their behind-the-scenes security approach, too.Apple on Thursday introduced a preview of Mountain Lion, which is due out this summer, only a year after Lion's introduction. The new release is mainly intended to take us further down the path trod by Lion: Making the Mac work more like the iPad and iPhone, while facilitating the flow of key content across all of a person's Apple devices. There is also something less obvious that Mountain Lion aims to carry over from Apple's iDevices: no malware or other mischievous programs. Of course, such nasties are already rare on Macs. To date there have been just a few Trojan Horses, or programs that pretend to be something they're not, most famously a fake antivirus program known as MacDefender. But thanks to strict controls on how third-party software is downloaded onto iPhone and iPad -- namely, via Apple's own highly regulated App Store and no other way -- there has been no malware on those gadgets at all (well, except for some jailbroken devices).Now, Apple wants to offer users this stricter type of control on the Mac through a new security feature called Gatekeeper. Mountain Lion's Gatekeeper lets users select in their security preferences panel to install only applications that come from the Mac App Store. They can also choose a more relaxed setting to allow apps from the App Store and from ""identified developers,"" which are software makers that have Apple Developer IDs and that Apple can punish should they behave badly. And finally, they can stick with today's more permissive system and allow the installation of apps from anywhere. The medium setting will be set as the default. A spokesperson said Thursday that Apple hopes that Gatekeeper, by making it even harder for bad guys to get their programs onto Macs, will further reduce the chances for a criminal ""payoff"" and discourage them from even trying to attack Macs. Many experts say that, technically speaking, Macs aren't more secure than PCs that use new versions of Windows. Rather, attackers primarily aim at  PCs because they have much more know-how and a large base of already developed malicious code to build upon. If correct, a crucial defensive strategy is to keep hackers from getting the idea that writing malcode for the Mac is worth their time. Apple has already taken a host of measures to make OS X an unappealing target, including many introduced in Lion. Especially important was Apple's move to ""sandbox"" its own applications and to push third-party apps to the sandbox as well. Sandboxing is a technology that restricts what an application can and can't do and forces it to play only in its own little area. Apple's implementation of this concept keeps apps from reading or writing data, like your personal information, in any app but their own. The Apple spokesman said all major apps are now sandboxed, but not every single app. The company is working to enhance sandboxing so there aren't any stragglers, he said.Mountain Lion will include another such geeky security improvement called Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization. The kernel is a major operating-system component that bridges applications and the computer hardware. And ASLR refers to a random rearranging of memory so would-be attackers don't know where things are located, a tactic that makes it significantly harder for hackers to exploit software vulnerabilities and launch automated attacks. In Lion, Apple greatly enhanced its use of ASLR. With Mountain Lion, it takes the approach down to the bedrock.The perception that Macs are safer than other computers is a part of their appeal. These changes show that Apple is determined to make sure nothing changes on that front. "
The Internet Apocalypse That Wasn't," So much for the Internet apocalypse.Several security experts and media reports predicted that Monday, July 9, would be remembered as the day millions lost their Internet connections -- and possibly their livelihoods. Those concerns did not play out.At 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on Monday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation pulled the plug on servers that had been communicating with personal computers infected with a particularly thorny piece of malware. The malware, called DNSChanger, reconfigured the computers' settings for the Domain Name System, or DNS, which functions as the switchboard for the Internet. The DNS translates user-friendly Web addresses like fbi.gov into numerical addresses that allow computers to speak to each other. Without DNS servers operated by Internet service providers, the Internet could not operate.For four years, criminals based in Eastern Europe used the malware to tell computers to use the criminals' own DNS servers and redirect Internet users to fraudulent advertising sites, in a scheme that federal officials say generated $14 million.Last November, officials traced the scheme to six men in Estonia and one man in Russia; the former were arrested, and the latter remains at large. But by that point, officials said, DNSChanger had infected four million computers, including 500,000 in the United States. The malware was so stealthy that it was impossible for users to know if they had been infected.As part of a federal court order, the F.B.I. arranged for a private company to swap the rogue DNS servers with legitimate servers to keep millions of infected users connected to the Internet. It also worked with Google, Facebook and major Internet service providers on a public awareness campaign to notify infected users that their systems had been compromised. As part of that push, a DNS Changer Working Group was formed to manage a Web sitethat let users check if their computers were infected and linked to sites that could help clean their systems.But the federal court order keeping those legitimate servers running expired at midnight on Sunday, which left many security firms and the media forecastinga Y2K-like Internet blackout.That never happened. By Monday afternoon, Internet service providers had yet to release the number of affected systems. But the final tally is likely to be nowhere near Internet Armageddon, partly because Internet service providers, like AT&T and Verizon, temporarily substituted their own DNS servers for those set up by the F.B.I. AT&T plans to keep its servers running through the end of the year. Verizon will keep its servers running through the end of July. "
From Black Hat: Apple's Debut Falls Short,"The annual Black Hat hacker conference in Las Vegas on Thursday represented the first time Apple cleared an employee to discuss its internal security so publicly. So when Dallas De Atley,  manager of Apple's platform security team, took the stage, the room was packed tight and thick with anticipation. But when hackers and security suits filed out an hour later, most looked bored and deflated. Mr. De Atley had basically done the equivalent of reading aloud a white paper, timed to a PowerPoint deck, before escaping out a side door without answering any questions. Steve Jobs he is not.While Mr. De Atley delivered his presentation on iOS security, hackers elsewhere were delivering a simultaneous presentation titled ""The Dark Art of iOS Application Hacking.""Still, the fact that Mr. De Atley was allowed to speak at all was a big deal. Apple's team is notoriously tight-lipped and no more so than when it comes to Apple's own security. The company has rarely elaborated on its security beyond a recently departed marketing slogan that its Mac computer ""doesn't get PC viruses."" Four years ago, members of Apple's security engineering team had to pull out of a scheduled appearance at Black Hat after Apple's marketing team found out. But recent security incidents - combined with the fact that more consumers are using their personal iPhones and iPads at work - have forced Apple to enter the fray and convince businesses that it takes security seriously. Last April, security experts discovered that a new piece of malware, called Flashback, had affected more than half a million Mac users in the largest-scale attack on Apple's Mac OS X operating system to date. A year earlier, researchers discovered that a separate piece of malware, called Mac Defender, was masquerading as anti-virus software and infecting Macs.  Many cautioned that such attacks were a harbinger of many more to come as Apple steadily gains a greater share of the PC market. Apple currently holds a 12 percent share. Researchers have predicted the tipping point, when digital criminals start targeting Mac users with Windows-style malware attacks, will be when Apple's share of the PC market reaches 16 percent.  What troubles security researchers is how little visibility they have into Apple's security practices, especially in comparison to Windows.Call it a baby step, but in June, Apple's marketing team made a subtle tweak to its Web site, replacing the usual company line - that its Mac computer ""doesn't get PC viruses"" - with simply: ""Built to be safe."" And Mr. De Atley's Black Hat talk, while underwhelming, was one more step in that general direction. ""Our attitude is: security is architecture. It has to be built in from the very beginning,"" Mr. De Atley said. In building the iPhone, he said, Apple took a bare-bones approach and sought to use the minimum number of components. Apple purposefully decided not to ship the phone with a shell, or support remote log-in access. ""There's an entire set of attack vectors we don't have to fundamentally worry about on iOS,"" he said.He said Apple aimed to make its software updates as easy as possible. Because of that, he said 80 percent of users were running the latest version of iOS. (Some read that as a subtle dig at Google. In a presentation on Wednesday, Charlie Miller, a serial phone hacker, said that 90 percent of Android users had yet to upgrade to the latest operating system.) Mr. De Atley highlighted a number of ""sandboxing"" technologies Apple had in place. ""The goal is to physically isolate and separate processes from each other so that if one has a flaw, it can't easily wreak havoc on the rest of the system."" As examples, he noted that all third-party apps were stored in their own container on users' devices. User data is kept partitioned from the device's operating system so that any updates to the system do not affect the user's personal data. He added that every single file created on the iPhone gets its own encryption key and is wrapped in the user's passcode.  But as Mr. De Atley's talk wrapped up, bored facial expressions belied that he had disclosed anything new.  One audience member summed up the general reaction on Twitter: ""It was very, very meh."" Baby steps. "
Wallflowers of Silicon Valley Get Asked to Dance,"SAN FRANCISCO - After years of being wallflowers at Silicon Valley's hottest tech conferences and Sean Parker's after-parties, enterprise technology firms are now part of the ""in"" crowd.The flameouts of social media stocks over the last year have left venture capital firms searching for a more measured approach to investing.""Watching capital markets do what they just did - to Facebook, to Groupon, to Zynga - not a lot of people want to get over their skis,"" said Hans Swildens, the managing director of Industry Ventures, who said he had not invested in consumer tech since 2010. ""They want a nice ride down the hill.""That means technology sectors - including mobile security, data analytics and storage companies and mobile payment systems - which previously elicited a shrug or a snooze, are suddenly finding millions of dollars of investments coming at them. Here's a look at some of the more promising sectors.  SEALING THE LEAKS Increasingly, employees are taking sensitive corporate data home with them, frustrated with the limits of corporate technology and using their personal phones and tablets to work. That has created huge security and compliance headaches for chief information officers struggling to regain control over corporate data.Enter the mobile security industry. Venture firms like Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners, Andreessen Horowitz and Accel Partners are backing companies that wrap extra security around employees' personal iPhones and Android devices.Lookout, a start-up, has already been valued at $1 billion. Its software offers spyware and malware protection, helps locate lost or stolen phones and alerts users when their phones have connected to unencrypted Wi-Fi networks.Okta, a start-up that helps employees at companies like LinkedIn and Pandora securely connect to their work applications from their personal devices, recently raised $25 million in fresh financing from Sequoia Capital.The mobile security sector is also attracting merger deals. ZenPrise, a mobile security start-up, was acquired last week by Citrix, a maker of virtualization software. Investors expect similar acquisitions to follow. STORING THE BYTES New storage methods will be critical to harnessing the gigabytes of data now pouring in from those mobile devices, as well as the Web, social networks and video. To accommodate the fire hose of information, companies have started revamping their data centers. Increasingly, they are moving away from expensive disk drives and slow backup solutions to the cheaper, high-speed flash memory used in iPhones and digital cameras.""For 30 years, companies stored everything on spinning disks. Now they're moving to a flash memory-based model,"" said Joseph Ansanelli, a partner at Greylock Partners.Investors are taking note. Fusion-io, a high-capacity flash memory company, had a successful public offering last year, then increased revenue by 82 percent, to $359 million, in its latest fiscal year. Its technology packs in storage capacity and speeds up database performance - a compelling proposition for Facebook, its largest customer, which now stores 2.7 billion ""Likes"" and 300 million photos a day, or roughly 105 terabytes of data each half-hour.Producers of high-speed flash memory storage products, like Pure Storage and Nimble Storage, are now attracting millions in venture backing. Pure Storage emerged from stealth mode only a year ago and now serves a wide range of businesses, including Sierra Nevada Brewing and the city of Davenport, Iowa. In August, it raised $40 million, bringing its total funding to $95 million. A month later, Nimble Storage doubled its funding with $40 million in new capital from Sequoia, Accel and others. CRUNCHING MOUNTAINS OF DATA Some of the hottest innovations are in large-scale data mining. With the right analytical tools, big data can be used to solve complex problems quickly.""Companies now need to be able to do large-scale data mining and analysis in real time, as opposed to one guy in the I.T. department running a pricing analysis over the weekend,"" said Rich Wong, a partner at Accel Partners.Corporate demand for such high-powered analysis helped make Splunk, a data analytics company, one of 2012's top-performing I.P.O.'s.Investors searching for the next Splunk are now watching several start-ups. One front-runner is Cloudera, founded by alumni of Yahoo, Google, Oracle and Facebook. The firm incorporates Hadoop, an open-source software, to make complex data queries that help drug firms predict adverse drug side effects, or media companies target readers with relevant content.DIGITAL WALLET It may not be the end of paper money just yet, but more and more commercial products are making mobile payments a huge business. In hindsight, eBay's $1.5 billion acquisition 10 years ago of PayPal, the mobile payments company, was a bargain; PayPal is expected to generate $10 billion in payment volume this year. Square, the four-year-old mobile payments start-up run by a Twitter co-founder, Jack Dorsey, has caught up. In November, it said that it, too, was now processing $10 billion in payments a year.Both are also vying for attention with Google and Intuit, which offer mobile payment services, and, more recently, with big retail chains like Best Buy and Walmart, which said in August that it were working on ways for customers to pay with smartphones.Even with brutal competition, venture capitalists are still eagerly throwing money at a new crop of start-ups like Braintree, which helps e-commerce sites process credit card payments, and Stripe, which offers a similar service for software developers.In the last two years, Braintree has raised nearly $70 million. And, this year, Stripe raised $40 million from venture firms and angels, including some of the PayPal founders, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Max Levchin.Smaller start-ups may have a harder time taking on PayPal and Square as those services become more ubiquitous. They will also have to compete on the security front, where even one hacker breach can lead to a lack of confidence among customers. MOBILE CONCIERGE Apps, with the proverbial ""touch of a button,"" have converted phones into urban remote controls, allowing customers to order meals, errands, car rides, concert tickets and even cocktails.The darling of the space is Uber, an app that lets users order a car service with the touch of a screen. The three-year-old start-up has already raised $50 million from the likes of Goldman Sachs and Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief.Though Uber has run into battles with municipal transportation authorities, other firms, including Cabulous, Taxi Magic and Hailo, are jumping into the space.Similarly, GrubHub's app offers mobile convenience for food delivery. Hotel Tonight's app does the same for same-day hotel bookings. Every day at noon, spontaneous or stranded travelers can find heavily discounted rates for hotel rooms that night. The two-year-old mobile app has already raised more than $35 million in financing.A younger start-up, WillCall, lets users buy concert and theater tickets. And Coaster even lets users order, pay and tip for cocktails at bars with their smartphones. Those two apps are only in San Francisco, but venture capitalists are optimistic that on-demand mobile services are no fad.""Soon there will be a remote control for your life,"" said Peter Fenton, a venture partner at Benchmark Capital. ""The future has arrived.""An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the product offerings of Pure Storage and Nimble Storage. The companies sell a high-speed flash memory storage product; they do not provide off-site Web storage.   "
"Minesweeper at Lunchtime, a Federal Crime?","In 1984, Congress passed the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a narrow statute to curb computer hacking, when hacking was so novel that criminal laws did not really address it. The act has been expanded repeatedly so it is one of America's most extensive criminal laws. The statute prohibits people from accessing computers and obtaining information in them either without authorization or beyond the authorization they have. The Justice Department has misguidedly urged that the law be broadly interpreted so that workers can be charged with a crime for using an office computer in a way that violates a company's policy.In an important 9-to-2 decision last week, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit sensibly rejected that approach. The full court interpreted the law narrowly, explaining that the government's stance ''would make criminals of large groups of people who would have little reason to suspect they are committing a federal crime,'' when they engage in ''minor dalliances'' like ''playing games, shopping or watching sports highlights.'' The defendant in the case, David Nosal, and three colleagues left an executive recruiting firm to start a competing business. Before leaving the firm, Mr. Nosal's colleagues, with valid computer passwords and access to proprietary information, took some of that data. The government indicted Mr. Nosal on many counts, including trade secret theft and violation of the computer abuse law for aiding his colleagues in exceeding their ''authorized access'' to the computers.Mr. Nosal contended that his colleagues had permission to access the firm's computers and the information contained there. He argued that the law was intended to criminalize computer hacking, not the misuse of data.The appeals court was right to support his position. As Chief Judge Alex Kozinski wrote, the government's overly broad interpretation of the statute would ''transform whole categories of otherwise innocuous behavior'' -- like checking personal e-mail -- ''into federal crimes simply because a computer is involved.'' It would wrongly turn an anti-hacker statute into one that made ordinary conduct illegal, with no indication that Congress intended to do so. "
Inside the Stratfor Attack,"1:58 p.m. | Updated Adding clarification from the F.B.I. regarding how much of Stratfor's data it was able to salvage.Last December, a group of hackers quietly orchestrated an attack on Stratfor Global Intelligence Service, a company based in Austin, Tex., that analyzes geopolitical risk and publishes a newsletter for various clients, among them the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense. The hackers breached the company's network and, once inside, confided in their fellow hacker, Hector Xavier Monsegur, and, as it turns out, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Six months earlier, in June, the F.B.I. had arrested Mr. Monsegur and turned him into an informant. With his help, four hackers in Britain and Ireland were charged last Tuesday with computer crimes; a fifth man was arrested Monday in Chicago. Using the information he passed along, F.B.I. officials said it was able to thwart attacks on roughly 300 private companies and government agencies.But with Stratfor, they were not so lucky.Conspiracy theorists across the Internet surmise that federal agents sat back and let the Stratfor attack occur to collect evidence, or perhaps net a juicier target - say, Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, which later released the five million internal e-mails that hackers obtained in the Stratfor hack.""That's patently false,"" said one F.B.I. official, who would speak only on anonymity because the investigation was continuing. ""We would not have let this attack happen for the purpose of collecting more evidence.""F.B.I. officials said they learned of the Stratfor breach on Dec. 6, after hackers had already infiltrated the company's network and were knee-deep in Stratfor's confidential files. On that date, F.B.I. officials said, Jeremy Hammond, suspected as the attack's ringleader, informed Mr. Monsegur he had found a way into Stratfor's network and was already working to decrypt its data.The F.B.I. said that it immediately notified Stratfor, but said that at that point it was too late. Over the next several weeks, hackers rummaged through Stratfor's financial information, e-mail correspondence and subscribers' personal and financial information, occasionally deleting its most valuable data - all in full view of  F.B.I. agents.In addition to monitoring hackers' chat logs, the F.B.I. managed, with Mr. Monsegur's help, to persuade Mr. Hammond and Stratfor's other attackers to use one of the agency's own computers to store data stolen from Stratfor. The hackers complied and transferred ""multiple gigabytes of confidential data,"" including 60,000 credit card numbers, records for 860,000 Stratfor clients, employees' e-mails and financial data, to the F.B.I.'s computers, according to the complaint against Mr. Hammond.In an interview, F.B.I. officials clarified that they were able to salvage the Stratfor data that hackers transferred to its servers. Officials said this included some, but not all, of Stratfor's data. As for why the F.B.I. was not able to stop hackers from siphoning five million Stratfor e-mails to Wikileaks later on, the F.B.I. said hackers had also stored data on their own servers.The F.B.I. said it told Stratfor to delay notifying customers while it completed its investigation - a demand that later made Stratfor the target of a class-action lawsuit from subscribers who complained the company did not inform them of the breach until it was too late. Stratfor had little choice but to go public with the breach on Dec. 24, when hackers defaced its Web site and began posting receipts online for donations they had made with customers' stolen credit card information.Over the following days, hackers released credit card details for thousands of Stratfor clients, made at least $700,000 in fraudulent purchases using their credit cards, and exploited their e-mail addresses for malware attacks. Stratfor was forced to stop charging for subscriptions to its newsletter - its principal source of revenue. All told, Stratfor estimates the breach cost it $2 million in damages and lost revenue, according to the complaint.And that's just the financial cost. Two weeks ago, the company suffered further embarrassment when, three months after the breach, hackers funneled its internal e-mails to WikiLeaks, for widespread publication.Conspiracy theorists wonder why, with ample evidence, the F.B.I. waited three months to arrest Mr. Hammond after the Stratfor breach. Some suggest that the F.B.I. purposely waited to net a bigger fish: Mr. Assange.But F.B.I. officials said it simply took that long to collect the evidence to support their case. Cybercrime investigators and former federal prosecutors say that this makes sense, and that the time frame between Stratfor's attack and subsequent arrests is not unusual.""It's not surprising it would take them that long to make arrests,"" said Mark Seiden, a cybercrime investigator. ""They have to collect evidence, and the paperwork takes between three and six months. If you don't know exactly how hackers attacked a site, it's difficult to bring them to justice. There's no point in picking an unripe fruit.""That news might disappoint the conspiracy theorists, but not nearly as much as it does Stratfor and its subscribers, whose personal and financial information was compromised as a result of the attack.""It's extremely frustrating,"" said David White, a subscriber. Mr. White said he and his company were debating whether to renew their subscription. ""At this point, it's up in the air."" "
Security Meeting Focuses on the Basics," SAN FRANCISCO -- At the annual gathering here for computer security professionals this week, there was a lot of talk about hygiene. Not hand washing, but its digital equivalent.Five years ago, conference attendees said, they might have been sharing tips on what to do to make their customers safe inside their trusted, protected company networks. These days, they said, there was no inside, and nothing could be trusted.  That was in part, they said, because people were online all the time on a variety of devices - all of them vulnerable to attack. A company could no longer expect its employees to log in to their computers in the office. Today, employees are expected to send e-mail on their cellphones and tablets, transmit data over their home wireless network, even reveal themselves (and often, whom they work for) on social networks like Facebook. Everyone must be taught about how vulnerable they are. Every device and every platform needs to be checked. And if something is dangerous - a Web site, a mobile application, an entire machine - it ought to be contained, before it turns into a contagion. ""Basic machine hygiene"" is how Scott Charney, the head of Microsoft Trustworthy Computing, described it Tuesday morning in a keynote speech at the RSA Conference. ""We need to ensure basic hygiene, and we need to do it at scale.""Mr. Charney offered the example of an Australian Internet service provider that quarantined one Internet protocol address - which effectively identifies a device and its users - because it kept spewing out malware. It turned out to be a badly infected machine, and its well-intentioned owner was struggling to figure out how to clean it up.The exhibition hall at the Moscone Center turned out to be a staging ground for all kinds of tonics against a contagion. Several companies promoted products directed at mobile phones and tablets. One company, TrendMicro, said its new package could, for instance, see if an infected mobile device was trying to get into a company's system. Another company, ZScaler, called itself a security check post, able to monitor every click on every device. Symantec said its new suite of anti-malware products could serve as a reverse firewall, stopping data from leaving a device if it wasn't supposed to. One start-up, Appthority, monitored risky applications, and offered companies a way to stave them off. It could, for instance, make sure executives' locations were not being tracked by triangulating which cellphone carrier towers they were near, or warn them that another application threatened to export their contacts.Along with spine-chilling talks about computer vulnerabilities, there was plenty of entertainment at the RSA convention. At one end of the convention hall, women with blue wigs raffled off iPads and Kindle Fires. At another end of the hall, women in pink fairy dresses gave away stuffed unicorns. There was candy throughout the day, pigs-in-blanket at lunch and free beer at 5 o'clock. "
"In Europe, a Facebook Privacy Face-Off","BERLIN -- As Wall Street prepares for a record, multibillion-dollar initial stock sale from Facebook, the social networking site, a meeting with the potential to shape the economics of the deal was set to take place Monday in Vienna.Richard Allan, a former member of Parliament in Britain who is the European director of policy for Facebook, and another executive from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, will meet with Max Schrems, a 24-year-old college student.Mr. Schrems, a law student at the University of Vienna and a user of Facebook since 2008, has led a vocal campaign in Europe against what he maintains are Facebook's illegal practices of collecting and marketing users' personal data, often without consent.In less than a year, Mr. Schrems's one-person operation has morphed into a Web site, Europe Versus Facebook, and a grass-roots movement that has persuaded 40,000 people to contact Facebook in Ireland, where its European headquarters are located, to demand a summary of all the personal data the U.S. company is holding on them. Mr. Schrems and his crusade have become a cause celebre in parts of Europe, attracting the attention of lawmakers in Brussels as the Continent begins a lengthy debate over tough new proposed restrictions on personal data, which could affect Web businesses like Facebook.Last month, the author of a proposed European data protection law, which would update a 1995 statute to reflect the realities of the digital age, cited Mr. Schrems's case as an example of why European lawmakers should adopt tightened controls over Web businesses.The plan put forward by Viviane Reding, the European justice commissioner, would give E.U. residents the right to opt out more easily of standard data collection practices used by businesses like Facebook. It would also compel companies to expunge all personal data, permanently, at a consumer's request.Both elements have the potential to hamper the data-harvesting engine that is at the heart of Facebook's advertising-driven business, and of its value.Facebook said in a statement that its data practices followed European law and that the company had gone out of its way to meet Mr. Schrems's request for personal information. The company also noted that Facebook users could easily obtain a copy of their information on Facebook by using a function within their personal account settings.The company said a report in December from an Irish regulator demonstrated ''how Facebook adheres to European data protection principles and complies with Irish law.'' It says it is not only fully compliant with E.U. data protection laws, but ''we also strongly believe that every Facebook user owns his or her own data and should have simple and easy access to it.''Mr. Schrems appeared on Facebook's radar last June when he filed a complaint against the company with the Irish regulator, the office of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, in Port Arlington, Ireland. He alleged 22 violations of European law. Mr. Schrems filed the grievance after using a provision of Irish law to obtain from Facebook a copy of all of the information the company had been keeping on him.Facebook sent Mr. Schrems a computer disc containing 1,222 pages of information.The disc, Mr. Schrems said, showed that Facebook was routinely collecting data that he had never consented to give, like his physical location, which he assumes was determined from his computer's unique address identifiers, which can be traced geographically. Facebook was also retaining data he had deleted, Mr. Schrems said.Irish officials began an audit based on his complaints and in October visited Facebook's offices in the Hanover Quay section of Dublin, where the company employs more than 400 workers to direct many of its global operations outside North America.On Dec. 21, the Irish regulator, which has a staff of only 22 employees, released a 150-page report that gave Facebook until July to make a series of changes in the way it collects and retains data and how it explains to users how their information is being used.Mr. Schrems, during an interview last week, said the Irish inquiry and the regulator's agreement with Facebook had not addressed ''90 percent'' of his complaints. Mr. Schrems said he planned to request a ''formal decision'' from Irish officials, which would give him the legal basis to challenge the regulator's findings in Irish court.Gary Davis, the deputy Irish data commissioner who led the audit on Facebook, said his agency had obtained significant concessions from Facebook that had had positive effects for the 854 million active global users of the site. After 40,000 people requested their own data from Facebook Ireland, the company responded, Mr. Davis said, by creating a software tool in October on the Web site that gives all users a quick overview of the data being kept on file.Facebook announced improvements to that tool last week, Mr. Davis said, to provide more detailed information, and has committed to providing even more by July, when the regulator will revisit Facebook's offices to check whether it has honored its commitments.That visit could coincide with Facebook's I.P.O., which could take place as early as May, depending on the length of the regulatory review in the United States.Mr. Davis said that Facebook, as a result of Mr. Schrems's campaign, had agreed to cut the amount of time it retains data on most user activities on the Web site to less than one year. Queries typed into Facebook's search field are deleted within six months, in conformance with European law. Previously, Mr. Davis said, the company had no comprehensive policy on data retention, with times often dictated by the perceived level of security threats and cyberattacks on the business.''We still view Max very favorably for the issues he has raised, which were very specific and well prepared and have led to concrete improvements in how Facebook does business,'' Mr. Davis said. ''I obviously think we have achieved a lot in Ireland by getting Facebook to improve its transparency and data protection practices.''Mr. Schrems said the concessions from Facebook had been insufficient. At the time of its release, Thilo Weichert, the data protection commissioner in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, criticized the Irish regulator, saying it had identified infractions in Facebook's handling of consumer data but had not taken a harder line or imposed financial penalties.The main issue, Mr. Schrems said, is that no one, including the Irish regulator, is independently verifying whether Facebook is doing what it says it will do in terms of permanently deleting personal information and shortening data retention times.''No one is actually looking into the computers,'' Mr. Schrems said. ''The regulators are just getting statements from different parties and deciding based on a vacuum.''Mr. Davis, the Irish regulator, said Facebook had given him full access to the data it kept. "
"Consumer Data, But Not for Consumers","BUPKIS. Zilch. Zip. Niente. Zero. Nada.I recently asked to see the information held about me by the Acxiom Corporation, a database marketing company that collects and sells details about consumers' financial status, shopping and recreational activities to banks, retailers, automakers and other businesses. In investor presentations and interviews, Acxiom executives have said that the company -- the subject of a Sunday Business article last month -- has information on about 500 million active consumers worldwide, with about 1,500 data points per person. Acxiom also promotes a program for consumers who wish to see the information the company has on them.As a former pharmaceuticals industry reporter who has researched all kinds of diseases, drugs and quack cures online, I wanted to learn, for one, whether Acxiom had pegged me as concerned about arthritis, diabetes or allergies. Acxiom also has a proprietary household classification system that places people in one of 70 socioeconomic categories, like ''Downtown Dwellers'' or ''Flush Families,'' and I hoped to discover the caste to which it had assigned me. But after I filled out an online request form and sent a personal check for $5 to cover the processing fee, the company simply sent me a list of some of my previous residential addresses. In other words, rather than learning the details about myself that marketers might use to profile and judge me, I received information I knew already.It turns out that Acxiom, based in Little Rock, Ark., furnishes consumers only with data related to risk management, like their own prison records, tax liens, bankruptcy filings and residential histories. For a corporate client, the company is able to match customers by name with, say, the social networks or Internet providers they use, but it does not offer consumers the same information about themselves.Jennifer Barrett Glasgow, Acxiom's chief privacy officer, said that the company kept consumer data in different databases and that its system was not designed to assemble all the information it had amassed on a single person.''We do not have the capability to look up an individual's data in the system,'' Ms. Barrett Glasgow said. ''We don't have a search-by-name capability.''Data brokers like Acxiom have developed advanced techniques to collect and collate information about consumers' offline, online and mobile behavior. But they have been slow to develop innovative ways for consumers to gain access to the information that companies obtain, share and sell about them for marketing purposes.Now federal regulators are pressuring data brokers to operate more transparently. In a report earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission recommended that the industry set up a public Web portal that would display the names and contact information of data brokers, as well as describe consumers' data access rights and other choices.Julie Brill, a member of the Federal Trade Commission, said consumers should have access to all the details that data brokers collect on them, as well as any analyses that the companies sell about their behavior.''I include in that not just the raw data, but also how that information has been analyzed to place the consumer into certain categories for marketing or other purposes,'' she said. ''I believe that giving consumers this kind of granularity will greatly increase consumer trust in the information flow process and will lead to more accurate marketing.''At the moment, however, information brokers have wildly different policies. Acxiom lets people opt out of its marketing databases, while Epsilon, another marketing services firm, allows people to opt out of having their data rented to third parties. Epsilon says it will also furnish individuals, upon request, with general information about their past retail transactions -- including the categories and years of purchase. But it does not include exact product or retailer names.Andrew Frawley, the president of Epsilon, says his company has set up a task force to explore giving consumers greater access and choices.''We agree in principle that more transparency is better,'' he said.But setting up a system for consumers to gain access to their own marketing data could be costly and technically challenging for data brokers, said Stuart Madnick, a professor of information technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Companies would have to develop security systems to verify a consumer's identity and to ensure that no one else could have access to that individual's record, he said. At the same time, they would have to be prepared to respond to people who questioned the accuracy of the records.''How correct is the information they have and are disseminating on you?'' Professor Madnick asked. ''How do they know who is asking for it?''Information security experts said data brokers might be reluctant to make public access easier lest consumers react by wanting to opt out of the data collection process altogether.In early May, when I first looked at Acxiom's Web site, the online request form that required consumers to submit their Social Security numbers and other sensitive personal information was not encrypted. (Ms. Barrett Glasgow said the company quickly identified and fixed a broken link that had caused the problem.) After I submitted my application, I didn't hear back from the company for several weeks. Subsequently, I left a voice mail message on Acxiom's consumer hot line. Nobody called back.''It sounds like this form was not a high priority for them,'' said Richard M. Smith, the founder of Boston Software Forensics, a consulting firm, and an expert on Internet security. Requiring consumers to mail in a personal check as part of the verification process, he added, seemed old-fashioned and cumbersome. ''It's so last century. Why are you making it so inconvenient?''After I reported in the article last month that Acxiom had not responded to my data request, a company representative e-mailed me to verify that I was indeed the person who had requested her file. Then Acxiom e-mailed me an encrypted report containing a list of my previous residential addresses.Several days later, Ms. Barrett Glasgow called to explain the delay in processing: Acxiom receives, on average, fewer than 100 requests a year from consumers, she said, and my check had ''ended up on someone's desk that was on vacation.'' She said she would look into why company representatives hadn't returned my voice mail message.''We'll try to take some action to improve and clean up the program,'' she said. ''We don't want to make it hard to do, risky to do, or leave a bad impression in the individual's mind.''BUT I still wanted to know the financial, retail, travel, health and hobby details that Acxiom might have collected about me. So I e-mailed Ms. Barrett Glasgow last month, asking to see at least some of my data and to find out the socioeconomic category in which Acxiom had placed me.Ms. Barrett Glasgow was on vacation last week and could not be reached for comment.Commissioner Brill of the F.T.C. said she could not comment on specific companies. But she said the reluctance of the data broker industry to show consumers their own records reminded her of an earlier era, when consumer reporting agencies -- companies that track and sell information about people's credit histories -- protested that it would be too expensive and time-consuming for them to show individuals the same reports that creditors could see. In 1996, Congress updated the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, giving people greater access to the files that those agencies held about them. Today, consumers can easily gain access to their credit reports online.''What the credit reporting industry did was change their point of view from client-oriented to consumer-oriented, and develop the tools and technology to allow consumers to see what's in their reports and ensure it is accurate,'' Ms. Brill said. ''The data broker industry could do the exact same thing.''E-mail: slipstream@nytimes.com "
I.S.S. Investigates Claim of Data Leaks,"Institutional Shareholder Services, the biggest player in the shareholder advisory world, disclosed on Monday that it was conducting an investigation into a claim that an employee improperly leaked confidential investor voting data in exchange for cash and gifts.MSCI, the parent of I.S.S., disclosed the internal inquiry in a regulatory filing, adding that it had placed an unidentified employee on administrative leave as part of the investigation.The filing came after an article in The New York Post on Sunday reporting that a whistle-blower had filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission about suspected actions by a midlevel executive at I.S.S. Proxy advisory firms like I.S.S. produce research reports that urge shareholders to vote one way or another on various corporate matters that come up at investor meetings. I.S.S. also runs ProxyExchange, a tool that allows shareholders to vote directly on a given matter. That gives the firm unique insight into how shareholder elections are proceeding. The complaint lays out purported examples of the employee selling confidential investor voting totals to proxy solicitor firms, which are hired to advise companies on matters requiring shareholder votes. Their most prominent showing is in proxy fights, when companies and activists look to such firms to give them near-real-time insights into how investors are voting -- and to help craft strategies that will sway elections.These firms normally work through endless rounds of calls to investors. But according to The Post, the whistle-blower complaint says that the I.S.S. employee sold investor voting data to proxy solicitors days or weeks in advance. That could give clients of such firms an enormous advantage in hotly contested situations. "
"Meg Whitman's Defining Moment, Still Undefined","LAS VEGAS -- Meg Whitman spoke Tuesday morning to 10,000 customers and partners at an event in the gambling capital. It was her biggest public performance as the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. In a sense it was her defining moment: after the turmoil of the last couple of years, she tried to define what H.P. is and does, and why the company still matters.""My job is to set the stage and frame the story,"" she told the crowd. ""This is about taking the incredible depth and breadth of our technology, and making H.P. greater than the sum of its parts.""What that means, she said, is that H.P. would provide hardware and software for a world of cloud computing and mobile Internet use that was more powerful and secure than the competition, with greater security and more analytic insight. That will make its products more valuable than commodity hardware, she said. The company's associated consumer rebranding around the line ""make it matter"" seems like a promise that H.P. will also deliver passionate experiences.""Our future is the power of hardware, software, and services, delivered as solutions,"" she said. ""We have to be more than the sum of our parts."" She spoke onstage about H.P. enabling credit card transactions and mobile phone calls. ""Our purpose is to advance the way we all live and work.""There were no blockbuster product announcements, just talk of ""solutions,"" perhaps the word most abused by the tech industry. The statement of principles was backed up onstage with a long endorsement of H.P. by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chief executive of Dreamworks SKG, who H.P. executives have trotted out in the past. But it seemed critical to her. The focus on delivering experiences also indicates that H.P.'s salesmen will be able to function something like consultants with industry knowledge, a better version of Dell and a less-expensive version of IBM. So far, there is no sign of how that will happen.Still, the message mattered. Ms. Whitman got her job last September after years of turmoil at the top of H.P., too soon to offer much new in the way of products. Her predecessor, Leo Apotheker, said the hardware giant needed to be a software company, a line that confused customers and employees. Both groups are still absorbing recent news that H.P will lay off 27,000 people.It may have been a valuable speech, if one thin on specifics. Talking with customers and employees on the show floor, I noted how few of them could actually say what H.P. was and did, or (from the employees) who these customers were and what they wanted. If Ms. Whitman can drive home a common definition, the company can get back to work on growing in a specific direction. "
The Breakfast Meeting: The Web Rages and Gingrich Pushes Back at ABC,"The campaign of Newt Gingrich issued an open letter on Wednesday night to ""ABC News leadership,'' as word leaked out - if a siren on Drudge Report can be called a leak -- that the network had conducted an interview with one of Mr. Gingrich's former wives, Marianne Gingrich. The letter, signed by Mr. Gingrich's two daughters from his first marriage, Kathy Lubbers and Jackie Cushman, faulted the network for engaging in ""talk about the past, just days before an important primary election,"" Trip Gabriel and Brian Stelter reported. The interview will be broadcast on ""Nightline"" at 11:35 p.m. Thursday, shortly after a Republican debate sponsored by CNN.In the fight over online antipiracy legislation, Jonathan Weisman writes, it appeared that ""Congress would follow Bank of America, Netflix and Verizon as the latest institution to change course in the face of a netizen revolt."" During a day of online protest, led by hugely popular sites like Google and Wikipedia, phone calls and e-mail messages poured in to Congressional offices against the legislation -- Stop Online Piracy Act in the House and the Protect I.P.

The scene didn't escape viewers' notice, if Twitter is any judge. "
Computer-Hacking Allegations Made Against News Corporation,"News Corporation faced fresh scrutiny in Britain on Tuesday after a BBC documentary reported that a company affiliated with the media conglomerate used computer hacking to advance the business interests of the broadcaster BSkyB.BBC1's Panorama program said that NDS Group, a television software developer in which News Corporation holds a minority stake, paid a consultant to ""crack"" and publish on a pirate Web site the smart-card codes of ITV Digital, a failed pay service that was started by ITV, Britain's free-to-air broadcaster.News Corporation owns 39.1 percent of BSkyB and James Murdoch serves as chairman of the board. The media company dropped its $12 billion bid to take over all of BSkyB in July amid a phone-hacking scandal at its tabloid The News of the World, which has since been closed.The BBC program said the alleged hacking led to mass piracy and technical problems at ITV Digital (known as OnDigital at the time of the alleged hacking). The service collapsed in 2002, leaving the competitive landscape open for BSkyB.Tom Watson, one of the most vocal members of the British Parliament on the question of phone hacking at The News of the World, said that, if true, the allegations against NDS could raise questions about whether News Corporation would pass the ""fit and proper"" requirement to operate as a broadcaster.NDS has consistently denied any wrongdoing. In a statement, NDS said, ""It is wrong to claim that NDS has ever been in the possession of any codes for the purpose of promoting hacking or piracy.""Attorneys for News Corporation called the allegations raised by the BBC documentary, which aired Monday in Britain, ""serious, defamatory, false and highly damaging"" and urged British newspapers not to repeat the allegations.The allegations come days after Cisco Systems said it planned to buy NDS Group for roughly $5 billion. The private equity firm Permira owns 51 percent; News Corporation owns 49 percent.NDS, a British-based company, provides antipiracy smart cards for set-top boxes and DVRs that help satellite TV systems prevent signals from being stolen. NDS has 5,000 employees operating in five countries; BSkyB is one of its largest clients.In the past, NDS has prevailed after accusations of wrongdoing. In a lawsuit filed in 2002 in Federal District Court in New York, Vivendi Universal's Canal Plus Group accused NDS of corporate espionage and conspiracy. DirecTV also sued DNS, alleging fraud and misappropriation of trade secrets. Vivendi and DirecTV withdrew the lawsuits.In January, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of NDS and awarded the company $19 million in damages after a protracted battle with EchoStar (now Dish Network). In a 2003 lawsuit, EchoStar had accused NDS of hacking into its system.""It is only with the active antipiracy efforts of companies such as ourselves that the pay-TV industry is able to evolve and continue to enable people to enjoy premium TV viewing,"" NDS's executive chairman, Abe Peled, said in a statement last week when the company announced it had received its full damages payment.In 1992, News Corporation paid $15 million for NDS, then an Israeli start-up, to provide encryption services for its burgeoning satellite-television business. "
Iran's Hand Is Suspected In Computer Attacks,"WASHINGTON -- American intelligence officials are increasingly convinced that Iran was the origin of a serious wave of network attacks that crippled computers across the Saudi oil industry and breached financial institutions in the United States, episodes that contributed to a warning last week from Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta that the United States was at risk of a ''cyber-Pearl Harbor.''After Mr. Panetta's remarks on Thursday night, American officials described an emerging shadow war of attacks and counterattacks already under way between the United States and Iran in cyberspace.Among American officials, suspicion has focused on the ''cybercorps'' that Iran's military created in 2011 -- partly in response to American and Israeli cyberattacks on the Iranian nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz -- though there is no hard evidence that the attacks were sanctioned by the Iranian government. The attacks emanating from Iran have inflicted only modest damage. Iran's cyberwarfare capabilities are considerably weaker than those in China and Russia, which intelligence officials believe are the sources of a significant number of probes, thefts of intellectual property and attacks on American companies and government agencies.The attack under closest scrutiny hit Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, in August. Saudi Arabia is Iran's main rival in the region and is among the Arab states that have argued privately for the toughest actions against Iran. Aramco, the Saudi state oil company, has been bolstering supplies to customers who can no longer obtain oil from Iran because of Western sanctions.The virus that hit Aramco is called Shamoon and spread through computers linked over a network to erase files on about 30,000 computers by overwriting them. Mr. Panetta, while not directly attributing the strike to Iran in his speech, called it ''probably the most destructive attack that the private sector has seen to date.''Until the attack on Aramco, most of the cybersabotage coming out of Iran appeared to be what the industry calls ''denial of service'' attacks, relatively crude efforts to send a nearly endless stream of computer-generated requests aimed at overwhelming networks. But as one consultant to the United States government on the attacks put it several days ago: ''What the Iranians want to do now is make it clear they can disrupt our economy, just as we are disrupting theirs. And they are quite serious about it.''The revelation that Iran may have been the source of the computer attacks was reported earlier by The Washington Post and The Associated Press.The attacks on American financial institutions, which prevented some bank customers from gaining access to their accounts online but did not involve any theft of money, seemed to come from various spots around the world, and so their origins are not certain. There is some question about whether those attacks may have involved outside programming help, perhaps from Russia.Mr. Panetta spoke only in broad terms, stating that Iran had ''undertaken a concerted effort to use cyberspace to its advantage.'' Almost immediately, experts in cybersecurity rushed to fill in the blanks.''His speech laid the dots alongside each other without connecting them,'' James A. Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote Friday in an essay for ForeignPolicy.com. ''Iran has discovered a new way to harass much sooner than expected, and the United States is ill-prepared to deal with it.''Iran has a motive, to retaliate for both the American-led financial sanctions that have cut its oil exports nearly in half, and for the cybercampaign by the United States and Israel against Iran's nuclear enrichment complex at Natanz.That campaign started in the Bush administration, when the United States and Israel first began experimenting with an entirely new generation of weapon: a cyberworm that could infiltrate another state's computers and then cause havoc on computer-controlled machinery. In this case, it resulted in the destruction of roughly a fifth of the nuclear centrifuges that Iran uses to enrich uranium, though the centrifuges were eventually replaced, and Iran's production capability has recovered.Iran became aware of the attacks in the summer of 2010, when the computer worm escaped from the Natanz plant and was replicated across the globe. The computer industry soon named the escaped weapon Stuxnet.Iran announced last year that it had begun its own military cyberunit, and Brig. Gen. Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's Passive Defense Organization, said the Iranian military was prepared ''to fight our enemies'' in ''cyberspace and Internet warfare.'' Little is known about how that group is organized, or where it has bought or developed its expertise.The United States has never acknowledged its role in creating the Stuxnet virus, nor has it said anything about the huge covert program that created it, code-named Olympic Games, which was first revealed earlier this year by The New York Times. President Obama drastically expanded the program as a way to buy time for sanctions to affect Iran, and to stave off a military attack on the Iranian facilities by Israel, which he feared could quickly escalate into a broader war.In advance of Mr. Panetta's speech in New York on Thursday, senior officials debated how much to talk about the United States's offensive capabilities, assessing whether such an acknowledgment could help create a deterrent for countries contemplating attacks on the countryBut Mr. Panetta carefully avoided using the words ''offense'' or ''offensive'' in the context of American cyberwarfare, instead defining the Pentagon's capabilities as ''action to defend the nation.''''We won't succeed in preventing a cyber attack through improved defenses alone,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''If we detect an imminent threat of attack that will cause significant, physical destruction in the United States or kill American citizens, we need to have the option to take action against those who would attack us to defend this nation when directed by the president. For these kinds of scenarios, the department has developed that capability to conduct effective operations to counter threats to our national interests in cyberspace.''The comments indicated that the United States might redefine defense in cyberspace as requiring the capacity to reach forward over computer networks if an attack was detected or anticipated, and take pre-emptive action. These same offensive measures also could be used in a punishing retaliation for a first-strike cyberattack on an American target, senior officials said.One senior intelligence official described a debate inside the Obama administration over the pros and cons of openly admitting that the United States has deployed a new cyber weapon, and could use it in response to an attack, or pre-emptively.For now, officials have decided to hold back. ''The countries who need to know we have it already know,'' the senior intelligence official said. "
U.S. Focuses on Growing Threat as Rivals Deploy Cheap but Potent Weapons,"WASHINGTON -- President Obama's new military strategy has focused fresh attention on an increasingly important threat: the use of inexpensive weapons like mines and cyberattacks that aim not to defeat the American military in battle but to keep it at a distance.The president and his national security team predict that the security challenges of the coming decade will be defined by this threat, just as the last one was defined by terrorism and insurgency. A growing number of nations whose forces are overmatched by the United States are fielding these weapons, which can slow, disrupt and perhaps even halt an American offensive. Modern war plans can become mired in a bog of air defenses, mines, missiles, electronic jamming and computer-network attacks meant to degrade American advantages in technology and hardware.It is a lesson that potential enemies drew from the way American public support for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan plummeted as armored vehicles -- each costing millions of dollars -- were broken and their troops killed and maimed by roadside bombs costing only a few hundred dollars apiece.China and Iran were identified as the countries that were leading the pursuit of ''asymmetric means'' to counter American military force, according to the new strategy document, which cautioned that these relatively inexpensive measures were spreading to terrorist and guerrilla cells.At his announcement at the Pentagon last week, Mr. Obama said the country should invest in ''the ability to operate in environments where adversaries try to deny us access.''The new strategy specifically orders that efforts to counter the threat, which the military calls ''anti-access, area-denial,'' become one of the 10 primary missions of the American military. That will help define how the four armed services compete for shares of a shrinking Pentagon budget.''The United States must maintain its ability to project power in areas in which our access and freedom to operate are challenged,'' the strategy document said.''Sophisticated adversaries will use asymmetric capabilities, to include electronic and cyberwarfare, ballistic and cruise missiles, advanced air defenses, mining and other methods to complicate our operational calculus.''For example, in recent exercises by the naval arm of the Revolutionary Guards, Iran has practiced ''swarming'' attacks by a number of small, fast boats that could be loaded with high explosives; if one such boat got through, it might blast a hole in the hull of a major American warship.''Iran's navy -- especially the naval arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards -- has invested in vessels and armaments that are well suited to asymmetric warfare, rather than the sort of ship-to-ship conflict that Iran would surely lose,'' Michael Singh, managing director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, wrote in a recent essay for Foreign Policy.With Chinese and Russian help, Mr. Singh added, Iran is also fielding sophisticated mines, midget submarines and mobile antiship cruise missiles.Nathan Freier, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, ''Iran's capabilities are best suited for imposing high costs on those who might need to force their way through the Strait of Hormuz, and on those in the region whom the Iranians perceive as being complicit in enabling foreign access.''The potential challenge from China is even more significant, according to analysts. China has a fleet of diesel-electric attack submarines, which can operate quietly and effectively in waters near China's shore to threaten foreign warships. China also fields short-, medium- and long-range missiles that could put warships at risk, and has layers of radar and surface-to-air missiles along its coast.Finding, identifying and striking an American warship is a complex military operation. But the thicket of Chinese defenses could oblige an American aircraft carrier and its strike group to operate hundreds of miles farther out to sea, decreasing the number of attack sorties its aircraft could mount in a day and diminishing their effectiveness.Perhaps most worrisome is China's focus on electronic warfare and computer-network attacks, which might blunt the accuracy of advanced American munitions guided by satellite.To counter these threats, the Air Force and Navy set up an office to develop complementary tactics and weaponry for what they are calling air-sea battle.One idea is to attack an outer ring of enemy air defenses with F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, opening an alley for an F-22 stealth jet carrying sensitive surveillance pods to fly deeper into contested territory, where it could, for example, guide a powerful sea-launched cruise missile to a mobile or hidden target.According to Lt. Gen. Herbert J. Carlisle, the Air Force deputy chief of staff for operations, plans and requirements, American computer warfare techniques could be used to spoil an adversary's decision-making process. ''If we can give them bad information, or we can make them doubt the good information they have,'' he said.Vice Adm. Bruce W. Clingan, the Navy's deputy chief for operations, plans and strategy, said the military was carefully studying anti-access, area-denial techniques to pinpoint potential weaknesses in an adversary's ability to identify and strike American targets.''Do you take out his ability to shoot? Do you take him out once he's shot? Do you deny him accuracy once the missile is airborne and then you create a greater 'miss distance'?'' Admiral Clingan said. ''You have to work your way across that entire effect chain and how you're going to do those things to keep those missiles from threatening you.''Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will soon release his concept for operating in an anti-access, area-denial environment. The 65-page directive will identify 30 capabilities that the armed forces will need to carry out missions across contested battlefields. "
"For Apple, Pressure Builds Over App Store Fraud","In a little over an hour, Ryan Matthew Pierson racked up $437.71 in iTunes charges for virtual currency that he could use to buy guns, nightclubs and cars in iMobsters, a popular iPhone game. One problem: Mr. Pierson, a technology writer in Texas, has never played iMobsters.''This was fraud,'' said Mr. Pierson, recalling the November incident. ''I woke up, checked my e-mail, and I could see these purchases happening in real time.''Mr. Pierson raised the issue with Apple and his bank, and the problem was eventually resolved. But his experience is hardly unique, as reflected by hundreds of online complaints saying that Apple's iTunes Store, and in particular its App Store, which the company portrays as the safest of shopping environments, is not so secure. The complaints come from consumers like Mr. Pierson, who say that their accounts have been hijacked or that some apps are falsely advertised. And they come from creators of apps, who say they are having to deal with fraudulent purchases that drain their time and resources. Software makers also complain that competition in the App Store has become so brutal that many companies resort to artificially inflating their popularity rankings to grab attention.It's a change for Apple, which was once criticized for its micromanaging of the App Store. Now the problem is not too much control, but too little.''This kind of thing just happens any time a platform is successful,'' said David Edery, chief executive of Spry Fox, a small software company that sells games in the App Store. ''People start flooding into it and it starts to get crazy.''The App Store offers more than 600,000 applications for iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches, and has already generated billions in revenue for Apple and its developers. That makes it both the best deal going for software makers and consumers, and also a hulking target for those looking to manipulate the system and cheat people.Apple declined a request for an interview, but said in a statement that it was working to enhance security. It advised customers whose payment information had been stolen to change their iTunes passwords and to contact their financial institutions.In the shadowy world of hacking, it's often unclear how criminals get iTunes passwords or credit card information. But the App Store, and Apple's broader iTunes Store, have become playgrounds for illicit transactions. And the Web is rife with App Store scams. On Chinese online marketplaces, like Taobao or DHgate, some sellers are offering access to iTunes accounts for as little as $33. One seller on DHgate, for instance, has sold 56 iTunes accounts for less than $35 each, promising thousands of dollars in ''credit.''There are services that claim to generate codes for iTunes gift cards, and forums that explain how to use prepaid Visa cards to get free App Store purchases.The scale of the problem is difficult to gauge without Apple's cooperation, though there is widespread anecdotal evidence, even on Apple's own site. On one Apple support forum, a thread titled ''iTunes store account hacked,'' there are some 1,370 replies, starting in November 2010 and extending to Thursday. Last week, more than 100 people on Twitter who said they were iTunes users complained about stolen funds.Last month, Daniel Saewitz, a 20-year-old Syracuse University student, was charged $81 for purchases related to a Chinese iPhone game. He alerted Apple and changed his iTunes password. But 24 hours later, he said, his account was hacked again. In an e-mail, Apple said it was refunding Mr. Saewitz's money, but added that it was making an exception to its usual rules.For developers, the scams can cause big headaches, eating up resources and damaging their reputations. Several game makers in China, where many of the hacks appear to originate, said they had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars because of fraud.Hoolai Game, a Beijing-based developer that introduced an iPhone app last year, looked at its monthly payments from Apple and found that they were roughly 20 to 50 percent less than the sum of the daily reports it gets from the company. Hoolai and others say they believe these missing payments are fraudulent transactions that are wiped out by Apple.More troubling for developers is that consumers whose accounts have been improperly charged often blame the game makers. The reviews in the App Store for Kingdom Conquest, from the Japanese game giant Sega, include dozens from incensed users who accuse Sega of robbing them. Sega, which first noticed a burst of fraudulent transactions last summer, is still working on the problem, according to Ben Harborne, a brand manager at the company.''We are very worried about reputation,'' said Jian Huang, the president of Hoolai, who hopes to introduce a game in the United States later this year. ''We have no way to tell the customer that we're victims too.''One successful American game developer, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by Apple, said he started to notice discrepancies in payments last summer. The developer said his team had sent multiple e-mails to Apple, but that it had not addressed whether the missing payments were a result of fraud. Over the last year, the gap has amounted to millions of dollars, according to internal documents provided by the developer.With little action from Apple, some affected developers have banded together. One Chinese developer, CocoaChina, has created an antifraud alliance of roughly a dozen developers.While many of the affected consumers and developers said they did not blame Apple for their misfortunes, nearly all said the company could be more responsive, and noted that it lacked even a dedicated phone line to deal with complaints.''Apple wants to pretend that everything is magic,'' said Alex Stamos, co-founder of iSEC Partners, a security firm. ''They need to admit that their products can be used by bad people to do bad things.''One problem, Mr. Stamos said, is that iTunes customers use a single account and password to access all Apple services. For example, the same login can be used to download a $1 game or buy a $2,000 laptop through the Apple Store app. He said that Apple could adopt a two-step verification method like Google's. For example, if a user wanted to log in to the iTunes store on a new device, Apple could send a message to his iPhone containing a code, which he would enter to verify his identity.Some App Store problems are the fault of the developers themselves -- including those who make it harder for consumers to trust the store by cheating the system. The easiest ways to find new apps are Apple's Top 25 lists for different categories, including ''most downloaded.'' But some of those downloads may not be generated by real people.Walter Kaman, an independent programmer, said he was disheartened by a phone call from a service that offered to put his game in the Top 25. He said the promoter, whom he declined to name so as not to attract clients to the service, had hired someone to build an army of software ''bots'' that automatically download apps and drive up their rankings. The company wanted $5,000 for this service, said Mr. Kaman, who declined.Mr. Edery of Spry Fox said his company was approached in October by a firm called GTekna, which offered to push its apps into the Top 25 for $10,000. Chang-Min Pak, GTekna's chief executive, said in an interview this week that it stopped offering such a service because Apple reminded developers in February that it was not allowed.Then there are the customers who have been tricked into downloading apps that are not what they seem to be. Apple has strict guidelines for developers, and it has tools and human reviewers to screen apps. But bad ones do slip through. One $2 app, for example, promises extra virtual coins for people playing the game DragonVale. But when customers download the app, no coins appear. The app has received dozens of one-star reviews from customers complaining that it is a scam and should be removed.John Casasanta, owner of the iPhone app studio Tap Tap Tap, said the issue of developers manipulating the App Store remained largely unaddressed. ''Apple has been doing the barest minimum to keep these things under control, because from their perspective, there's simply not a problem,'' Mr. Casasanta said. "
Facebook Engineers Hack the Nasdaq Button,"David Garcia, a senior software engineer at Facebook, says a small group of Facebook engineers hacked into the Nasdaq button that Mark Zuckerberg pressed to begin trading in the stock so that it would automatically update Mr. Zuckerberg's Facebook status when he pushed it. In a guest blog post on TechCrunch, Mr. Garcia explains all about it.Mr. Garcia said he suggested the idea in a message on his Facebook wall. In the blog, he wrote that Mr. Zuckerberg seemed thrilled by the idea and commented to Mr. Garcia, ""It would be epic if you pulled that off.""So a small group of engineers did just that. According to Mr. Garcia, they hacked a mobile phone to the Nasdaq button that fed directly into Mr. Zuckerberg's Facebook wall.Early this morning, when the Facebook founder pressed the button, his status updated with the following message: ""Founded in 2004, Facebook's mission is to make the world more open and connected. People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover what's going on in the world, and to share and express what matters to them."" "
Make the Punishment Fit the Cyber-Crime,"Emily Bazelon, a senior editor at Slate, is writing a book about bullying called ''Sticks and Stones.''New HavenLAST week, a New Jersey jury convicted Dharun Ravi of invasion of privacy, and for good reason. Mr. Ravi activated the webcam in his room at Rutgers so he could watch his roommate, Tyler Clementi, meet up with a male date. Worse, he broadcast his plans to do it again over Twitter, inviting his friends to watch. That kind of spying should be out of bounds on a college campus.What's out of whack about Mr. Ravi's case is the harsh punishment he now faces: as much as 10 years in prison, for a 20-year-old who'd never been in legal trouble before. Mr. Ravi could go away for years because, on top of spying, he was convicted of a hate crime: bias intimidation, a conviction probably influenced by Mr. Clementi's subsequent suicide. According to New Jersey's civil rights law, you are subject to a much higher penalty if the jury finds that you committed one of a broad range of underlying offenses for the purpose of targeting someone because of his race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation.The idea of shielding vulnerable groups is well intentioned. But with the nation on high alert over bullying -- especially when it intersects with computer technology and the Internet -- these civil rights statutes are being stretched to go after teenagers who acted meanly, but not violently. This isn't what civil rights laws should be for.New Jersey passed one of the country's first hate crimes statutes in 1981, outlawing the burning of crosses or placing of swastikas to terrorize and threaten violence. In 1990, the legislature added extra prison time for racial, ethnic or religious prejudice. ''From now on hate crimes will be serious crimes,'' Governor Jim Florio said upon signing the bill, citing ''a phone call in the middle of the night or vandalism that leaves hateful symbols in its wake or racial slurs.''In New Jersey, cases with bias intimidation charges have typically included an underlying offense of significant violence. People have been found guilty under the civil rights law for throwing punches while yelling a racial epithet, for beating a man with a metal rod while cursing him for being from India, and for threatening to shoot a driver, employing a racial slur and then tailgating him for miles. These are cases in which prejudice twists into ugly and serious harm.Teenagers have also previously been charged with bias intimidation. One boy was convicted for being the ringleader of a bunch of children who ganged up on a girl, calling her a lesbian. Another teenager got in trouble for shoving a boy, using a racial slur and threatening to hang him from a tree. But as juveniles, the kids in these cases were spared harsh punishment. The boy who did the shoving was ordered to spend 10 days in juvenile detention and read the book ''Black Like Me.''Mr. Ravi was 18 years old when he spied on Mr. Clementi, legally an adult, but he did things that reek of immature homophobia. He told a friend he wanted to ''keep the gays away,'' and when he set up his webcam a second time, his tweets and texts showed that he was giddily trading on Mr. Clementi's homosexuality to get attention.Was Mr. Clementi intimidated by Mr. Ravi's spying? The record is mixed, but inflected by Mr. Clementi's suicide a day after the second spying incident. Though it's not clear how much Mr. Ravi's actions influenced his roommate's decision to take his own life, the proximity in time is chilling.Given how broadly the civil rights laws are written, it's not surprising that prosecutors turned to them to ramp up the charges against Mr. Ravi, especially because this normally increases the pressure on a defendant to plead guilty. The state then made Mr. Ravi a fair offer: community service in exchange for admitting to invading Mr. Clementi's privacy. It was Mr. Ravi's mistake not to take it.And yet, if Mr. Ravi spends years in prison, his case will set an alarming precedent of disproportional punishment. The spying he did was criminal, but it was also, as his lawyer put it, ''stupid kid'' behavior.Mr. Ravi isn't the only person caught in this legal snare. After bullying was blamed for the suicide two years ago of Phoebe Prince, a 15-year-old in South Hadley, Mass., prosecutors criminally charged six teenagers. That time, the district attorney used the state's civil rights laws to directly blame five of them for Phoebe's death. Like Mr. Ravi, they faced a sentence of up to 10 years. Never mind that the Massachusetts law had previously been used against violent racist thugs. Because it was broadly written, like New Jersey's, prosecutors could seize upon the law because it ''sent a message'' about bullying, as one of them later said.The Massachusetts cases ended with a whimper: After the district attorney who brought the civil rights charges left office, her successor dropped the charges against one teenager and wisely resolved the cases against the other five, who admitted some wrongdoing, with probation and community service.Mr. Ravi, of course, will not be so lucky. States like New Jersey and Massachusetts should narrow their civil rights laws so that he's not the first of many stupid but nonviolent young people who pay a too-heavy price for our fears about how kids use technology to be cruel.

Daily Report: Anonymous Feeds Stolen E-Mail to WikiLeaks," WikiLeaks announced on Sunday that it would release reams of e-mail correspondence from Stratfor, a geopolitical analysis firm, detailing the work of the company for clients, Somini Sengupta reports in The New York Times on Monday.  WikiLeaks did not disclose how it obtained the e-mails, but Stratfor acknowledged in December that its data servers were breached by a group of hackers known as Anonymous, a loose-knit group that publicly supports WikiLeaks.A WikiLeaks news release said the messages ""reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations."" Stratfor released a statement that said the e-mail released by WikiLeaks might have been altered and condemned the ""deplorable, unfortunate - and illegal - breach of privacy.""Wired's Threat Level blog said it had been told by members of Anonymous that the group had turned the e-mails over to WikiLeaks because that group would be better able to analyze and disseminate the information. In other Anonymous news, Nicole Perlroth and John Markoff report in The Times on Monday on a new study that details an attack by Anonymous on the Vatican last year, one that did not receive much notice at the time.  While the attack was largely unsuccessful, the study casts light on the group's methods. "
A Weapon We Can't Control,"Misha Glenny, a visiting professor at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs, is the author of ''DarkMarket: Cyberthieves, Cybercops and You.''LondonTHE decision by the United States and Israel to develop and then deploy the Stuxnet computer worm against an Iranian nuclear facility late in George W. Bush's presidency marked a significant and dangerous turning point in the gradual militarization of the Internet. Washington has begun to cross the Rubicon. If it continues, contemporary warfare will change fundamentally as we move into hazardous and uncharted territory.It is one thing to write viruses and lock them away safely for future use should circumstances dictate it. It is quite another to deploy them in peacetime. Stuxnet has effectively fired the starting gun in a new arms race that is very likely to lead to the spread of similar and still more powerful offensive cyberweaponry across the Internet. Unlike nuclear or chemical weapons, however, countries are developing cyberweapons outside any regulatory framework. There is no international treaty or agreement restricting the use of cyberweapons, which can do anything from controlling an individual laptop to disrupting an entire country's critical telecommunications or banking infrastructure. It is in the United States' interest to push for one before the monster it has unleashed comes home to roost.Stuxnet was originally deployed with the specific aim of infecting the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in Iran. This required sneaking a memory stick into the plant to introduce the virus to its private and secure ''offline'' network. But despite Natanz's isolation, Stuxnet somehow escaped into the cyberwild, eventually affecting hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide.This is one of the frightening dangers of an uncontrolled arms race in cyberspace; once released, virus developers generally lose control of their inventions, which will inevitably seek out and attack the networks of innocent parties. Moreover, all countries that possess an offensive cyber capability will be tempted to use it now that the first shot has been fired.Until recent revelations by The New York Times's David E. Sanger, there was no definitive proof that America was behind Stuxnet. Now computer security experts have found a clear link between its creators and a newly discovered virus called Flame, which transforms infected computers into multipurpose espionage tools and has infected machines across the Middle East.The United States has long been a commendable leader in combating the spread of malicious computer code, known as malware, that pranksters, criminals, intelligence services and terrorist organizations have been using to further their own ends. But by introducing such pernicious viruses as Stuxnet and Flame, America has severely undermined its moral and political credibility.Flame circulated on the Web for at least four years and evaded detection by the big antivirus operators like McAfee, Symantec, Kaspersky Labs and F-Secure -- companies that are vital to ensuring that law-abiding consumers can go about their business on the Web unmolested by the army of malware writers, who release nasty computer code onto the Internet to steal our money, data, intellectual property or identities. But senior industry figures have now expressed deep worries about the state-sponsored release of the most potent malware ever seen.During the cold war, countries' chief assets were missiles with nuclear warheads. Generally their number and location was common knowledge, as was the damage they could inflict and how long it would take them to inflict it.Advanced cyberwar is different: a country's assets lie as much in the weaknesses of enemy computer defenses as in the power of the weapons it possesses. So in order to assess one's own capability, there is a strong temptation to penetrate the enemy's systems before a conflict erupts. It is no good trying to hit them once hostilities have broken out; they will be prepared and there's a risk that they already will have infected your systems. Once the logic of cyberwarfare takes hold, it is worryingly pre-emptive and can lead to the uncontrolled spread of malware.Until now, America has been reluctant to discuss regulation of the Internet with Russia and China. Washington believes any moves toward a treaty might undermine its presumed superiority in the field of cyberweaponry and robotics. And it fears that Moscow and Beijing would exploit a global regulation of military activity on the Web, in order to justify and further strengthen the powerful tools they already use to restrict their citizens' freedom on the Net. The United States must now consider entering into discussions, anathema though they may be, with the world's major powers about the rules governing the Internet as a military domain.Any agreement should regulate only military uses of the Internet and should specifically avoid any clauses that might affect private or commercial use of the Web. Nobody can halt the worldwide rush to create cyberweapons, but a treaty could prevent their deployment in peacetime and allow for a collective response to countries or organizations that violate it.Technical superiority is not written in stone, and the United States is arguably more dependent on networked computer systems than any other country in the world. Washington must halt the spiral toward an arms race, which, in the long term, it is not guaranteed to win. "
New Online Storage Service to Put Users in Charge,"WELLINGTON -- Kim Dotcom, the founder of the closed file-sharing site Megaupload, which had housed material as varied as family photos and blockbuster films, announced Thursday a new online storage service called Mega that will give users direct control over -- and responsibility for -- their files. Mega will begin service in January, just before Mr. Dotcom, the Internet entrepreneur, is scheduled to face a hearing on whether he can be extradited from New Zealand to the United States, where he and other Megaupload operators face charges of online piracy, fraud and money laundering.The U.S. government alleges that Megaupload, once one of the world's most popular Web sites, was directly responsible for illegally uploaded content and that it netted $175 million from unlawful activities.''The new Mega will not be threatened by U.S. prosecutors,'' Mr. Dotcom said in an interview, adding that he was confident Mega would avoid violating U.S. law. ''The new Mega avoids any dealings with U.S. hosters, U.S. domains and U.S. backbone providers and has changed the way it operates to avoid another takedown.''In other words, the new site will not use U.S.-based host companies as partners in an effort to avoid being shut down by the U.S. authorities.Megaupload was shut down last January. New Zealand police helicopters swooped into Mr. Dotcom's mansion outside Auckland to seize computers and other evidence at the request of the U.S. authorities.Users of the new service will be able to upload, store and share photos, text files, music and films, encrypt those files and grant access using unique decryption keys. ''You hold the keys to what you store in the cloud, not us,'' a statement on the Mega Web site said.While the new site will operate faster and have a bigger storage capacity, the encryption technology is a major change from Megaupload, with the objective that Mega operators will not have access to files and will therefore be immune to content liability.The encryption system also aims to make it the job of content owners to ensure that files are not pirated, a major change from Megaupload, which the U.S. film industry says was directly responsible for taking down illegally uploaded content.''Content owners can still remove infringing material and they will even get direct delete access if they agree not to make us responsible for actions of users,'' Mr. Dotcom said.

LinkedIn Was Breached. Now What Do You Do?,"Security researchers have confirmed that a file containing 6.5 million encoded LinkedIn passwords has been posted to a Russian hacker site. LinkedIn has yet to confirm the breach, but it took to its Twitter account Wednesday to tell users it was investigating the matter.It is unclear whether the file represents the full extent of the breach. Paul Kocher, president of Cryptography Research, a computer security company in San Francisco, said it appeared that LinkedIn's user credentials had been compromised because it stored log-in information on its main Web servers instead of isolating those files on separate, secure machines whose only function was to verify log-in details.The passwords are encoded in what is called hash cryptography, in which the standard letters and numbers are encrypted into a table of what seems to be random numbers and letters.As hackers work quickly to crack those ""hashed"" passwords -- chances are they already have -- LinkedIn users would do well to change their passwords immediately.Here is the important thing to note if you are worried about your password being taken. You need to change the password not just for LinkedIn, but for any other site where you might have used the same password, or any site for which you might have given a simple password for that matter.Here are some quick tips in the meantime:Throw out the dictionaryStop using simple passwords. To crack passwords, hackers often use automated tools. Any password that can be found in the dictionary is useless. ""The worst passwords are dictionary words or a small number of insertions or changes to words that are in the dictionary,"" said Mr. Kocher.Consider an easy-to-remember phrase that contains two or three words, or stringing together only the first few letters of each word in a sentence that would be difficult to guess. The longer the password, the better.Never use the same password twicePeople tend to use the same password across multiple sites, a fact hackers are all too happy to exploit. While cracking into someone's professional profile on LinkedIn might not have huge consequences, hackers can use that password to crack into, say, someone's e-mail, bank, corporate account or brokerage firm, where sensitive financial and personal details are free for the taking.Choose your security questions carefullyHackers can easily reset your password using basic information found on the Internet. During the 2008 presidential campaign, a hacker was able to reset Sarah Palin's password using her birth date, ZIP code and information about where she met her husband -- the security question on her Yahoo account, the answer to which --""Wasilla High""-- was available on the Web. On Tuesday, a hacker claimed he had been able to crack into Mitt Romney's Hotmail and Dropbox accounts using the name of his favorite pet.Store your passwords somewhere safeDo not store your passwords in your e-mail inbox. Consider a password manager, password-protected software that lets you store all your usernames and passwords in one place. Some programs will even create strong passwords for you and automatically log you into sites as long as you provide one master password. Those programs also make it impossible for hackers to crack your accounts using keystroke logging software or a phishing attack. Several password managers work across platforms. Splash Data offers password-management software for Windows and Macs and mobile devices, as does Agile Bits with its 1Password software. Top Ten Reviews has reviews of password managers for PCs.Change your passwords regularlySecurity experts advise people to regularly switch up their passwords. Setting calendar reminders to change your passwords is not a bad idea. In the case of LinkedIn, it is still unclear how hackers were able to breach its systems or whether they still have access. ""This is going to be an ongoing headache for LinkedIn for an extended period of time,"" said Mr. Kocher. "
"One On One: Andy Greenberg, Author, ""This Machine Kills Secrets"""," Andy Greenberg is the author of ""This Machine Kills Secrets: How WikiLeakers, Cypherpunks, and Hacktivists Aim to Free the World's Information,"" published by Dutton Publishing. Mr. Greenberg, a Forbes writer, interviewed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange three weeks before he leaked 250,000 State Department files, the largest release of classified materials in history. In that interview, Mr. Assange alluded to another leak - this time involving a major bank - that he likened to the Enron e-mails. Speculation that Assange was referring to Bank of America shaved $3.5 billion off the bank's market capitalization. But that release never happened. Mr. Greenberg said he wrote the book, in part, to find out why. He traveled to cypherpunk hangouts all over the country and then the world - Iceland, Sweden, Bulgaria, Berlin - to meet Julian Assange's predecessors and those who seek to build the next WikiLeaks. The following is an edited interview about information and the subculture whose members fight - often among themselves - to free it. Q. What prompted you to write this book? When I saw WikiLeaks dump these record-breaking troves of classified information in 2010, it seemed to me a new reality where anyone can eviscerate a government agency or company that they work for. I went to meet with Julian Assange in late 2010, three weeks before he released 250,000 State Department cables. At that point, the media was treating Assange as a singularity - this one crazy, or courageous, or evil hacker, however you wanted to see him - but I wanted to figure out how WikiLeaks did what it actually did. Was this about Assange? Or was it about the technology he used? And if it was the technology, then could this be replicated? So I went on this journey around the country, and then the world, to figure out where the ideas for WikiLeaks came from historically and where they were going. Q. You introduce us to several  pioneers of encryption technologies. What was their impression of Julian Assange?  It was mixed. Many cypherpunks in the '90s dreamed of using encryption to take power away from the government and give it to individuals. They see Assange as a gutsy hero to some degree, or the proof that everything they had dreamed of was possible. Q. You introduce us to several hackers, like  Peiter Zatko, the hacker better known by his hacker handle ""Mudge,"" who could have easily become the next Julian Assange but chose instead to work on anti-leaking technologies for the government. Mudge and Assange were friends back in the day. Mudge never really wanted to talk about it. He claims now he has never worked on rooting out insider leakers but a request for proposals that he wrote seems very much to be trying to solve the problem of how to root out human leakers inside organizations. A lot of the hackers who were on the freedom of information side of this game in the '90s - when Assange was still a teenage hacker cracking into the Pentagon - have become part of the establishment and now work for the cybersecurity industry or the military. Q. Their dynamic reminds me of Professor X and Magneto in X-Men. My favorite analogy is ""Sneakers."" Robert Redford and Ben Kingsley play Cosmo and Marty, two friends who are hackers that end up on opposite sides of the information war. Cosmo goes to prison and becomes a freedom of information advocate. Marty becomes a White Hat hacker who helps companies plug their security holes. There's this great moment in the film when Cosmo says to Marty, ""No more secrets, Marty.""But, to be clear, Mudge does not like this portrayal of his work. He claims his project is intended to root out malware not human leakers. But when you read his request for proposals, he writes about how to find someone who is printing a document, or writing it to a CD and taking it out of an organization. That's not something malware can do. Reading that, is becomes clear that his project is not just about malware but about humans, too. Q. In his review of your book, Evgeny Morozov praises your exhaustive research of encryption technologies, but criticizes the fact you did not give anti-leaking technologies the same due. He wrote, "" For every machine that kills secrets, there are at least two that keep them alive,"" and cites the example of Fox News which was able to track down a leaker within 48 hours.  In part, Morozov and I agree that WikiLeaks touched off a cat-and-mouse game between leaking and anti-leaking technologies. But I don't think it's as easy to catch a leaker as Morozov makes it sound. The whole notion of what the industry calls ""the insider threat"" is that lots of people have legitimate access to the same documents and network security is not necessarily going to help you find out who leaked a document because everybody's fingerprints are on it. This game will continue to get more sophisticated on both sides. But looking ahead, there will always be ways to get around really strict network security. The next level of this game will be installing malware on multiple machines that gives you control of other people's machines so you can leak documents from their computers. Q. What was your impression of Julian Assange when you first interviewed him? How has that changed?  At the time, he struck me as very charismatic and ultra-smart. I was impressed with his ideology. WikiLeaks seemed like a noble experiment. Yes, leaks hurt companies and government agencies but there is a moral argument behind them because if whistleblowers see the need to get information out, then he is just enabling them. But when I watched WikiLeaks fall apart over the next year, I became less impressed with the way Assange ran the project. To some degree, he let his own paranoia take over. That caused a mutiny in which The Architect, the engineer who built WikiLeaks infrastructure, left and took WikiLeaks' best resources with him to OpenLeaks. Q. You are only journalist to ever meet ""The Architect."" How did you track him down? I found him by accident. I was tracking the launch of a WikiLeaks spinoff group called OpenLeaks who were debuting at the Chaos Communication Camp, a gathering of radical hackers who camp out in an airfield outside of Berlin. I was shadowing everything they were doing at the camp, because I still believed then that OpenLeaks might become the next WikiLeaks. There was one guy who struck me as very authoritative and was teaching everyone some really technical things about anonymity. So I pulled him aside and he started to say things that made it clear he had been part of WikiLeaks. I started pressing him about who he was and eventually he told me he was The Architect. Q. What is the status of his relationship with Julian Assange?They do not have a very fond relationship at this point. He sees Assange as driven by his ego and there were points when he felt like Assange was not as focused about the release of significant information as he was on breaking records, releasing leaks that were bigger than the last one. Q. In your interview with Julian Assange, he alluded to an upcoming leak that would involve a major American bank. Rumors he was referring to Bank of America cut $3.5 billion off of its market cap. But that leak never happened? Why? I kept waiting for it and it never happened. It became the leak that got away. It was one of the mysteries I set out to solve with this book. What happened to that bank leak? I don't know if I should give away the ending but that bank leak essentially became a casualty of the mutiny within WikiLeaks. Q. Was it Bank of America? What happened to the files? WikiLeaks has now said the leak was Bank of America. But they don't have it any more. WikiLeaks blames The Architect and Daniel Domscheit-Berg for taking the files with them to OpenLeaks. Those two claim that was not the case, that WikiLeaks just lost the files.Insiders have told me that when The Architect joined WikiLeaks it was a mess. It was two creaking servers without all the flashy security that Assange had promised in interviews with the media. The Architect rebuilt it from scratch. They say the leak was lost because of an I.T. problem, that WikiLeaks was trying to deal with enormous amounts of data and that one of their storage drives crashed and they lost it.Those are the two versions of events. It has been impossible to get to the bottom of which one is true. But I don't ever expect to see those bank documents. Q. How many WikiLeaks copycats are there now? Which have been the most successful?  More than 50. I spent the most time with BalkanLeaks, which has been successful. But BalkanLeaks proved that for this to work you have to be in a country with a free media because none of their scoops were picked up by the mainstream media. I don't think anybody has successfully replicated WikiLeaks. The best we've seen have been various sub-groups of  Anonymous. But that's not insider whistleblowing so much as stealing stuff. Q. And even Anonymous was paralyzed earlier this year by the revelation that one of its own was a government informant. Anonymous is a multiheaded hydra. As soon as you cut off one head, another one will just pop back up. There are basically two ingredients for any WikiLeaks-like organization: One is a really strong understanding of the anonymous technologies, which I think OpenLeaks has. The second is a trusted figure at the helm, which is what Julian Assange was, but OpenLeaks lacks. OpenLeaks is very distrusted after what they did to WikiLeaks. That part is just as rare as the technical know-how and that is why I don't think we've seen a successful WikiLeaks since.An earlier version of this post rendered a word in the title of Andy Greenberg's book incorrectly. The word is ""cypherpunks,"" not ""cyperpunks,"" in ""This Machine Kills Secrets: How WikiLeakers, Cypherpunks, and Hacktivists Aim to Free the World's Information.""

Companies Pledge Not to Help Pakistan Filter the Web," Rivals at birth, India and Pakistan are now both struggling to manage the irrepressible Internet.In India, Facebook, Google and several other American technology companies are in court on charges that they failed to block ""objectionable"" material that showed up on their sites. In a country with a rapidly expanding Internet market, the case is an important test of whether and how Internet companies should police the user-generated content that appears on their sites.In Pakistan, the government's unabashedly open call for global companies to provide Web filtering technology has met with an unusual civil society campaign. A group based in Pakistan that calls itself Bolo Bhi wrote directly to eight companies that make a variety of security products, asking them not to satisfy Pakistan's demand for a firewall that would censor the Web.In less than a month, five of those eight companies have said they will not respond to Pakistan's request for proposals, known as an RFP. McAfee was the latest company to do so, with a message on Twitter on Monday afternoon: ""McAfee has confirmed that it is not pursuing the Pakistan Firewall RFP.""The campaign is unusual in that it seeks to name and shame companies before they make a deal with a government that seeks to filter the Internet.Cisco Systems, which has faced widespread criticism for the deployment of its technology in building the Internet firewall in China, has also said it will not bid on the proposal, as have Verizon and Websense. The holdouts include Huawei of China, one of Pakistan's staunchest allies.Advocacy groups like the Center for Democracy and Technology and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have backed the Bolo Bhi campaign. ""Sometimes there are lines that companies cannot cross without becoming complicit in human rights violations,"" the center opined in a blog post. "
Adding More Bricks to the Great Firewall of China,"HONG KONG - China appears to have reinforced its Internet firewall in recent days, blocking some of the leading services that allow people on the mainland to access forbidden sites like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.International business transactions also are being affected, Internet analysts said. The New York Times Web site remains 100 percent blocked on the mainland, along with the Chinese-language edition of The Times and Rendezvous. At least three foreign companies - Astrill, WiTopia and StrongVPN -  have apologized to customers whose virtual private networks, or VPNs, have been slowed or disabled. VPNs are used to circumvent the Communist government's firewall. The companies, meanwhile, were suggesting some work-arounds. The daily newspaper Global Times, affiliated with the Communist Party, acknowledged the firewall had been ""upgraded,"" but it also warned that foreign providers of VPN services were operating illegally. China blocks online searches of politically sensitive terms, smothers embarrassing news events, blocks online messages from dissidents and simply deletes any microblog posts that it dislikes. The firewall also blocks countless Web sites that are openly available to users elsewhere around the world - from pornography sites and commercial come-ons to news reporting, political activism and religious proselytizing. Users on the mainland thus have to use VPNs to reach the banned sites. Liu Xiao Ming, the Chinese ambassador to Britain, told the BBC on Friday that there was ""a misconception about the Internet and development in China.""""In fact, the Chinese are very much open in terms of the Internet,"" he said, quoted in an article in The South China Morning Post. ""In fact, we have the most number of Internet users in China today.""An estimated 600 million Chinese have access to the Internet.Foreign businesses also use VPNs not only to safeguard their transactions but also to keep government censors and rival companies from seeing their corporate communications.Global Times quoted an anonymous executive at a foreign technology company operating in China who said the lack of a VPN would damage the firm's operations. Josh Ong, China editor of the tech monitoring site The Next Web, said in an interview with the Voice of America that international companies were reporting disruptions in their corporate VPN services.""A lot of companies have a general policy that they must use their own proxy network in order to transfer data, especially into and out of China,"" Mr. Ong said. ""So you are looking at banks or e-commerce companies, anyone who is transferring very sensitive information, a lot of them use corporate VPNs.""Mr. Ong suggested that the tightening of the firewall could be tied to the recent leadership change in the Chinese Communist Party.  ""It is certainly possible that some of it is just a general flexing of might, kind of coming in with a strong arm to really show who's in control,"" he said. ""But there is definitely something intentional happening when these VPN services are being restricted.""As Bill Bishop wrote recently on DealBook, China's management of the Internet ""has not been encouraging for those who want to believe the leadership will push reforms.""""I have lived in Beijing since 2005, and these have been the most draconian few days of Internet restrictions I have experienced,"" he said last month. ""Indiscriminate blocking of major parts of the global Internet is not going to help China in its quest to internationalize the renminbi and make it a reserve currency,"" Bill said. ""Internet controls at the level of the last few days may also deter foreign firms from moving their regional headquarters to China.""Barbara Demick of The Los Angeles Times bureau in Beijing offered this cautionary tweet:Note to Chinese censors: if you pull our  vpns, main Asia news bureaus will have to move to Tokyo. Not good for China.- Barbara Demick (@BarbaraDemick)6 Nov 12My colleagues Sharon LaFraniere and David Barboza wrote about similar concerns over China's Internet censorship last year, and they spoke to Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA China, an investment and strategy consultancy based in Beijing. ""It has been double the guard, and double the guard, and you never hear proclamations about things being relaxed,"" said Mr. Clark, a 17-year resident of China. ""We have never seen this level of control in the time I have been here, and I have been here since the beginning of the Internet.""  "
Voter Registration Rolls in 2 States Are Called Vulnerable to Hackers,"Computer security experts have identified vulnerabilities in the voter registration databases in two states, raising concerns about the ability of hackers and others to disenfranchise voters.In the last five years, Maryland and Washington State have set up voter registration systems that make it easy for people to register to vote and update their address information online. The problem is that in both states, all the information required from voters to log in to the system is publicly available.It took The New York Times less than three minutes to track down the information online needed to update the registrations of several prominent executives in Washington State. Complete voter lists, which include a name, birth date, addresses and party affiliation, can be easily bought -- and are, right now, in the hands of thousands of campaign volunteers. Computer security experts and voting rights activists argue that a hacker could use that information to, say, change a person's address online to ensure that the voter never receives a ballot in Washington, where voting is now done entirely by mail. In Maryland, hackers could ensure that a voter is not listed on the precinct register at a designated polling station. In that case, the voter would be redirected to another precinct, or asked to fill out a provisional ballot. In both cases, the person would not be able to vote in local, or possibly, Congressional races.But the real concern, critics say, is that large numbers of voters from one political party, or demographic, could have their information changed by automated computer programs. A program that could change tens of thousands of voter records at once, they say, would require only a dozen lines of code.Rebecca Wilson, co-director of Save Our Votes, a voting rights nonprofit, said her organization did not initially track how states set up their online systems. ''We thought, 'How badly could you mess that up?' Well, we learned,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''Now, anyone in the world can write a computer program that commits absentee ballot fraud on a mass scale.''Maryland and Washington are not considered swing states in next month's election, but as other states move to online registration systems, security experts worry that they will follow Maryland and Washington's example.Officials in the two states say that concerns of a widespread cyberattack are exaggerated. Washington officials point out that voters who do not receive their ballots can still print them online, and they say, they have never received a complaint about an address being unknowingly changed.In Maryland, officials say they consult with their own security experts to pick up unusual patterns in online traffic, like an effort to change thousands of addresses from a single Internet address. They point out that address changes require a confirmation letter be sent to the new address. If that bounces back, the change is deemed invalid.Washington officials also cite their use of ''captchas,'' which are meant to help weed out humans from computer programs. Captchas -- those puzzles used by e-commerce sites that require people to type in a set of distorted letters and numbers -- are easy for humans to read and retype but difficult for machines to decipher.''What is technically possible and what realistically could happen are very different,'' said Ross Goldstein, the deputy administrator for Maryland's Board of Elections.But security experts say that these measures are not enough to prevent a determined hacker from disenfranchising scores of voters and influencing an election. Critics say that hackers could use botnets, networks of infected computers, to change voters' addresses. And new machine learning technologies can beat captchas, or people can be paid to type them in, in real time, for as a little as a penny per captcha or less.''They could influence an election with 20,000 votes for less than a penny a head,'' said J. Alex Halderman, one of the computer scientists who first discovered Washington's loophole. ''That would be a great return on investment for them.''In Florida last month, Republican state officials paid a company $1.3 million to register voters, but county election officials noticed several registrations contained unauthorized address changes and names of dead people Laws in the state make it difficult to vote if an address is recently changed.''In theory, the same scenario is possible online, where it is much easier to do,'' said Charles Stewart III, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Last week, Mr. Halderman, David Jefferson, a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and Barbara Simons, a retired IBM computer scientist, sent a letter to Washington and Maryland election officials with seven recommendations for security, including authenticating voters with nonpublic information like the last four digits of their Social Security numbers and setting up disaster plans that would let them shut down their systems during an attack.Shane Hamlin, Washington's co-director of elections, said that the state's registration closed last week, but that his team planned to review transaction logs for unusual activity. ''Their suggestions are all reasonable and doable,'' Mr. Hamlin said. ''Some we have in place and can build on, some are longer term.''The computer scientists say that they have yet to receive a response from Mr. Hamlin's counterparts in Maryland, where online registration remains open.''We want to make voting as accessible as possible,'' Mr. Goldstein said. But ''there's always risk in all systems.'' "
Hacker Claims to Have Breached Adobe," 2:50 p.m. | Updated  Adding response from Adobe. Password securityis only as good as the weakest link. And on Wednesday, that weak link appeared to be Adobe Systems.A hacker who said he was Egyptian posted a message on Pastebin with links to hundreds of records that he said belonged to Adobe employees and users of the company's software, including employees of Google, NASA and the United States military, as well as academic institutions. The hacker claimed to have pilfered the records from an Adobe server which, he said, had records for some 150,000 Adobe employees and clients.Adobe said in a  blog post  that it appeared that a discussion forum for users of its Adobe Connect conferencing software had been compromised. It said it had taken the forum offline and was resetting the passwords of its users.The records posted by the hacker contain names, job titles, company affiliation, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, usernames and passwords that have been jumbled -- or what security researchers call ""hashed""-- using an algorithm known as MD5, a widely used tool to produce unique digital fingerprints. But hashed passwords can be easily deciphered using readily available online services.Some of the records appeared to be outdated. One record belongs to a person named Ben Tauber who is listed as a product manager at Adobe. A glance at Mr. Tauber's LinkedIn profile, however, shows that he left Adobe in 2010 and now works at Google.The hacker claimed to have alerted Adobe about the breach and said he carried it out, in part, to expose the company's slow response time. In a message alongside the data dump, he complained that it took the company five to seven days to respond to vulnerability reports and another three to four months to patch them.""Such big companies should really respond very fast and fix the security issues as fast as they can,"" he said.The hacker warned that he was planning another data dump, this time for Yahoo. "
Anonymous Steps Up Attacks on Israeli Sites," Hackers stepped up attacks on a number of Israeli Web sites on Friday, including Israel's Foreign Ministry and the municipal Web site for Tel Aviv. The attacks are part of a broader campaign that the hacker collective Anonymous is calling #OpIsrael. The group says the attacks are in retaliation for Israeli military strikes on Hamas on Wednesday.The campaign, which began at 3 a.m. New York time on Thursday -- with coordinated attacks on several Israeli Web sites, including those of an Israeli Defense Forces blog and a  private Israeli surveillance and security company -- showed no signs of slowing on Friday.By Friday, Anonymous hackers claimed to have defaced more than 600 Israeli Web sites, many belonging to private companies. They also claimed credit for taking down a Tel Aviv municipal site, tel-aviv.gov.il, and said, in Twitter posts, that they had deleted the Web databases for Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Bank of Jerusalem.While the former site was still offline Friday afternoon, the latter appeared to be functioning normally.

What Does Homeland Security Read?,"For the last year, the Department of Homeland Security has been routinely monitoring social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and even MySpace. It is an avid reader of The Huffington Post, Jihad Watch, Technorati and, oddly, TruckingInfo.com. But apparently it has no interest in Techmeme and TechCrunch.This according to a ""social media monitoring and situational awareness initiative update"" released by the Department of Homeland Security. The document, which has left some people in the computer security industry scratching their heads, details over 100 sites that Homeland Security's National Operations Center has been monitoring ""to provide situational awareness and establish a common operating picture"" for the last year.Homeland Security seems to have a real affinity for Twitter. It advises its employees to follow not only Twitter itself but also Twitter search sites like Monitter, Tweetzi and Tweefind and more than 10 Twitter trend sites like TweetStats and Trendistic.It monitors Facebook and, while it also recommends monitoring MySpace, it notes the once-popular social network has ""limited search"" capabilities. Homeland Security employees also monitor video sites like YouTube, Vimeo and Hulu - ""situational awareness"" apparently entails full episodes of ""The Bachelor.""Among the blogs the department follows: Wired's Threat Level and Danger Room, Krebs on Security and, at The New York Times, The Lede blog. The list also includes more controversial sites like JihadWatch, Wikileaks and ""Narcotrafico en Mexico.""Absent from the list: Techmeme, TechCrunch and Boing Boing, which seemed really hurt by this. Apparently Homeland Security thinks Picfog and TruckingInfo.com are more interesting.Let's give the Homeland Security Department some help. Where would you tell them to monitor?

"With Free Software, Caution Is in Order","Q. Is it safe to install freeware and shareware on my computer?A. Freeware (free software) and shareware (programs that can be downloaded free of charge to use on a limited basis or with a donation request) can be perfectly fine or they can deliver malware and spyware. In general, shareware from established companies that offer trial versions of their programs is O.K. For example, some freeware security products like the free versions of AVG Anti-Virus or Avast are basic, no-frills editions of the commercial products. Microsoft Security Essentials is another freeware antivirus option for Windows users. Having an updated security program on your computer before you download anything from the Internet is a very good idea.Other types of freeware and shareware are not as well documented. Some ''free'' programs are free because they have bundled in advertisements and unwanted add-ons that get installed alongside the program you actually wanted to try. Certain programs have been known to install toolbars, change the browser's home page and break other applications you have installed on the computer. Some can do far worse, like relay your keystrokes to criminals or allow them to take over your computer.Perhaps the best way to find safe, useful programs is to stick with reputable shareware sites like CNet's Download.com or Tucows.com. Even with established sites that claim to scan for viruses and spyware, however, read the user reviews and do some online research on any program you are considering. If the free software affects the computer in a negative way, the comments section on its download page (and other online forums) will probably be filled with complaints, rants and warnings.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to QandA @nytimes.com. This column will answer questions of general interest, but letters cannot be answered individually. "
Google's 'Bouncer' Service Aims to Toughen Android Security," Google has released details of a security system it is using to protect the Android app store from malicious software. Called Bouncer, the service analyzes apps and flags those with suspicious code before they have a chance to get into the store, the company said.Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's vice president of engineering for Android, published a blog post on Thursday describing Bouncer. He explained that every app a software maker submits to the Android Market gets run through a simulation on Google's servers to look for hidden malware, spyware and trojans, which malicious programmers can use to steal a user's personal information.He said Google also examines developer accounts to prohibit repeat offenders from submitting their software to the app market. After putting Bouncer in place, Google saw a 40 percent decrease in the number of potentially malicious apps in the Android Market in the second half of 2011 compared with the first half, according to Mr. Lockheimer.""Our systems are getting better at detecting and eliminating malware every day, and we continue to invite the community to work with us to keep Android safe,"" he wrote.Despite Mr. Lockheimer's assurances, Lookout, an Android security firm, posted a report in December saying that Android malware had doubled since the beginning of July. The company said that using its own malware-detection tools, it found 1,000 separate instances of malware, and that Android users were four times more likely to encounter malware than they were in early 2011.Google's disclosure about Bouncer comes after a growing number of critics have raised concerns about the weaker security of Android compared to its major rival, Apple's iOS. Android security is an important issue for Google in the world of business, as major enterprises will shy away from letting employees use Android phones if they are more prone to malicious software.

Company Denies Role in Recently Uncovered Spyware," An executive at Gamma Group, a British company that sells surveillance technologies, denied on Wednesday that a spyware program running on servers in 11 countries is part of his company's product line.Gamma Group makes FinFisher, spyware that, according to the company's promotional materials, can be ""used to access target systems, giving full access to stored information with the ability to take control of the target system's functions to the point of capturing encrypted data and communications.""Martin J. Muench, a managing director at the company, said in an e-mail that the company only sells its products to governments for the express purpose of monitoring criminals. ""The most frequent fields of use are against pedophiles, terrorists, organized crime, kidnapping and human trafficking,"" he said.But recent findings by security researchers suggest it is being used more broadly. Researchers believe they found FinFisher spyware in e-mails sent to three Bahraini activists - one in the United States, one in London and one in Bahrain - none of whom have criminal backgrounds. And they found that the spyware was communicating with a server in Bahrain. It was capable of grabbing images of users' computer screens, recording their Skype chats, remotely turning on their cameras and microphones and logging their keystrokes. The word ""FinSpy"" -- the name of part of the FinFisher product - appeared in the spyware's code. In an e-mail, Mr. Muench said he could not disclose Gamma Group's client list or confirm whether his company had sold its spyware products to Bahrain. He said he thought the server the researchers found was most likely a proxy server, which redirects traffic to mask its true origins.""The server that was found in Bahrain is very likely a custom-built software that was simply used as a proxy to forward traffic between two or more systems. It is not a product from the FinFisher product line, "" Mr. Muench wrote.But researchers question this explanation. ""The timing suggests that the Bahrain server was not a proxy,"" said Bill Marczak, a computer science graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, who has been looking into the malware.Proxy servers typically take longer to respond to commands because they have to forward traffic elsewhere. Researchers compared the response time of the Bahrain server to nonproxy servers and found no difference in their response times.Mr. Muench also disputed additional findings by researchers at Rapid7, a security research firm, which found evidence that FinFisher spyware was being run off 11 additional servers in 10 countries, including on EC2, a popular Amazon cloud service, in the United States.As of Wednesday afternoon, the spyware was still being dispersed from an I.P. address hosted on Amazon's service. Researchers tested its response time and believe it is a proxy server. Amazon has not responded to a request for further information about the owner of the I.P. address and why it continues to send out spyware.Rapid7's researchers were able to find the Amazon I.P. address and the 10 others because they shared a unique trait with the Bahrain server. They found that when they sent unexpected data to that server, it responded with an unusual message: ""Hallo Steffi."" They then scanned the Internet to uncover other I.P. addresses that responded with the same message and found others in Indonesia, Australia, Qatar, Ethiopia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Mongolia, Latvia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.""FinFisher servers would not respond in such a way and would not be able to be fingerprinted with such a technique,"" Mr. Muench wrote in his e-mail. He added, ""None of our server components send out strings like 'Hallo Steffi.'""""The core FinSpy servers are protected with firewalls which only allow incoming connections from the setup proxies, and therefore a global scan by third parties would not reveal any real FinSpy servers,"" Mr. Muench said.Mr. Muench added that Gamma Group was still investigating the malware samples found last week, but suggested that the company's code may have been modified by someone else.""We cannot confirm whether this is the actual FinFisher product as it does not match any of our released versions,"" Mr. Muench said. ""Any comment on how third parties may or may not have acted would be pure speculation on my part."" "
Study Finds Weakness in Google's Android Security Service," 5:09 p.m. | Updated  Adding comment from Google.  2:23 p.m. | Updated  Adding comment from Lookout.  In the latest version of the Android operating system, Google added a security tool that is supposed to prevent users from installing harmful software. But an independent study suggests that the feature fails to detect large swaths of malware. An Android user can turn on Google's new feature, called the ""application verification service,"" in settings. Once it is flipped on, whenever an app is being installed, the service sends information about the app to Google for verification, and Google responds with a result.If the service detects a ""potentially dangerous app,"" it warns the user that the app may harm the device if installed. And if the service detects a ""dangerous app,"" it simply blocks it from being installed.Xuxian Jiang, an associate professor of computer science at North Carolina State University, put Google's security service through some tests. He installed 1,260 samples of malware on Google Nexus tablets, and Google's service caught only 193 of them - a detection rate of 15 percent. Mr. Jiang concludes that the service is still immature and has lots of room to improve.Google says that along with its verification service, it has a security system called Bouncer. Whenever an app is submitted to Google Play, the official Android app store, Bouncer puts it through a simulation on Google's servers to search for hidden malware, spyware and trojans.Lookout, a mobile security company based in San Francisco, said it had also tested Google's verification service and its results were consistent with Mr. Jiang's. Derek Halliday, a product manager at Lookout, said Google's security tools were relatively new, so their imperfections were not surprising. He noted that Google also recently acquired VirusTotal, a company that offers an online service for detecting malware.""It signals Google is taking the problem seriously,"" Mr. Halliday said. ""When Google makes these types of improvements, it's safe to say everyone wins.""In a statement, a Google spokeswoman said that many of the apps in Mr. Jiang's test were samples used by security researchers, and they are not downloaded by Android users. The company said its application verification service focuses on catching malware that people will actually encounter.""The Google Play application verification service uses real-world data and multiple detection techniques to protect against Android malware,"" the company said in a statement. ""We go after threats users are most likely to face, rather than just focusing on an AV test set which may not be representative of actual conditions.""Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ZDNet first reported the study. "
Sony Picks Game Chief As President,"TOKYO -- Sony on Wednesday picked Kazuo Hirai, a video game executive who led a turnaround of its PlayStation business, as its next president and chief executive, in a bid to regain some of its magic.Mr. Hirai, 51, Sony's chief of consumer electronics and games, had been widely expected to succeed Howard Stringer, who has led Sony as chief executive since 2005. Mr. Stringer, an American born in Wales and one of just a handful of foreign chief executives at large Japanese companies, will become chairman of the board on April 1, Sony said in a statement. Mr. Stringer already is Sony chairman, an executive position. He will move to a board seat that is not an executive post.Mr. Hirai -- who was chosen in a rare unanimous vote of the board -- takes the helm of a company that has struggled to reverse a long slide. Once the envy of the technology industry, Sony, which is based in Tokyo, has fallen behind nimbler rivals in recent years. The maker of the Walkman music player in the 1970s, Sony could not translate that success to the digital area and now trails Apple in portable music players and smartphones. Once a pioneer in television technology, Sony has been muscled out of that market by its South Korean rivals Samsung and LG.Mr. Stringer's drive to cut costs and streamline Sony's sprawling operations briefly appeared to gain traction in the mid-2000s. Mr. Stringer, who is 69 and joined Sony's American unit from CBS in 1997, has also tried -- with varying degrees of success -- to better integrate the company's hardware business with its vast catalog of music, movies and video games. The popular PlayStation Network, which offers downloads of games, movies and television shows, has nearly 100 million subscribers.But the global economic crisis, which caused a collapse in Japanese exports and a severe recession in Japan, stopped any meaningful Sony comeback. The earthquake and tsunami last March disrupted production at 10 Sony plants in northern Japan and severed vital supply chains; flooding in Thailand, the manufacturing hub, has also curtailed production.An older issue, the stubbornly strong yen, continues to hurt Sony's competitiveness overseas. Further clouding the outlook was an embarrassing hacker attack on its PlayStation network, which required it to shut down for about two months beginning last April and led to a breach of personal data from tens of millions of user accounts.Sony is now on course for a fourth consecutive year of losses. Its shares have lost three-quarters of their value over that time.''As challenging as times are for Sony now, were it not for the strong leadership of Sir Howard Stringer these past seven years, we would have been in a much more difficult position,'' Mr. Hirai said in a statement. ''The path we must take is clear: to drive the growth of our core electronics businesses.''Mr. Hirai, who cut his teeth in Sony's music division, is part of a new generation of executives promoted by Mr. Stringer, who pushed aside much of the old guard. He has long been considered Mr. Stringer's protege and has an effortless fluency in English rare among Japanese executives.Mr. Hirai rebuilt Sony's business after several years of losses, overseeing the development and introduction of its latest hand-held game console.He was tapped as executive deputy president in March, making him a front-runner to succeed Mr. Stringer as chief.Recent decisions made under Mr. Stringer put Mr. Hirai in a better position to push changes in two important areas.In smartphones, Sony took complete control of a cumbersome joint venture with Ericsson of Sweden last year, freeing Sony engineers to move more quickly to match the iPhone's dominance in the business.And last December, Sony sold its stake in a flat-panel screen venture with Samsung Electronics, allowing Sony to switch to less expensive outsourcing options that might help it resuscitate its money-losing television business.Among the challenges Mr. Hirai inherits is dismantling what Mr. Stringer called Sony's ''silos.'' Those internal divisions and rivalries have prevented Sony's many parts from working well together and have driven a destructive competition that has confused product strategy.At various times, portable video players have been made by the Walkman group, the Vaio group and the video game unit, while Sony's music and motion picture divisions often have not worked effectively with their colleagues in electronics to increase hardware sales.

25 Suspects Held In Hacking Cases Across 4 Countries,"PARIS (AP) -- Twenty-five suspected members of the loose-knit Anonymous hacker movement have been arrested in a sweep across Europe and South America, Interpol, the global police agency, said on Tuesday. The arrests, in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Spain were carried out by national law-enforcement officers working under the support of Interpol's Latin American Working Group of Experts on Information Technology Crime, Interpol said in a statement.Those arrested, who ranged in age between 17 and 40, are suspected of planning coordinated cyber-attacks against institutions including Colombia's defense ministry and presidential Web sites, Chile's Endesa electricity company and national library, and other targets.The arrests followed an ongoing investigation begun in mid-February, which comprised searches of 40 locations in 15 cities and included the seizure of 250 pieces of information technology equipment and mobile phones, Interpol said.Among the 25 people arrested were four suspected Anonymous hackers seized in connection with attacks on Spanish political party Web sites, the Spanish police announced. A national police statement said two servers used by the group in Bulgaria and the Czech Republic have been blocked. It said the four arrested included the suspected manager of Anonymous's computer operations in Spain and Latin America, who was identified only by his initials and the aliases ''Thunder'' and ''Pacotron.''The four are suspected of defacing websites, carrying out denial-of-service attacks and publishing data online about police assigned to the royal palace and the premier's office.Anonymous has no real membership structure. Hackers, activists, and supporters can claim allegiance to its freewheeling principles so it is not clear what impact the arrests will have. Some Internet chatter appeared to point to the possibility of a revenge attack on Interpol's Web site, but the police organization's home page appeared to be operating normally late Tuesday.Interpol, whose headquarters are in Lyon, France, has no arrest or investigative powers. It facilitates intelligence sharing to help police forces around the world work together.Anonymous, whose genesis can be traced back to a popular United States image messaging board, has become increasingly politicized amid a global clampdown on music piracy and the international controversy over the publication of classified documents by WikiLeaks, a group with which many Anonymous supporters identify.Authorities in Europe, North America and elsewhere have made dozens of arrests, and in retaliation, Anonymous has increasingly attacked law enforcement, military and intelligence-linked targets.The group turned the tables on the authorities last month by listening in on a conference call between the F.B.I., Scotland Yard and other foreign police agencies about their joint investigation into Anonymous and its allies.One Twitter account purportedly associated with Anonymous's Brazilian wing said the latest sweep would fail. ''Interpol, you can't take Anonymous,'' the message read. ''It's an idea.'' "
Chinese Company and Employee Deny Any Involvement in Hacking Attacks,"SHANGHAI -- Tencent, a Chinese Internet company, denied on Friday that one of its employees had been involved in a recent breach of computers belonging to Japanese and Indian companies, as well as Tibetan activists.The company and the employee suggested that his identity might have been confused with someone else's.The company released a statement soon after Trend Micro, a computer security company with headquarters in Tokyo, released a report on Friday describing the breach. It was the result of a nearly yearlong effort to hack into computers and steal information from hundreds of companies and individuals in several countries, the report said. The report never identified a hacker by name. But it linked the attacks to an alias used by a graduate of Sichuan University in western China who wrote several articles on computer hacking and defense. The researchers found the alias through its connection to an e-mail address and a QQ number, the Chinese equivalent of an instant messaging screen name.The New York Times identified the owner of the alias as Gu Kaiyuan, based on online records of his writing. Mr. Gu is now an employee at Tencent, which offers social networking, instant messaging, online gaming and other online features.On Thursday, when asked about the attacks, Mr. Gu said, ''I have nothing to say.'' On Friday, however, he denied involvement.In a message posted on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media service, Mr. Gu said: ''The QQ number associated with the hacker-controlled server belongs to my classmate, not me. I have not participated in any hacking.''Sichuan University also issued a written statement late Friday by e-mail, saying it had never ''hired any unit or individual to participate in Internet attacks or hacking activities.''The report does not say precisely how many hackers were involved, but it suggests that the main attacker used the alias ''scuhkr,'' which may stand for Sichuan University hacker, a researcher said.Mr. Gu, the Tencent employee, has used the alias ''scuhkr,'' and he agreed on Friday that a QQ number mentioned in the report belonged to him. In several articles he wrote, he used both his real name and the alias ''scuhkr.''But he and a Tencent executive said on Friday that the report also included a second QQ number that did not belong to Mr. Gu and that was more likely related to the attacks.''We have checked with our colleague Mr. Gu Kaiyuan, who denied he was involved in any hacking activities,'' Tencent said in its statement. ''Nor was he named by the author of the report as a hacker.''In an interview on Friday, Nart Villeneuve, a researcher who helped lead Trend Micro's effort, said there appeared to be one hacker using multiple QQ numbers and aliases.''That's what it seemed like to me based on the posts I saw online,'' he said. ''We saw two aliases, 'dang0102' and 'scuhrk,' make separate posts that contained the same QQ number that was used to register a command and control server.''But he did not rule out more than one hacker.Sichuan University also suggested that two people were associated with the QQ numbers in the report. In a statement, it said: ''Sichuan University had two students who used the nicknames of 'dang0102' and 'scuhkr,' '' -- which were both mentioned in the Trend Micro report. ''But they never participated in malicious Internet attacks or hacking activities while at school and have graduated and left the university several years ago.''According to the Micro Trends report, the hacker used a variety of types of malware, including some tied to an earlier cyberespionage campaign. The attacks breached 233 computers, according to the report. They aimed at Japanese companies, an Indian military research organization and activists and nongovernmental organizations related to Tibet, among others, the report said.The researchers did not suggest the attacks had been the work of government-employed hackers, but security experts said the methods and victims suggested a state-backed campaign. Chinese officials did not respond to the release of the report on Friday. "
"With Advance Warning, Preparing For Hackers' Attack on the Internet","SAN FRANCISCO -- On a quiet Sunday in mid-February, something curious attracted the attention of the behind-the-scenes engineers who scour the Internet for signs of trouble. There, among the ubiquitous boasts posted by the hacking collective Anonymous, was a call to attack some of the network's most crucial parts.The message called it Operation Global Blackout, and rallied Anonymous supporters worldwide to attack the Domain Name System, which converts human-friendly domain names like google.com into numeric addresses that are more useful for computers. It declared when the attack would be carried out: March 31. And it detailed exactly how: by bombarding the Domain Name System with junk traffic in an effort to overwhelm it altogether.There was no way to know for sure whether this was a pre-April Fool's Day hoax or a credible threat. After all, this was Anonymous, a decentralized movement with no leaders and no coherent ideology, but a track record of considerable damage. The call to arms would have to be treated as one would treat a bomb threat called in to a high school football game. The engineers would have to prepare.Those preparations turned into a fast-track, multimillion-dollar global effort to beef up the Domain Name System. They offer a glimpse into the largely unknown forces that keep the Internet running in the face of unpredictable, potentially devastating threats.Among those leading the effort was Bill Woodcock, whose nonprofit based in San Francisco, Packet Clearing House, defends vital pieces of Internet infrastructure. By his calculation, the Anonymous threat was as good a reason as any to accelerate what might have been done anyway over the next several months: fortify the network, chiefly by expanding the capacity of the root servers that are its main pillar.''Whether or not Anonymous carries out this particular attack, there are larger attacks that do happen,'' Mr. Woodcock said. ''A forewarning of this attack allowed everyone to act proactively for a change. We can get out in front of the bigger attacks.''In an attack, the hackers would in effect point virtual cannons at the name servers and blast them with data in what is called a distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS. The only effective way to mitigate such an attack is to expand capacity -- so much so that the system can absorb the extra traffic thrown at it, while still accommodating the normal load.''DDoS is very much a numbers game,'' Mr. Woodcock said. ''If the target has more than the sum of the attackers' capability and normal day-to-day traffic, then it is fine.''In the last few weeks, in a campaign financed mostly by companies that maintain Internet infrastructure, several huge 40-gigabit routers and hundreds of servers have been shipped across the world and hooked into the network, giving the Domain Name System additional computing power. It was part of what is often called an arms race between attackers and defenders on the Internet.On Saturday, if an attack takes place, it is likely to be imperceptible, at least initially, to the bulk of the world's Internet users, though service could slow down in places that have narrow bandwidth to begin with -- much of sub-Saharan Africa, for instance. In the improbable event of a huge attack that goes unabated for several days, the ability to connect to Web sites could be impaired.But if the defenses are effective, the result will be something akin to what happened with the Y2K bug: advance warning, plenty of preparation and then barely a blip on the Internet.Still, it will be anything but a normal Saturday for the people who run the Domain Name System. They plan to be glued to their monitors, looking out for signs of unusual network traffic, communicating with one other through encrypted, digitally signed e-mails or through a private telephone hot line maintained just for this purpose.''For us, it's not going to be another day at the office,'' said Paul Vixie, whose nonprofit Internet Systems Consortium in Redwood City, Calif., runs a root server known as the F-root. ''We are going to be on alert.''There are 13 root servers worldwide, run by government institutions, universities and private companies. The operators of several of them declined to talk about the threat, including VeriSign, which runs two root servers. Some insisted that they routinely expand capacity to guard against attacks that come from different quarters all the time.Mr. Vixie, for his part, warned against what he called ''panic engineering'' in the face of any particular threat. ''We are using the threatened attack,'' he said, ''to go kick the tires on everything, make sure there's no loose dangly parts.''Part of the challenge here is the mercurial and leaderless nature of the Anonymous movement. Just after one so-called Anonymous member called for the attack to protest, among other things, ''our irresponsible leaders and the beloved bankers who are starving the world for their own selfish needs out of sheer sadistic fun,'' another unnamed member of the movement pushed back. ''I don't think this is a good idea,'' this person wrote on an Anonymous-affiliated site. ''The collateral damage is not worth it.''A pragmatist wondered how participants would know when to end the attack, if indeed the Domain Name System was overwhelmed. Another suggested that they attack only ''the 10 most used sites.'' Yet another reckoned that root servers would be so heavily protected that an Anonymous attack could only disrupt them for ''a few minutes.''Since late February, there has been little to no chatter about Operation Global Blackout on Twitter, which Anonymous often uses to spread the word about its campaigns.Even so, computer security professionals point out, anyone can act in the name of Anonymous, and Anonymous has certainly swung its wrecking ball around in the last few years: its denial of service attacks have impaired private sites like that of PayPal, and some of its offshoots have penetrated the e-mail communications of global law enforcement agencies.Dan Kaminsky, a security researcher who pointed out the inherent vulnerabilities of the Domain Name System several years ago, put the probability of an effective attack this way: as unlikely as a shark descending from the sky, jaws open.Nevertheless, on the Internet, no warning should go unheeded, he said: ''It is belt-and-suspenders stuff: Is everything where it should be? You have to be ready for disaster.'' "
"After Threats, No Signs Of Attack By Hackers","A threat to attack a crucial part of the Internet on Saturday by members of the mercurial, leaderless hacker collective called Anonymous appears to have had no discernible impact so far. By Saturday in the Eastern United States, there were no major signs of an attack, said several people monitoring the Domain Name System. Some Anonymous hackers had threatened six weeks ago to attack that system, which converts domain names like google.com into numeric addresses that computers use. It led to a quiet global multimillion-dollar effort to strengthen the Domain Name System in recent weeks.''This is kind of anticlimactic,'' said Bill Woodcock, whose nonprofit Packet Clearing House has been part of that campaign. ''That was kind of the goal.''One person monitoring traffic over one of the 13 root servers that are part of the Domain Name System said there was only a five-minute spike in traffic at midnight Friday Greenwich Mean Time after which network traffic seemed to have subsided; the person spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of his job to maintain Internet infrastructure.The effects of a sustained attack on the Domain Name System can be felt only after several days, when parts of the system would be impaired by very heavy flow of network data.On Twitter, which is what the hackers affiliated with Anonymous use as a soapbox to spread their message, there was little chatter Saturday about the prospective attack. Instead, Anonymous called on its student supporters to put on masks and register their protest against restrictions on freedom of speech.''Anonymous challenges you to gather your friends and to show your support by wearing a mask, educating your friends about their rights and showing your teachers that school is a place of learning and expression,'' it announced on one of its blogs. "
Guarding the Numbers,"WASHINGTON -- On Tuesday morning at precisely 8:30, after a 10-second countdown synchronized to the Naval Observatory's atomic clock, a Labor Department official will flip a master switch in the agency's battened-down pressroom and computers will blurt out the monthly Consumer Price Index.Until that moment, the market-sensitive data will be guarded with launch-code secrecy, a precaution against anyone who might try to take advantage of an accidental or a surreptitious leak to gain an insider's edge in the financial markets, turning milliseconds into millions.Yet for all the rituals of high security, government officials have become increasingly nervous that their process is vulnerable, and are now overhauling it. After a yearlong review that included scrutiny by anti-hacking specialists from Sandia National Laboratories, officials at the Labor Department revoked the credentials of a few little-known news organizations that appeared to serve financial clients rather than the public at large.The government has also ordered other media groups to replace their computers in the lockup room with new computers under tighter controls.The efforts stem from the newfound importance of high-speed trading, which began to grow significantly in the middle of the last decade and is now a central part of some hedge funds' investment strategies. By gaining information seconds or minutes before others, high-speed traders -- sometimes known as high-frequency or algorithmic traders -- can use the computerized nature of modern finance to make quick profits or, if a bet goes wrong, take large losses.In addition to the inflation numbers, the lockup process, in use at several agencies, covers releases on economic growth, home sales, gas prices, corn yields and the unemployment rate, among other things.The Labor Department's overhaul was ignited by inquiries starting in 2007 from the F.B.I., the Securities and Exchange Commission and the department's own inspector general. Officials did not cite any specific major breach of security, but they had grown concerned that one was possible. Two instances in 2008, when Reuters accidentally released data a few seconds too early, heightened concerns.The clampdown has strained the Labor Department's relations with some of the world's biggest news agencies, including Reuters and Bloomberg News. In negotiations with the department and at a fractious Congressional hearing, the companies suggested the government was taking extreme measures against an imagined threat.At the center of the Labor Department's effort was a so-called Red Team from Sandia Labs, a federally financed research group operated by a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, which has half a century of experience in computer security, including work on the military's command and control networks.The ''root cause'' for the review, the team noted, was the possibility of traders or their agents working inside the lockup.Acting on the team's recommendations, Labor Department officials sought a wholesale replacement of the computer equipment in the lockup room. The replacement is scheduled to happen by September, although further steps to shield against surreptitious transmissions are possible later.At a hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last month, the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Keith Hall explained the main worry, which is that the growing reliance on high-speed trading had created the potential for participants in the media lockup to give an unfair advantage to traders.''Lockup participants may now have access to specialized computer equipment and software that links them directly to automated trading models,'' he noted. ''This effectively allows financial market transactions to be driven from inside lockups.''Carl Fillichio, the Labor Department official in charge of the overhaul, described a series of malfunctions and violations over the last few years, including the installation of fiber optic cables in the lockup room without permission or the use of BlackBerrys or mobile phone cameras. Media companies themselves have complained about competitors who ''may have gained unfair advantage in speed of transmission or have surreptitiously broken embargoes,'' Mr. Fillichio added in his testimony.Some members of the media, however, say the crackdown is unnecessary. (The New York Times does not participate in the Labor Department lockup.)''What is the problem you think, you imagine that this will prevent?'' asked Daniel Moss, an executive editor at Bloomberg News, in an April conference call between Mr. Fillichio and news organizations. Mr. Moss, plainly exasperated, repeated the question several times but got no clear answer.Government officials consider the potential security problems to be real. After a five-member team from Sandia Labs visited the lockup room last July, it identified ''verified vulnerabilities in processes, procedures and systems used to protect'' embargoed data, according to the summary of its report.The team warned about methods of sneaking information out, such as by hidden transmitters, or bypassing the black boxes and master switches that keep the lockup room under electronic quarantine through other means, like wireless Internet. The team noted that ''likely adversaries'' had the technical and financial resources and possibly the willingness ''to bend and potentially violate rules and laws.''But it said any culprits were unlikely to ''employ violent means to meet their goal of exfiltrating embargoed data prior to the official release time.''At the oversight hearing, Mr. Moss of Bloomberg News argued that traditional media outlets were not the problem and suggested that the Labor Department instead expel those groups connected to algorithmic traders from the lockup.Ultimately, the Labor Department did pull the credentials of a few organizations -- including Need to Know News, a small enterprise owned by the German exchange. Its data goes directly from the lockups to specialized trading programs. Mr. Fillichio explained that they were not ''primarily journalistic'' and did not ''disseminate their information to a wide audience.''Chris Rhea, chief executive of Need to Know News, referred questions to a spokesman, who did not respond.In the initial stages of the crackdown, Mr. Fillichio ordered lockup participants to use government computers, transmission lines and even pens and pencils and paper while inside the lockup. Media groups objected.''This proposal threatens the First Amendment,'' Mr. Moss said at the oversight hearing, adding that it would give the government ''access to a reporters' thoughts, drafts or notes as a condition for covering the news.''After another round of negotiations, the government backed off a bit. For now, some equipment owned by media companies is expected to stay. But over the next few months they will have to deliver new, shrink-wrapped terminals, which will be subject to inspection and maintenance by Labor Department technicians.One question that is still unresolved is how many seats each organization will be allowed.Space is tight in the lockup. And paradoxically, all the attention to this obscure room on a drab corridor has brought newcomers knocking, as if at the door of a speakeasy.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: "
GoDaddy Says Its Disruption Was Not Caused by a Hacker,"9:13 p.m. | UpdatedGoDaddy, a popular Web site hosting company, said on Tuesday that its extensive service interruptions on Monday were the result of technical problems, not a cyberattack as one hacker has claimed. Scott Wagner, the company's interim chief executive, said failures that knocked out several million Web sites were caused by an internal network error, ""not a hack.""That explanation contradicted claims by a supporter of Anonymous, the loose confederation of rogue hackers, who said on Twitter Monday that he took down GoDaddy using a distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS attack. In a DDoS attack, hackers barrage a site with traffic until it collapses under the load.It was the second time this month that hackers claiming affiliation with Anonymous appeared to be falsely claiming credit for hacks. ""We're starting to see a pattern of Anonymous taking credit for the media attention,"" said Rob Rachwald, director of security at Imperva, a computer security firm. ""There has been a lack of serious Anonymous campaigns in the last several months, and they may be trying to get back in the groove after a temporary lull.""GoDaddy was emphatic that the failure was not caused by outsiders. ""It was not a 'hack' and it was not a denial of service attack,"" Mr. Wagner said. While he was not specific, he said ""internal network events"" corrupted router data tables.GoDaddy's Web site was down for several hours on Monday afternoon, as were several million Web sites that use it for domain hosting and other services. GoDaddy manages 53 million domain names and hosts roughly five million Web sites on its servers. Its shutdown caused a ""ripple effect"" across the Internet, said Stephen Pierzchala, an analyst at Compuware, a firm that measures Internet performance.The hacker who initially claimed credit for the GoDaddy failure posted on Tuesday what he said was GoDaddy's source code to Pastebin, a Web site. But that same code had appeared online in a software forum two years ago.In a direct message, the person behind @Anonyops, a Twitter account frequently associated with the Anonymous movement, said the hacker was either ""misguided or trying to give Anons a bad reputation.""Last week an Anonymous-related group released a file it said contained a million ID numbers for Apple mobile devices obtained by hacking into the computer of an F.B.I. agent. The data was actually stolen from a Florida company.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Attacks On 6 Banks Frustrate Customers,"Six major American banks were hit in a wave of computer attacks last week, by a group claiming Middle Eastern ties, that caused Internet blackouts and delays in online banking.Frustrated customers of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo and PNC, who could not get access to their accounts or pay bills online, were upset because the banks had not explained clearly what was going on.''It was probably the least impressive corporate presentation of bad news I've ever seen,'' said Paul Downs, a small-business owner in Bridgeport, Pa. ''This is extremely disconcerting.'' The banks suffered denial of service attacks, in which hackers barrage a Web site with traffic until it is overwhelmed and shuts down. Such attacks, while a nuisance, are not technically sophisticated and do not affect a company's computer network -- or, in this case, funds or customer bank accounts. But they are enough to upset customers.A hacker group calling itself Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters -- a reference to Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, a Muslim holy man who fought against European forces and Jewish settlers in the Middle East in the 1920s and 1930s -- took credit for the attacks in online posts.The group said it had attacked the banks in retaliation for an anti-Islam video that mocks the Prophet Muhammad. It also pledged to continue to attack American credit and financial institutions daily, and possibly institutions in France, Israel and Britain, until the video is taken offline. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were also targeted.On Friday, PNC became the latest bank to experience delays and fall offline. Customers said they had been unable to get access to PNC's online banking site, and those that visited the bank's physical locations were told it was because PNC, and many others, had been hacked.Fred Solomon, a PNC spokesman, said Friday afternoon that the bank's Web site was back online, but that it was still working to restore online bill payment. Asked why the bank was not better able to withstand such an attack, he said that while PNC had systems in place to prevent delays and disruption from hacker attacks, in this case ''the volume of traffic was unprecedented.''Representatives for other banks also confirmed that they had experienced slow Internet performance and intermittent downtime because of an unusually high volume of traffic.Security researchers said the attack methods were too basic to have taken so many American bank sites offline. The hackers appeared to be enlisting volunteers for the attacks with messages on various sites. On one blog, they called on people to visit two Web addresses that would cause their computers to flood banks with hundreds of data requests a second. They asked volunteers to attack banks according to a timetable: Wells Fargo on Tuesday, U.S. Bancorp on Wednesday and PNC on Thursday.But experts said it seemed implausible that this method would create an attack of this scale. ''The number of users you need to break those targets is very high,'' said Jaime Blasco, a security researcher at AlienVault who has been investigating the attacks. ''They must have had help from other sources.''Those sources, Mr. Blasco said, would have to be a group with money, like a nation, or botnets -- networks of infected computers that do the bidding of criminals. Botnets can be rented through black market schemes that are common in the Internet underground, or lent out by criminals or governments.Last week, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said in an interview on C-Span that he believed Iran's government had sponsored the attacks in retaliation for Western economic sanctions. The hacker group rejected that claim. In an online post, it said the attacks had not been sponsored by a country and that its members ''strongly reject the American officials' insidious attempts to deceive public opinion.''The hackers maintained that they were retaliating for the online video. ''Insult to the prophet is not acceptable, especially when it is the last Prophet Muhammad,'' they wrote.It is very difficult to trace such attacks back to a particular country, security experts say, because they can be routed through different Internet addresses to mask their true origin.But experts said they had seen an increase in such activity from Iran and in the number of so-called hacktivists, hackers who attack for political purposes rather than for profit, based in Iran.''We absolutely have seen more activity from the Middle East, and in particular Iran has been increasingly active as they build up their cyber capabilities,'' said George Kurtz, the president of CrowdStrike, a computer security company, and former chief technology officer at McAfee. ''There is also a strong activist movement underfoot, which should be concerning to many large companies. The threat is real, and what we are seeing now is only the tip of the iceberg.''James A. Lewis, a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in this case, the attack methods used were ''pretty basic'' to have been state-sponsored. But he added that even if the attacks were not the work of Iran's government, the state would be aware of them because Iran monitors its networks extensively.For Mr. Downs, the small-business owner in Pennsylvania, such half explanations were of little consolation.''A major bank has a problem and gives no indication of what's happening, when it started or when it will stop,'' he said. ''That's pretty freaky if it's your own business's money and you need to do things with it.'' "
Britain: Extradition of Hacker To United States Is Blocked,"LONDON -- British authorities on Tuesday blocked a longstanding demand for the extradition of Gary McKinnon, a computer hacker wanted in the United States to face charges of intruding into Pentagon computer networks in a case that has become a touchstone of the delicate jurisdictional balance between the two countries since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.Mr. McKinnon, 46, who has been facing the accusations for a decade, has Asperger syndrome and is prone to depression, British officials said. In light of the ''high risk'' that the suspect would commit suicide if sent to the United States, Home Secretary Theresa May told Parliament she had ''withdrawn the extradition order against Mr. McKinnon'' to safeguard his human rights.American prosecutors say that Mr. McKinnon gained unauthorized access to 97 government computers between February 2001 and March 2002, causing damage worth $566,000. While he has admitted hacking into Pentagon networks, he insists that he did so to seek evidence about unidentified flying objects.American officials have described his actions as ''the biggest military computer hack of all time.''American authorities sought his extradition under a 2003 treaty that, British critics of the legislation assert, was designed to help prosecute terrorists but that has been misused by American prosecutors as a catchall measure in less onerous cases unrelated to national security.Ms. May's ruling was said by legal experts to be the first time that Britain had publicly thwarted an American demand made under the contentious treaty, which enables American authorities to seek extradition of suspects without providing substantive evidence of their purported crimes.''Mr. McKinnon is accused of serious crimes,'' Ms. May said. ''But there is also no doubt that he is seriously ill. He has Asperger syndrome, and suffers from depressive illness. The legal question before me is now whether the extent of that illness is sufficient to preclude extradition.''She continued, ''After careful consideration of all of the relevant material, I have concluded that Mr. McKinnon's extradition would give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life that a decision to extradite would be incompatible with Mr. McKinnon's human rights.''A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice, Rebekah Carmichael, said Tuesday that ''the United States is disappointed'' by the decision not to extradite Mr. McKinnon but that ''our extradition relationship with the United Kingdom remains strong.''British critics of the extradition treaty have said the pact effectively outsources British judicial responsibilities to the United States without securing reciprocal benefits or distinguishing between serious and lesser crimes.David Blunkett, the former home secretary who signed the treaty, said in 2010 that he might have ''given too much away'' to American prosecutors when the pact was framed.Last year British legislators urged the government to change the procedures. Dominic Raab, a lawmaker for the governing Conservatives, said at the time that Mr. McKinnon should not be treated ''like a gangland mobster or Al Qaeda mastermind.''Rights campaigners hailed the ruling. Shami Chakrabarti, the director of the civil rights group Liberty, called it ''a great day for rights, freedoms and justice in the United Kingdom.''Mr. McKinnon was first arrested in 2002, and then again in 2005. An order for his extradition was made in July 2006 under the 2003 treaty, but Mr. McKinnon's family, his lawyers and rights campaigners began a series of legal battles.The case has generated such intense interest in Britain that Prime Minister David Cameron has discussed it with President Obama, British officials said.Since 2006, three of Ms. May's predecessors as home secretary have supported extradition, prompting both a public outcry and further legal moves to prevent Mr. McKinnon's removal.His immediate fate in the British justice system remained unclear.In 2009, the Crown Prosecution Service said that while the evidence against Mr. McKinnon justified charges of ''unauthorized access with intent,'' it ''does not come near to reflecting the criminality that is alleged by the American authorities.''The ruling on Tuesday came days after the British authorities ended another long-running extradition battle by sending five terrorism suspects, including the firebrand cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, to face trial in the United States on an array of charges. The men had been resisting extradition for many years.British authorities are still locked in a protracted effort to send another prominent Muslim cleric to Jordan to face charges. The preacher, who is known as Abu Qatada but whose real name is Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman, has been opposing extradition for seven years and has spent long periods in detention or under restriction in Britain for more than a decade.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Aramco Says Cyberattack Was Aimed At Production,"JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) -- Saudi Arabia's national oil company, Aramco, said on Sunday that a cyberattack against it in August that damaged some 30,000 computers was aimed at stopping oil and gas production in Saudi Arabia, the biggest exporter in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The attack on Saudi Aramco -- which supplies a tenth of the world's oil -- failed to disrupt production, but was one of the most destructive hacker strikes against a single business.''The main target in this attack was to stop the flow of oil and gas to local and international markets and thank God they were not able to achieve their goals,'' Abdullah al-Saadan, Aramco's vice president for corporate planning, said on Al Ekhbariya television. It was Aramco's first comments on the apparent aim of the attack.Hackers from a group called Cutting Sword of Justice claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that their motives were political and that the virus gave them access to documents from Aramco's computers, which they threatened to release. No documents have yet been published.Aramco and the Saudi Interior Ministry are investigating the attack. A ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, said the attackers were an organized group operating from countries on four continents.The attack used a computer virus known as Shamoon, which infected workstations on Aug. 15. The company shut its main internal network for more than a week. General Turki said the investigation had not shown any involvement by Aramco employees. He said he could not give more details because the investigation was not complete.Shamoon spread through Aramco's network and wiped computers' hard drives clean. Aramco said damage was limited to office computers and did not affect systems software that might harm technical operations.In a posting on an online bulletin board the day the files were wiped, the hacker group blamed Saudi Arabia for ''crimes and atrocities'' in countries including Syria and Bahrain.Saudi Arabia sent troops into Bahrain last year to back the Persian Gulf state's rulers, fellow Sunni Muslims, against Shiite-led protesters. Saudi Arabia is also sympathetic to rebels in Syria. "
Zappos Says Hackers May Have Accessed Customer Account Details,"The account information for millions of customers at Zappos.com, an online shoe and clothing company, may have been compromised by a hacking attack, the company's chief executive, Tony Hsieh, wrote on Sunday in an e-mail to employees.In the message, posted on the Zappos Web site, Mr. Hsieh said a criminal ""gained access to parts of our internal network and systems"" through one of the company's servers in Kentucky.He wrote, in capital letters, that the database containing complete credit card and other payment information for Zappos customers had not been accessed.Mr. Hsieh said the company would send an e-mail notifying the more than 24 million accountholders of the incident, including details about the information that might have been obtained: names, e-mail addresses, billing and shipping addresses, phone numbers and the last four digits of credit cards. The messages will encourage customers to create a new password for both Zappos and ""any other Web site where you use the same or a similar password.""The company had already reset all passwords, the e-mail said.Mr. Hsieh said the company made the ""hard decision"" to temporarily shut off its phones, directing customers to correspond by e-mail because the phone systems ""simply aren't capable"" of handling the expected volume of inquiries.All employees at the company's headquarters in Henderson, Nev., would be asked to assist customers, ""regardless of department,"" he wrote.""We've spent over 12 years building our reputation, brand, and trust with our customers,"" Mr. Hsieh said. ""It's painful to see us take so many steps back due to a single incident.""In 2009, Zappos was sold to Amazon.com for more than $1 billion. "
Anonymous Says It Knocked Citigroup Sites Offline," Hackers claiming to be members of the loose hacking collective Anonymous took credit for knocking the Citigroup and Citibank Web sites offline on Friday. At times the sites were only sporadically available, and some attempts to log into banking accounts were met with an error message. Andrew Brent, a Citigroup spokesman, confirmed that Citigroup's consumer site had experienced a temporary outage but said that Citigroup had been able to restore Web site operations within one hour and was continuing to monitor its systems. ""At no point were there data integrity issues or compromise of client account information,"" Mr. Brent said in an interview. ""We apologize for any inconvenience."" This was part of a string of attacks this week by hackers who call themselves Anonymous Brasil. In posts on Twitter, the hackers said their attacks were intended  to fight corruption. By Friday, they had at various times taken down the Web sites of Banco BMG, Banco Bradesco, Banco de Brasil, Banco Panamericano, Citigroup, HSBC Holdings, Itau Unibanco Banco Multiplo and  Febraban, Brazil's banking federation. There was no evidence hackers had compromised any customer accounts in the attacks. They were able to take down the sites with denial of service attacks,  which involve flooding them with traffic until they crash. Denial of service attacks, while not technically sophisticated, can be difficult to thwart. Once attacked, a target can employ technologies to filter out false traffic, but that is only an after-the fact  measure.  In the past, hackers affiliated with Anonymous have announced their targets before an attack. This was the case with PayPal and with Sony in March, when Anonymous attacked Sony's PlayStation Network in retaliation for lawsuits against PlayStation hackers.That at least gives targets an opportunity to step up defenses. The attacks on the Brazilian banks were not advertised beforehand. But in Twitter postings, hackers have said that they planned to target credit-card companies and government Web sites. "
How Much Have Foreign Hackers Stolen?,"Hackers in China and Russia, security experts say, are habitually breaking into foreign travelers' mobile devices, leapfrogging into their corporate networks and stealing sensitive government information and corporate trade secrets, often undetected. I explored this issue in an article in Saturday's New York Times.But how much have they stolen? Nobody really knows. Most companies I spoke with were reluctant to discuss security breaches or even disclose what policies, if any, they had put in place to protect their trade secrets. In most cases, security experts say, companies do not realize they have been compromised until long after the fact. Yet nearly everyone I spoke with agreed that as hackers improve their capabilities, and as Americans migrate to a mobile workplace, the problem has only grown worse.In testimony before the House Committee on Financial Services last September, A.T. Smith, the assistant director of the United States Secret Service, estimated that in 2010, cyberthieves abroad stole 867 terabytes of data from the United States, or ""nearly four times the amount of data collected in the archives of the Library of Congress.""That much is now ""taken on a daily basis,"" said Mike McConnell, the former director of national intelligence and now vice chairman at Booz Allen Hamilton in a recent interview. ""The volume is staggering.""Mr. McConnell said that in evaluating computer systems ""of consequence""- at government agencies, Congress and in the private sector - he had yet to encounter one computer that had not been compromised by an advanced persistent threat.Joel Brenner, formerly the nation's top counterintelligence official at the office of the director of national intelligence, said the problem was ""huge, but it hasn't been persuasively quantified yet."" He added, ""Trade secrets can be measured in so many different ways and most companies don't know they've been targeted.""Mr. Brenner was the first to alert American companies to the threat of digital espionage by foreign hackers in the lead-up to the Beijing Olympics. In a 2008 travel advisory, his office cautioned travelers that foreign security services and criminals could track their every move using their mobile devices, and remotely activate their microphones, even if their phones were switched off. If a customs official asked to examine a device, or if a hotel room was searched, the advisory warned, ""You should assume the device's hard drive has been copied.""Four years later, security officials say the pace of China's corporate espionage campaign has accelerated. ""Within the last four years, cyber-espionage has gotten exponentially worse as their capabilities have gotten exponentially better,"" said Representative Mike Rogers, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House intelligence committee. ""The biggest threat, when it comes to cyber-espionage today, is the sheer volume with which China seeks to steal our intellectual property for its own prosperity.""Mr. Rogers said that at a closed forum at Stanford University last month, which included executives from Cisco, Google, Intel and Oracle, each company acknowledged that it had been hacked and each said they believed China was the culprit.Enabling matters, security experts say, are American workers themselves. It is far easier to steal trade secrets when Americans carry them around on their personal devices. According to a report by International Data Corporation, half of all mobile devices used in the workplace last year were employee-owned. Workers were connecting these devices to their corporate networks and using them to transmit confidential information, often without so much as a four-digit password.""We never let go of these things,"" said Tom Kellermann, chief technology officer at AirPatrol, a wireless security company. ""We work with them; we even sleep next to them. That's the dark side of Web 3.0. Once someone hacks your device, they don't just hack the back end, they hack your network. They can turn your camera and microphone on. They can hack your whole life."" "
A Photojournalist's First Hack Day,"Jamal Fanaian, FlickrJames Estrin, a photojournalist and the editor of the Lens blog, was among the first to arrive at Photo Hack Day, just after 9 a.m., there on the fourth floor home of General Assembly, the tech and entrepreneurship community hub in Manhattan's Flatiron District.This was Estrin's first ever hack day, even though it was the second time around for Photo Hack Day (and so the hashtag, #PHD2), 6 short months after PHD1. Both were organized by Aviary, a New York City-based startup that has, among a range of image processing technologies, a high-quality image editor that works inside of a web browser. The long list of sponsor companies, all of them with headquarters or branch offices in the city, and many of them startups, provided evidence that this technology has clustered in New York. Estrin doesn't code, but when we spoke after the event, he explained why New York City sits at the intersection of Web 2.0 and photography, ""Photographs are a form of social interaction now. What a photograph is is completely different than what it was 30 years ago"" when he was starting his career.""A photograph was a relatively rare item. People didn't take photographs all the time. And they weren't used as the currency of social interaction which they are in Instagram and Foursquare. Even on Facebook, it's the photographs that drive it.""Estrin was one of a group of us from The Times that went to Photo Hack Day. He stayed into the evening that first day, and then returned on Sunday to judge the completed Hack Day hacks. Judging was a 60 demo marathon that took more than 4 hours.(We, the other Times participants, helped Estrin avoid any conflicts of interest by not submitting any hacks for judging.)General Assembly has a spacious, open, flexible floorplan which comfortably fit dozens and dozens of hackers in long rows of tables. The huge turnout forced Erin Tao from Aviary, the event's lead organizer, to go to the hardware store for more power strips. Internet bandwidth was never a problem though.So while photographs and the underlying technology are inherently social, so too is the hacker process. One thing about how hack day developers, many of them in college or recently out of school, go about making things ""that's so interesting to me is the collaboration, how they Open Source things,"" Estrin said.""There's this whole environment of you walk over there and this person helps you with that, and even if, in a sense you're competing against the other person, anyone will go do this, do that, do this. Not that it's uncompetitive, but it's also at the same time highly cooperative.""""What was exciting to me about coding is the efficiency and the speed with which you can create things, transform an idea into reality,"" Estrin also told me. In addition to providing the workspace, General Assembly also develops services to support the community, like Start Making, a new entrepreneurial education initiative which encourages coder to follow all the way through on their ideas and work. (The New York Times is a media sponsor for Start Making.)According to Estrin, ""The opportunities are endless. You're limited by only how small you let yourself think. The total limit is the limit you place on yourself.""The first place project, called Synviary, took the Aviary in-browser photo editing tools, and made them sharable. Two (or more) people could change the same picture, at the same time, and using the application's chat interface, coordinate the work and, one expects, make fun of each other. The project's author, Yufei Liu, a Columbia computer science undergrad, took home $7500 in total prize earnings, plus who knows how many job offers. Aviary's CEO, Avi Muchnick, made the first of them, telling Liu using the house mike, not 10 seconds after his demo, ""You're hired.""Estrin, a judge along with Muchnick, said, ""Synviary was so fabulous because once you saw it, it was so obvious, which is the sign of a great idea."" The way photos have become social objects, it seems like a no-brainer to make photo editing into a social activity.I had to ask Estrin, ""How does this experience change your perspective on the Lens blog and what you might want to do there?""""We always had ideas and thought of the Lens blog as a lab to try things out, since we have our own little corner of The New York Times,"" he said. The speed with which people got things done has him excited, ""it encourages me to double down in terms of the efforts to try to get ideas that we have, that we can make, try to get them done, make them a reality.""""A lot of time is spent in practical matters. You look at your colleagues, we need to do this so we have to make this. What I hope will happen during The Times internal hack day is combining the creativity of the newsroom with the creativity of people who are not in the newsroom,"" he said. ""That has some pretty amazing possibilities.""  Note:  A version of this post also appeared on beta620. "
What Do the LulzSec Arrests Mean for Anonymous?," On Tuesday morning, members of so-called hacktivist groups discovered that  they had been betrayed by one of their own.Four men in Britain and Ireland who were affiliated with Lulz Security, or LulzSec, a group loosely affiliated with the larger Anonymous hacking collective, were charged with computer crimes, and a fifth man was arrested in Chicago.  They are accused of waging attacks against diverse, high-profile targets like  Sony and the government of Tunisia.But the real shocker was that it was LulzSec's vocal ringleader, Hector Xavier Monsegur -  better known by his Twitter handle ""The Real Sabu"" - who turned them all in. The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Mr. Monsegur and charged him with a dozen counts of hacking last August.Mr. Monsegur proved a rare catch. He was one of the more notorious and brazen hackers in the larger Anonymous movement,  promoting and helping to orchestrate attacks against Sony, PBS, Mastercard, PayPal, HBGary and Visa, among others, according to court documents. As the F.B.I. has done with many cybercriminals before Mr. Monsegur, it turned him, and he continued to participate in attacks while providing information about his fellow hackers.His arrest is likely to put a chill on the hacktivist movement, said Cole Stryker, an author who writes about Anonymous.""It will be difficult for Anons to work collaboratively now that their ranks are undoubtedly infiltrated by feds, security contractors and rival hackers,"" Mr. Stryker said in an interview Tuesday.Mr. Stryker noted that, in the past, LulzSec and Anonymous attacks have typically required a critical mass of participants to succeed. A so-called distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS attack, in which hackers clog a site with bogus data requests until it crashes, requires that hundreds, if not thousands, of people participate.That explains why hackers are eager to promote their attacks on Twitter and in the media - it lightens their load. But the more people participate in any given attack, the more likely it is that unsophisticated hackers will not adequately cover their tracks with anonymizing software like Tor,  Mr. Stryker noted.Even sophisticated hackers can make mistakes. The F.B.I. first started tracking Mr. Monsegur after he mistakenly logged into an online chat room without masking his IP address early last year, according to Fox News.""All it takes is one little slip-up,"" Mr. Stryker said. ""If one of your layers of obfuscation isn't there, that's all it takes for the whole thing to come crashing down.""In the wake of Tuesday's arrests, Mr. Stryker said he suspected that would-be Anonymous hackers will think twice before they participate in an attack, for fear they will be exposed.""It's likely that Anonymous won't disappear after these arrests, but will instead revert back to its previous methods of nimble, surprise attacks on unsuspecting victims, committed by hackers who know what they're doing,"" Mr. Stryker said.Some members of Anonymous disputed the notion that Tuesday's arrests would have an impact and said hackers would not retreat.""There are lots and lots of people here that continue to work. The F.B.I. did not really cut the head off of anything. Anonymous will go forward as usual,"" said Barrett Brown, who has claimed to speak on behalf of Anonymous in connection with past attacks, like the one on Stratfor in December. ""We are prepared for a big slug-out.""By Tuesday afternoon, Anonymous had already defaced the Web site of PandaSecurity, a firm that hackers accused of aiding the F.B.I. investigation, and replaced it with a video retrospective of its exploits. On Twitter, accounts affiliated with Anonymous called on members to crash the Web site of the F.B.I. with traffic, in retaliation for the arrests.""Greetings to the spies,"" one tweeted. ""Just do not forget that we also spy."" "
How Facebook Tries to Protect Users' Online Credentials,"4/3/12 | Updated A recent report on identity theft suggested that people who aren't careful with their privacy settings on social media may be putting themselves at risk.But Facebook, for one, says it offers additional protections to keep its users' personal information safe.  After recent high-profile hacks, like one last year at Universal Music, Facebook says it has taken steps to determine if any of its own users' credentials may have been affected.Although the security breaches did not occur at Facebook, people often use the same e-mail and password combinations for various online accounts.  So if the information from one account is compromised, it may put other accounts at risk, too.Sometimes, hackers are seeking to gain attention or to make a point and are not planning to sell the personal credentials they improperly obtained.  (Recent attacks by the hacker group Anonymous are a case in point.) In those instances, the hackers may post the pilfered information on file-sharing sites, as proof of what they've done.  In such cases, Facebook can obtain the information and compare it with its own records.Facebook's security team seeks out the hacked information and cross-checks it with credentials used by its members.  ""We try and monitor those channels proactively,"" said Matt Jones, an engineer on Facebook's site integrity team.If a match is found between hacked credentials and those used for Facebook accounts,  Facebook can lock out the affected accounts. Then, the next time the users log in, they are notified that because their information was compromised elsewhere, they must go through additional steps to verify their identity and must change their log-in credentials.Facebook has obtained roughly five million credentials -- typically, e-mail and password combinations - from publicly posted hacks and cross-checked them against Facebook accounts, said a company spokesman, Fred Wolens. He said he couldn't provide statistics on how often a match had been found.Mr. Jones noted that cross-checking hacked information is an extra, ""aggressive"" step that Facebook takes, in addition to security measures it routinely uses to verify users when they log into their accounts.Have you ever been notified by Facebook that you must change your log-in or password?An earlier version of this post referred incorrectly to a hacking episode last year directed at Viacom. The hackers released internal computer server information from the company, not user names and passwords. (The same group did, however, expose user credentials from Universal Music.) "
Russian Hackers Attack Online Live Streaming Video Sites,"Hackers shut down a United States online video company on Wednesday that was being used by Russian activists to stream live video of protests in Moscow, prompting the company's leaders to launch a Russian-language version of the site.Brad Hunstable, chief executive and co-founder of the company uStream, said that the online platform was down for nine hours. He said it was the third highly coordinated attack from Russia in six months. He noted that each attack took place at the same time Russian activists were using the platform to stream live video of protests in Moscow and other cities. He said the attack began on Wednesday at 5:30 a.m. Eastern time, targeting a channel operated by a Russian citizen journalist filming the protests. Known as a distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS, it involved thousands of IP addresses coming primarily from Russia, Kazakhstan and Iran that flooded the site,  Mr. Hunstable said, crippling the company's data centers all over the world.""The scale of this thing was absolutely incredible,"" said Mr. Hunstable, who started the company in 2007 with a fellow West Point graduate to help troops stationed overseas to communicate more easily with family members.  ""It was the most complex cyberattack that we have ever seen. This is much more than one cyberattack and one protest. This is fundamental to preserving freedom of speech and assembly on the Internet.""Mr. Hunstable said to help make sure that more people in Russia could use uStream once service was restored, his team translated into Russian instructions and other information about the site and launched it on Wednesday as soon as service was restored. They also put Russia on the site's homepage. In light of today's DDOS attack on Ustream & citizen journalists, our Russian translation feature is active now. twitter.com/Ustream/status- Ustream (@Ustream) May 9, 2012The target of the attack was a uStream channel called reggamortis1and started by Kirill Mikhailov, 23, who only recently began streaming live video from the protests. He said in an interview that he was looking to give people inside and outside of Russia a view of the protests that they might not see on official Russian television networks. When he realized that he could not stream video live on uStream from the protests Wednesday he said he turned to his Twitter account, @reggaemortis1, to share images from the protests, and to YouTube, where he posted several short videos. He also tried to use Bambuser, a popular mobile video streaming tool, but it was also under attack by hackers. ""Twitter was up the whole time,""  Mr. Mikhailov said. ""But it was not the same thing. It is not enough to get the information to people. The live video gives the vibe of the protests and people get to see them live all over the world."" He said he suspected he was targeted because he had been providing live coverage of the protests from the front lines in recent days, including showing protesters clashing with the police.  As my colleagues Andrew E. Kramer and Michael Schwirtz report, protesters used flash mobs and other  tactics to avoid arrest.  "
"Dot-Music, Dot-Sport and (Security Experts Hope) Dot-Secure","Will the new Internet with hundreds of new top-level domain names be more secure or a wild free for all? Until now, the Web has been organized into 22 familiar top-level domains -- those two or three letters that come after the period -- like .com, .org, .net, .gov and so on. But now, with the Internet crunched for space, the body that governs the domain name system, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, is about to throw open the floodgates to thousands of new top-level domains.Icann started accepting applications for new domains in January and will announce the winners this year. One year from now, you might find yourself browsing a site that ends in .coffee, .sport, .travel, or a non-English, or even non-Latin, script. Icann has already received 2,100 applications from 1,300 applicants, quadruple the number of applications expected.The expansion has been controversial to say the least. Rod Beckstrom, Icann's departing president, praised the change as a ""new domain name system revolution."" But others have predicted World War Web. The loudest critics have been security specialists who paint a frightening, Wild West landscape rife with turf wars between cybersquatters and companies, as well as hackers who can more easily game the system.For now, anyone browsing Apple.com can be reasonably confident they are, in fact, communicating with Apple. The new system will not be so straightforward. Complicating matters is the fact that any trademark, anywhere, can be used by an applicant to establish ownership. Google, for example, will not have a hard time securing .google. But Icann will have a harder time deciding who should own .apple: Apple, or the Washington State Apple Commission.The application process itself has already been a bit of a disaster. Icann had to pull its application site off line on April 12 after a bug made it possible for applicants to view other applications (no small blunder when you consider that it costs each applicant $185,000 to apply).But one group of security experts plans to use the top-level domain changes to carve out a trusted, hacker-free zone on the Web. Alex Stamos, a security expert at Artemis Internet Inc., a security firm based in San Francisco, said he filed an application for a .secure domain.""In the end, we're all just professional critics unless we do something about this,"" Mr. Stamos said in an interview. ""This is an opportunity to create a part of the Internet where the old rules don't apply.""Mr. Stamos says security technologies are still optional on the Web and it is often the user's job to decipher whether or not they are browsing safely.""If you want to securely browse the Web at Starbucks, or use a social network in Syria, you have to be a security expert to notice if something's wrong. I can only name 2,000 cryptographers who are qualified to do that,"" said Mr. Stamos.Jeremiah Grossman, a chief technology officer at Whitehat Security, said: ""I'm surprised the Web has survived this long. The only thing keeping it alive, at this point, is the fact the bad guys don't want to bring it down.""Mr. Stamos said he hopes .secure will be the closest anything has come to a safe browsing experience on the Web. Anyone who wants to host their site on the domain -- think BankofAmerica.secure or Facebook.secure -- will have to be personally vetted by an Artemis security expert and required to abide by certain security standards.To establish those security requirements, Artemis put together a working group of security experts from a broad range of technology and financial institutions. Mr. Stamos said five companies had already committed to the Domain Policy Working Group. He said it was too early to disclose which ones, but he qualified them as a software provider, three major Internet companies and a major payments company -- most likely PayPal. In a blog post on Thursday, Brad Hill, who leads security at PayPal, confirmed that PayPal had been invited to join the working group and praised the effort.Once security standards are established, Mr. Stamos said Artemis will police subdomains with scanning technologies to determine if they are up to snuff. Minor loopholes will elicit a warning or suspension until the problem is fixed. More egregious security holes will get a subdomain owner kicked to the curb.""We want this to be a safe, gated neighborhood on the Web,"" Mr. Stamos said. ""So if you want to be a member, we're going to make sure you aren't running the online equivalent of a meth lab in your garage."" "
Hacked Reuters Twitter Feed Used to Spread Disinformation About Syrian Rebels,"Reuters reports that a hacker briefly seized control of the news agency's technology news Twitter feed, @ReutersTech, on Sunday and used the account to post a stream of fabricated reports about Syria and the Middle East under the new handle @ReutersME.Earlier today @ReutersTech was hacked and changed to @ReutersME. The account has been suspended and is currently under investigation- Reuters Top News (@Reuters)5 Aug 12The stunt appeared to be the second step in a campaign by supporters of President Bashar al-Assad to use the news agency's Internet feeds to spread false information about the conflict in Syria. On Friday, Reuters was forced to temporarily shut down part of its Web site after the agency's blogging platform was hacked and fabricated reports of setbacks for Syrian rebels were posted on Reuters.com.  Before the Twitter feed was taken offline, several bloggers managed to capture screenshots of the stream of fake news headlines posted on the social network. According to a cache of the updates on Topsy, which tracks Twitter use, 22 messages were posted on the short-lived @ReutersME feed. An anonymous Dutch blogger who edits the @worldwidenieuws Twitter feed managed to capture images of 19 of the updates in threeseparatescreenshots (click on the images to see larger versions of the captures).@KMBTweets @TNW Image is much sharper if you open large photo by clicking on it.

Other updates reiterated Syrian government claims that its forces are battling a foreign-led insurgency. The first update posted after the account was seized described the capture of a French spy in Aleppo; another read: ""Turkey complains that one of its generals was captured in Aleppo, Erdogan heard shouting from his office.""While most of the updates conveyed fictional reports of disarray in the rebel Free Syrian Army, several also tweaked the White House by pretending that a spokesman for the Obama administration had announced ""financial and technical support given to Al Qaeda operatives in Syria."" The Syrian government has cast its opponents as radical Islamist terrorists since the first protesters took to the streets in March of last year.The fictional reports of American support for Al Qaeda were accompanied by an update linking to the Web site InfoWars.com, which is run by a libertarian radio host in Texas who promotes the conspiracy theory that the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks were carried out by the United States government. Several of the fictional updates seemed to be based on that premise.One part of the elaborate fiction was an update reporting the fake news that President Obama had signed an ""executive order banning any further investigation of 9/11.""Anoche, una cuenta de @Reuters fue hackeada y cambiada a @ReutersME, enviando noticias falsas. Ya fue suspendida. http://t.co/M4EfVCCG- Robby Cortés (@RobbyCortes)5 Aug 12Since the start of the uprising, the Assad government has claimed to be fighting terrorists backed by an improbable alliance between Al Qaeda, the United States and Israel. What appears to have been the final update posted on the Twitter account before it was taken offline -- ""Reuters shareholders to hold meeting over Rothschild's 'iron grip' over decision making process"" -- amplified that conspiracy theory by insinuating that the Reuters news agency itself was somehow a tool of Zionist plotters.

Al Jazeera Wrests Back Its Web Sites From Pro-Assad Hackers,"Updated | 6:15 p.m. Hackers said to be supporters of the Syrian government temporarily seized control of the Arabic and English news sites of Al Jazeera, the Qatari satellite network, which has been accused of bias in favor of protesters and rebels by the government of President Bashar al-Assad and its supporters.On Tuesday, users who tried to go to Al Jazeera's Arabic and English Web sites were instead directed to an image that said ""Hack!!"" and ""Hacked by Al-Rashedon,"" an Arabic phrase that generally means ""the rightly guided"" ones, in bold letters across an image of the news organization's page. A Syrian flag waved in the background.""In response to your stance against Syria (the people and the government), and support for only armed terrorist groups, and publication of news reports that are lies,"" the Arabic statement said in part, ""this is our response to you.""  Other news organizations or human rights groups reporting on the conflict have been hacked in apparent protest over their coverage of the conflict in Syria.  As The Lede reported last month, the international news agency Reuters temporarily lost control of its blogging platform and a Twitter feed, which were both used to publish false reports of setbacks for Syrian rebels.Amnesty International, the human rights organization, also reported being hacked last week.http://t.co/3qqdjsY2's Livewire blog was hacked, posts are up that did not originate from Amnesty. Our team in London is working on a fix!- AmnestyInternational (@amnesty)27 Aug 12Al Jazeera was created with a lavish grant from the emir of Qatar in 1996 and critics have noted that reports on the network often seem to echo his government's foreign policy. The network was credited with playing a vital role in the Arab revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, both in its own coverage and by giving air time to video documenting protests and clashes recorded by activists and posted online. In Libya, the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and its supporters went so far as to accuse Al Jazeera of fabricating video clips documenting protests on sets in Qatar. The very day that Tripoli fell, a correspondent for Iran's state-owned Press TV claimed in an interview on the Russian government's RT channel that there were no rebels in the Libyan capital. The war's decisive battle, she insisted, had been entirely simulated on Qatari sound stages.Since the start of the uprising in Syria in March of last year, Al Jazeera has offered extremely sympathetic coverage, on the airwaves and online, to protesters and armed rebels struggling against the Assad government.Poetry has been a key weapon in the #ArabSpring, used to taunt regimes refusing to see the writing on the wall | http://t.co/pv8S8uSV- Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish)3 Sep 12Supporters of Mr. Assad are not the only ones to have suggested recently that the network's reports on Syria, like those of the Saudi-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya, are so one-sided in favor of the rebels that they have dented the organization's credibility. The political commentator Sultan Al Qassemi argued in a post for Foreign Policy last month that the Arab world's two most important satellite channels had become far too partisan:Al Arabiya and Al Jazeera, the two Gulf-based channels that dominate the Arabic news business, have moved to counter Syrian regime propaganda, but have ended up distorting the news almost as badly as their opponents. In their bid to support the Syrian rebels' cause, these media giants have lowered their journalistic standards, abandoned rudimentary fact-checks, and relied on anonymous callers and unverified videos in place of solid reporting....It is not uncommon to tune in to either channel and find that the first 20 minutes of a newscast consists of Syrian activists -- some with shady backgrounds -- based either outside or inside Syria reporting via Skype on events that took place hundreds or thousands of miles away.When Al Arabiya and Al Jazeera do comment directly on Syrian affairs, they tend to paper over the rebels' flaws and emphasize the conflict's religious fault lines.  Others have noted that the network's coverage of the uprising in Bahrain, whose government enjoys Qatari support, has been far less thorough.During an interview with The Lede in Cairo last month, and in barbed comments on Twitter, the Syrian activist Rami Jarrah, who coordinates a network of anti-Assad video bloggers using the pseudonym Alexander Page, said that Al Jazeera's attempts to bolster the uprising through hyperbolic and inaccurate reports had become a liability for the revolutionaries.Aljazeera English and Arabic and al Arabiya Satelite channels have all been distorted, who ever is doing this supports #Assad.- Alexander Page (@AlexanderPageSY)20 Jul 12On Wednesday, Al Jazeera reported that the cyber attack had lasted several hours, by affecting a third-party service provider that distributes the station's online content worldwide in a security breach. It said the authorities in the United States, where the content distributor is based, were investigating. AlJazeera.net is registered to Network Solutions, whose spokeswoman, Susan Datz Edelman, said she did not have an immediate ""definitive"" comment.A spokesman for Al Jazeera, Osama Saeed, said in e-mailed statements: ""Some visitors to our Web sites faced disruption after external DNS servers were compromised.""""The company that operates them quickly resolved this, though some users may continue to experience issues for a couple of days,"" he continued. ""We thank our online community for their patience and support."" In another e-mail later on Wednesday, he said, ""Just to give you a scale of the problem as it stands, we're only around 10 percent lower on our usual number of Web visitors."" In a telephone interview, Mr. Saeed of Al Jazeera declined to discuss coverage or the possible motive of the hackers. ""We don't know anything about them, and what I understand,  there is not much about them in the public domain,"" he said.He said the hacking also affected the Web site of Al Jazeera Balkans, a news station based in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. "
No Web Site Is an Island,"Late one night last June, Facebook's Web site ground to a halt. All around the Web, thousands of other sites with a Facebook ""Like"" button slowed to a crawl. Last week, a technical malfunction at GoDaddy took down its Web site and millions more, many of which did not use a GoDaddy service.The problem was that the Web is now so interconnected that a cyberattack on, unexpected traffic to or even a minor error on one Web site can send a ripple affect across the Internet that can slow down thousands if not millions of other sites.A typical Web site today incorporates elements from some 10 different domains -- images, ads, shopping carts, Facebook's ""Like"" button, Google's Analytics service --  all hosted by third-party servers. A problem at GoDaddy or an attack on Facebook can affect any Web site those companies touch.Then there's Amazon. When Amazon started out as a book e-retailer, it hosted its own basic home page with one image and a payments feature that required 10 kilobytes of data. Today, Amazon's home page incorporates 96 different elements, some 530 kilobytes worth of images, shopping carts, ads and analytics features, hosted by 12 different domains.""Back in the '90s, if your site went down it only affected you,"" said Steve Tack, a vice president at Compuware, a firm that measures Internet performance. ""Now many relationships exist between different Web sites and if one of the large services -- Akamai, Facebook, Microsoft -- go down, it affects many sites.""Referring to the GoDaddy and Facebook failures, Mr. Tack added, ""No one service is too big too fail.""Mr. Tack said companies would do well to build their Web sites with that interconnectedness in mind. That means testing for peak loads and incorporating virtual ""off switches"" so that if one image, ad or feature experiences a problem, it does not have to take down an entire site.But, for now, most companies are not doing this. Until they do, Mr. Tack said, ""The number of hosts and interdependency is only increasing and the potential impact is very real."" "
American Banks Undamaged by Cyberattacks,"Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, U.S. Bancorp and PNC have been hit by a wave of cyberattacks that have caused Internet blackouts and delays on online banking sites.The banks have been targeted with distributed denial of service or DDoS attacks, in which hackers barrage a Web site with traffic, causing it to slow or collapse under the load. Such attacks, while a nuisance, are not technically sophisticated and typically do not affect a company's computer network - or, in this case, funds or customers' bank accounts. A hacker group, which calls itself the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters, took credit for the attacks in an online post to Pastebin, a Web site hackers frequently use to publicize attacks. The hackers say they will continue to target American corporations daily, as part of an operation they call Operation Ababil, until an amateurish 14-minute anti-Islam video, which mocks the Prophet Muhammad, is pulled from the Web. (Izz ad-Din al-Qassam was a Muslim holy man who fought against European forces and Jewish settlers in the Middle East during the 1920s and 1930s.) Last week, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup customers all experienced delays and intermittent failures on the banks' sites. On Tuesday, Wells Fargo's online banking site also periodically fell offline. Sara Hawkins, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, confirmed Wednesday that customers might still be experiencing ""intermittent access"" to the bank's Web site and said the bank was working to resolve the problem.In their post, the hackers called on volunteers to attack the site of U.S. Bancorp on Wednesday and PNC's on Thursday. By Wednesday afternoon, Tom Joyce, a spokesman for U.S. Bancorp, said that the company's online banking site had experienced some delays, but no failures, as a result of unexpected traffic and that the bank was working with law enforcement.""The issues, indeed, are related to what we would call an unusual amount of coordinated, high-volume traffic that has slowed down the system very similar to what other banks have experienced,"" Mr. Joyce said. ""These attacks were designed to slow the customer experience but their funds and data are secure.""Fred Solomon, a PNC spokesman, said that PNC's customers had also reported difficulty logging into its Web site Wednesday. Adrienne Senatore, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's field office in New York, declined to comment. Kathleen Wright, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Washington, said that as a matter of policy, the F.B.I. could not confirm whether it was investigating the attacks. None of the press officers would comment on the origin of the attacks. But last week, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, chairman of the homeland security committee, said in an interview with C-Span's ""Newsmakers"" program that the attacks on the banks had originated in Iran and were conducted in retaliation for Western economic sanctions. Hackers rebutted those claims in their online post, which has since been withdrawn from the Web. They said the attacks were not state-sponsored by Iran, and said they ""strongly reject the American officials' insidious attempts to deceive public opinion."" It said:We invite all cyberspace workers to join us in this Proper Act. If America's arrogant government do not submit, the attack will be large and larger and will include other evil countries like Israel, French and U.Kingdom indeed.Cybersecurity experts said they had witnessed an increase in activity from Iran and an increase in the number of so-called hacktivists, hackers who attack for political purposes rather than for profit. ""We absolutely have seen more activity from the Middle East, and in particular Iran has been increasingly active as they build up their cybercapabilities,"" said George Kurtz, the president of CrowdStrike, a computer security company, and former chief technology officer at McAfee. ""There is also a strong activist movement underfoot which should be concerning to many large companies.  The threat is real and what we are seeing now is only the tip of the iceberg.""James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in this case, the attack methods used were ""pretty basic,"" which raised doubts about whether the attacks were state-sponsored. He added that if the attacks were not the work of Iran's government, the state would still be aware of them. ""They extensively monitor their domestic networks, so if this is some activist group there may be at least some government knowledge.""   "
The Internet Attack That Wasn't,"For an hour this afternoon, the entire Internet came under attack. Or so it seemed.Brian Krebs, a closely followed computer security blogger, reported on Twitterthat he had received a tip that the servers that power the entire Internet were under attack. The well-regarded Mr. Krebs linked to an Internet Traffic Report that said nine out of 13 Domain Name System servers had been disabled in the largest denial of service ever reported - topping a 1997 incident in which a technical glitch disabled seven DNS root servers.""At 1:45pm for about one hour an extremely large distributed denial-of-server (DDoS) attack took place. The target of the attack were the 13 DNS root servers, which are responsible for helping to resolving domain names to their respective IP's. Even though 9 of the 13 servers were disabled in the attack, the remaining were able to support the additional load without any widespead problems. Prior to this attack, the largest outage for the root registry was 7 machines in July of 1997, due to a technical problem.""An attack on the Domain Name System would be devastating. The system converts people-friendly domain names like yahoo.com into the numeric addresses that computers use to route traffic. By attacking the root servers that power the system, attackers would crash the Internet's switchboard, making it impossible for people to reach Web sites.Anonymous, the loose hacking collective, threatened to take down the DNS root servers in March - an effort that was unsuccessful but that prompted a multimillion-dollar global effort to beef up the DNS system, given the potential for devastation.But Monday afternoon's report was a false alarm. And the unusual traffic directed at the DNS root servers was actually the Internet's version of a fire drill. The Internet Traffic Report that Mr. Krebs linked to was actually from 2002.According to people who work closely with the DNS system, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak, those who defend the Domain Name System underwent an exercise this week to simulate a denial of service attack on its root servers. The simulation was part of a regular exercise conducted every six months, to make sure the system can withstand large amounts of traffic in the event of attack.The exercise was timed a little more than one week after Leon E. Panetta, the defense secretary, warned that the United States was vulnerable to ""cyber-Pearl Harbor,"" with foreign hackers determined to attack the nation's critical infrastructure, like its water supply and power plants.As for Mr. Krebs, he later Tweeted that people should disregard his earlier message. ""Some days I just want to unplug and play Halo,"" Mr. Krebs wrote. ""This is one of those days."" "
Daily Report: How Aramco Got Hacked,"On Aug. 15, more than 55,000 Saudi Aramco employees stayed home from work to prepare for one of Islam's holiest nights of the year - Lailat al Qadr, or the Night of Power - celebrating the revelation of the Koran to Muhammad.That morning at 11:08, Nicole Perlroth reports in The New York Times, a person with privileged access to the Saudi state-owned oil company's computers unleashed a virus to initiate what is regarded as among the most destructive acts of computer sabotage on a company. The virus erased data on three-quarters of Aramco's corporate PCs - documents, spreadsheets, e-mail, files - replacing all of it with an image of a burning American flag. United States intelligence officials say the attack's real perpetrator was Iran, although they offered no specific evidence to support that claim. But Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, in a recent speech warning of the dangers of computer attacks, cited the Aramco sabotage as ""a significant escalation of the cyber threat."" In the Aramco case, hackers who called themselves the ""Cutting Sword of Justice"" and claimed to be activists upset about Saudi policies in the Middle East took responsibility. But their online message and the burning flag were probably red herrings, say independent computer researchers who have examined the code of the virus.  After analyzing the software code from the Aramco attack, security experts say the event involved a company insider, or insiders, with privileged access to Aramco's network. The virus could have been carried on a USB memory stick that was inserted into a PC.Aramco's attackers posted blocks of I.P. addresses of thousands of Aramco PCs online as proof of the attack. Researchers say only an Aramco employee or contractor with access to the company's internal network would have been able to grab that list from a disconnected computer inside Aramco's network.Neither researchers nor officials have disclosed the names of the attackers involved. Saudi Aramco said in a statement that it was inappropriate to comment during an investigation, adding that the company had a policy of not commenting on rumor or speculation.  "
U.S. Charges Popular Site With Piracy,"In what the federal authorities on Thursday called one of the largest criminal copyright cases ever brought, the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation seized the Web site Megaupload and charged seven people connected with it with running an international enterprise based on Internet piracy.Coming just a day after civil protests in the United States over proposed antipiracy bills, the arrests were greeted almost immediately with digital Molotov cocktails. The hacker collective that calls itself Anonymous attacked the Web sites of the Justice Department and several major entertainment companies and trade groups in retaliation for Mega-upload's seizure. The Justice Department's site and several others remained inaccessible for much of Thursday afternoon. Megaupload, one of the most popular so-called locker services on the Internet, allowed users to anonymously transfer large files like movies and music. Media companies have long accused it of abetting copyright infringement on a vast scale. In a grand jury indictment, Megaupload is accused of causing $500 million in damages to copyright owners and of making $175 million through selling ads and premium subscriptions.Four of the seven people, including the site's founder, Kim Dotcom (born Kim Schmitz), have been arrested in New Zealand, the authorities said; the three others remain at large. Each of the seven people -- who the indictment said were members of a criminal group it called ''Mega Conspiracy'' -- is charged with five counts of copyright infringement and conspiracy. The charges could result in more than 20 years in prison.As part of the crackdown, more than 20 search warrants were executed in the United States and in eight other countries. About $50 million in assets were also seized, as well as a number of servers and 18 domain names that formed Megaupload's network of file-sharing sites.Ira P. Rothken, a lawyer for Megaupload, said in a phone interview on Thursday that ''Megaupload believes the government is wrong on the facts, wrong on the law.''The case against Megaupload comes at a charged time, a day after broad online protests against a pair of antipiracy bills in Congress, the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, in the House, and the Protect I.P. Act, or PIPA, in the Senate.The bills would give federal authorities expanded powers to crack down on foreign sites suspected of piracy. But technology companies and civil liberties groups say that the powers are too broadly defined and could effectively result in censorship. On Wednesday, Google and Wikipedia joined dozens of sites in political theatrics by blacking out some content and explaining their arguments against the laws.Anonymous, which has previously set its sights on PayPal, Sony and major media executives, was more blunt in its response. The group disabled the Justice Department's site for a time, and it also claimed credit for shutting down sites for the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America, two of the most powerful media lobbies in Washington, as well as those of the Universal Music Group, the largest music label, and BMI, which represents music publishers.''Let's just say, for #SOPA supporters their #SOPAblackout is today,'' Anonymous wrote in a Twitter post. In an e-mail, a spokesman for the group said it was responsible for the Web attacks.The Megaupload case touches on many of the most controversial aspects of the antipiracy debate. Megaupload and similar sites, like Rapidshare and Mediafire, are often promoted as convenient ways to legitimately transfer large files; a recent promotional video had major stars like Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas singing Mega-upload's praises. But they have become notorious inside media companies, which see the legitimate uses as a veil concealing extensive theft.Mr. Dotcom, a portly 37-year-old with dual Finnish and German citizenship, has made himself a visible target. He splits his time between Hong Kong and New Zealand and casts himself in flamboyant YouTube videos. His role as one of the most prominent Web locker operators has earned him a half-joking nickname in Hollywood: Dr. Evil.According to the indictment, he earned $42 million from Mega-upload's operations in 2010.The indictment against Mega-upload, which stems from a federal investigation that began two years ago, was handed down by a grand jury in Virginia two weeks ago but was not unsealed until Thursday.It quotes extensively from correspondence among the defendants, who work for Megaupload and its related sites. The correspondence, the indictment says, shows that the operators knew the site contained unauthorized content.The indictment cites an e-mail from last February, for example, in which three members of the group discussed an article about how to stop the government from seizing domain names.The Megaupload case is unusual, said Orin S. Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University, in that federal prosecutors obtained the private e-mails of Megaupload's operators in an effort to show they were operating in bad faith.''The government hopes to use their private words against them,'' Mr. Kerr said. ''This should scare the owners and operators of similar sites.'' "
U.S. to Share Cautionary Tale of Trade Secret Theft With Chinese Official,"WASHINGTON -- China's next leader, Xi Jinping, may never have heard of American Superconductor Corporation before he arrived here Monday, but by the end of his visit United States officials hope to make the small Massachusetts wind-energy company an object lesson in the impact of Chinese trade secret theft on American business.Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Massachusetts Democrat, plans to raise personally with Mr. Xi the case of a company that saw 70 percent of its business evaporate last year after a Chinese partner enticed one of its employees to steal the crown jewel of its technology. ''It's a very clear and, in our judgment, egregious, palpable demonstration of the practice that we are deeply concerned about,'' Mr. Kerry said, ''but it's not the only one. There are so many things: cyberattacks, access-to-market issues, espionage, theft. These are major points of discussion between us and China.''Both President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. warned Mr. Xi on Tuesday that they had been hearing more and more from United States businesses about intellectual property and trade secret theft, but they did not specifically mention American Superconductor. However, background material on the company's experience was included in briefing papers distributed before the arrival in Washington of Mr. Xi's delegation, and a top administration official said the Chinese were aware of United States frustration over the case.With anger toward Chinese trade and industrial practices emerging as a major theme for the 2012 campaign season, American Superconductor's story seems ripe for the moment.The facts are difficult to dispute, given the volume of evidence. Last March, China's Sinovel, the world's second largest wind turbine manufacturer, abruptly refused shipments of American Superconductor's wind turbine electrical systems and control software. The blow was devastating; Sinovel provided more than 70 percent of the firm's revenues.The value of undelivered components on existing contracts exceeded $700 million, Daniel Patrick McGahn, the company's president and chief executive, told investors. Its share price plunged by more than 80 percent in six months.Last summer, evidence emerged that Sinovel had promised $1.5 million to Dejan Karabasevic, a Serbian employee of American Superconductor in Austria.Company officials say they found hundreds of e-mails and messages between senior Sinovel staff members and Mr. Karabasevic detailing the property to be stolen from the company, offering the money, and showing the actual transfer of the software. They even found signed contracts for the transaction.Mr. Karabasevic was arrested, confessed to the crime, was convicted and is now serving time in an Austrian prison.American Superconductor filed multiple lawsuits against Sinovel, seeking more than $1.2 billion in damages, cease and desist orders and copyright remedies.In October, Sinovel countersued, saying it stopped accepting components because of quality problems and asking an arbitration commission to award it about $58 million for a breach of contract. The company is also demanding that American Superconductor pay its lawyers' fees, expenses and the cost of the arbitration.This month, a court in Hainan, China, dismissed the smallest of the suits and said it should be heard by an arbitration commission in Beijing. The first arbitration hearing is scheduled for Feb. 24.Company officials would not discuss their push for attention in Washington, but in a conference call with analysts in November, Mr. McGahn was open about his view of the case.''While we acknowledge that this is a commercial matter, many have pointed to this case as an important litmus test for future energy cooperation between China and the West,'' he said, according to a transcript of the call.Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation who has been leading a roundtable on such cases for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, called the case particularly egregious. But, he added, ''This is not a one-shot deal that affects one company in Massachusetts. It is unbelievably endemic.''A lengthy paper by the foundation, due out in two weeks, will detail what Mr. Atkinson says has been the systematic pilfering of United States technology. ''The Chinese have U.S. companies over a barrel because of the pressure for short-term earnings. They've got renminbi dancing in their eyes,'' Mr. Atkinson said, referring to China's currency. ''But nine years later the Chinese are eating your lunch.''The United States-China Business Council, which encourages economic cooperation, is more sanguine. Its survey of companies doing business in China found that only 18 percent said they had been asked to transfer technology as a condition for a business transaction. Three percent said they were able to scale back the request but did hand over some of their technology. About 2 percent said they met the request so they could stay in business in China.But stories like American Superconductor's are rampant. Japanese and European companies like Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Siemens AG say they are competing against their once-junior Chinese partners and their own technology for the global high-speed rail business. Automobile writers have waxed indignantly about a new Chinese pickup truck that looks uncannily like the Ford F-150.Such concerns are meshing with Mr. Obama's stern new push to make China play by the rules of international commerce. ''I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules,'' the president said during his State of the Union address in January, announcing the creation of what he has called a Trade Enforcement Union ''that will be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China.''Mr. Atkinson is not convinced that the administration will hold to that pledge. ''They've got to stop pretending that this engagement that they're in right now with China is yielding results,'' he said. ''For every mole they whack, three more pop up. They need to vocally call out China on these egregious practices and say enough is enough.'' "
Appeals Court Overturns Conviction of Ex-Goldman Programmer,"Since his arrest nearly three years ago, Sergey Aleynikov, a former programmer at Goldman Sachs, has acknowledged violating the bank's confidentiality policy by downloading source code from company computers.He also insisted that it was not a criminal act.A federal appeals court has now agreed with Mr. Aleynikov, issuing a ruling late Thursday that not only reversed his conviction but also mandated an acquittal, resulting in his release from prison on Friday afternoon.''Justice occasionally works,'' said an emotional Mr. Aleynikov, who appeared in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Friday afternoon sporting a prison-issued gray sweat suit. He had served one year of an eight-year sentence at a federal penitentiary in Fort Dix, N.J.The reversal deals a major blow to the Justice Department, which has made the prosecution of high-tech crime and intellectual property theft a main concern. It is also a loss for Goldman Sachs, which reported Mr. Aleynikov to federal authorities after it accused him of stealing computer code. The bank had portrayed itself as the victim of a brazen crime. The unusual decision from a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit came just hours after hearing his lawyer, Kevin Marino, argue his appeal. On Friday, after a request from prosecutors, the appeals court dialed back its ruling, revoking its mandate that the trial court judge issue an acquittal. That could allow the government to appeal the Second Circuit's decision by requesting that the entire panel of appeals court judges review the case.Chief Judge Dennis G. Jacobs issued a terse one-paragraph order without explanation, saying only that an opinion would follow ''in due course.''A spokesman for the United States attorney in Manhattan declined to comment. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.Legal experts said that the ruling strongly suggested that the written opinion from the highly influential Second Circuit court would be a significant development in corporate espionage law.''Given that theft of trade secrets and other intellectual property has been a growing priority for federal prosecutors, the court's forthcoming opinion will be critical for defining the scope of the government's enforcement ability in this space,'' said Nicholas S. Goldin, a partner at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, who served as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where he worked on these types of cases.The Aleynikov case has tested the boundaries of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, which makes it a crime to steal trade secrets. At the time of his conviction, Mr. Aleynikov was held up by federal prosecutors as an example of the government's crackdown on employees who steal valuable information - especially in digital form - from their employers.Early this decade, the Justice Department formed computer hacking and intellectual property units, or CHIP units, at United States attorney's offices around the country to fight a spike in intellectual-property theft and cybercrime. During the 2010 fiscal year, the F.B.I. opened at least 190 intellectual-property crime investigations, 66 of which concerned trade-secret theft.Members of the white-collar criminal-defense bar have criticized the Justice Department's aggressive stance toward prosecuting corporate espionage, arguing that victims like Goldman can seek suitable remedies in civil court.A crucial issue on Mr. Aleynikov's appeal - and a main focus of the judges during the oral argument on Thursday - was whether his actions constituted a crime under the statutory language of the Economic Espionage Act. The judges homed in on whether Goldman's high-frequency trading system, and the code upon which it was built, was a ''product produced for interstate commerce'' within the meaning of the statute.Mr. Marino, Mr. Aleynikov's lawyer, argued that the trading system housed on Goldman's computer servers was not produced for commerce because Goldman never licensed or sold the system and had no intention of doing so. Goldman's trading system, he argued, was built for internal use and was not a tangible item of property distributed and used by the commercial public.A government lawyer countered that the trading system had obvious connections to interstate commerce, because Goldman used to it buy and sell stocks and bonds across global markets.Mr. Aleynikov's odyssey through the criminal justice system began on July 3, 2009, when F.B.I. agents arrested him as he stepped off a flight at Newark Liberty International Airport.The government accused Mr. Aleynikov of stealing Goldman's proprietary ''black box'' computer code that the bank used to make rapid-fire trades across global markets. Mr. Aleynikov was criminally charged with violating two laws: the Economic Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act.His case highlighted a new and lucrative corner of Wall Street. High-frequency trading uses complex computer algorithms to make thousands of lightning-fast trades that exploit tiny price discrepancies. The trading became a substantial source of revenue at banks and hedge funds, which vigilantly guard the code underpinning their lucrative trading strategies.Mr. Aleynikov, 42 years old and a resident of North Caldwell, N.J., came to the United States from Russia in 1990, with a degree in computer programming. He joined Goldman in May 2007 and was paid $400,000 a year to write code for its high-frequency trading business, making him one of the bank's highest-paid programmers.After a little more than two years at Goldman, Mr. Aleynikov was lured away from Goldman by Teza Technologies, a new firm run by a former senior executive at the Citadel Investment Group, a large Chicago hedge fund. Teza offered to pay Mr. Aleynikov about triple his Goldman salary.Before leaving Goldman, Mr. Aleynikov downloaded the bank's secret source code to his home computer, his laptop and a memory device. Goldman caught Mr. Aleynikov after noticing a surge of data leaving its servers and reported the violation to criminal authorities.During a two-week trial in December 2010, the government depicted Mr. Aleynikov as an evil, greedy computer scientist who had masterminded a hacking scheme that could potentially earn his new employer millions of dollars.Mr. Aleynikov's lawyer acknowledged that his client should not have lifted source code from Goldman, but argued that it was not a criminal case and his client never intended to harm the bank.A jury convicted Mr. Aleynikov after three hours of deliberation.But on Friday at 6 a.m., Mr. Aleynikov opened his prison-monitored e-mail account at Fort Dix to find a two-word message from his lawyer: ''We won.''Standing by his client after Friday's court hearing, Mr. Marino railed against the government's case.''This was a radical exaggeration of the breadth of the criminal laws and a wrongheaded prosecution that should never have been brought,'' the lawyer said.Mr. Aleynikov said he had barely had time to think about the future, but was excited to see his three young children, ages 8, 6 and 3. And though overjoyed with his win on appeal, he was measured about the future.''In prison you learn to appreciate your life day by day,'' he said. ''Today is a victory, but tomorrow you never know.''This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
The Cybercrime Wave That Wasn't,"Dinei Florencio is a researcher and Cormac Herley is a principal researcher at Microsoft Research.IN less than 15 years, cybercrime has moved from obscurity to the spotlight of consumer, corporate and national security concerns. Popular accounts suggest that cybercrime is large, rapidly growing, profitable and highly evolved; annual loss estimates range from billions to nearly $1 trillion. While other industries stagger under the weight of recession, in cybercrime, business is apparently booming.Yet in terms of economics, there's something very wrong with this picture. Generally the demand for easy money outstrips supply. Is cybercrime an exception? If getting rich were as simple as downloading and running software, wouldn't more people do it, and thus drive down returns? We have examined cybercrime from an economics standpoint and found a story at odds with the conventional wisdom. A few criminals do well, but cybercrime is a relentless, low-profit struggle for the majority. Spamming, stealing passwords or pillaging bank accounts might appear a perfect business. Cybercriminals can be thousands of miles from the scene of the crime, they can download everything they need online, and there's little training or capital outlay required. Almost anyone can do it.Well, not really. Structurally, the economics of cybercrimes like spam and password-stealing are the same as those of fishing. Economics long ago established that common-access resources make for bad business opportunities. No matter how large the original opportunity, new entrants continue to arrive, driving the average return ever downward. Just as unregulated fish stocks are driven to exhaustion, there is never enough ''easy money'' to go around.How do we reconcile this view with stories that cybercrime rivals the global drug trade in size? One recent estimate placed annual direct consumer losses at $114 billion worldwide. It turns out, however, that such widely circulated cybercrime estimates are generated using absurdly bad statistical methods, making them wholly unreliable.Most cybercrime estimates are based on surveys of consumers and companies. They borrow credibility from election polls, which we have learned to trust. However, when extrapolating from a surveyed group to the overall population, there is an enormous difference between preference questions (which are used in election polls) and numerical questions (as in cybercrime surveys).For one thing, in numeric surveys, errors are almost always upward: since the amounts of estimated losses must be positive, there's no limit on the upside, but zero is a hard limit on the downside. As a consequence, respondent errors -- or outright lies -- cannot be canceled out. Even worse, errors get amplified when researchers scale between the survey group and the overall population.Suppose we asked 5,000 people to report their cybercrime losses, which we will then extrapolate over a population of 200 million. Every dollar claimed gets multiplied by 40,000. A single individual who falsely claims $25,000 in losses adds a spurious $1 billion to the estimate. And since no one can claim negative losses, the error can't be canceled.THE cybercrime surveys we have examined exhibit exactly this pattern of enormous, unverified outliers dominating the data. In some, 90 percent of the estimate appears to come from the answers of one or two individuals. In a 2006 survey of identity theft by the Federal Trade Commission, two respondents gave answers that would have added $37 billion to the estimate, dwarfing that of all other respondents combined.This is not simply a failure to achieve perfection or a matter of a few percentage points; it is the rule, rather than the exception. Among dozens of surveys, from security vendors, industry analysts and government agencies, we have not found one that appears free of this upward bias. As a result, we have very little idea of the size of cybercrime losses.A cybercrime where profits are slim and competition is ruthless also offers simple explanations of facts that are otherwise puzzling. Credentials and stolen credit-card numbers are offered for sale at pennies on the dollar for the simple reason that they are hard to monetize. Cybercrime billionaires are hard to locate because there aren't any. Few people know anyone who has lost substantial money because victims are far rarer than the exaggerated estimates would imply.Of course, this is not a zero-sum game: the difficulty of getting rich for bad guys doesn't imply that the consequences are small for good guys. Profit estimates may be enormously exaggerated, but it would be a mistake not to consider cybercrime a serious problem.Those who've had their computers infected with malware or had their e-mail passwords stolen know that cleaning up the mess dwarfs any benefit received by hackers. Many measures that tax the overall population, from baroque password policies to pop-up warnings to ''prove you are human'' tests, wouldn't be necessary if cybercriminals weren't constantly abusing the system.Still, that doesn't mean exaggerated loss estimates should be acceptable. Rather, there needs to be a new focus on how consumers and policy makers assess the problem.The harm experienced by users rather than the (much smaller) gain achieved by hackers is the true measure of the cybercrime problem. Surveys that perpetuate the myth that cybercrime makes for easy money are harmful because they encourage hopeful, if misinformed, new entrants, who generate more harm for users than profit for themselves.

"Florida Firm Says It, Not F.B.I., Was Hacking Victim","A company in Orlando, Fla., said on Monday that it -- not the F.B.I. -- was the source of a file hackers posted online last week that contained a million identification numbers for Apple mobile devices.The company, BlueToad, which works with thousands of publishers to translate printed content into digital and mobile formats, said hackers had breached its systems more than a week ago and stolen the file. A few days after the file appeared online, the company realized that its contents matched the stolen information, said Paul DeHart, BlueToad's chief executive.That version of events differs sharply from that put forth by the hackers last week. They claimed to have stolen the file from the laptop of an F.B.I. agent -- and they said it was proof that the F.B.I. was tracking people through their iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches. They posted one million identification numbers but claimed to have 11 million more in their possession, along with personal information about the owners of the devices.A spokesman for the F.B.I. denied last week that the file had been taken from one of its agent's computers, and an Apple spokeswoman said it had never given any such information to the F.B.I.Mr. DeHart said in an interview that BlueToad was voluntarily disclosing the theft. ''We decided to come forward to apologize to our customers, partners and the public in general that this got out there,'' he said. ''We face thousands of attacks every day that we've been successful at defending. This one happened to get through.''A security researcher first tipped the company off last week to the fact that hackers might have posted its data, Mr. DeHart said. David Schuetz, a researcher at the Intrepidus Group, a New York-based mobile security firm, mined the data in the hackers' file for clues to its origin. He noted that several of the identification numbers were linked to device names that referenced Blue-Toad.After Mr. Schuetz contacted BlueToad, the company verified the data breach and alerted law enforcement and Apple.Apple's unique device identifiers -- known as U.D.I.D.'s -- are 40-character strings that are tied to a particular device. The company began discouraging app makers from using U.D.I.D.'s last year because developers and advertisers were taking advantage of them to track users as they moved from app to app, compiling a profile of user behavior that could be sold or used for ad targeting.Trudy Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, said Apple recently introduced a system to replace the use of the U.D.I.D. and would soon be banning apps that tried to exploit them.''As an app developer BlueToad would have access to a user's device information, such as U.D.I.D. device name and type,'' she said. Ms. Muller noted that developers would not have access to more confidential information like passwords or credit card information, ''unless a user specifically elects to provide that information to a developer.''Mr. DeHart said BlueToad collected U.D.I.D. information to keep count of how many people used its services, but stopped collecting it after Apple discouraged its use last year. He said the stolen file contained identifiers collected by older BlueToad mobile apps, and that BlueToad had ''nowhere near'' the 12 million identification numbers that hackers claimed to have stolen.Security researchers debate how much harm can be done using someone's U.D.I.D. Most say the release of identifiers and device names poses little risk. They said that without more information about device owners -- like their e-mail addresses or date of birth -- it would be hard for someone to use the data to do harm.But some researchers disagree with that assessment. Aldo Cortesi, a New Zealand security researcher, has called U.D.I.D.'s a ''privacy catastrophe.'' Last year, he demonstrated how, in some cases, U.D.I.D.'s could be used to find a person's identity, determine their location and even hijack their Facebook profile.Mr. DeHart said in an interview his company thought the data release posed little danger. ''We're aware of the differing opinions out there,'' he said. ''We have never associated these numbers with other account information and never used them for authentication purposes. We think the overall risk is very low.''Mr. DeHart said law enforcement officials were still investigating the attack, but suspected that the hackers responsible were different from the hackers who claimed credit for the attack online. ''The way we understand it, somebody got into our systems, took the information and, to prove themselves, handed it to this other group who exploited it for their own purposes,'' he said.Peter Donald, an F.B.I. spokesman, declined to comment on BlueToad's announcement.AntiSec, the hacking group that said it had taken the file from the F.B.I., is a subset of the loose hacking collective known as Anonymous. The group has frequently gone after the F.B.I. But the frequency of such attacks tapered off in March after several members of Anonymous, and a spinoff group, were arrested.Messages sent Monday to the Twitter accounts of hackers who had claimed credit for the attack went unanswered.PHOTO: Paul DeHart, BlueToad's chief, said the company was voluntarily disclosing the theft.

Japan: Rocket Data Stolen,"TOKYO -- Japan's space agency said on Friday that information on one of its newest rockets was stolen from a desktop computer by someone using a computer virus. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency said that the virus in a computer at its Tsukuba Space Center northeast of Tokyo was found to be secretly collecting data and sending it outside the agency. The agency said that after the virus was detected by antivirus software on Nov. 21, it conducted an emergency sweep for viruses that showed no other computers at the center had been infected.The agency said it was unclear if the virus was a cyberattack. Japanese defense companies, however, have been recent targets of similar information-stealing viruses, some previously traced to China.The data stolen from the space agency included information about the Epsilon, a solid-fuel rocket still under development. While the Epsilon is intended to launch satellite and space probes, solid-fuel rockets of that size can also have a military use as intercontinental ballistic missiles.The Epsilon, whose first launching is scheduled for next autumn, will also feature new technology that will allow it to be remotely controlled by a personal computer.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Court Overturns Conviction of Ex-Goldman Programmer,"A federal appeals court reversed the conviction late Thursday of Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs programmer found guilty of stealing proprietary code from the bank's high-frequency trading platform.The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the conviction and ordered the trial court to enter a judgment of acquittal. A judgment of acquittal generally bars the government from retrying a defendant.The reversal was without explanation; it said an opinion would follow ""in due course.""  The appeals court ruling came just hours after a three-judge panel heard oral arguments on Mr. Aleynikov's appeal. Mr. Aleynikov, who was convicted in December 2010, is serving an eight-year sentence at a federal prison in Fort Dix, N.J.""We are pleased and gratified that the court of appeals has roundly rejected the government's attempt to rewrite the federal criminal laws,"" said Kevin Marino, Mr. Aleynikov's lawyer. ""Mr. Aleynikov spent a year in prison and suffered many other losses as a result of these unjust charges, but he never lost faith in his ability to win an acquittal. This is a wonderful day in his life.""Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, declined to comment.The reversal deals a major blow to the Justice Department, which has made the prosecution of high-tech crime and intellectual property theft a top priority. This case tested the boundaries of the Economic Espionage Act, a 15-year-old law that makes it a crime to steal trade secrets. Federal prosecutors held up the arrest of Mr. Aleynikov as an example of the government's crackdown on employees who steal valuable and proprietary information from their employers.The decision is also a loss for Goldman Sachs, which reported Mr. Aleynikov to federal authorities after it accused him of stealing computer code. The bank had portrayed itself as the victim of a brazen crime.A crucial issue in the appeal -- and a main focus of Thursday's oral argument -- was whether Mr. Aleynikov's actions constituted a crime under the statutory language of the Economic Espionage Act. The debate centered on whether Goldman's high frequency trading system was a ""product produced for interstate commerce"" within the meaning of the law.Lawyers for Mr. Aleynikov argued that the bank's trading platform was built for internal use and never placed in the stream of commerce. The government countered that the high-frequency trading system, which Goldman used to trade in markets around the globe, was clearly produced for interstate and foreign commerce.Mr. Aleynikov's arrest in 2009 drew attention to a new and lucrative corner of Wall Street. High-frequency trading uses complex computer algorithms to make rapid trades that exploit tiny price discrepancies. The trading became a substantial source of revenue at banks and hedge funds, and these companies vigilantly guard the code underpinning their trading strategies.Armed with a degree in computer programming, Mr. Aleynikov came to the United States from Russia in 1990. His services were in demand at Goldman, which paid him $400,000 a year to write code for its high-frequency trading business, making him one of the bank's highest-paid programmers.He was lured away from Goldman by Teza Technologies, a new firm run by an executive from the Citadel Investment Group, a giant Chicago hedge fund. Teza offered to pay about triple what he made at Goldman.During his last final days at Goldman, Mr. Aleynikov uploaded source code to a server in Germany that allowed him to do an end run around the company's security systems. He was arrested shortly thereafter.At trial, Mr. Marino, the lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov, acknowledge that his client breached Goldman's confidentiality agreements, but insisted that he did not commit a crime.Federal prosecutors portrayed Mr. Aleynikov as a thief who stole Goldman's closely guarded code to help his new employer. After a two-week trial, the jury deliberated for just three hours before reaching a unanimous guilty verdict.The ruling is the second time in as many months that the Federal Appeals Court in Manhattan has overturned a conviction secured by the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. In January, the appeals court reversed the conviction of Joseph P. Collins, a former outside lawyer to Refco, the collapsed brokerage firm, citing judicial error.  "
Dropbox Spam Attack Tied to Stolen Employee Password,"A spam attack on users of Dropbox, the cloud-storage service, has been linked to a password that was stolen in a breach on another Web site.That is the conclusion of a two-week-long investigation by Dropbox into reports that a security breach may have caused its users to receive spam messages. The problems first surfaced July 16 after Dropbox users complained that spam messages had been sent to e-mail addresses they reserved exclusively for their Dropbox accounts. The fraudulent e-mails appeared to be from gambling sites.In a blog post, Dropbox said that user names and passwords exposed in breaches on another Web site were tested on Dropbox accounts. And in one case, hackers used a stolen password to log into a Dropbox employee's account that contained a document with users' e-mail addresses. Spammers used those e-mail addresses to send spam.The incident illustrates a frequent tactic used by hackers. Hackers will often steal user names and passwords from sites that, at first glance, may not appear to contain any valuable financial or personal information. Then, they will test those credentials across the Web sites of financial organizations, brokerage accounts and, apparently, Dropbox accounts, where potentially more lucrative information may be found.Such appeared to be the case with the breaches that surfaced in June at LinkedIn, eHarmony and the CBS music site LastFM.comYahoo breach on July 12.Brandon Borrman, a spokesman for Dropbox, declined to say whether it was that Yahoo breach  - which led to the posting of thousands of user names and passwords just four days before Dropbox users began reporting problems - that led to its own spam attack.The incident represents the second time a Dropbox security issue has surfaced publicly. Last year, a bug in a software update made it possible for anyone to log into any Dropbox account so long as that person had the e-mail address of the user.The problem was fixed within several hours but it served as a warning both for users and for corporations whose employees increasingly turn to cheap and easy-to-use storage services, like Dropbox and Google Docs, to store sensitive corporate information.Use of these services has become the preferred storage method for many employees. Unbeknown to their employers at closely guarded organizations like Apple, Johnson & Johnson and NASA, employees increasingly use Dropbox and Google Docs to store corporate files - a reality that has helped Dropbox accumulate some 50 million users. The problem is that a single breach on Dropbox could have much broader implications for a host of larger corporations, which find it increasingly difficult to get a handle on their data with an increasingly mobile work force.In its blog post, Dropbox said it would be adding a number of additional security features in coming weeks. Among them is a new two-factor authentication option, in which Dropbox users will soon be able to log in with both a password and a second code texted to a user's phone. The company said it had also added a new page that would let users examine their log-in history and check for any suspicious activity. It also said it would start requiring its users to change passwords that were too common or had not been used for a long period of time. "
Questions On Hacking For Times Of London,"LONDON -- Questions about illegal computer hacking by The Times of London were raised on Thursday when officials at the judicial inquiry into press ethics said they would recall the paper's editor for further testimony and the police confirmed that they were investigating an incident in 2009 in which one of the paper's reporters apparently hacked an e-mail account. So far the bulk of the police investigation has focused on phone hacking, which officials at Rupert Murdoch's News International have admitted was rampant at the now-defunct News of the World tabloid. Hacking into people's e-mails is a potentially more serious crime than listening to their voice mail messages, and last summer the police opened Operation Tuleta, an investigation into computer hacking that is being held in tandem with one on phone hacking (Operation Weeting) and another on bribing the police (Operation Elveden).One suspect, identified only as a 52-year-old man, was arrested in November on suspicion of computer hacking as part of Operation Tuleta. He has not yet been charged.The judicial investigation, known as the Leveson Inquiry, earlier heard testimony by the editor of The Times of London, James Harding, referring to an incident in 2009 when one of the paper's reporters illegally gained access to an e-mail account. The account belonged to a police officer who was writing a blog under the pseudonym Nightjack and whose true identity was subsequently revealed by the paper.It is this incident that the police say they are looking at.Mr. Harding told the Leveson panel that he had reprimanded the reporter and directed him to find the officer's identity legally.''When the reporter informed his managers that, in the course of his investigation, he had on his own initiative sought unauthorized access to an e-mail account, he was told that if he wanted to pursue the story he had to use legitimate means to do so,'' Mr. Harding wrote in a statement to the committee.''He did, identifying the person at the heart of the story using his own sources and information publicly available on the Internet,'' Mr. Harding continued. The reporter has since left the paper.A spokesman for the inquiry said that Mr. Harding would appear next week to answer further questions. He did not elaborate.Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police said that they had responded to a letter from Tom Watson, a Labour member of Parliament who has pushed for investigations into News International, that asked them to examine computer hacking at The Times of London in light of the revelations.''The concerns raised within your letter are under investigation,'' Detective Superintendent John Levett, who is part of Operation Tuleta, wrote in his response to Mr. Watson. "
Britain: Nine Hacking Suits Settled,"LONDON -- Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper subsidiary reached a new batch of settlements on Wednesday in the hacking scandal that has convulsed parts of the British press, police and political establishment, according to lawyers.In January, Mr. Murdoch's media empire agreed to pay substantial damages to several dozen high-profile victims of phone and e-mail hacking, and lawyers for those victims said they had seen documents showing that senior managers not only knew about the practice but also lied about it and destroyed evidence as part of a cover-up.On Wednesday, nine out of 10 remaining cases in a first wave of suits brought against News International were settled, said Hugh Tomlinson, a lawyer for the victims. The only outstanding case was one concerning a singer, Charlotte Church. But, Mr. Tomlinson said, six more suits had been filed and 50 were being prepared.A spokeswoman for News International, the British newspaper subsidiary of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, confirmed that the settlements had been reached, but would not comment on them ''beyond what's being read into court.''Among the cases settled was that of the comedian Steve Coogan, who received a settlement of around $64,000. A Liberal Democrat lawmaker, Simon Hughes, received around $72,000, according to The Press Association news agency.Alastair Campbell, the former media adviser to former Prime Minister Tony Blair, said in a statement that he had reached a ''satisfactory'' settlement, The Press Association said.In a statement Mr. Hughes, who had first brought a criminal case for phone hacking in 2006, said he had decided to settle because he was ''completely satisfied that the evidence which currently exists in relation to my case has been disclosed to or is being made available to my lawyers.''There is no confidentiality clause in the settlement, he warned -- News International is obliged by its terms to disclose any new information and will be ''open to further action.'' Mr. Hughes also condemned the original police inquiry for failing to act on the information it had of hacking on an ''industrial scale.''The scandal exploded last year as the extent of phone hacking became known, centering on the now-defunct News of the World, a Sunday tabloid. Some of the tabloid's reporters were accused of hacking the voice-mail messages of well-known show business people, politicians and others.One of the first settlements was with the family of Milly Dowler, a British schoolgirl whose cellphone was hacked after she was abducted and murdered in 2002.The scandal cast a spotlight on British police officials who are accused of failing to investigate the hacking at the time.Scotland Yard formally acknowledged on Tuesday that it had acted unlawfully in 2006 and 2007 in failing to notify hundreds of individuals who had been targeted by The News of the World.Senior officers at Scotland Yard have previously rejected accusations that they tried to quash a wide-ranging inquiry into the hacking as part of a cozy relationship with News International.Scotland Yard lawyers said the failure to investigate more thoroughly resulted from the pressure the police were under to investigate terrorism threats.The settlements disclosed last month included those of the actor Jude Law, who received about $200,000; Sadie Frost, his ex-wife, who received $77,000; Ben Jackson, his assistant, who received $61,000; Gavin Henson, a Welsh rugby star, who also received $61,000; and Denis MacShane, a member of Parliament, who received $50,000.It was unclear how much the Murdoch businesses will end up having to pay after all the cases are settled.According to the police, there may be as many as 800 victims.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Murdoch Unit Accused of Hacking Rivals in Pay TV,"The News Corporation faced new accusations of hacking on Wednesday after media reports in Britain and Australia claimed that an affiliate of the media conglomerate had hacked into pay-television rivals to undermine their operations.The accusations of sabotage appeared in a report Wednesday in The Australian Financial Review and a documentary that was broadcast on BBC1 on Monday, and focused on the NDS Group, a television technology group in which News Corporation holds minority ownership.According to the reports, NDS hacked into satellite television companies to advance the interests of BSkyB in Britain and Foxtel in Australia. News Corporation has minority stakes in both BSkyB and Foxtel. NDS, which is based in Britain, makes smart cards that go inside set-top boxes to secure the digital delivery of television programming. The hacking reportedly took place in the late 1990s and early 2000s when counterfeit smart cards were common in the growing satellite TV industry.According to the reports, NDS undermined the competition by hiring hackers to crack the codes of smart cards associated with the satellite services of News Corporation's rivals. The hackers supposedly posted those codes online or sold them on the black market, allowing viewers to pirate the competitors' TV broadcasts without paying a subscription fee and costing them tens of millions of dollars.News Limited, the Australian arm of News Corporation, said the Australian Financial Review article was ''full of factual inaccuracies.''Late Wednesday evening, Chase Carey, News Corporation's president and chief operating officer, said in a statement that the claims made in the BBC1 program ''Panorama'' used ''manipulated and mischaracterized e-mails to produce unfair and baseless accusations.''He added, ''News Corporation is proud to have worked with NDS and to have supported them in their aggressive fight against piracy and copyright infringement.''Given the heightened pressure that News Corporation faces over phone hacking at its British tabloids, any new accusations of hacking-related wrongdoing could worsen the company's problems.Tom Watson, a member of Parliament who has championed investigations into News Corporation's British newspapers, said he would refer the accusations against NDS to Ofcom, the British regulatory body investigating whether News Corporation passes the country's ''fit and proper'' test to operate a broadcaster.Suzie Brady, a spokeswoman for Australia's communications minister, Stephen Conroy, said in an e-mail, ''These are serious allegations, and any allegations of criminal activity should be referred to the Australian federal police for investigation.''The accusations come days after Cisco Systems said it planned to buy the NDS Group for approximately $5 billion. The private equity firm Permira owns 51 percent and News Corporation owns 49 percent.''Recent media allegations date back over 10 years and predate Cisco's involvement with NDS,'' a Cisco spokesman, Jim Brady, said in a statement. He declined to comment further.News Corporation first invested in NDS in 1988 when the company was a small Israeli start-up operated by several former soldiers. In 1992, News Corporation paid $15 million for NDS to provide encryption services for its satellite-television business. Today, NDS's largest clients are BSkyB in Britain, of which News Corporation owns 39.1 percent, and DirecTV in the United States.In the past, NDS's main satellite TV competitors in Britain and the United States have leveled charges against the company. In a lawsuit filed in 2002 in Federal District Court in New York, Vivendi Universal's Canal Plus Group accused NDS of corporate espionage and conspiracy. DirecTV also sued DNS on grounds of fraud and misappropriation of trade secrets. Vivendi and DirecTV later withdrew the lawsuits.In January, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of NDS and awarded the company $19 million in damages after a protracted battle with the EchoStar Communications Group. In a 2003 lawsuit, EchoStar (now Dish) accused NDS of hacking into its satellite service.Those types of disputes were common in the satellite TV industry in its early days. ''They all accused each other of hacking into each other and spreading it on the Internet,'' said Bob Scherman, editor and publisher of Satellite Business News, an independent trade publication. ''They all hired satellite hackers and called them 'consultants.' ''''These allegations -- most of which are 10 or more years old -- were the subject of a long-running court case in the United States that concluded with NDS being totally vindicated of all allegations of piracy,'' the company said. "
Hacking Case Hits British TV For First Time,"LONDON -- Sky News, a British satellite news broadcaster whose parent company is controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, admitted Thursday that one of its reporters had hacked into e-mails on two occasions while pursuing news stories, the first time that Britain's hacking scandal has spilled into television news.The acknowledgment came just two days after Mr. Murdoch's son James resigned as chairman of Sky's parent company, British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB. Company officials said there was no link between the resignation and the hacking revelations, which were made public only as a result of a recent inquiry by the newspaper The Guardian.Sky said the hacking, while illegal, had been authorized by its executives for journalistic reasons -- in pursuit of a story that benefited the public interest -- and in one instance had helped a police investigation. And the company said that a continuing review of its e-mail records and accounts had so far turned up no evidence of impropriety in Sky's reporting practices. ''We stand by these actions as editorially justified and in the public interest,'' the head of Sky News, John Ryley, said in a statement. ''We do not take such decisions lightly or frequently.''The admission came after months of overlapping police, parliamentary and judicial inquiries into phone hacking, e-mail hacking and paying bribes to public officials at two Murdoch-owned tabloids, The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World. In general, broadcasters abide by higher standards of news gathering in Britain than newspapers do. Sky News operates separately from the Murdochs' newspaper business and has asserted its independence by aggressively reporting on News Corporation's troubles.Still, the disclosures of e-mail hacking come at an awkward time for BSkyB, which is 39.1 percent owned by News Corporation and which has suffered from its association with the Murdochs as the hacking scandal has unfolded.''This is nothing like the hacking at The News of the World,'' said Roy Greenslade, a journalism professor at City University London. ''But there's an embarrassment in that it's another News Corporation business, so people will be saying, 'That's just typical of Murdoch.' ''Last summer, stung by sustained criticism in Parliament and across Britain, News Corporation withdrew one of Mr. Murdoch's cherished goals: its $12 billion bid to take over the portion of BSkyB that he did not own already. On Tuesday, in announcing James Murdoch's resignation from BSkyB, the company said the continuing phone hacking investigation was making him a lightning rod for dissatisfaction and proving distracting to the company.A report from a House of Commons select committee investigating phone hacking is scheduled to be released within the next few weeks, and is expected to criticize the younger Mr. Murdoch for what some members believe was incomplete and misleading testimony during hearings last summer.''I believe that my resignation will help to ensure that there is no false conflation with events at a separate organization,'' Mr. Murdoch, 39, wrote in a letter to the BSkyB board, referring to News International, the British newspaper arm of his father's media empire. He resigned as chief executive of News International five weeks ago.Mr. Ryley of Sky said Thursday that one of the e-mail hacking cases occurred in 2008 and concerned John Darwin, a Briton who staged his death in a fake canoeing accident in 2002 but actually moved to Panama and, in collusion with his wife, collected $:500,000 in life insurance.Known in the tabloids as the ''canoe man,'' Mr. Darwin returned to Britain and lived in a secret apartment in his old house until 2007, when he turned himself in to a police station, claiming at first to have no idea what he had been doing for the last five years.The next year, a Sky News reporter pursuing the story sought permission to hack into e-mails he suspected had been used by the Darwins to communicate after Mr. Darwin's fake death, Mr. Ryley said in an online posting.''After careful consideration, Sky News granted permission because we believed the story was justified in the public interest,'' Mr. Ryley said. ''None of the material obtained was broadcast prior to the conviction and our coverage made clear that we had discovered and supplied e-mails to the police. There has been no attempt by Sky News to conceal these facts, which have been available on our Web site ever since.''In a statement, the police department in Cleveland, which handled the Darwin case, said that it had ''conducted an initial review into these matters and can confirm that inquiries are ongoing into how these e-mails were obtained.''A second case involved e-mails relating to a suspected pedophile, a spokeswoman for Sky News said. On both occasions, she said, the managing editor of Sky News, Simon Cole, authorized the hacking.The company likened the e-mail hacking to other instances in which journalists broke the law for the sake of journalism. In 2004, Sky News journalists bought an Uzi machine gun to highlight how easy it was to buy illegal weapons in Britain. The year before, a reporter penetrated airport security to show how porous it was.BSkyB has suffered various upheavals in the last year. As a result of the allegations surrounding the Murdochs' newspaper business in Britain, the broadcaster is being investigated by Ofcom, the British broadcast regulator, over whether it is ''fit and proper'' to hold a television license.Critics seized on Sky's disclosures as evidence of impropriety at the company.''The chair of BSkyB has to say something on this and reassure viewers that this has not been going on more widely,'' Tom Watson, a Labour Party member of Parliament and a persistent Murdoch critic, told the BBC. ''There are cases where the public is best served with journalists breaking the law, but it has to be done in extremis, and I am not sure whether it was in these two cases.''But Clare Enders, the head of Enders Analysis, a media research firm in London, said she thought that the biggest potential obstacle to BSkyB's retaining its broadcast license had been James Murdoch, and that his resignation had removed much of the problem.''We all spend our days shell-shocked because it's been one thing after another,'' Ms. Enders said in an interview, referring to the seemingly endless stream of disclosures about wrongdoing at News International. Still, compared with past revelations by other British media outlets, she said she did not consider Sky's practices ''that big a deal.''Rupert Murdoch, who is 81, has complained on Twitter recently that critics have been unfairly targeting News Corporation with false allegations.He was particularly incensed, it seems, by reports in the BBC, PBS and The Australian Financial Review charging that a section of his television operation hacked the encryption codes of its pay-television rivals in Britain and Australia, encouraging piracy to undermine their businesses in the late 1990s.''Seems every competitor and enemy piling on with lies and libels,'' he wrote on Twitter last week. ''So bad, easy to hit back hard, which preparing.'' "
Times of London Sued in Hacking Scandal,"LONDON -- As Britain's hacking scandal shows little sign of easing, a high-profile London lawyer who has been closely involved in pursuing cases involving Rupert Murdoch's British tabloids said on Friday that his firm was suing the upmarket Times of London over e-mail hacking for which the newspaper has apologized.The lawyer, Mark Lewis, said in an interview Friday that the ''claim has been issued,'' and that he would soon be filing a comprehensive statement of case against the London newspaper, also part of Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper group, News International. The suit, filed Tuesday, concerns a case in which a reporter who is no longer with the newspaper hacked into the e-mail account of Richard Horton, a police detective who ran an award-winning blog under the pseudonym NightJack. The claim, Mr. Lewis said, ''is not just on misuse of information or privacy grounds, but also a claim for what lawyers would call deceit,'' based on denials the newspaper made. A spokeswoman for News International confirmed the suit had been filed, but declined to comment further. The blogger's true identity was not publicly known until an article in The Times of London in 2009 identified him as Mr. Horton.At a hearing in February of the so-called Leveson inquiry into press ethics and practices, James Harding, the editor of The Times of London, apologized on behalf of the newspaper, saying ''I sorely regret the intrusion'' into the e-mail account.His acknowledgment reversed earlier denials by the newspaper.Britain's hacking scandal has focused largely on the illicit interception of voice mails, which are at the center of overlapping police, parliamentary and judicial inquiries mainly involving News International, the British newspaper subsidiary of the giant News Corporation.Investigators are also examining the payment of bribes to public officials at two Murdoch-owned tabloids, The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World.Hacking into people's e-mails is a potentially more serious crime than listening to their voice mail messages, and last summer the police opened Operation Tuleta, an investigation into computer hacking that is being held in tandem with one on phone hacking (Operation Weeting) and another on bribing the police (Operation Elveden).The scandal may be poised to go beyond Britain.On Thursday, Mr. Lewis, the lawyer, said that he planned for the first time to sue on behalf of alleged victims in the United States, the center of Mr. Murdoch's global media empire.In a telephone interview, he said that he would take legal action on behalf of three people -- a well-known sports person, a sports person not in the public eye and an American citizen, none of whom he would further identify.''The News of the World had thousands of people they hacked,'' Mr. Lewis said, when announcing the suits in an interview with the BBC, referring to the Sunday tabloid that Mr. Murdoch closed down last year as the hacking scandal engulfed it. ''Some of them were in America at the time, either traveling or resident there.''It was not immediately clear how or whether the action would affect the News Corporation. News International declined immediate comment on the cases.Mr. Lewis's clients in the hacking scandal include the family of Milly Dowler, an abducted teenager who was found murdered in an outer London suburb in 2002, and whose voice mail was said to have been hacked after she disappeared. Public outrage at the case helped propel the hacking scandal to new heights in July, leading to the closure of The News of the World.Reports last year said News International had offered a package of compensation worth some $4.8 million in that case, made up of $3.2 million to the Dowler family, with an additional payment of about $1.6 million to go to charity.News International has so far paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in other compensation settlements to dozens of hacking victims. But, the BBC said, more than 4,000 people have been identified by the police as possible victims of phone hacking.The scandal spread further earlier this month when a British satellite news broadcaster, Sky News, whose parent company is partly owned by News Corporation admitted that one of its reporters had hacked into e-mails on two occasions while pursuing news coverage, the first time that such accusations had spilled into television news.The acknowledgment came just two days after Mr. Murdoch's son James resigned as chairman of Sky's parent company, British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, of which News Corporation owns around 39 percent. Company officials said there was no link between the resignation and the hacking revelations, which were made public only as a result of an inquiry by the newspaper The Guardian. "
A Scandal Worthy of a Tabloid,"Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is the main target of a series of investigations into the operations of Britain's newspapers. Separate police inquiries cover, among other things, phone and e-mail hacking, bribery and obstruction of justice. Ofcom, the British broadcast regulator, is looking into the company's stake in a lucrative cable company. A judicial inquiry on media ethics heard testimony last week from Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, two former high-ranking employees, both closely connected to the British prime minister. Here is a guide to the major characters in the drama.ARRESTED TWICE REBEKAH BROOKSFormer News International chief executive and former editor of The News of the World and The Sun Ms. Brooks has twice been arrested and released during the investigation. She faces possible criminal charges of conspiracy in phone hacking, paying public officials, and obstructing justice.

Phone hacking accusations included the case of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old schoolgirl, who had been abducted and murdered.TOM CRONEFormer legal manager of The News of the WorldA parliamentary panel said this month that Mr. Crone had misled its inquiry. Mr. Crone and Colin Myler, former editor of The News of the World, testified that they told James Murdoch in June 2008 of the extent of the hacking, but Mr.Murdoch said he did not know how widespread it was until last year and acted then to assist the police investigation.COLIN MYLERWas editor of The News of the World in 2007, after the first arrests were made in the phone hacking scandal. He was still editor when the paper was closed in 2011.A report released this month concluded that Mr. Myler had misled a parliamentary panel. The panel held months of hearings into the phone hacking scandal about his knowledge of the illegal behavior in the company. Mr. Myler is now the editor of The Daily News of New York.LES HINTONExecutive chairman of News International when the scandal broke in 2006 and, later, publisher of The Wall Street JournalTestified to Parliament in 2009 that the hacking was limited to one rogue reporter. The parliamentary report released on May 1 concluded that Mr. Hinton misled lawmakers. He has been a close aide to Rupert Murdoch for more than 50 years.Mr. Hinton was Dow Jones chief executive until July, when he resigned, citing the scandal.News InternationalUmbrella company for the News Corporation's British newspapers, including The Times of London, The Sunday Times, The Sun and The News of the World.NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERSA subsidiary of News InternationalBCL BURTON COPELANDThe law firm BCL Burton Copeland compiled evidence in 2006 for the Metropolitan Police on behalf of News Group, related to investigations of the hacking of royal family phones.

E-mails released in April indicated that an aide to Mr. Hunt who strongly supported the bid was in frequent contact with NewsCorporation officials as the transaction was being examined by his office. He is expected to testify this month at the judicial inquiry and has said that he can prove his integrity.DAVID CAMERONPrime MinisterMr. Cameron has been under intense pressure because of his own close contacts with Rupert Murdoch and some of his top executives. He was in the spotlight again last week, when his friend Rebekah Brooks and his former communications chief, AndyCoulson, both facing possible criminal charges in a police investigation, testified at the judicial inquiry. Mr. Cameron has denied making any behind-the-scenes deals with the Murdoch empire.ARRESTEDANDY COULSONEditor of The News of the World from 2003 to 2007, when much of the hacking occurredMr. Coulson was hired by the Conservative Party in 2007 and became Mr. Cameron's media chief at 10 Downing Street in 2010. He resigned in January 2011 because of the scandal. Mr. Coulson is among nearly 50 people who have been arrested and released in the police investigation. He has not been charged. "
"After 7 Years, No End in Sight to Phone Hacking Scandal","LONDON -- The phone hacking scandal that shook Rupert Murdoch's global media empire and hit the heart of the British government began quietly on a Monday in 2005, when aides to the British royal family gathered in a palace office appointed with priceless antiques to air suspicions that their voice mail messages had been intercepted.Seven years and dozens of arrests later, the day after the latest criminal charges were brought, information from the police, prosecutors and investigators indicated Wednesday that the investigations are likely to go on for years, with no obvious end in sight. Rebekah Brooks, the former editor of Mr. Murdoch's Sun and News of the World tabloids, who rose to become chief executive of his British newspaper subsidiary, News International, and a close friend to Prime Minister David Cameron, was among the first to face criminal charges, the authorities announced Tuesday. Ms. Brooks, her husband and four former colleagues were accused of perverting the course of justice by removing materials pertinent to police investigations -- charges she called ''unjust.''Ms. Brooks, who will appear in court on June 13, will most likely not be the last to face prosecution, the police and prosecutors said. There are three current police operations, Scotland Yard confirmed: Operation Weeting, which is examining illegal voice mail interceptions, currently employs 95 officers and staff members and has made 22 arrests; Operation Tuleta, which is looking into computer hacking, employs eight and has made three arrests; and Operation Elveden, which is exploring illegal payments by journalists to public officials, employs 29 and has made 28 arrests.''It is difficult to give an end date,'' said a police spokesman, who declined to be identified in line with policy. ''We follow the evidence, and it's impossible to say where it will lead. It's safe to say it will last years.'' A police budget for all the investigations into journalism extends into 2015, and anticipates that the cost will reach $64 million in total.Criminal trials for central players in the scandal could air new information. Among those who could face charges is Andy Coulson, the former editor of The News of the World who later became Mr. Cameron's director of communications.If it is proved that those in Mr. Murdoch's employ conspired to pay public officials to further business interests, experts say he could be at risk of sanctions in the United States under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Even a small fine would threaten to take the scandal across the Atlantic, and increase political pressure on Mr. Murdoch's lucrative American interests.A far-reaching British public inquiry, led by a senior judge, Lord Justice Brian Leveson, is running in parallel to the criminal investigations. It has elicited explosive testimony from Mr. Murdoch, his son James and their former senior executives and will continue into July with appearances by leading past and present politicians, said John Toker, a spokesman for the inquiry.On the witness stand in the next two weeks will be Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt, who is accused of seeking to aid Mr. Murdoch's bid to take over a British satellite broadcaster, BSkyB, instead of adjudicating it impartially.It is unclear whether Mr. Cameron and his chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, will also give evidence on their relationships with the Murdoch family and company executives. Both officials have faced embarrassing allegations that dinners and parties with the Murdochs, including a gathering that Mr. Cameron attended on Mr. Murdoch's yacht, reveal an inappropriate coziness that may have influenced the BSkyB deal.The inquiry's report will be released in October, Mr. Toker said, and the second part of the inquiry, focusing on the hacking scandal, will begin after criminal proceedings have ended.Meanwhile, more than 100 civil lawsuits alleging illegal voice mail interceptions have been filed, according to court records. Many suits have been settled at an undisclosed cost, which could reach hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and legal fees. The police have said that there are likely more than 800 victims.The judge overseeing the cases, Geoffrey Vos, set a trial date of Feb. 18, 2013, for any cases that are not settled out of court.News International has also come under some pressure to waive legal privilege and allow the release of an internal dossier on hacking, compiled by the law firm BCL Burton Copeland in 2006, that might reveal whether senior executives knew of widespread illegality even as they said that hacking was limited to ''one rogue reporter,'' Clive Goodman, who was jailed in 2007. A News International spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter, and the law firm did not respond to messages.''We're now thinking in terms of years, not weeks or months,'' said a News International official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy. But the company may not be alone. Other allegations of phone hacking outside of Mr. Murdoch's empire -- including accusations that it took place at a large corporation -- are likely to emerge, one person familiar with the investigations said.

Former British Premier Rebuts Murdoch and Ex-Editor in Hacking Inquiry,"LONDON -- Starting four days of testimony by political leaders about the sway of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers over public life here, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Monday denied Mr. Murdoch's depiction of some of their most contentious exchanges and accused a leading Murdoch newspaper, The Sun, of undermining Britain's war effort in Afghanistan.He also rejected assertions by a former editor of The Sun that Mr. Brown's wife, Sarah, had approved a story in 2006 on the medical condition of the Browns' infant son, whose cystic fibrosis was diagnosed at 4 months.Mr. Brown said The Sun had caused ''huge damage to the war effort'' in Afghanistan, where British troops have been the main allies of American forces in the international coalition, by publishing articles suggesting that his government, in office from 2007 to 2010, ''didn't care about our troops.'' He referred specifically to an article in 2009 that disclosed that Mr. Brown had misspelled the name of a British soldier killed in Afghanistan and aspects of what he called a ''campaign'' by The Sun over Afghanistan.''The whole focus of their coverage was not what we had done,'' he said, ''but that I personally did not care about our troops.''Mr. Brown said Mr. Murdoch had told him in a private letter that he disagreed with Britain's ''management of the war effort.'' In response to Mr. Brown's allegations, a spokeswoman for Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, based in New York, said Mr. Murdoch ''stands by his testimony.''The former prime minister was the first in a series of past and present political heavyweights to appear this week before the judicial inquiry led by Lord Justice Brian Leveson into the phone hacking scandal that engulfed Mr. Murdoch's British tabloids last summer.As the inquiry has inched forward, so, too, has a parallel police investigation in which around 50 people have been arrested and released on bail in connection with phone intercepts; bribery of public officials, mainly the police; and e-mail hacking. Britain's Crown Prosecution Service said Monday that it had received files from the police relating to five unidentified journalists in the phone hacking investigation to assess whether they should face criminal charges. The prosecution service declined to provide further details.Mr. Brown's testimony, delivered in his hallmark Scottish burr, seemed among the most emphatic in contradicting sworn testimony by Mr. Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks, a former editor of The Sun who became chief executive of News International, the British newspaper subsidiary of News Corporation. She resigned as the hacking scandal escalated last July.Ms. Brooks has testified to the Leveson inquiry that Mr. Brown's wife, Sarah, gave permission for the article on their son to be published, but the former prime minister denied that.''I don't think any child's medical information should be broadcast,'' he said. ''There was no question ever of implicit or explicit permission.'' Rather, he said, he and his wife had been presented with a ''fait accompli'' that the story was to be published.In messages on Twitter, journalists at The Sun rejected Mr. Brown's version of events relating to the newspaper's Afghanistan coverage and to its source for the article about his son.In her own testimony to the inquiry in May, Ms. Brooks said the information for the article had come from the father of another child with cystic fibrosis.Scottish health authorities who dealt with the case said in a statement on Monday that although there had been ''no inappropriate access to the child's medical records,'' it was ''highly likely'' that a local employee ''spoke, without authorization, about the medical condition of Mr. Brown's son, Fraser.''In a statement, News International said it welcomed the Scottish authorities' statement that ''said that they believe there was 'no inappropriate access' to the medical records of Gordon Brown's son.'' The Sun stood by its previous rejection of Mr. Brown's complaints, the statement said.Robert Jay, the inquiry's lead counsel, pressed Mr. Brown about a conversation that Mr. Murdoch testified had taken place between them in which the former prime minister had threatened to ''make war'' on Mr. Murdoch's company after its tabloids had switched their support to the Conservatives in late 2009.In April, Mr. Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that Mr. Brown had said, ''Well, your company has declared war on my government, and we have no alternative but to make war on your company.'' Mr. Murdoch also said that Mr. Brown did not seem to be in ''a very balanced state of mind.''''This conversation never took place,'' Mr. Brown said. ''I'm shocked, surprised, that it should be suggested.'' He also said, ''I couldn't be unbalanced on a call that I didn't have.''Mr. Brown said that although he respected Mr. Murdoch's business acumen, he rejected suggestions that the tycoon had influenced his thinking. ''The idea that I followed his views is absolute nonsense,'' Mr. Brown said.The concentration of high-ranking figures at the inquiry this week has provoked speculation that the testimony could be among the most significant so far in the investigation, which began last year. George Osborne -- the chancellor of the Exchequer and a close ally of David Cameron, the current prime minister -- appeared at the inquiry after Mr. Brown.Much questioning centered on Mr. Osborne's role in the Conservatives' decision to hire Andy Coulson, a former editor of The News of the World, a Murdoch-owned Sunday tabloid that is now defunct, as director of communications.The Conservatives hired Mr. Coulson after he was forced to resign as editor of The News of the World in 2007. At the time, the full extent of the hacking scandal was not widely known. His association with The News of the World later cost him his job as Mr. Cameron's director of communications after the Conservative victory in the 2010 election. Like Ms. Brooks, Mr. Coulson has been charged in recent weeks with criminal offenses. They have both denied any wrongdoing.''It was an issue that he had resigned at The News of the World,'' Mr. Osborne said, acknowledging that he had been aware of the hacking controversy. But he said Mr. Coulson had assured him that the issue was resolved.Mr. Murdoch's tabloids supported the Conservatives for many years, but switched to Labour before the 1997 election that brought Tony Blair to power. Mr. Blair testified before the inquiry in late May.Shortly before the 2010 election, which produced a coalition led by Mr. Cameron and Nick Clegg, a Liberal Democrat, as junior partner, the Murdoch tabloids switched back to the Conservatives.Mr. Osborne said the Conservatives had sought the endorsement of The Sun as ''one of a range of things.'' But, he added, ''I certainly think you can win an election without the endorsement of The Sun.''Mr. Osborne rejected any suggestion that he the government, or the Conservative Party had supported News Corporation's $12 billion bid to take over the 60.9 percent of British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, the British satellite broadcaster, that it did not already own. The company withdrew the bid last summer at the height of the phone hacking furor.Far from wanting to help News Corporation secure approval for the takeover, Mr. Osborne said, he regarded the bid as ''politically inconvenient'' in that however it was resolved, someone would be angry.The four days of hearings will culminate on Thursday with a daylong appearance by Mr. Cameron.

News Corp. Steps Up Defense in TV-Code-Hacking Accusations,"News Corporation fired back late Wednesday night against accusations that NDS Group, a technology firm that it has a minority stake in, had hacked into satellite-TV rivals in the Britain and Australia.Chase Carey, president and chief operating officer, said accusations made in the BBC program ""Panorama"" were a ""gross misrepresentation of NDS's role as a high quality and leading provider of technology and services to the pay-TV industry.""Mr. Carey, who runs the day-to-day operations of most of the company's $50 billion worth of businesses, has largely remained quiet as a phone-hacking scandal has engulfed News Corporation's British tabloids.But on Wednesday, he strongly denied accusations that NDS, of which News Corporation owns 49 percent, paid hackers to crack the codes of smart cards of pay-TV companies that competed with News Corporation-backed businesses. Posting black-market codes online would have allowed customers to access TV broadcasts without out paying a subscription fee, potentially costing the rival companies millions of dollars.He said other accounts about the alleged hacking have ""piled on - if not exaggerated - the BBC's inaccurate claims.""Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, echoed that sentiment in his Twitter feed. ""Seems every competitor and enemy piling on with lies and libels,"" he wrote. ""So bad, easy to hit back hard, which preparing.""Although the alleged hacking by NDS would have occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s, any further incidents of hacking-related accusations could exacerbate News Corporation's problems in Britain.The fallout from the phone hacking scandal has led to an investigation into whether News Corporation is ""fit and proper"" to operate a broadcaster. News Corporation owns 39.1 percent of the British satellite-TV broadcaster BSkyB. James Murdoch, deputy chief operating officer of News Corporation, serves as BSkyB's chairman.In addition to its own response, Mr. Carey said the company supported a letter sent to ""Panorama"" from Abe Peled, executive chairman of NDS.In the letter, Mr. Peled contended that the BBC used ""manipulated and mischaracterized e-mails"" and had ""taken e-mails wholly out of context"" in order to ""paint a picture for your viewers that is incorrect, misleading and deeply damaging to my company and our sister company News Corporation.""The BBC said Thursday that it stood by its ""Panorama"" program. ""The e-mails shown in the program were not manipulated, as NDS claims, and nothing in the correspondence undermines the evidence presented in the program,"" a BBC spokeswoman said in a statement. "
Lawyer for Phone-Hacking Victims Is Coming to America,"The lawyer at the center of the legal battle against News Corporation over phone hacking at the company's British newspapers will arrive in New York on Monday and spend the week here.The lawyer, Mark Lewis, has told the BBC that he plans to take legal action on behalf of three clients who assert that while they were on United States soil their phones were hacked by The News of the World, the tabloid that has since been closed. Mr. Lewis's clients in Britain include the family of Milly Dowler, the murdered teenager whose cellphone is said to have been hacked by The News of the World.Mr. Lewis will work with Norman Siegel, a prominent civil liberties lawyer in New York. Mr. Lewis has not revealed the identity of his clients, but he told the BBC and other outlets that the plaintiffs include a well-known athlete and a United States citizen.Although the lawsuits have not yet been filed, Mr. Lewis's trip to New York brings the phone-hacking crisis in Britain precariously close to the epicenter of Rupert Murdoch's $50 billion media empire's headquarters. The company has largely shielded its more lucrative, United States-based business assets from the scandal that has engulfed its British newspaper unit, News International.Before arriving in New York, this Saturday, Mr. Lewis will visit California where he will participate in a panel at the journalism school of the University of California at Berkley, ""The Murdoch Effect: The News at Any Price?""Mr. Lewis has long pledged to take his legal battle against News Corporation to the United States. ""This is getting wider,"" Mr. Lewis told The Daily Beast on Wednesday.In 2008, Mr. Lewis settled one of the first hacking-related lawsuits against The News of the World. News International paid more than $1 million to a client of Mr. Lewis's, Gordon Taylor, a British soccer union executive, who said reporters had hacked into his voice mail. The size of the settlement - much larger than previous plaintiffs had received in similar cases - prompted questions about whether the hacking was more widespread.The Dowlers received a $4.7 million payment from News Corporation related to the allegations of phone hacking.News Corporation has declined to comment on Mr. Lewis's trip to New York. "
James Murdoch Is One of the Crowd at Fox's Upfront Party,"Spotted at the Fox upfront party Monday night: the recent television star (on British screens), James Murdoch.Mr. Murdoch, who has separated himself from the British assets of his family's media empire, News Corporation, in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, was enjoying the festivities after the Fox network's presentation of its fall TV schedule to advertisers. Asked whether he had had the chance to view the pilots for the new season, Mr. Murdoch said he had, adding, ""but I only watch them to see what they're like - I don't have any input.""He did say he thought Fox looked as if it had some promising new entries. He was scheduled to have dinner later in the evening with Fox television executives who were meeting with executives at advertising agencies and stars from Fox shows, including Simon Cowell and cast members from ""Glee.""Since returning to New York and relinquishing his board position at BSkyB, the British satellite-TV company, Mr. Murdoch has been heavily involved in the company's strategic television business, though mostly focusing on international assets like Sky Italia, Sky Deutschland and emerging channels in India and elsewhere. As for his recent highly rated appearances on British TV (where he was giving testimony to a government inquiry into the phone-hacking scandal and press ethics more generally) Mr. Murdoch demurred with a gracious smile. ""I'm here now,"" he said. "
Mutually Assured Cyberdestruction?,"The chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times. This article is adapted from his new book, ''Confront and Conceal: Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power.''WashingtonIT took years after the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima for the nation to develop a common national understanding of when and how to use a weapon of such magnitude. Not until after the Cuban Missile Crisis, 50 years ago this October, did a consensus emerge that the weapon was too terrible ever to employ again, save as a deterrent and a weapon of last resort.Over the past decade, on a far smaller scale, the country's military and intelligence leadership have gone through a parallel debate about how to use the Predator drone. Because it is precisely targeted, often on an individual, it is used almost every week.And now we know that President Obama, for the past three years, has been going through a similar process about how America should use another innovative weapon -- one whose destructive powers are only beginning to be understood. In a secret program called ''Olympic Games,'' which dates from the last years of the George W. Bush administration, the United States has mounted repeated attacks with the most sophisticated cyberweapons ever developed. Like drones, these weapons cross national boundaries at will; in the case of Olympic Games they invaded the computer controllers that run Iran's nuclear centrifuges, spinning them wildly out of control. How effective they have been is open to debate; the United States and its close partner in the attacks, Israel, used the weapons as an alternative to a potentially far more deadly, but perhaps less effective, bombing attack from the air. But precisely because the United States refuses to talk about its new cyberarsenal, there has never been a real debate in the United States about when and how to use cyberweapons.President Obama raised many of the issues in the closed sanctum of the Situation Room, participants in the conversation say, pressing aides to make sure that the attacks were narrowly focused so that they did not take out Iranian hospitals or power plants and were directed only at the country's nuclear infrastructure. ''He was enormously focused on avoiding collateral damage,'' one official said, comparing the arguments over using cyberwar to the debates about when to use drones.Does the United States want to legitimize the use of cyberweapons as a covert tool? Or is it something we want to hold in reserve for extreme cases? Will we reach the point -- as we did with chemical weapons, and the rest of the world did with land mines -- that we want treaties to ban their use? Or is that exactly the wrong analogy, in a world in which young hackers, maybe working on their own or maybe hired by the Chinese People's Liberation Army or the Russian mob, can launch attacks themselves?These are all fascinating questions that the Obama administration resolutely refuses to discuss in public. ''They approached the Iran issue very, very pragmatically,'' one official involved in the discussions over Olympic Games told me. No one, he said, ''wanted to engage, at least not yet, in the much deeper, broader debate about the criteria for when we use these kinds of weapons and what message it sends to the rest of the world.''Cyberweapons, of course, have neither the precision of a drone nor the immediate, horrifying destructive power of the Bomb. Most of the time, cyberwar seems cool and bloodless, computers attacking computers. Often that is the case.The Chinese are believed to attack America's computer systems daily, but mostly to scoop up corporate and Pentagon secrets. (Mr. Obama, one aide said, got a quick lesson in the scope of the problem when an attack on his 2008 campaign's computers was traced back to China, a foretaste of what happened to Google the following year.) The United States often does the same: the Iranians reported last week that they had been hit by another cyberattack, called ''Flame,'' that appeared to harvest data from selected laptop computers, presumably those of Iranian leaders and scientists. Its origins are unclear.But the cutting edge of cyberwar is in the invasion of computer systems to manipulate the machinery that keeps the country going -- exactly what the United States was doing to those Iranian centrifuges as it ran Olympic Games. ''Somebody has crossed the Rubicon,'' Gen. Michael V. Hayden, the former director of the C.I.A., said in describing the success of the cyberattacks on Iran. General Hayden was careful not to say what role the United States played, but he added: ''We've got a legion on the other side of the river now. I don't want to pretend it's the same effect, but in one sense at least, it's August 1945,'' the month that the world first saw the capabilities of a new weapon, dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.That was deliberate overstatement, of course: the United States crashed a few hundred centrifuges at Natanz, it did not vaporize the place. But his point that we are entering a new era in cyberattacks is one the administration itself is trying to make as it ramps up American defenses. Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta -- a key player in the Iran attacks -- warned last year that the ''next Pearl Harbor we confront could very well be a cyberattack that cripples our power systems, our grid, our security systems, our financial systems.''IN March the White House invited all the members of the Senate to a classified simulation on Capitol Hill demonstrating what might happen if a dedicated hacker -- or an enemy state -- decided to turn off the lights in New York City. In the simulation, a worker for the power company clicked on what he thought was an e-mail from a friend; that ''spear phishing'' attack started a cascade of calamities in which the cyberinvader made his way into the computer systems that run New York's electric grid. The city was plunged into darkness; no one could find the problem, much less fix it. Chaos, and deaths, followed.The administration ran the demonstration -- which was far more watered-down than the Pentagon's own cyberwar games -- to press Congress to pass a bill that would allow a degree of federal control over protecting the computer networks that run America's most vulnerable infrastructure. The real lesson of the simulation was never discussed: cyberoffense has outpaced the search for a deterrent, something roughly equivalent to the cold-war-era concept of mutually assured destruction. There was something simple to that concept: If you take out New York, I take out Moscow.But there is nothing so simple about cyberattacks. Usually it is unclear where they come from. That makes deterrence extraordinarily difficult. Moreover, a good deterrence ''has to be credible,'' said Joseph S. Nye, the Harvard strategist who has written the deepest analysis yet of what lessons from the atomic age apply to cyberwar. ''If an attack from China gets inside the American government's computer systems, we're not likely to turn off the lights in Beijing.'' Professor Nye calls for creating ''a high cost'' for an attacker, perhaps by naming and shaming.Deterrence may also depend on how America chooses to use its cyberweapons in the future. Will it be more like the Predator, a tool the president has embraced? That would send a clear warning that the United States was ready and willing to act. But as President Obama warned his own aides during the secret debates over Olympic Games, it also invites retaliatory strikes, with cyberweapons that are already proliferating. In fact, one country recently announced that it was creating a new elite ''Cybercorps'' as part of its military. The announcement came from Tehran. "
National Secrets and National Security,"ON May 29, a New York Times article depicted President Obama as deciding case by case on secret drone-strike assassinations, personally poring over photos of prospective targets.Just three days later, a second article pulled the veil on the secret American cyberweapons program, providing a close narrative of how the president personally greenlighted the expansion of efforts to use computer code to destroy Iranian nuclear enrichment machines.The articles spawned an angry response in Congress, with some denouncing election-season leaks that they said could harm national security and others, including Senator John Kerry, complaining about The Times's decision to publish the secrets. The national security complaints centered on the cyberwarfare article. Written by David E. Sanger, The Times's chief Washington correspondent, the article recounted the origins of an effort, begun under President George W. Bush, to halt the Iranian nuclear program.The article spelled out how American programmers wrote a computer code that penetrated Iranian computers and traced a blueprint of Iran's Natanz enrichment center. It told how the United States next worked with Israel to create a virus designed to sabotage the centrifuges used for fuel enrichment.The narrative told how, because of a programming error, the virus broke out onto the Internet, where its existence became known though its purpose remained obscure.The president, faced with a decision whether to continue, ordered the cyberattacks to go on and, as Mr. Sanger reported, ''Within a week, another version of the bug brought down just under 1,000 centrifuges.'' Finally, in its concluding paragraphs, the article said the cyberattacks were not limited to Iran.All these details exposed a shadowy American weapon to public view and debate. Senator Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview that he worried that publication of such detailed information created perils outweighing Americans' need for the specifics. ''It tips people off to methods and locations and concepts and capacities,'' he said.He added: ''I am not an editor, and I am not going to venture there. I have too much respect for David Sanger. I would have probably been very hard put. I just think that you have to weigh -- that is the job of an editor, of a publisher -- to weigh the impact of what you print, of how you do it and when you do it.''Times editors said they did weigh these considerations and followed what has become a familiar protocol, contacting government officials to determine whether there were objections on national security grounds.In this case, the officials did not object to the articles as a whole, but certain technical details were edited out of the cyberattack article at their request, said Jill Abramson, the executive editor.Explaining the rationale The Times used to decide whether to publish the cyberwarfare and drone-strike articles, she said, ''I think the test is: These are modes of a kind of warfare being waged in the name of the American public, and the public benefits from knowing the dimensions and some of the details of those programs, although I would hardly argue they have to have all the details.''For guidance in such decisions, Ms. Abramson said she refers to two documents produced by Times editors, both related to the Pentagon Papers case.One is an Op-Ed column written in 1972 by A. M. Rosenthal, then the managing editor, who asserted one year after the case that publication of the Pentagon Papers had served the public well and had led to no national security setbacks.The other is an affidavit by Max Frankel, then the Washington bureau chief, submitted in court in support of publishing the secret documents. It is a canny discussion of how democracy is well-served by the ecosystem of reporters and government officials trafficking in secrets while taking care to protect the nation's core security interests.Ms. Abramson added, ''No story about details of government secrets has come near to demonstrably hurting the national security in decades and decades.''But that has not stopped responsible people from worrying that it will happen. Representative Peter King, a Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, told me he saw ''no purpose'' in publishing so many details about the cyberattacks. More broadly, though, he was clearly exasperated by the prodigious leaking of sensitive government information that enabled The Times to produce insider accounts of the drone program and cyberweapons. In his view, the leakers were motivated to show President Obama as ''a powerful leader,'' adding, ''It seems to me that the reporters' end of the deal was to go along with that.''The Times dismissed the notion that it was manipulated by its sources, or that the stories were dropped in the newspaper's lap. Mr. Sanger said he began work 18 months ago, after the computer virus broke out onto the Internet and became known as Stuxnet. ''I built this story from the bottom up,'' he said. ''I did this on multiple continents. It would be foolish to think all my sources are American.''The article, adapted from Mr. Sanger's book ''Confront and Conceal: Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power,'' was published just days ahead of the book's release date, which was set a year earlier, he said.The article on drone strikes, meanwhile, grew out of an election coverage assignment, months in the making, that set out to explain President Obama's national security policies that had ''surprised the country and surprised us journalists by hewing to policies that were similar to Bush's in some cases,'' Ms. Abramson said.As I view all this, I conclude that Max Frankel's Washington ecosystem produces rough truth, perhaps the best that can be achieved at a time when the nation's most essential policies and programs are cloaked in secrecy and reporters have to scrounge in the dark for information.The two articles tell the public what its government is up to. Did the coverage gild the president-as-decider? Probably. The drones article cited his intellectual devotion to St. Augustine and the priestly qualities of his counterterrorism adviser: that seemed a bit much. Did the cyberweapons article deliver more detail than was necessary about the virus? Possibly. It is plausible to think it gave the Iranians something they didn't know; Senator Kerry certainly thought so.But this kind of journalism isn't surgery. It is rougher than that, a first draft without all the details filled in and produced with limited knowledge of the other side in ongoing conflicts. In the end, it's essential journalism in a self-governing society.E-mail: public@nytimes.com "
Cyberwarfare Emerges From Shadows for Public Discussion by U.S. Officials,"WASHINGTON -- For years, even as the United States carried out sophisticated cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear program and the Pentagon created a Cyber Command, officials have been hesitant to discuss American offensive cyberwarfare programs openly. Since June, in fact, F.B.I. agents have been investigating leaks to The New York Times about the computer attacks on Tehran.But the reticence is giving way. The chorus of official voices speaking publicly about American cyberattack strategy and capabilities is steadily growing, and some experts say greater openness will allow the United States to stake out legal and ethical rules in the uncharted territory of computer combat. Others fear that talking too boldly about American plans could fuel a global computer arms race.Next month the Pentagon's research arm will host contractors who want to propose ''revolutionary technologies for understanding, planning and managing cyberwarfare.'' It is an ambitious program that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, calls Plan X, and the public description talks about ''understanding the cyber battlespace,'' quantifying ''battle damage'' and working in Darpa's ''cyberwar laboratory.'' James A. Lewis, who studies cybersecurity at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, says he sees the Plan X public announcement as ''a turning point'' in a long debate over secrecy about cyberwarfare. He said it was timely, given that public documents suggest that at least 12 of the world's 15 largest militaries are building cyberwarfare programs.''I see Plan X as operationalizing and routinizing cyberattack capabilities,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''If we talk openly about offensive nuclear capabilities and every other kind, why not cyber?''Yet like drone aircraft, which similarly can be used for both spying and combat, American cyberattack tools now are passing through a zone of semisecrecy, no longer denied but not fully discussed. President Obama has spoken publicly twice about drones; he has yet to speak publicly on American cyberattacks.Last week, at a public Cyber Command legal conference, the State Department's top lawyer, Harold H. Koh -- who gave the Obama administration's first public speech on targeted killing of terrorists in 2010 -- stated the administration's position that the law of war, including such principles as minimizing harm to civilians, applies to cyberattacks.In August, the Air Force raised eyebrows with a bluntly worded solicitation for papers advising it on ''cyberspace warfare attack capabilities,'' including weapons ''to destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, corrupt or usurp'' an enemy's computer networks and other high-tech targets.And a few weeks earlier, a top Marine commander recounted at a public conference how he had used ''cyber operations against my adversary'' in Afghanistan in 2010. ''I was able to get inside his nets, infect his command-and-control, and in fact defend myself against his almost constant incursions to get inside my wire,'' said Lt. Gen. Richard P. Mills, now deputy commandant of the Marine Corps.Cyberwarfare was discussed quite openly in the 1990s, though technological capabilities and targets were far more limited than they are today, said Jason Healey, who heads the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council in Washington.''Our current silence dates back 8 or 10 years, and N.S.A. is a big reason,'' said Mr. Healey, who is working on a history of cyberwarfare.The National Security Agency, which plays a central role in Cyber Command, traditionally breaks foreign codes and eavesdrops on foreign communications; it is among the most secretive agencies in government. Years ago it pioneered the field of cyberespionage: breaking into foreign computer systems in order to collect intelligence. The same skills and reflexive secrecy of spies carried over to cyberwarfare, Mr. Healey said. American officials have long preferred to talk cyberdefense, leaving the attack side in the shadows.The increased candor recently about cyberoffense results not from a policy change, officials say, but from an inevitable acceptance of attacks on computer networks as a standard part of military and intelligence capabilities. The fact that dozens of Beltway contractors see cyberwarfare as one of the few parts of the defense budget that are likely to grow is also a factor.When Darpa announced a ''proposers' day workshop'' for its Plan X program, the ''overwhelming response from industry and academia'' led the defense research agency to expand the event to an extra day, the agency said in a statement. (A Darpa spokesman declined to comment further on Plan X.)Just as drone-fired missiles have never been a secret to those on the ground, so cyberattacks have consequences that cannot be hidden, even if their origin may be initially uncertain. The computer worm called Stuxnet, devised by the United States and Israel to destroy Iran's nuclear centrifuges, was quickly detected by computer security experts when it infected networks around the world in 2010 -- but remains highly classified.Hence the Cyber Command legal conference, which avoided specific cases while dwelling on principles. Mr. Koh, of the State Department, told the conference that the United States carries out ''at least two stages of legal review'' on cyberwarfare operations -- considering whether the law of war prohibits the use of ''new weapons'' altogether and, if not, how the law governs their use in ''each particular operation.''Matthew Waxman, a law professor at Columbia and former Defense Department official, said speaking openly about cyberwarfare policy was important because it allowed the United States to make clear its intentions on a novel and fast-emerging form of conflict.Because both the Bush and Obama administrations were slow to speak publicly about their use of armed drones, Mr. Waxman said, ''they ceded a lot of ground to critics to shape the narrative and portray U.S. practices as lawless.'' As a result, he said, ''the U.S. is trying to play catch-up, giving speech after speech, saying 'We abide by the law.' ''Now, Mr. Waxman said, because the United States ''occupies a position of advantage on offensive cyber capabilities, it should seize the opportunity to lay out a set of rules for itself and others.''That is a worthy goal, said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. But he said that came with a hazard: more talk about the United States' cyberwarfare capabilities might prompt other countries to step up their own programs at a time when the world is ''on the cusp of a cyber arms race,'' he said.Mr. Kimball said Darpa's sweeping public statement about the goals of its Plan X for cyberwarfare might be a case in point.''It makes it sound like the U.S. is preparing to be able to wage a full-out cyberwar,'' Mr. Kimball said. ''Those kinds of statements could come back to haunt the U.S. down the road.'' "
Iranian Scientist Claims U.S. Cyberattack Was ... Loud,"The United States has a rather bizarre history of blasting rock music into the ears of presumed enemies, so it seemed plausible when a prominent security expert reported Monday that a new cyberattack on Iran's atomic program included workstations erupting in booms of ""Thunderstruck"" by AC/DC, an Australian rock band.    In a blog post, Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer of F-Secure, a computer security company based in Finland, cited ""a series of e-mails"" he had received from ""a scientist working at the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran."" He admitted he was unable to confirm any details of the alleged attack but said the sender was using the correct e-mail address, aeoi.org.ir.Mr. Hypponen quoted the scientist as saying the music hit ""in the middle of the night with the volume maxed out.""His report created a sensation as blogs and news reports around the globe repeated the claim. ForeignPolicy.com went further, noting on its blog that the United States had repeatedly blasted loud music at supposed foes.For instance, it noted that American troops in 1989 had tried to force the Panamanian president, Manuel Noriega, from his refuge in the Vatican embassy by bombarding it with loud music. The blog told of military DJs taking requests and creating a playlist that included AC/DC's ""You Shook Me All Night Long.""More recently, Foreign Policy said, the United States Psychological Operations Company ""admitted to the use of heavy metal in Iraq as a mechanism to break uncooperative prisoners' resistance."" And the International Committee of the Red Cross, it noted, had reported the use of similar tactics against Guantánamo inmates.Alas, the Iranian episode seems too good to be true.Specialists in cyberwarfare said the e-mails could have easily been faked, including the seeming return address from the Iranian atomic program. Simple logic, one expert noted, suggested that an Iranian scientist writing such a report to a foreigner might quickly join the ranks of the martyrs. Finally, the tone of the alleged e-mails from the Iranian scientist seemed suspicious in their self-congratulatory tone about the success of the computer attack and its heavy-metal explosion.""I doubt it,""  a senior administration official who closely follows the Iranian program said of the cyber claim.

Apple Denies Giving F.B.I. Device Information,"Apple on Wednesday denied claims that it had worked with the government to share millions of device identification numbers, a day after the hacking group known as AntiSec claimed to have obtained numbers from an F.B.I. laptop.In a statement, Apple said it had not worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation or any other agency to release the numbers, called unique device identifiers or U.D.I.D. numbers.""The F.B.I. has not requested this information from Apple, nor have we provided it to the F.B.I. or any organization,"" said Natalie Kerris, an Apple spokeswoman. ""Additionally, with iOS 6, we introduced a new set of A.P.I.'s meant to replace the use of the U.D.I.D. and will soon be banning the use of U.D.I.D.""Apple's unique device identifiers are 40-character strings of letters and numbers assigned to Apple devices that act as fingerprints for the company's mobile devices.On Tuesday, the F.B.I. denied that the identification numbers had been taken from the agency. It noted in a statement that there was ""no evidence indicating that an F.B.I. laptop was compromised or that the F.B.I. either sought or obtained this data.""Antisec - a subset of the loose hacking collective Anonymous -  claimed to have obtained 12 million numbers for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices, and some phone numbers and other personal data on the owners of the devices.

Annual Intelligence Report Lists Iran and Cyberattacks as Leading Concerns,"WASHINGTON -- Some senior Iranian leaders are now more willing to carry out attacks inside the United States in response to perceived American threats against their country, the Obama administration's top intelligence official said on Tuesday, pointing to last fall's suspected assassination plot against the Saudi ambassador to Washington.The comments by the official, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, in prepared testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, came as tensions between the United States and its allies with Iran over its nuclear program have escalated, with the United States trying to build support for increased sanctions against Iran.Other intelligence officials indicated that while there was no evidence of other Iranian plots in the United States, Mr. Clapper's remarks were intended to put both the Iranians and the American intelligence community on notice that high priority would be given to ferreting out information about possible plans to stage attacks in this country. Mr. Clapper said that the suspected assassination plot ''shows that some Iranian officials -- probably including supreme leader Ali Khamenei -- have changed their calculus and are now more willing to conduct an attack in the United States in response to real or perceived U.S. actions that threaten the regime.''He said the United States was also concerned about plotting by Iran against American or allied interests overseas, adding that ''Iran's willingness to sponsor future attacks in the United States or against our interests abroad probably will be shaped by Tehran's evaluation of the costs it bears for the plot against the ambassador as well as Iranian leaders' perceptions of U.S. threats against the regime.''The written statement did not provide any details on what types of attacks Mr. Clapper thought were possible, and senators did not ask him about it during the panel's annual session to review global threats to the United States.The session was the first such hearing since the death of Osama bin Laden last May, and Mr. Clapper used the opportunity to say that sustained pressure from the United States and its allies will probably reduce Al Qaeda's remaining leadership in Pakistan to ''largely symbolic importance'' over the next two to three years as the terrorist organization fragments into more regionally focused groups and homegrown extremists.Flanked by senior intelligence officials from throughout the government, Mr. Clapper also noted the rising volatility in the Middle East and North Africa after the popular uprisings of the Arab Spring, increasing threats of cyberattacks against government and private business computer systems, continued tensions with North Korea over its nuclear program and rising drug-fueled violence in Mexico and Central America that threatens to spill over the border.As American diplomats step up their efforts to broker a peace deal with the Taliban and other militants to end the war in Afghanistan, Mr. Clapper also defended the administration's discussions of preliminary trust-building measures, including a possible transfer of five Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.Senator Saxby Chambliss, a Georgia Republican who is the committee's vice chairman, signaled Congressional opposition to the plan, which administration officials have said would not release the prisoners outright but transfer them to authorities in Qatar, where the Taliban are setting up an office to hold political talks. ''We should not transfer these detainees from Guantanamo,'' Mr. Chambliss said, citing American intelligence assessments warning of the risks the prisoners posed.Mr. Clapper acknowledged that the Taliban remained ''a resilient, determined adversary'' and underscored that any deal involving prisoners would hinge on ''where these detainees might go and the conditions in which they would be controlled or surveilled.''As Taliban leaders debate whether to fight or cut a deal, the death of Bin Laden has severely weakened a Qaeda leadership that was already reeling from the death or capture of several other top leaders. The losses have forced the organization to rely more heavily on affiliates in such places as North Africa, Iraq and Yemen, as well as individual ''lone wolf'' extremists in the United States.Intelligence officials say that continued pressure by the United States and its allies -- including drone strikes, efforts to dry up terrorists' financing and campaigns to counter extremist recruiting propaganda -- are likely to fragment this already decentralized movement.''As long as we sustain the pressure on it, we judge that core Al Qaeda will be of largely symbolic importance to the global jihadist movement,'' Mr. Clapper said in his opening statement.Of all the affiliates that have sprouted up over the past decade, intelligence analysts say that the Qaeda arm in Yemen, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, poses the greatest immediate threat to the United States. Mr. Clapper said that the death last September of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric who was a top propagandist and operational planner for the Yemen affiliate, ''probably reduces, at least temporarily, A.Q.A.P.'s ability to plan transnational attacks.''Over all, Al Qaeda has struggled to keep pace with events unfolding as result of the Arab Spring, Mr. Clapper said, warning, however, that ''prolonged instability or unmet promises of reform would give Al Qaeda, its affiliates and its allies more time to establish networks, gain support and potentially engage in operations, probably with less scrutiny from local security services.''The domestic instability in Syria could potentially escalate into regional crises, and American intelligence officials were wary on Tuesday of being pinned down on how long the government of President Bashar al-Assad could survive and what would replace it if it fell.''It's a question of time before Assad falls, but that's the issue; it could be a long time,'' Mr. Clapper told senators. ''The opposition continues to be fragmented.''David H. Petraeus, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said the opposition had shown increasing resilience in the face of stepped-up attacks by Syrian military forces in suburbs of Aleppo and Damascus. ''It has shown, indeed, how substantial the opposition to the regime is and how it is, in fact, growing and how increasing areas are becoming beyond the reach of the regime's security forces,'' he said.Hopscotching around the world in his remarks, Mr. Clapper singled out Iran for special attention in both his opening comments and a more detailed written statement.He reiterated the American intelligence assessment that ''Iran is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons, in part by developing various nuclear capabilities that better position it to produce such weapons, should it choose to do so.''He added, ''We do not know, however, if Iran will eventually decide to build nuclear weapons.'' The United States also faces evolving cyberthreats from nations like Russia and China, as well as nonstate entities. Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said his agency was beginning to reorganize to combat this. ''Down the road, the cyberthreat, which cuts across all programs, will be the number one threat to the country,'' he said.Nearly a dozen senior administration officials, including the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, are scheduled to brief senators on Wednesday about the latest cyberthreats and American responses.

Measuring a Giant's Stature: Zuckerberg's 'Social Mission' View Vs. Financial Ambitions of Wall St.,"SAN FRANCISCO -- It's not about the money. Really.That's what the billionaire Mark Zuckerberg says.As investors scramble to get a piece of Facebook ahead of its initial offering, Mr. Zuckerberg wants to paint a portrait of a company with goals far loftier than the moneymakers on Wall Street -- and certainly loftier than most mere businesses.''Facebook was not originally created to be a company,'' he wrote in a letter to potential investors that was part of Facebook's filing on Wednesday. ''It was built to accomplish a social mission -- to make the world more open and connected.'' Mr. Zuckerberg goes on to compare his invention to the printing press and television. ''Facebook aspires to build the services that give people the power to share and help them once again transform many of our core institutions and industries.'' And there is this: ''We don't build services to make money; we make money to build better services.''To many, the letter brought to mind a similarly high-minded document from the founders of Google, a company that Facebook has come to rival on the Web. When Google filed for its public offering in 2004, its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, said they intended to all but ignore Wall Street's financial expectations in favor of shoot-for-the-moon, long-term products and projects. Last month, Google's share price was battered when it failed to meet analysts' quarterly sales predictions.Of course, those who invest in the stock market want results, not just rosy ambitions. And when they don't get results, they move on to the next big thing.''I would suspect that Mark Zuckerberg could say whatever he wants, but he's probably still going to find that Wall Street is going to influence how he runs his company,'' said Danny Sullivan, an expert on the industry and editor of the Web site Search Engine Land.Mr. Zuckerberg's lengthy letter also tries to help investors understand the philosophy of the computer programmer -- the Hacker Way, as he puts it.''Hackers try to build the best services over the long term by quickly releasing and learning from smaller iterations rather than trying to get everything right all at once,'' he wrote, summing up with a slogan that he said was painted on Facebook's walls: ''Done is better than perfect.''This approach explains both Facebook's swift, extraordinary success at drawing users and the fierce anger that it sometimes provokes. To a user, it can often seem as though Facebook takes a leap of 20 steps ahead, riles users and then rolls 10 or 15 steps back.This ethos seems close to that of Google and diametrically opposed to that of Apple, where perfection has been paramount, and a product could not go to market until it met the exacting standards of its late founder and chief executive, Steven P. Jobs.But the approach is spreading across Silicon Valley. Even Apple surprised people when it introduced the voice-powered Siri feature on the iPhone 4S in a test version, complete with flaws.''We have a saying: 'Move fast and break things,' '' the letter from Mr. Zuckerberg continued. ''The idea is that if you never break anything, you're probably not moving fast enough.''The four-page letter laid out what Mr. Zuckerberg called ''the five core values'' of the company, emphasizing ambition, speed and risk taking. ''We have another saying: 'The riskiest thing is to take no risks.' ''The tricky thing about parables like this is that people remember. In their letter the Google founders included an unofficial corporate motto: ''Don't be evil.'' Its detractors remember it, and use it to shame Google at every perceived transgression.Though Google says it has maintained its unconventional philosophy over all, Mr. Page, now Google's chief executive, has lately been more deferential to Wall Street. On a recent earnings call, he struck a different tone when he told analysts, ''We have a few small speculative projects happening at any one time, but we are very careful stewards of shareholders' money.'' "
Hackers Eavesdrop On the F.B.I.,"WASHINGTON -- The international hackers group known as Anonymous turned the tables on the F.B.I. by listening in on a conference call last month between the bureau, Scotland Yard and other foreign police agencies about their joint investigation of the group and its allies.Anonymous posted a 16-minute recording of the call on the Web on Friday and crowed about the episode in via Twitter: ''The FBI might be curious how we're able to continuously read their internal comms for some time now.''Hours later, the group took responsibility for hacking the Web site of a law firm that had represented Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich, who was accused of leading a group of Marines responsible for killing 24 unarmed civilians in Haditha, Iraq, in 2005. The group said it would soon make public ''mails, faxes, transcriptions'' and other material related to the case, taken from the site of Puckett & Faraj, a Washington-area law firm. A voluminous 2.55 gigabyte file labeled as those files was later posted on a site often used by hackers, Pirate Bay. Regarding the conference call, an F.B.I. official said Anonymous had not in fact hacked into it or any other bureau facilities. Instead, the official said, the group had simply obtained an e-mail giving the time, telephone number and access code for the call. The e-mail had been sent on Jan. 13 to more than three dozen people at the bureau, Scotland Yard, and agencies in France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden. One recipient, a foreign police official, evidently forwarded the notification to a private account, he said, and it was then intercepted by Anonymous.''It's not really that sophisticated,'' said the official, who would discuss the episode only on condition of anonymity. He said no Federal Bureau of Investigation system was compromised but noted that communications security was more challenging when agencies in multiple countries were involved.''We're always looking at ways to make our communications more secure, and obviously we'll be taking a look at what happened here,'' he said.The bureau issued a brief statement confirming the intrusion, which was first reported by The Associated Press: ''The information was intended for law enforcement officers only and was illegally obtained. A criminal investigation is under way to identify and hold accountable those responsible.''The breach, clearly an embarrassment for investigators, is the latest chapter in a continuing war of words and contest of technology between hacking groups and their perceived opponents in law enforcement and the corporate world.The F.B.I. e-mail titled ''Anon-Lulz International Coordination Call'' -- a reference to Anonymous and to an allied group of hackers, Lulz Security -- announced a conference call for investigators ''to discuss the on-going investigations related to Anonymous, Lulzsec, Antisec, and other associated splinter groups.''The recording posted on YouTube and elsewhere included American and British voices discussing suspects in the case. The call begins with banter between an American named Bruce and British officials named Stewart or Stuart and Matt, who are joined by another official from F.B.I. headquarters, Timothy F. Lauster Jr., who sent the e-mail announcing the conference call.The conference call illustrates both the scale of the international police effort to identify and prosecute the hackers, and the striking contrast in age and status of the investigators and their targets: what seem to be middle-aged law enforcement officials on two continents are overheard dissecting the illicit activities of teenagers.A British official refers to Ryan Cleary and Jake Davis, two British teenagers who have been arrested and are wanted in the United States on suspicion of having ties to Anonymous. The British official describes a 325-page report analyzing Ryan Cleary's hard drive, and an F.B.I. agent in Los Angeles discusses various suspects and their nicknames.The investigators also refer to several suspects who had not yet been arrested, including one who calls himself Tehwongz, described by the British official as ''a 15-year-old kid who's basically just doing this all for attention and is a bit of an idiot.''The conversation was part of an international criminal investigation that began in 2010 after Anonymous championed WikiLeaks by mounting electronic attacks on MasterCard and PayPal and other sites that had stopped collecting donations for the antisecrecy organization.Last month, Anonymous attacked the Web sites of the Justice Department and major entertainment companies in retaliation for criminal charges against the founders of Megaupload, a popular Internet service used to transfer music and movies anonymously.The hackers could have penetrated the law-enforcement official's personal e-mail account by guessing a weak password, sneaking into an unencrypted wireless network, or, most likely, with a common and relatively easy tactic known as a phishing attack, said Keith Ross, a computer science professor at Polytechnic Institute of New York University and a security expert. A phishing attack involves sending an e-mail that looks like it is from a friend or relative and persuading the recipient to click on a link that allows every keystroke entered on that particular computer to be recorded. Recording keystrokes is an efficient way to steal someone's e-mail username and password.''The real issue for law-enforcement officials is they need to be better educated about how they handle sensitive data on their e-mails,'' Mr. Ross said. ''It's an easy vulnerability to crack. If you're not careful it's a very dangerous attack.''The same methods may have been used to hack the Web site of the lawyers who represented Sergeant Wuterich, Neal Puckett and Haytham Faraj. Their Web site was defaced by the hackers to display a message from Anonymous saying it was exposing ''the corruption of the court systems and the brutality of U.S. imperialism,'' Gawker.com reported. Later, the site was taken down.In an interview late Friday, Mr. Faraj said he thought that little of the material stolen from their site related to the Haditha case, though some documents might relate to a polygraph that he said Sergeant Wuterich had passed. He said he feared the documents might include a confidential statement from a rape victim in an unrelated case. ''I think in their haste to put stuff out there, they're going to hurt some people,'' he said.Mr. Faraj said he had represented Guantanamo detainees and had supported and offered to represent Pfc. Bradley Manning, the soldier accused of providing documents to WikiLeaks, suggesting that the hackers of Anonymous may be inadvertently attacking someone who shares some of their presumed political views. ''They got the wrong guy,'' he said.He said the F.B.I. had contacted the law firm and opened an investigation.Sergeant Wuterich, 31, pleaded guilty last month in a military court in California to dereliction of duty, telling the judge that he regretted ordering his men to ''shoot first, ask questions later.'' As part of a plea agreement, however, he received no prison time, though his rank was reduced to private. The sentence sparked anger in Iraq and among some human rights advocates, and the Anonymous message complained that Sergeant Wuterich had gotten ''only a pay cut'' as a penalty. "
The Perpetual War: Pirates and Creators,"From book publishers like Macmillan to Hollywood studios like Disney, producers of content are deeply frustrated by the defeat of their efforts to curb online piracy in Congress last month. The bill they favored was flawed, and could have inhibited expression on the Web. But their concern is spot on: the rampant piracy enabled by the Internet undermines the very economics of creative industries.Online piracy is growing by leaps and bounds, as the first chart shows. The use of peer-to-peer and cyberlocker sites, most of it for illegal sharing, amounts to over one-fourth of all Internet traffic, according to Cisco Systems' Visual Networking Index. And while that fraction is expected to shrink as legal services like Internet video expand, file-sharing is still expected to grow about 23 percent annually, on average, until 2015. The Recording Industry Association of America says that four out of five digital music downloads are illegal. Piracy's effects on the economy as a whole are hard to measure. Studies used by the supporters of the defeated piracy legislation have tended to exaggerate piracy's economic costs and threat to jobs. For example, they often omit the fact that money not spent on music or movies is likely to be spent on something else. Nonetheless, piracy does hurt the industries that rely on copyright to protect their creations.Consider the record labels' plunging sales since the music-sharing service Napster made large-scale piracy easy a decade ago. Album sales, including digital singles added up into album equivalents, fell from 755 million in 1999 to 458 million last year, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The top album in 1999, ''Millennium'' by the Backstreet Boys, sold 9.4 million copies. The top 2011 album, Adele's ''21,'' sold 5.8 million.Hollywood was hit by piracy somewhat later because movie files are bigger and require more Internet bandwidth. But home entertainment sales -- a huge chunk of movie revenues -- fell every year from 2004 to 2010. While box-office revenues have benefited from rising ticket prices, movie attendance has been steadily declining. The Oscar-winning ''Hurt Locker,'' for instance, had a worldwide box office of only $49 million but was downloaded illegally seven million times, according to TorrentFreak, a Web site about file-sharing.Publishers embraced e-books only a few years ago. In 2010, 1.5 to 3 million people were looking for free pirated copies of books every day, according to an analysis of global Internet searches by Attributor, a Web monitoring company. Of course, not every pirated download displaces the sale of a book, album or movie. But when it comes to music, most economic studies have concluded that piracy accounts for the vast majority or even entirety of the sales decline.Many Internet enthusiasts say that this change isn't unhealthy, and that the Web makes more ventures possible. They point out that while piracy may be cutting the pay of record label executives, it doesn't seem to have stopped musicians from making new music. According to Nielsen, 75,300 albums were released in 2010, 25 percent more than in 2005. But new releases that sold more than 1,000 copies fell to about 4,700 from 8,000 during that time. The wave of creation that is more hobby than profession has little to do with piracy, and would likely be unaffected by laws to curb illicit downloads.But if professional musicians, movie directors and writers can't make money from their art, they will probably make less of it. Independent producers say piracy is already making it harder to raise money for small and mid-budget movies.Stopping piracy is about protecting creativity -- and the many occupations it supports (think pop band or sound mixer). If we value what creative industries produce as much as we say we do, Congress will have to find a way to protect it without limiting speech. "
Steal This Column,"AMONG the wonders of the Internet, Wikipedia occupies a special place. From its birth 11 years ago it has professed, and has tried reasonably hard to practice, a kind of idealism that stands out in the vaguely, artificially countercultural ambience of Silicon Valley. Google's informal corporate mantra -- ''Don't Be Evil'' -- has become ever more cringe-making as the company pursues its world conquest. Though Bill Gates has applied his personal wealth to noble causes, nobody thinks of Microsoft as anything but a business. I marvel at Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and his acolytes; but I marvel at their imagination and industry, not what the new multibillionaire described last week as their ''social mission.'' But Wikipedia, while it has grown something of a bureaucratic exoskeleton, remains at heart the most successful example of the public-service spirit of the wide-open Web: nonprofit, communitarian, comparatively transparent, free to use and copy, privacy-minded, neutral and civil. Like many people, I was an early doubter that a volunteer-sourced encyclopedia could be trusted, but I'm a convert. Although I find errors (a spot check of the entries for myself and my father the other day found minor inaccuracies in both, which I easily corrected), I use it more than any other Web tool except my search engines, and because I value it, I donate to its NPR-style fund-raising campaign.So as I followed the latest battle in the great sectarian war over the governing of the Internet -- the attempt to curtail online piracy -- I was startled to see that Wikipedia's founder and philosopher, Jimmy Wales, who generally stays out of the political limelight, had assumed a higher profile as a combatant for the tech industry. He supplied an aura of credibility to a libertarian alliance that ranged from the money-farming Megatrons of Google to the hacker anarchists of Anonymous.Et tu, Jimmy?For those of you who have not followed this subject -- or who, like me, regard phrases like ''Net neutrality'' as Novocain for the brain -- the latest skirmish concerns the rampant online theft of songs, films, books and other content. Separate bills advancing in the House and Senate would have given the government new tools to go after digital bootleggers. The central purpose of the legislation -- rather lost in the rhetorical cross-fire and press coverage -- was to extend the copyright laws that already protect content-creators in the U.S. to offshore havens where the most egregious pirates have set up shop. Like most people who make their living the way I do, I think parasite Web sites should be treated with the same contempt as people who pick pockets or boost cars.But the legislation in question, drafted by the once-mighty entertainment industries, was vague and ham-handed, a case of overreach by Hollywood's lobbyists. In the journalistic equivalent of taking a bullet for you, I read all 78 staggeringly dull pages of the House version, called SOPA. Interpreted in the most draconian way, it might have criminalized innocent sites and messed with the secure plumbing of the Internet itself. The partisans of an unfettered Internet saw their moment, and seized it. They unleashed a wave of protest that included much waving of the First Amendment and an attention-grabbing blackout of Wikipedia, the company's most conspicuous foray into protest politics. The legislation is dead, and proponents of the open Web have shown that they are the new power in Washington.The question is, how will they use their muscle now? Does this smackdown mean that any attempt to police the Web for thievery is similarly doomed?Jimmy Wales, when I connected with him in London, was the voice of reason compared with some members of the openness alliance. He disavows the hacker anarchists -- whose most recent stunt to protest enforcement of the copyright laws was to sabotage the Justice Department Web site -- as ''incredibly counterproductive.'' He said he believes copyright protection is ''unquestionably good'' but that enforcement should focus on serious criminal enterprises, not the music fan who burns a copy for a friend or the search engine that merely offers the link to a bad place. (Agreed.) He worries that, under too-sweeping legislation, a site like Wikipedia could be punished because its very informative article about the aptly named site ''The Pirate Bay'' includes a link to the offending destination. (That kind of prosecutorial overkill seems unlikely, but it would be appalling.)Wales thinks the current copyright protections -- which require publishers, broadcasters and other content-makers to watch out for piracy of their own material and notify Internet hosts to take it down -- work fine in the U.S. He grants that enforcement in foreign countries is a problem, but he opposes as burdensome and stifling any effort to make search engines or other intermediaries filter what flows through them.Wales is not endorsing legislation yet, but he had positive things to say about an alternative bill, one that has won support from some tech companies and Internet freedom groups. The so-called OPEN Act would give new powers to the International Trade Commission to issue temporary restraining orders against sites that specialize in selling bootleg copies of books, movies, TV shows and so on, and to cut off their access to the online payment processors and ad-placing services that fund them.I read those 44 pages, too, and the best that can be said about the law -- drafted by the improbable left-right duo of Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican -- is that it's a start. An impartial copyright expert who examined the bill at my request pointed out many loopholes and ambiguities that could make enforcement cumbersome and easily evaded. And personally, I'd go beyond OPEN (and Jimmy Wales) to give the intermediaries -- search engines, online sharing services -- greater responsibility to police what passes through their sites, rather than obliging the victim to do all the work.''Google can remove sites from its search results for causing too much spam; why not for piracy?'' said Robert Levine, whose 2011 book, ''Free Ride,'' is a wonderfully clear-eyed account of this colossal struggle over the future of our cultural lives.But the OPEN Act is at least something to build on, and its sponsors have indicated they are flexible. The music and motion-picture industries should be reaching out to the saner members of the tech industry to collaborate in making it better, instead of demonizing it as if it were written by Blackbeard himself. The online industry is not a monolith. Internet companies that have made fortunes building paid venues -- Apple (proprietor of iTunes) and Microsoft (Xbox Live) and Netflix, among others -- have been pretty quiet during the angry backlash against copyright laws. They have a financial stake in protecting intellectual property.''Basically, we need some serious reform,'' Wales told me. ''Everything should be on the table. But it's not a war; it's a giant public policy question.''Ah, Jimmy, Jimmy, there's the rub. These days in Washington, everything is a war. This is a complicated subject that has been turned into simplistic sloganeering by rival vested interests dressed up as the saviors of freedom.When the founders enshrined free speech in the Constitution, they did not mean ''free'' in the sense of Wikipedia. As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in an important 1985 Supreme Court decision supporting intellectual property rights: ''the Framers intended copyright itself to be the engine of free expression. By establishing a marketable right to the use of one's expression, copyright supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate ideas.''Content-makers would be crazy to let the Internet be stunted as a force for invention, mobilization and shared wisdom. It's the sea we all swim in.At the same time, online companies would be crazy to let piracy kill off the commerce that supplies quality material upon which even free sites like Wikipedia depend. "
What Wikipedia Won't Tell You,"Cary H. Sherman is chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents music labels.WashingtonTHE digital tsunami that swept over the Capitol last month, forcing Congress to set aside legislation to combat the online piracy of American music, movies, books and other creative works, raised questions about how the democratic process functions in the digital age.Policy makers had recognized a constitutional (and economic) imperative to protect American property from theft, to shield consumers from counterfeit products and fraud, and to combat foreign criminals who exploit technology to steal American ingenuity and jobs. They knew that music sales in the United States are less than half of what they were in 1999, when the file-sharing site Napster emerged, and that direct employment in the industry had fallen by more than half since then, to less than 10,000. They studied the problem in all its dimensions, through multiple hearings. While no legislation is perfect, the Protect Intellectual Property Act (or PIPA) was carefully devised, with nearly unanimous bipartisan support in the Senate, and its House counterpart, the Stop Online Piracy Act (or SOPA), was based on existing statutes and Supreme Court precedents. But at the 11th hour, a flood of e-mails and phone calls to Congress stopped the legislation in its tracks. Was this the result of democracy, or demagoguery?Misinformation may be a dirty trick, but it works. Consider, for example, the claim that SOPA and PIPA were ''censorship,'' a loaded and inflammatory term designed to evoke images of crackdowns on pro-democracy Web sites by China or Iran. Since when is it censorship to shut down an operation that an American court, upon a thorough review of evidence, has determined to be illegal? When the police close down a store fencing stolen goods, it isn't censorship, but when those stolen goods are fenced online, it is? Wikipedia, Google and others manufactured controversy by unfairly equating SOPA with censorship. They also argued misleadingly that the bills would have required Web sites to ''monitor'' what their users upload, conveniently ignoring provisions like the ''No Duty to Monitor'' section.The hyperbolic mistruths, presented on the home pages of some of the world's most popular Web sites, amounted to an abuse of trust and a misuse of power. When Wikipedia and Google purport to be neutral sources of information, but then exploit their stature to present information that is not only not neutral but affirmatively incomplete and misleading, they are duping their users into accepting as truth what are merely self-serving political declarations.As it happens, the television networks that actively supported SOPA and PIPA didn't take advantage of their broadcast credibility to press their case. That's partly because ''old media'' draws a line between ''news'' and ''editorial.'' Apparently, Wikipedia and Google don't recognize the ethical boundary between the neutral reporting of information and the presentation of editorial opinion as fact.The violation of neutrality is a patent hypocrisy: these companies have long argued that Internet service providers (telecommunications and cable companies) had to be regulated under the doctrine of ''net neutrality'' because of their power as owners of the Internet pipes. But what the Google and Wikipedia blackout showed is that it's the platforms that exercise the real power. Get enough of them to espouse Silicon Valley's perspective, and tens of millions of Americans will get a one-sided view of whatever the issue may be, drowning out the other side.The conventional wisdom is that the defeat of these bills shows the power of the digital commons. Sure, anybody could click on a link or tweet in outrage -- but how many knew what they were supporting or opposing? Would they have cast their clicks if they knew they were supporting foreign criminals selling counterfeit pharmaceuticals to Americans? Was it SOPA they were opposed to, or censorship?No doubt, some genuinely wanted to protect Americans against theft but were sincerely concerned about how the language in the bill might be interpreted. But others may simply believe that online music, books and movies should be free. And how many of those e-mails were from the same people who attacked the Web sites of the Department of Justice, the Motion Picture Association of America, my organization and others as retribution for the seizure of Megaupload, an international digital piracy operation? Indeed, it's hackers like the group Anonymous that engage in real censorship when they stifle the speech of those with whom they disagree.Perhaps this is naive, but I'd like to believe that the companies that opposed SOPA and PIPA will now feel some responsibility to help come up with constructive alternatives. Virtually every opponent acknowledged that the problem of counterfeiting and piracy is real and damaging. It is no longer acceptable just to say no. The diversionary bill that they drafted, the OPEN Act, would do little to stop the illegal behavior and would not establish a workable framework, standards or remedies.It has become clear that, at this point, neither SOPA, PIPA nor OPEN is a viable answer. We need to take a step back to seek fresh ideas and new approaches. The ''Copyright Alert'' program, a voluntary effort by the entertainment industries and leading Internet service providers to notify users whose accounts are being used for wrongful downloading over peer-to-peer networks, shows that respectful fact-based conversations can lead to progress.We all share the goal of a safe and legal Internet. We need reason, not rhetoric, in discussing how to achieve it. "
Internet Piracy,"To the Editor:''What Wikipedia Won't Tell You,'' by Cary H. Sherman (Op-Ed, Feb. 8), underscores the reality that his organization, the Recording Industry Association of America, and other old-school content groups don't understand the Internet. What Mr. Sherman accurately calls a ''digital tsunami'' was the voice of millions of ordinary Americans expressing their displeasure with extremist copyright bills -- the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect IP Act (PIPA) -- favored by the association. These citizens were legitimately concerned that these overly broad bills would have gone beyond pirates and harmed legitimate Web sites, innovation and the Internet economy.In response to this overwhelming public opposition, one would expect the R.I.A.A. to reconsider and moderate its approach. Instead, Mr. Sherman chooses to accuse his opponents of bad faith, while repeating his same failed arguments.The R.I.A.A. and its colleagues have long used the back rooms of Congress to formulate unbalanced and anti-consumer copyright laws. As we have learned, back rooms do not exist on the Internet.PIPA and SOPA are now dead. I encourage Mr. Sherman to learn from his experience, jettison his love for these extremist bills and work with us on reasonable approaches to the very real problem of Internet piracy.GARY SHAPIRO President and Chief Executive Consumer Electronics Association Arlington, Va., Feb. 10, 2012 "
Scott Ritter's Other War,"On a February afternoon in 2009, Ryan Venneman, one of only five full-time police officers in tiny Barrett Township, Pa., decided to spend some time hunting for sexual predators online. Venneman entered a Yahoo chat room, where the minimum legal age is supposed be 18, and passed himself off as a teenager named Emily. Before long, he was contacted by a man who said he was 44 and called himself delmarm4fun -- a reference to Delmar, N.Y., an Albany suburb about three hours from where Venneman was sitting in the Poconos.''Age?'' delmarm4fun asked.''15.'' ''Aha,'' came the response. ''New York or Pa.?''A graphic flirtation ensued. At one point, delmarm4fun asked ''Emily'' again if she was 18.''No, I'm 15,'' Venneman replied.''Aha,'' delmarm4fun said again. ''My bad.''''What's wrong?'' Venneman asked.''Didn't realize you were 15. . . .''''So why u don't like me,'' Venneman typed, mimicking an adolescent's mangled syntax.''I do, very much. LOL. Just don't want any trouble.''After about an hour of this, according to logs later presented in court, the man Venneman was talking to masturbated in front of a webcam and announced he was off to take a shower.''U know ur in a lot of trouble, don't you,'' Venneman typed.''Huh?''''I'm a undercover police officer. U need to call me A.S.A.P.''''Nah,'' delmarm4fun wrote. ''Your not 15. Yahoo is for 18 and over. It's all fantasy. No crime.''''I have your phone number and I will be getting your IP address from Yahoo and your carrier,'' Venneman wrote. ''We can do this 2 ways call me and you can turn yourself in at a latter date or I'll get a warrant for you and come pick you up.''The perpetrator turned himself in almost immediately. Delmarm4fun, it turned out, was Scott Ritter, one of the most controversial figures in American foreign policy for the past decade and a half. It was Ritter, a former Marine major and United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq, who quit the U.N. inspection team in 1998 and railed against Saddam Hussein's government for misleading inspectors and scamming the international community. And it was Ritter who then did an about-face and emerged, during the long period that led to the war, as the loudest and most credible skeptic of the Bush administration's contention that Hussein was hiding weapons of mass destruction. In a bizarre moment in 2002, Ritter even made the long journey back to Baghdad to address the Iraqi Parliament as a private citizen, warning that his own country was about to make a ''historical mistake'' and urging the Iraqis to allow inspections to resume. For this, and for his relentless insistence that the presence of hidden W.M.D.'s was nothing but a political pretense for war, Ritter was dismissed and even mocked by much of the media establishment (including writers for this magazine and The New York Times).As the last American troops left Iraq, it's fair to say that the war and the debate that surrounded it produced few real heroes; rather, it served as a kind of vortex of destruction that sucked in and defiled nearly everyone associated with it. In Ritter's case, the public vindication to which he would seem entitled -- and which he has never quite received -- has now been replaced by a very public disgrace, his life having slowly come undone in the years after the invasion. ''It's tragic,'' Seymour Hersh, The New Yorker's investigative reporter, said when we spoke this fall. Hersh grew close to Ritter in the late '90s and appeared as a character witness at his trial in Pennsylvania last April. ''He understands the Arab world in a way that few Westerners I know do. You have no idea how smart he is.''Even after he was convicted on five felony counts and two misdemeanors last year, Ritter remained, as he always has, self-righteous and inclined toward seeing conspiracies. ''I'm not humiliated,'' he told me recently, when I suggested he should be. ''It's nobody else's business. And anybody who seeks to make it their business, they should be humiliated. They should be ashamed. They should be embarrassed. What I did or what I didn't do is nobody's business but my own and my wife's. And the fact that this had been dragged out into the public eye the way it has speaks volumes about our society.''Those who came to Ritter's defense around Iraq always argued that he was a courageous and patriotic American, unjustly defamed by opponents, while his critics portrayed him as unreliable and attention-starved -- an ''unstable'' character, as Richard Perle, one of the administration's war planners, once described him. The confounding thing about a figure as self-defeating and polarizing as Scott Ritter is that, with enough time, supporters and critics alike can come to feel they've been proved right.''I'll tell you why it doesn't matter,'' Ritter was saying. This was in October, a few weeks before he was to be sentenced for his crimes. I had asked him whether he thought he deserved some public acknowledgment that his warnings about Iraq and its supposed W.M.D.'s were correct. ''Because today everybody knows I was right. I was right about one of the most significant issues in modern American history. I was the only one who was right about one of the most significant issues in modern American history.''And yet,'' Ritter went on, ''the common reaction seems to be: 'Well, that was then, this is now. Yeah, he was right back then, but how does that impact us today, 10 years later?' '' He shook his head in disbelief. Ritter is an uncommonly articulate man, and when he gets going, the indignation flows in fully formed paragraphs. ''What is the relevance of being right 10 years ago? I don't know -- talk about all the dead Americans. It's relevant to their families, I would think. Talk about the tens of thousands of wounded Americans and the hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded Iraqis.''We were sitting in a dark booth at the Recovery Room, a sports bar across the street from the Albany Medical Center. Ritter's Georgian-born wife, Marina, whom he met as a weapons inspector in Russia in 1989, no longer allows reporters into their home, so Ritter and I had settled in here for the afternoon. Ritter, who was wearing a sweatshirt the size of a small tent, is a densely packed 6-foot-4. Talking to him about his various intrigues and scrapes with authority, I found it almost impossible to keep in mind any kind of linear narrative. He claims that the American government suspected him of spying for Israel; that Norman Schwarzkopf, the gulf-war general, once had him arrested; that the F.B.I. hounded Marina for years because it suspected she was former K.G.B. You can't help wondering how one man managed to attract so much institutional persecution.Ritter's opponents on Iraq still aren't willing to grant that he knew something they didn't. The way they see it, Ritter, whose position on W.M.D.'s swung significantly after he left the country in 1998, was like the stopped clock that finally managed to tell the correct time. ''Oh, no, he wasn't pres/cient, I can't agree with that,'' said Richard Butler, who was Ritter's boss under the United Nations in Iraq. ''When he was the 'Alpha Dog' inspector,'' Butler said, referring to Ritter's own description of his aggressive tactics, ''then by God, there were more weapons there, and we had to go find them -- a contention for which he had inadequate evidence. When he became a peacenik, then it was all complete B.S., start to finish, and there were no weapons of mass destruction. And that also was a contention for which he had inadequate evidence.''History will record, though, that Ritter was right, while those who showed him nothing but contempt were flat wrong. While he wasn't the only one saying that the war's pretense was false or that its aftermath could be calamitous, Ritter was almost certainly the most determined dissenter and the one with the most on-the-ground intelligence. And if his views on Hussein's regime careened from one extreme to the other, at least he demonstrated a capacity to evolve in his thinking -- something few policy makers or commentators showed themselves able to do at the time. No doubt his very existence continues to discomfit those who insisted on Hussein's lethality, and whose explanation for why they were wrong -- that the intelligence was fabricated, essentially -- has always been undercut by the fact that Ritter was never taken in.I asked him if the war in Iraq, which in a matter of weeks would effectively end, had turned out as he thought it would, or if it could have been worse. He considered the question.''It could have been worse,'' he said finally. ''We could have won. We could have felt empowered to move on to Syria and Iran, and then we would have been totally screwed.''But if we're just going to get into the realm of reality,'' Ritter went on, ''how much worse do you want it? We're bankrupt, morally and fiscally, because of this war. The United States is the laughingstock of the world.''What really agonizes Ritter is that Americans seem to care about his forays into chat rooms, or about Michael Jackson's doctor or the Kardashians' wedding, but not about the moral crisis that Iraq unleashed on the land. They keep talking to Scott Ritter about justice for what he has done, and yet no one is paying for the larger crimes he believes were perpetrated against the society.''Everybody who lied about the war got rewarded,'' Ritter said. ''Because they played the game. Tell the truth about the war, you don't get rewarded.'' He paused. ''And then, you know, let's be frank -- you compound it with me shooting myself in the foot on personal, behavioral issues.'' An awkward moment passed between us. ''I'll just ask the fundamental question,'' Ritter said, looking at me squarely across the table. ''My personal missteps -- how many Americans have died as a result of that? None. Other than my family, how many victims were there? None. And yet, in refusing to engage in a responsible debate about Iraq, how many Americans died? Thousands. And America seems to have no problem with that.''In the years after he resigned as a weapons inspector in Iraq, after he changed his mind about the likelihood that Hussein was stockpiling weapons, Ritter briefly basked in the adulation of America's liberal aristocracy. He was asked to speak at Hollywood fund-raisers; at one, he recalled, Barbra Streisand ''sequestered'' him for 40 minutes, and then Warren Beatty drove Ritter to his house for homemade chili and a 90-minute political discussion. Streisand, he said, later invited him and Marina to one of her retirement concerts, in New York, where the Ritters were ushered backstage for a private reunion.But what Ritter really needed was a paying job. A much-maligned documentary about Iraq, which he made in 2000 with the dubious financial backing of an Iraqi businessman living in Detroit, failed miserably and plunged him into debt. His ambition was to land a fellowship for which he could write papers and fly off to conferences, or to get some steady gig as a TV commentator, or to dash across the globe on assignment for a glossy magazine. But the Council on Foreign Relations hired Richard Butler instead, and NBC stopped using him as a TV analyst, and Vanity Fair's editors would only spring for lunch. He wasn't so much an academic or a journalist as he was a peace activist, something for which think tanks and networks had little use.And then there was the vague personal innuendo, tawdry and troubling. In ''Cruel and Unusual,'' his screed against the Bush administration and the media who covered it, the liberal press critic Mark Crispin Miller devoted about 30 pages to documenting the public campaign to discredit Ritter in the months before the Iraq war began. Near the end of the section, in what felt like an obligatory aside, Miller raised and then dismissed an inconvenient wrinkle in Ritter's story of heroism: ''The drive to neutralize Scott Ritter finally climaxed in a murky but effective charge of something like attempted pedophilia, stealthily 'exposed' in January 2003. That slander was, to say the least, gratuitous. . . .''Except that it wasn't slander, inasmuch as slander is, by definition, untrue. In fact, the police in Colonie, N.Y., encountered Ritter twice in 2001 -- and quietly arrested him once -- after he contacted cops posing as under-age girls in chat rooms. (Ritter was caught using the unsubtle screen name OnExhibit.) In both cases, Ritter agreed to meet the fictional teenagers in the parking lots of fast-food joints, with the intent of masturbating in front of them, only to be confronted by cops when he got there. For reasons that still aren't entirely clear, the prosecutor dismissed the charges, on the condition that Ritter enter intensive counseling, and a local judge sealed the records.The timing of the revelations about Ritter's two-year-old arrests, which somehow became public just as the administration was preparing to invade Iraq, certainly seemed to indicate that his political adversaries meant to destroy his credibility. The charges made international news and effectively ended any hope Ritter had of becoming a public intellectual or a war correspondent. He continued churning out op-eds and books (six in all), but he struggled to pay his bills, and his role as an advocate receded to the point where he was talking to only a small community of policy experts.In the years after, Ritter sought other outlets for his energies. He and Marina joined Delmar's volunteer Fire Department (he as a firefighter and she as an E.M.T.), and Ritter became one of its most active members, eventually selected as an assistant chief. In the hours left to himself, though, Ritter struggled. According to court testimony, by 2004, when he stopped attending therapy, Ritter had made an almost daily habit of trying to meet adult women from the chat rooms, in cars or out-of-the-way places, so they could watch him masturbate. (Ritter maintains that he never engaged with an actual minor online, and there's no evidence to suggest he did, beyond his interactions with undercover police officers in chat rooms for over-18-year-olds.) In 2007, he started using the webcam instead. He admits he couldn't stop.''I always sort of chuckle when people say, 'What were you thinking?' '' Ritter told me. ''Well, what part of 'depressed' don't you understand? Find me someone who says depressed people engage in coherent thought.''It's tempting to try to find some deeper connection between Ritter's public crusade and his most private transgressions. Does he simply crave attention wherever he can get it? Does he need to feel admired? If there is a connection between Ritter the activist and Ritter the accused, though, it probably lies in the uncompromising, even heedless way in which he insists on his version of reality, and how he sees himself always as the victim of a system that is self-evidently corrupt. ''I'm someone who believes the truth needs to be heard,'' Ritter told me. ''And if I'm empowered with the truth, I'm not going to shut up.''Such stridency has repercussions. Taken in isolation, this latest case against Ritter -- the one in Pennsylvania stemming from Ryan Venneman's sting -- is hardly the kind of thing that lands you on ''America's Most Wanted.'' It's not as though Ritter, who is the father of twin 19-year-old daughters, was trolling an adolescent site looking to prey on minors. Nor did he ever hint at meeting with the fictional Emily face to face. There's little question the man needs help, but such cases are routinely disposed of through plea bargains, and prosecutors in Ritter's case were willing, initially, to let him escape with a single guilty plea, which may well have meant probation rather than jail. Especially given Ritter's previous arrests in New York, this seems to have been a more-than-equitable resolution, and most accused sex offenders in the age of Megan's Law would probably have jumped at it.But Ritter has forcefully insisted all along that he did nothing wrong, beyond betraying Marina's trust. ''Why would I plead guilty to something I didn't do?'' he asked me, when I raised the issue of a plea arrangement. I suggested he might have done it to avoid going to jail.''No,'' he replied. ''Wrong answer. Then I'm not a man. Then I'm not a human being.''At trial, Ritter told the jury that he assumed Venneman was a housewife pretending to be 15, and that he had never for a moment believed he was talking to a minor, despite the fact that ''Emily'' repeatedly stated her age. When prosecutors were successful in moving to unseal his New York files and presented evidence from those arrests too, Ritter steadfastly maintained that he was aware, in both instances/, that he was talking to undercover cops. He knew his online activities needed to be stopped, Ritter said, so he arranged to meet the officers involved, playing along with the notion that they were teenage girls, so that he could get himself arrested and be forced to face his demons. This would have been a more persuasive defense, perhaps, had one of the arresting detectives not testified that Ritter, upon seeing the police lying in wait for him, tried to evade capture by slamming down the gas pedal and jumping a curb, T.J. Hooker-style.Ritter's refusal to surrender to the system, to even admit there could be any reasonable interpretation of the facts other than his own, seemed to enrage the prosecutor and the judge in Monroe County. ''I think his arrogance and his refusal to admit any wrongdoing definitely hurt him at trial,'' the prosecutor, Michael Rakaczewski, told me recently, likening Ritter to an alcoholic or a drug addict. ''If that person is in denial about the root issue of the problem or the extent of the problem, I don't see how that person can get effective treatment. They're still liable to reoffend.''And so you could say that the very attribute that made Scott Ritter appear somehow clairvoyant on Iraq -- his refusal to accede to everyone else's sense of reality -- is the same one that has led him, now, to ruin. He lost his only steady job in years, writing analyses on world events for a private energy firm, when the charges became public. After years of picnics and camaraderie, his fellow firefighters removed him from active duty before he could even be tried in court. ''These guys knew me better than any of my military friends knew me,'' Ritter told me. ''To have them turn on me that quickly, that quickly'' -- he snapped his fingers -- ''yeah, it was one of the most profound disappointments I have experienced.''Beset now by six-figure legal bills, Ritter told me he wasn't sure how he and Marina were going to keep their house or pay their daughters' college tuition if he went away to jail. I asked him if the prospect of being incarcerated frightened him.''Jail doesn't scare me,'' Ritter said. ''Not being there for my family scares me. Jail is something guilty people fear. I'm not guilty.''In the days leading up to Ritter's sentencing in the last week of October, a significant development suddenly brought him new hope. Responding to an appeal from Ritter's lawyers, a panel of appellate judges in New York ruled unanimously that the files from his 2001 arrest should never have been unsealed and used in his trial. This presented a legal quandary between two neighboring states; the records from Ritter's arrests in New York were now under seal once again, but in the meantime they had been instrumental in convicting Ritter in Pennsylvania. His lawyers -- Gary Kohlman, a white-collar trial lawyer in Washington, and Todd Henry, a Philadelphia-based specialist in sex crimes -- filed a motion asking the judge in Pennsylvania to throw out the conviction.On the morning of Ritter's scheduled sentencing, he and Marina and the lawyers arrived back at the courthouse in Stroudsburg, Pa., and proceeded into a drab basement room to hear the ruling on their motion. Kohlman argued his case for vacating the verdict, but the judge, Jennifer Harlacher Sibum, was clearly unmoved, as she had been by most of Ritter's arguments during the trial. She acknowledged that the legal issues raised by the simultaneous decisions in two separate states were unusual (''I don't know that it's ever been confronted in Pennsylvania,'' she said at one point), but decided to proceed with sentencing anyway.Ritter was seated at the defense table, about four feet in front of me, wearing a dark gray suit with a white shirt and a red tie. He sat expressionless, locking and unlocking his fingers and occasionally pressing them against his closed eyes. Behind me, in the second and last row of benches for spectators, sat a few of Ritter's old military buddies from his days as a weapons inspector, and next to them a gaunt-faced Marina.After hearing testimony from dueling psychologists, Judge Sibum decided that Ritter met the state standard for being classified as a violent predator -- despite having never displayed a sexually violent tendency. This meant that he would have to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. Then it was the defendant's turn to address the court and ask for leniency. Ritter rose from his chair and took a long moment to compose himself, the uncomfortable silence broken only by Marina's voice. ''Hold your head up high, Scott,'' she called out.This was Ritter's chance to plea for mercy and demonstrate remorse. ''I stand before you about as chastened as an adult man can be,'' Ritter told the judge in a commanding voice. ''As a husband, as a father, I had no business doing what I was doing.'' I heard a woman's anguished sniffling behind me.But even in his determination to show humility, Ritter couldn't help flashing defiance. ''It should never have been made public,'' he loudly told the court, motioning back toward Marina. ''It's between me and my wife.'' You could see, in the hardening of Judge Sibum's eyes, how his adamancy exasperated her. Richard Butler and Norman Schwarzkopf would no doubt have sympathized.''I have paid a horrible price,'' Ritter went on. ''No one to blame, only myself. I went from being someone who stood tall in my community, who assisted my community, to someone who's been cast aside.''Then it was the judge's turn. ''I do acknowledge that Mr. Ritter has had tremendous service and has made many contributions to his community and this country,'' Siburn said. She added, however, that ''he has made excuses for his conduct in this case,'' specifically noting what he had just said about the whole thing being a matter for him and his wife. ''It supports the conclusion,'' she said, ''that Mr. Ritter fails to take responsibility. He believes he was entrapped.''She read off the seven counts and their corresponding prison terms. They amounted to a minimum of 18 months and a maximum of five and a half years in a state facility. Kohlman immediately urged the judge to set some kind of bail, pending appeal, but she shook her head and ordered the three sheriffs standing nearby to take Ritter into custody. There was the sound of handcuffs clicking, followed by another sob from the back of the room. Ritter looked impassively at Marina and nodded once as the sheriffs turned him around and marched him down a short hallway and through a locked door, silenced at last. "
The Bright Side of Being Hacked,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Hackers operating under the banner Anonymous have been poking a finger in the eye of one private company after another for two years now.They steal files from inside corporate computer systems and occasionally, as in the case of Stratfor last week, dump company e-mail online for all to see.The Stratfor hack, in which Anonymous claimed to have joined forces with WikiLeaks, drove home a clear lesson about the era of ubiquitous ''hactivism,'' or hacking as a form of protest. Despite the arrests of dozens of suspected members of Anonymous and its offshoots worldwide, it is far from diminished. Nor have most of its corporate targets been irreparably damaged by the attacks.Rather, what Anonymous has done, experts said at the big RSA computer security conference here last week, is raise the alarm about the unguarded state of corporate computer systems.By and large, the Anonymous break-ins take advantage of gaping computer holes and gullible human beings. The hackers ferret out weak passwords and take advantage of unencrypted e-mail stashes. They persuade company employees -- one is all it takes -- to click on rogue Web sites or divulge a confidential piece of information, in an exercise known as social engineering.''Anonymous is a wake-up call,'' said Roger Cressey, senior vice president of Booz Allen Hamilton, a defense and intelligence contractor that was attacked by the group last summer. ''Any company that is patting themselves on the back and saying that they're not a target or not susceptible to attack is in complete and utter denial.''More to the point, a company that is a target of Anonymous may also be the target of a far more potent adversary. The social engineering tactics that Anonymous members have repeatedly used are often similar to those used by criminal hackers and state-sponsored actors who penetrate company systems in order to steal valuable secrets, whether for monetary gain or competitive edge.Anonymous draws public attention -- and by extension, that of executives and shareholders. It puts a face -- or rather, a mask -- on a far more pernicious problem: online espionage.''The attacks by them pale in comparison to the nation-state stuff and the criminal element,'' said Eddie Schwartz, chief security officer for RSA, the organizer of the computer security conference and a maker of security tokens, which was itself the target of a highly publicized breach by suspected state-backed hackers. ''There is an awakening. There is a lot more visibility in the press.''An Anonymous attack can leave a measurable toll. In 2010, its activists broke into Sony's systems, exposing names and credit card numbers of millions of customers; Sony said last May that the cleanup would cost it $170 million. Last year, Anonymous extracted the password of an executive at the security firm HBGary and helped itself to a pile of internal company e-mail.News of the breach at the geopolitical analysis firm Stratfor began trickling out on Christmas Eve, when the company's site was defaced. At first, a group called Antisec, an Anonymous offshoot, claimed responsibility, announcing that it had penetrated the company's network. It posted the names, addresses and credit card details of 75,000 people who subscribed to Stratfor newsletters. Soon came a dump of credentials for 860,000 user accounts, not all of whom may have been paid subscribers.Mary Landesman, a senior security researcher at Cisco who has closely studied the Stratfor breach, said the attack appears to have been twofold: a relatively commonplace attack, known as an SQL injection, on four servers that stored e-mails dating back several years, as well as a breach of a vulnerable third-party e-commerce system that Stratfor would have used to process its paid subscribers.A company's vulnerabilities, whether human or machine, are far easier to spot, Ms. Landesman pointed out, if a sprawling army of thieves is plotting the break-in. ''The more eyes, the greater chance of success,'' she said.Soon the paid customers found themselves having to deal with purchases made with the stolen card numbers. Then they began receiving e-mails that purported to be from George Friedman, Stratfor's chief executive, and came with malicious software attached. Mr. Friedman announced that Stratfor had not sent out the e-mails, and the company stopped charging for its subscriptions, which had been its principal source of revenue.A class-action lawsuit followed, accusing the company of negligence in securely storing its customers' information and failing to promptly notify them of the theft.In its response to the lawsuit, Stratfor said it had informed the FBI as soon as it learned of the breach on Dec. 7.The most recent salvo in the Stratfor hack began last Sunday, when WikiLeaks began releasing the contents of the company's internal e-mail communications. Stratfor for its part refused to distinguish between e-mails that it said may have been ''forged'' and those that were ''authentic.''Stratfor declined requests for an interview.Law enforcement officials at the RSA conference expressed frustration with their inability to squelch the rise of such attacks. Those who participate can be hard to find. And often they turn out to be minors who are not prosecuted as aggressively as adults.The head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert Mueller, struck an ominous note about the threat of digital attacks on corporate America. ''There are only two types of companies,'' Mr. Mueller said in a keynote speech at the conference, ''those that have been hacked and those that will be.''Oddly enough, despite the stream of attacks and a security industry that is eager to sell its services, a survey of the largest American companies shows that neither their top executives nor their board members are directly involved in decisions about the security of their data.According to the latest results of an annual survey by Carnegie Mellon University, released last week, more than 70 percent said they occasionally, rarely or never reviewed their top information security policies or staff.How the attack will damage Stratfor in the long run remains to be seen. If HBGary is any yardstick, it may pull through. HBGary suffered an embarrassing blow last year when thousands of its internal e-mails were dumped on the Internet.Aaron Barr, the chief executive of its sister company, HBGary Federal, who provoked the ire of Anonymous by boasting of having penetrated its anonymity, resigned. But in late February, despite the hacking, HBGary was acquired by ManTech, a giant Virginia-based defense contractor, which itself had been hacked by Anonymous last August. "
Arrests Sow Mistrust Inside a Clan of Hackers,"For months, The Real Sabu, as he called himself on Twitter, boasted, cursed and egged on his followers to take part in computer attacks against private companies and government agencies worldwide.''Don't give in to these people,'' he wrote on Monday, ridiculing ''cowards'' in the federal government. ''Fight back. Stay strong.''It turns out that Sabu had become an informant for federal law enforcement authorities. On Tuesday, in what could be one of the biggest breakthroughs in the government crackdown on a loose, large confederation of politically inspired ''hacktivists,'' he was unmasked and revealed to have helped the authorities catch several fellow hackers in Europe and the United States.Four men in Britain and Ireland were charged Tuesday with computer crimes; a fifth man was arrested Monday in Chicago. Court papers identified Sabu as Hector Xavier Monsegur, 28, of New York. He pleaded guilty last August to a dozen counts of conspiracy to attack computers. He had operated since then as usual -- as The Real Sabu, instigating attacks and quoting revolutionaries online.The prosecutions are part of a wave of coordinated efforts to rein in a leaderless, multinational movement called Anonymous, which has drawn attention for its protests against the Church of Scientology and in support of the whistle-blower site WikiLeaks. It has spawned spinoffs with different names and insignias, among them LulzSec, which claimed to attack computer security companies for laughs, or lulz, and of which Sabu was a prominent, outspoken member.Just last week, Interpol announced the arrests of 25 people suspected of being Anonymous members in Europe. Sabu reacted to that news on Twitter by urging others to attack Interpol's Web site.Mr. Monsegur's base of operations seems to have been his late grandmother's sixth-floor apartment in a public-housing project on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He was apparently self-trained, and he appears to have been equally skilled at hacking and deceiving his fellow hackers. His downfall, if nothing else, will sow even more distrust and dissension in the ranks of Anonymous.''It is going to be very difficult for Anonymous to recover from such a breach of trust,'' said Mikko Hypponen, a security researcher at F-Secure Labs in Helsinki. ''You can see the Anonymous people now looking left and right and realizing, if they couldn't trust Sabu, who can they trust?''Whether this will temper the larger hacker cause remains to be seen. Anonymous is a decentralized movement that is, broadly speaking, opposed to state institutions and the companies that work with them, and its members have embraced an ever-shifting variety of causes, including animal rights and democracy in the Middle East.The ranks are steadily replenished with people of varying skills. The targets have included Fox News, Sony, the government contractor HBGary and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Favored tactics are either to start brute-force attacks aimed at slowing or shutting down sites, or to break into computer systems and expose embarrassing communications.Gabriella Coleman, an anthropologist who studies the Anonymous movement and teaches at McGill University in Montreal, said she expected the latest prosecutions would most likely have ''a chilling effect'' on their hacking tactics.''These are moments of massive reflection -- who are we, what do we want to be?'' she said of Anonymous.The group's latest highly publicized breach was of the geopolitical analysis firm Stratfor. Its system was first penetrated last December, and the hackers exposed its customers' names and e-mail addresses. Then, starting last week, its internal communications were released on the Internet by a new partner, WikiLeaks.On Monday night, the F.B.I. arrested Jeremy Hammond, 27, of Chicago, in connection with the Stratfor breach. Mr. Hammond is charged with stealing credit card information and using some of it to rack up more than $700,000 in charges.Mr. Hammond's neighbors on Tuesday described him as a friendly man who dressed eccentrically, sometimes wearing mismatched shoes and, other times, suspenders. He sat on the front porch of the red brick house where he rented a first-floor apartment, and sometimes played the banjo and made up songs about the goings-on on the street.Mr. Hammond's eccentricities apparently involved previous run-ins with the F.B.I. In 2006, he was convicted of having hacked into a political group's computer server and stolen credit card numbers. He was sentenced to 24 months in prison.Also charged in a separate indictment were two Britons, Ryan Ackroyd, 23, and Jake Davis, 19. Mr. Davis, who was known by his nickname Topiary and was as loquacious on Twitter as Mr. Monsegur, was arrested last July in the Shetland Islands.Also charged in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York were Darren Martyn, 25, whose nicknames included Pwnsauce, and Donncha O'Cearbhail, 19, who was known as Palladium.All four men are accused of hacking into the computer systems of, among others, Fox Broadcasting, Sony Pictures Entertainment and PBS over the last year. (Fox News first reported the prosecutions on Tuesday.)Mr. O'Cearbhail is separately charged with breaching the personal e-mail account of an Irish law enforcement official and using it to covertly record a conference call in January in which authorities from several countries, including F.B.I. agents, were discussing investigations of Anonymous and other hacktivist groups.Mr. Monsegur, for his part, was described as a smart, politically motivated hacker who had steered clear of trouble with the law -- unlike his father, a Bronx resident who was convicted of selling heroin and spent seven years in prison.A family member who did not want to be identified said that Mr. Monsegur was tall and heavy, and known for being into computers, video games and cars. He had been close to his grandmother, whose apartment in the Jacob Riis Houses became his home and his workshop. He has been living there with his girlfriend's two children, a person in law enforcement said.Online, Mr. Monsegur was generating international mayhem, according to the complaint, participating in an attack on PayPal, defacing the Web site of the prime minister of Tunisia and breaking into the government of Yemen's computers. His role, court documents say, was to act as a ''rooter,'' identifying vulnerabilities in the target's systems.Some residents of the housing complex were shocked to hear of the charges. ''I don't believe it,'' said Jaime Reyes, who said he had known Mr. Monsegur for many years, adding: ''He was a good kid.'' Mr. Reyes said Mr. Monsegur seemed to be off at work a lot, and when he was home he was busy taking care of the children. ''The way I see him, if somebody was a hacker, they would be home all day,'' he said.As is common in cases involving informants, a federal judge will eventually decide whether Mr. Monsegur will be sentenced to jail or to what extent his punishment will be reduced in exchange for his cooperation.In the days just before his guilty plea was announced, Mr. Monsegur -- or Sabu on Twitter -- was his usual bombastic self. ''You think arresting my people will stop our idea? Our love and solidarity will not cease but will be empowered. We are stronger than the gov,'' he wrote last week.His last post, on Monday afternoon, was adapted from a quote from the Marxist activist Rosa Luxemburg, in German. ''The revolution says I am, I was, I will be,'' it said. "
"Hacker, Informant and Party Boy of the Projects","In his Lower East Side apartment, the nights were racket-filled and without end. Neighbors lived with the pounding music and the sound of a pit bull being chased around the living room. The revelry sent scores of calls to the city's complaint line.In that same apartment he hatched the online plots, the ones intended to cripple the governments of Algeria and Zimbabwe, to shame some of the biggest brand-name companies in the world.On the Internet he was Sabu, a notorious celebrity who led a scattered tribe of politically motivated ''hacktivists,'' revered as the sly mastermind of brash computer attacks. Then, when he was caught, he slipped into the role of federal informant.But always he was Hector Xavier Monsegur, party boy of the projects. The multiple worlds of Sabu converged on Tuesday when court papers revealed his real identity.As an informant, he helped bring down a batch of prominent fellow hackers in Europe and the United States. They were indicted on a charge of computer crimes that the authorities said affected one million victims, along with major companies and government agencies.Hackers, concealed behind fanciful aliases on the Internet, often appropriate larger-than-life dimensions. In reality, other than in physical proportions, Sabu seemed considerably smaller than life. A defensive-lineman-size man known as Booby, he was raising the two young children of his imprisoned aunt in a public housing project. Court documents showed that Mr. Monsegur, 28, paid bills with stolen credit cards and dabbled in drug sales.In one neighborly gesture, he offered to use his hacking skills to sweeten other tenants' credit ratings.On Twitter, both before and after he was helping the authorities catch his compatriots, he was prone to grand declarations: ''Give us liberty or give us death -- and there's billions of us around the world. You can't stop us. Because without us you won't exist.''In the days before his unmasking, he was strangely haunted by the subject of turncoats. ''So you're telling me if you get locked up, and your nosy neighbor who dropped the dime on you runs free -- you would simply ignore?'' he posted Monday.Mr. Monsegur's whereabouts are unknown, and his lawyers declined to comment. His background remains gauzy, but court records and interviews with relatives and neighbors offer an outline.He was born in 1983. His father, also named Hector Monsegur, was arrested in 1997 along with his sister, Iris, for selling heroin. Both went to prison for seven years.While his father was locked up, Mr. Monsegur apparently moved in with his grandmother, Irma, who lived in a sixth-floor apartment in the Jacob Riis Houses, a Lower East Side housing project.School officials said Mr. Monsegur attended Washington Irving High School, but left in 2001 without finishing ninth grade. In the transcript of his guilty plea, Mr. Monsegur said that he went to college, though it is unclear if he actually did.After his release from prison in early 2003, Mr. Monsegur's father found work with a sanitation company. The aunt, Iris, ran a credit repair company from her Staten Island home. Her involvement with drugs, however, continued. She was arrested again and returned to prison in 2010. By that point she had had two girls. They were entrusted to the care of the younger Mr. Monsegur, and he gained legal custody of them.Even after his aunt left prison last August, her children remained with Mr. Monsegur.He worked sporadically, including for a few months at OpenPlans, a nonprofit group that tries to improve government through technology. His profile on the networking site LinkedIn, which listed him as a senior systems administrator there, disappeared on Thursday. A former co-worker described him as friendly and competent.But authorities said he had been unemployed in recent years.Mr. Monsegur was active in computer and hacking circles as far back as the late 1990s, and started a group for local programmers in 2002. ''My name is Xavier,'' he announced, inviting others to join and ''integrate their knowledge into one big mass of hairy information.''He soon came to embrace strong antigovernment and anticapitalist ideologies that steered him into the hacking world.In what was identified as a question-and-answer interview with Sabu published in New Scientist magazine last year, he said that he became a hacktivist when he was 16. He said he became disturbed that the Navy was using Vieques Island in Puerto Rico as a bombing range for exercises, and that he helped disrupt communications. In 2010, he said in the interview, he was drawn to Anonymous, a leaderless, antiauthoritarian movement that has taken up a variety of political causes. The catalyst, he said, was his outrage over the arrest of Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, the whistle-blower site.In particular, he became a leader of a splinter group, Lulz Security, or LulzSec, which claimed to attack computer security companies for laughs, or lulz, rather than for financial gain.Describing himself, he said in the interview, ''I'm not some cape-wearing hero, nor am I some supervillain trying to bring down the good guys. I'm just doing what I know how to do, and that is counter abuse.'' For his online handle he chose Sabu, adopted from a former professional wrestler.In 2010 and 2011, according to court documents, Mr. Monsegur participated in a relentless string of online attacks against companies and governments. Targets included Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Sony. He also played a role in attacks on computers belonging to the governments of Tunisia, Yemen, Algeria and Zimbabwe, as well as those of the United States Senate.Though he was self-taught, Mr. Monsegur was probably among the most skilled technologists in the bunch. As the ''rooter,'' federal authorities say, he was in charge of identifying vulnerabilities of LulzSec targets and creating the attack strategy.Copies of LulzSec chat logs posted online show that he was sometimes wary of getting caught. In one discussion, he is irate at his fellow hackers for revealing the name of a site used in an attack, because it could expose his computer's location. Another participant is deferential: ''Mm, okay, ill not say anything further without conferring with you.''In another chat, Sabu is told about a hacker who spots weaknesses of target organizations. He issues an order: ''Can you bring them to this network for private chats with me? I want some realtime coordination.''On Twitter he posted about a variety of political causes: repression in Syria, the American colonization of Puerto Rico, legislation that would restrict the Internet.Mr. Monsegur's value as an informant is on display in an online chat with Jeremy Hammond, a Chicago man accused of attacking a company called Stratfor last December, as excerpted in court papers. Mr. Hammond gleefully describes his attack to Mr. Monsegur, who praises him. Then Mr. Monsegur extracts a valuable piece of information. He calls him by one of his other nicknames, Anarchaos, and Mr. Hammond responds -- linking the two aliases.''If I get raided anarchaos your job is to cause havok in my honor,'' Mr. Monsegur says.''It shall be so,'' Mr. Hammond replies.Neighbors and relatives said that offline, Mr. Monsegur became more disruptive after his grandmother died a couple of years ago. ''That messed him up,'' a family member said.Most residents of the complex who knew him would speak only on condition of anonymity, out of fear of retribution from him and his friends. These neighbors said that besides the children, he seemed to live with a number of others.Some found him an irksome presence. ''He partied all night,'' one neighbor said. ''I always made complaints to the police. Nothing was done.''One neighbor complained twice to Community Board 3 about the chronic noise, as recently as last week. She said it would persist from 7 p.m. to 4 a.m., seven days a week.Several neighbors said that they smelled marijuana wafting from the parties. One neighbor said that when she left in the morning the hubbub persisted. ''The music gives me headaches,'' she said. Among his visitors, neighbors said, were a half-sister and several brothers, one of whom brought along a white pit bull named China.There were those who found Mr. Monsegur gracious. One man who lived in the complex told of losing his wallet a year ago while stepping out of a cab. Mr. Monsegur happened to find it, tracked down the man and returned it.Neighbors said Mr. Monsegur told them he spent the bulk of his days huddled in front of his computer. ''He would brag how he changed bad credit to good credit on his computer,'' one neighbor said. She said she had heard another tenant talk about how Mr. Monsegur helped him upgrade his credit.They were in disbelief that he could be the man authorities unmasked.In pleading guilty, Mr. Monsegur admitted that he applied his hacking skills not simply for laughs or noble causes but for money. In court documents, he said that he had hacked into an auto parts company and had it ship him four automobile motors worth $3,456.According to sources briefed on the investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation learned in February of last year that Sabu was Mr. Monsegur. He had made elementary mistakes, like logging into an online chat room without using anonymity software and revealing the name of a Web site he controlled in a chat room.Last summer, authorities arrested Mr. Monsegur. Two F.B.I. agents visited him in his apartment and employed the classic Good Cop-Bad Cop method to pressure him into cooperating, according to a person briefed on the matter.In August, he pleaded guilty to a dozen criminal counts, most involving conspiracy to hack computers, and entered into a cooperation agreement. The agreement also detailed an array of crimes that prosecutors did not charge him with, including hacking into an online casino, using and trying to sell marijuana and buying $15,000 worth of merchandise with a former employer's credit card.He was freed on bail and began functioning as an informant, continuing to speak on Twitter and elsewhere as Sabu.According to the cooperation agreement, authorities said that if Mr. Monsegur felt endangered they would take steps to protect him, including trying to get him and ''his family and certain loved ones'' into the witness protection program.His crimes carry a maximum sentence of 122 years, though his cooperation agreement said that if he provided ''substantial assistance'' to the government, prosecutors would recommend leniency.

Thailand: Message Board Manager Sentenced Over Postings by Others,"CORRECTION APPENDEDBANGKOK -- A Thai court sentenced the manager of an Internet message board to a one-year suspended prison term on Wednesday for comments posted by users that insulted the Thai royal family. The sentence was immediately condemned by Google and human rights groups.The manager of the site, Prachatai, a popular forum for discussions about politics and culture, was convicted of lese-majeste, as royal insults are known, under Thailand's Computer Crimes Act. Courts in Thailand have jailed people convicted of lese-majeste with increasing frequency in recent years, but the verdict on Wednesday was unusual in that the defendant, Chiranuch Premchaiporn, was not the author of the offending comments; she was just the Web master of the site that hosted them. Taj Meadows, a spokesman for Google, said in an e-mailed statement that the verdict was ''a serious threat to the future of the Internet in Thailand.''''Telephone companies are not penalized for things people say on the phone, and responsible Web site owners should not be punished for comments users post on their sites -- but Thailand's Computer Crimes Act is being used to do just that,'' Mr. Meadows said.The Computer Crimes Act is controversial in Thailand partly because it was enacted by an unelected government installed after the military coup in 2006. The act also has a far-reaching extraterritorial feature built in: an American citizen was sentenced to two and a half years in prison last year for uploading from his computer in the United States a translation of a book banned in Thailand. He was arrested during a visit to Thailand.In Ms. Chiranuch's case, Judge Kampol Rungrat ruled that she was liable for one out of 10 comments posted on Prachatai. But the judge appeared ambivalent in making the ruling. Prosecutors could not prove that Ms. Chiranuch ''intentionally supported'' the insulting comments and it would be ''unfair'' to expect that a Web master could immediately remove offending comments from a Web site, he said. Under the law, however, it was nonetheless Ms. Chiranuch's ''duty and responsibility'' to remove them, the judge ruled.Ms. Chiranuch had argued that she removed the comments as soon as she was made aware of them. The judge agreed in all but one instance, and said leaving a comment for 20 days was beyond a reasonable period of time. The sentence was suspended because she had no previous convictions.Benjamin Zawacki, a Thailand researcher for Amnesty International, said the verdict would discourage anyone wanting to start up an Internet business in Thailand.''International media corporations need to sit up and take notice,'' he said. ''Even 'liking' something on Facebook could have legal implications.''The Chiranuch case illustrated the larger question of responsibility for speech in the digital age.Faced with a torrent of digital content -- 72 hours of video are uploaded onto YouTube every minute -- some governments are trying to put the responsibility for policing offensive or illegal content on intermediaries like Facebook, YouTube or any services that allow or encourage public participation.Some governments seek to control the Internet directly. China, Cuba, North Korea, Singapore, Syria and Vietnam are among countries with significant controls over politically related content. Iran is seeking to build a ''halal'' Internet.Myanmar, however, lifted its heavy controls last year.In Thailand's case, control over the Internet has been closely intertwined with the issue of the monarchy. Thailand's freewheeling society has been anything but stifling for over the years. But King Bhumibol Adulyadej is 84 and Thais are anxious both about succession and the future of the institution over all. Successive governments have stepped up enforcement of the country's lese-majeste laws.Human Rights Watch said in a statement that Wednesday's conviction had ''added to a climate of fear and self-censorship in Thailand's media'' and was a ''new low in Thailand's intolerance of free speech.''This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Online Correction: May 30, 2012, WednesdayThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Earlier versions of this article misstated the rate of uploads onto YouTube as 72 hours every second.

Cyberfraud and Businesses,"To the Editor:''Owners May Not Be Covered When Hackers Wipe Out a Business Bank Account'' (Business Day, June 14) identifies the steps that businesses can take to protect themselves online. Not mentioned is that law enforcement -- one of the first calls small-business owners make when their accounts have been compromised -- is woefully ill equipped to deal with cyberfraud. The legal path is contentious and time-consuming; the court system can be slow, the point of origin of the attack may never be found, and energy is wasted as criminals live to fight another day.Combating modern cyberfraud requires speed, nimbleness and intense smarts. The hackers are smart and getting smarter. Fighting hackers requires a set of tools that focus on prevention: stopping the bad guys before the damage is done.Prevention before the fact rather than legal remedies after is the best path for business to take in combating cybercrime. Companies need to take matters into their own hands.New technologies are deployed every day to smoke out the cybercriminals. Banks are already using these services, which are becoming cheaper and more accessible to small businesses.To win the fight, businesses need to stay a step ahead of the criminals. As the adage says, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound (or in this case, a ton) of cure.S. H. FOSS Jr. St. Louis, June 14, 2012The writer, a former law enforcement official, is chief operating officer of NorseCorp, an Internet company that creates security solutions for companies doing business online.

Going Steady With a Telenovela,"It is not a spoiler alert to say that at some point in the next few weeks on ''Hollywood Heights'' Eddie and Loren will finally get together.Loren Tate is an insecure high school senior with a gift for coffeehouse folk. Eddie Duran is a pop megastar with a soft spot for maudlin lyrics. Everything about ''Hollywood Heights,'' which began last month and is being shown every weeknight into October on Nickelodeon, is intended to ensure that these two incomplete people find in each other what they lack: for Loren confidence and fame, for Eddie a purity of soul that's been mangled by his celebrity. ''Hollywood Heights'' is billed as an English-language telenovela, based on the Mexican show ''Alcanzar una Estrella'' (''To Reach a Star''). There have of course been English-language telenovelas before. They're called soap operas. But unlike Spanish-language originals, which can be convoluted and veer off in unanticipated directions, there are almost no detours on ''Hollywood Heights,'' which boils down to two parallel stories that slowly -- very slowly -- converge in the middle. The show's five-times-a-week schedule means that there's far more television to watch, even though there are far fewer directions for it to go in.Eddie -- played by Cody Longo, who displays the emotional hooligan contradictions of a young Jason Gedrick -- is a dreamer saddled with a gold-digger girlfriend, Chloe (Melissa Ordway); a fun-hating taskmaster of a manager, Jake (Brandon Bell); and millions of fans who won't let him be. Among them is Loren (a dewy Brittany Underwood), who, goaded by her chatterbox best friend, Mel (Ashley Holliday), and her sympathetic bombshell mom, Nora (Jama Williamson), is hoping to get Eddie's attention with her lyrics, which she enters in a songwriting contest and sends to him on Twitter.And it's on the Internet that the two first meet, though its just a Twitter handle Eddie falls for. What makes this telenovela modern, however notionally, is its embrace of technology. Over the first three weeks of the show there's been theft of electronic equipment, Twitter romance, hacking of a school computer, hacking of the hacker's computer, and more.Even though the melodrama, highly structured scripting and stilted camera shots are indebted to the telenovela form, ''Hollywood Heights'' owes the most to the rat-tat-tat rhythms of ''Gilmore Girls.'' Loren and her mom are made in the Rory and Lorelei mold, and Mel, with her ''Toddlers & Tiaras'' jokes, is a worthy, if grating, Lane knockoff. And there's music snobbery, thanks to the all-in-one computer nerd and music geek Adam (Nick Krause), to whom Loren has to defend her idol, Eddie, with the impressively misaligned defense, ''Pitchfork says that his new sound puts him in a class with Girls and Cut Copy.''Like any good telenovela ''Hollywood Heights'' has its share of villains and interlopers: Eddie's father, Max (Carlos Ponce, whose Spanish accent slips out in scenes where he has to do more than just purr or mope), who hopes to end his son's relationship; Tyler (Justin Wilczynski), who maintains an affair with Chloe, and an unhealthy fixation on Eddie; and Don (Grayson McCouch, whose features all gather at the middle of his face, in that Clooney way), Nora's boss, who's a terrible single father and possibly a serial workplace sexual harasser. These one-note characters exist largely to mirror the main players or to make them appear more righteous by contrast.In the spirit of telenovela viewing I set out to watch ''Hollywood Heights'' every night at its appointed time, a relapse to pre-time-shifted viewing habits and an accession to the wishes of programmers, who hope that one story is worth checking in with five times a week.The problems with this plan began with the first broadcast, on June 19. I'd had a bit of insomnia the night before and ended up napping through the premiere. I watched it later that night -- no harm, no foul.But anything could be a disruption -- dinner plans, a concert, a desire to sit somewhere other than in front of the television. Before long, episodes began to pile up in the DVR like incomplete homework assignments. I started grabbing them in batches, two and three at a time, sometimes during meals or during fits of returning weeks of unanswered e-mail.Fortunately telenovelas, with their rote acting and easy-to-follow and heavily repeated plotlines, are ideal background viewing. There was no escaping that while an hour a night made for an untenable time commitment, there was still a warm familiarity to visiting the show in big gulps, more satisfying than the weekly heavy-breathing countdown to new episodes of ''The Newsroom'' or ''Mad Men.'' Whenever the urge struck, there were almost certainly episodes yet to watch. It was comfort TV with narrative soul.What awoke me from that pleasant semi-slumber was, naturally, James Franco.At the end of the show's second week Eddie was being courted for a movie role by a square-seeming executive. Turns out, though, that he was working for Oz, a mad movie mogul, played by Mr. Franco, wealthy enough to hire Eddie for a film but not sensible enough to make use of a comb.Oz hasn't gotten much screen time yet, but when he's there, Mr. Franco chews more than his share of scenery, which turns out to be a necessary strategy. In an environment like this, in which all the performances have soft edges, and no one is steering the scenes too aggressively, acting out is the only sort of acting that gets noticed. His frazzled energy isn't realistic but is instead fantastical and a running commentary on the stiltedness of the rest of the proceedings.After a second appearance, though, Mr. Franco began to feel less like a welcome interloper and more like a prankster, aware of the limitations of those around him and throwing off enough glare to keep the focus firmly on himself. But even Mr. Franco is probably no match for the impending radiance of Loren and Eddie, a sunbeam no Hollywood prankster, real or fictional, can disrupt. "
U.S. Pursuing A Middleman In Web Piracy,"Richard O'Dwyer, an enterprising 24-year-old college student from northern England, has found himself in the middle of a fierce battle between two of America's great exports: Hollywood and the Internet.At issue is a Web site he started that helped visitors find American movies and television shows online. Although the site did not serve up pirated content, American authorities say it provided links to sites that did. The Obama administration is seeking to extradite Mr. O'Dwyer from Britain on criminal charges of copyright infringement. The possible punishment: 10 years in a United States prison.The case is the government's most far-reaching effort so far to crack down on foreigners suspected of breaking American laws. It is unusual because it goes after a middleman, who the authorities say made a fair amount of money by pointing people to pirated content. Mr. O'Dwyer's backers say the prosecution goes too far, squelching his free-speech right to publish links to other Web sites. Mr. O'Dwyer did not respond to requests for an interview, but his mother, Julia, a nurse with the state-run health service, described him as a somewhat reserved young man who grew up playing Super Mario games on his computer and became devoted to coding. He studies interactive media and animation at Sheffield Hallam University and, his mother said, long ago spent the money he had made from his Web site.''He would take his mates to the cinema and pay for them,'' she said.No matter how Mr. O'Dwyer's legal problems are resolved, the case against him reflects the complexities of wrestling with piracy in the digital age.The entertainment industry lobbied Congress hard for the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, which was withdrawn this year after an online uproar led by Web companies and their consumers. Another bill on Capitol Hill would establish intellectual property attaches in American embassies. An international antipiracy treaty, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, or ACTA, was roundly rejected last week by the European Parliament.In the last two years, the Obama administration has closed about 800 Web sites suspected of piracy, including those that stream new Hollywood films. In a widely publicized case, the Justice Department has sought to extradite the operators of Megaupload, a site that let users anonymously share movies and music, on criminal copyright infringement.''There is a problem of copyright infringement on the Internet, and copyright owners have been struggling over how to deal with that,'' said Mark A. Lemley, a Stanford law professor who has represented Internet companies like Google in intellectual property disputes. ''The U.S. government is aggressively getting involved in turning what used to be civil lawsuits into criminal cases. The combination of that and reaching across the border is new.''The extradition case against Mr. O'Dwyer has turned him into something of a cause celebre. Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, is leading a crusade to save him, with an online petition that has gathered over 225,000 signatures worldwide in two weeks.Still, the British home secretary, Theresa May, approved the extradition order in March and said Monday that she would let the order stand. Mr. O'Dwyer has appealed; a hearing in Britain is expected this fall.His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. The federal prosecutors in New York who are handling the case also declined to comment. The criminal complaint against Mr. O'Dwyer is sealed.Mr. O'Dwyer's story began in 2008 when he set up his Web site, TVShack.net, which allowed users to search for and link to other sites, including ones that the authorities say showed pirated movies and shows. Because the domain name was registered in the United States, it fell under the ambit of American law. The government shut down TVShack.net in summer 2010.Mr. O'Dwyer was unbowed. TVShack.net had been growing in popularity, and it made about $230,000 from advertising over the course of two years, federal prosecutors say.''America? They have nothing to do with me,'' Mr. O'Dwyer's mother said he had told her. He reopened his site as TVShack.cc, which he reckoned was beyond the reach of the United States.A few months later came a knock on the door from the British police. A judge ruled that Mr. O'Dwyer would not be prosecuted in Britain. Instead, the United States would seek to extradite him.His mother was stunned. ''This is for fugitives and murderers and terrorists,'' she recalled thinking. ''Richard has never fled the scene of a crime. He has never left the U.K.!''A judge released Mr. O'Dwyer on bail. On his mother's orders, he shut down his site, which makes it difficult to tell how it operated.At the heart of the O'Dwyer case is a question of what to do about Web sites that help users find unlicensed content.According to British court documents examined by The New York Times, the Justice Department argues that Mr. O'Dwyer enabled Internet users to easily avail themselves of copyrighted material by providing links to third-party sites that contained thousands of pirated films and television programs.Prosecutors say that on one day in 2010, his Web site contained links to seven films, described as the ''most popular movies today,'' that were still playing in theaters and had not been authorized for distribution on the Internet.Mr. O'Dwyer, prosecutors suggest, was aware the material was copyrighted. They cite an announcement on TVShack that urged users to be patient with download times because they were ''saving quite a lot of money (especially when putting several visits to the theater or seasons together).''Ted Shapiro, the Motion Picture Association of America's general counsel for Europe, said the fact that Mr. O'Dwyer had not stored illegal material on TVShack itself signaled that he knew how to evade the law.''The fact that the U.S. government is willing to step up and protect content from the film industry and the copyright sector is an amazingly important thing,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''We are talking about protecting things Americans are good at.''Mr. O'Dwyer's backers say his site was effectively a search engine. To prosecute him, they argue, would set a dangerous precedent -- tantamount to holding one person accountable for the acts of another.''Something that lets you find illegal content can also help you find legal content,'' said Mitch Stoltz, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ''When you go after intermediaries, you're going to shut down legal and legitimate speech and commerce and innovation to get at what they perceive as illegal copyright violation.''Peter Decherney, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who wrote the book ''Hollywood's Copyright Wars: From Edison to the Internet,'' said the O'Dwyer case showed how difficult Hollywood has made it for people in other countries to consume American entertainment online.Sites like Netflix, Hulu and iTunes have limited offerings overseas, if any. The demand for American entertainment drives a lucrative underground economy of pirated movies and television shows.''In many other countries, unauthorized distribution is the only form of online distribution,'' said Mr. Decherney, ''and consumers will continue to make Robin Hoods out of anyone who can help them get to media online.''This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: .

Internet Pirates Will Always Win,"A technology columnist for The New York Times.STOPPING online piracy is like playing the world's largest game of Whac-A-Mole.Hit one, countless others appear. Quickly. And the mallet is heavy and slow.Take as an example YouTube, where the Recording Industry Association of America almost rules with an iron fist, but doesn't, because of deceptions like the one involving a cat.YouTube, which is owned by Google, offers a free tool to the movie studios and television networks called Content ID. When a studio legitimately uploads a clip from a copyrighted film to YouTube, the Google tool automatically finds and blocks copies of the product. To get around this roadblock, some YouTube users started placing copyrighted videos inside a still photo of a cat that appears to be watching an old JVC television set. The Content ID algorithm has a difficult time seeing that the video is violating any copyright rules; it just sees a cat watching TV.Sure, it's annoying for those who want to watch the video, but it works. (Obviously, it's more than annoying for the company whose product is being pirated.)Then there are those -- possibly tens of millions of users, actually -- who engage in peer-to-peer file-sharing on the sites using the BitTorrent protocol.Earlier this year, after months of legal wrangling, authorities in a number of countries won an injunction against the Pirate Bay, probably the largest and most famous BitTorrent piracy site on the Web. The order blocked people from entering the site.In retaliation, the Pirate Bay wrapped up the code that runs its entire Web site, and offered it as a free downloadable file for anyone to copy and install on their own servers. People began setting up hundreds of new versions of the site, and the piracy continues unabated.Thus, whacking one big mole created hundreds of smaller ones.Although the recording industries might believe they're winning the fight, the Pirate Bay and others are continually one step ahead. In March, a Pirate Bay collaborator, who goes by the online name Mr. Spock, announced in a blog post that the team hoped to build drones that would float in the air and allow people to download movies and music through wireless radio transmitters.''This way our machines will have to be shut down with aeroplanes in order to shut down the system,'' Mr. Spock posted on the site. ''A real act of war.'' Some BitTorrent sites have also discussed storing servers in secure bank vaults. Message boards on the Web devoted to piracy have in the past raised the idea that the Pirate Bay has Web servers stored underwater.''Piracy won't go away,'' said Ernesto Van Der Sar, editor of Torrent Freak, a site that reports on copyright and piracy news. ''They've tried for years and they'll keep on trying, but it won't go away.'' Mr. Van Der Sar said companies should stop trying to fight piracy and start experimenting with new ways to distribute content that is inevitably going to be pirated anyway.According to Torrent Freak, the top pirated TV shows are downloaded several million times a week. Unauthorized movies, music, e-books, software, pornography, comics, photos and video games are watched, read and listened to via these piracy sites millions of times a day.The copyright holders believe new laws will stop this type of piracy. But many others believe any laws will just push people to find creative new ways of getting the content they want.''There's a clearly established relationship between the legal availability of material online and copyright infringement; it's an inverse relationship,'' said Holmes Wilson, co-director of Fight for the Future, a nonprofit technology organization that is trying to stop new piracy laws from disrupting the Internet. ''The most downloaded television shows on the Pirate Bay are the ones that are not legally available online.''The hit HBO show ''Game of Thrones'' is a quintessential example of this. The show is sometimes downloaded illegally more times each week than it is watched on cable television. But even if HBO put the shows online, the price it could charge would still pale in comparison to the money it makes through cable operators. Mr. Wilson believes that the big media companies don't really want to solve the piracy problem.''If every TV show was offered at a fair price to everyone in the world, there would definitely be much less copyright infringement,'' he said. ''But because of the monopoly power of the cable companies and content creators, they might actually make less money.''The way people download unauthorized content is changing. In the early days of music piracy, people transferred songs to their home or work computers. Now, with cloud-based sites, like Wuala, uTorrent and Tribler, people stream movies and music from third-party storage facilities, often to mobile devices and TV's. Some of these cloud-based Web sites allow people to set up automatic downloads of new shows the moment they are uploaded to piracy sites. It's like piracy-on-demand. And it will be much harder to trace and to stop.It is only going to get worse. Piracy has started to move beyond the Internet and media and into the physical world. People on the fringes of tech, often early adopters of new devices and gadgets, are now working with 3-D printers that can churn out actual physical objects. Say you need a wall hook or want to replace a bit of hardware that fell off your luggage. You can download a file and ''print'' these objects with printers that spray layers of plastic, metal or ceramics into shapes.And people are beginning to share files that contain the schematics for physical objects on these BitTorrent sites. Although 3-D printing is still in its infancy, it is soon expected to become as pervasive as illegal music downloading was in the late 1990s.Content owners will find themselves stuck behind ancient legal walls when trying to stop people from downloading objects online as copyright laws do not apply to standard physical objects deemed ''noncreative.''In the arcade version of Whac-A-Mole, the game eventually ends -- often when the player loses. In the piracy arms-race version, there doesn't seem to be a conclusion. Sooner or later, the people who still believe they can hit the moles with their slow mallets might realize that their time would be better spent playing an entirely different game. "
"Our Extinction, Via the Internet","The future according to Tom Hanks: post-apocalyptic, with electricity rationed and rebels communicating via antique radios. The future according to the ''CSI'' creator Anthony Zuiker: tenuous, with the world about to fall victim to a vast online fraud.Could it be that men with deep roots in old media, like movies and television, are more likely to be cybercontrarians when they produce for the Web? To Mr. Hanks's ''Electric City'' and Mr. Zuiker's coming ''Cybergeddon'' we can now add ''H+,'' an online series whose producers include the Hollywood veteran Bryan Singer (''The Usual Suspects,'' ''X-Men''). In ''H+'' death comes not with a bang but with an error message: the Internet literally makes our brains shut down. Written by John Cabrera (known primarily as an actor in ''Gilmore Girls'') and Cosimo De Tommaso, and directed by Stewart Hendler (''Sorority Row''), it's an ambitious project, consisting of 48 three-to-six-minute episodes with reasonably solid production values and competent acting, at least for an online series.Unfortunately, based on 20 episodes made available for review (the series begins on Wednesday on YouTube and will conclude in January), that ambition doesn't carry through to the storytelling, which has the dull familiarity and repetitiveness of low-grade cable-TV science fiction. It's possible that by Episode 48 a big idea or some intriguing twists will emerge, but they may not warrant three or four hours of staring into your laptop or phone.In its early going the story jumps back and forth among at least seven timelines: these include a Finnish cop chasing hackers ''seven years before it happened''; a techie couple hiring a surrogate mother five months before; a group of survivors at the San Francisco airport during and just after; and a priest in the Italian countryside two years later.''It'' involves the extinction of much of the human race because of a malfunction in the popular brain implants that have given people direct neural access to the Internet, but how and why ''it'' happened remain murky. There are hints of evil corporate interests and technological hubris, and the mass kill-off doesn't end the mystery.(Also mysterious: even with the implants, people must move their hands around in the air to navigate the Internet. This doesn't seem very likely, but it's a way to inject some action into otherwise inert, dialogue-heavy scenes.)''H+'' is intended as a collagelike work, in which the episodes can be watched in whatever order the viewer prefers (though presumably the answers to the mystery, if they're coming, should be saved for last). If you wanted to get fancy, you could argue that its format subordinates traditional storytelling values to the pleasures of the puzzle or the game and invokes postmodern novelists and ''Last Year at Marienbad.'' But you'd just end up making a point about how mundane and humorless this sort of project can be. "
Fighting Web Piracy,"To the Editor:''Internet Pirates Will Always Win'' (news analysis, Sunday Review, Aug. 5) argues that the only way to deal with the growing problem of online piracy is to throw up our collective hands and accept theft as a fact of life. But while copyright infringement is indeed a difficult and complicated issue, the stakes are too high to ignore it. The livelihoods of too many creators of our favorite movies, TV shows and songs are at stake. How can we expect these content providers to continue making great art -- or news organizations like The New York Times to produce in-depth and hard-hitting reporting -- if we don't value their work enough to protect it from online theft?The Times has a long and admirable history of vigilantly protecting the creative product of its reporters, recognizing the basic principle that stealing is just plain wrong, even if it can be done electronically or anonymously.In an ever-changing technological environment, we must continue looking for innovative ways to tackle the problem of copyright infringement while also protecting an Internet that works for everyone. It's a tall order, but worth the fight.HENRY HOBERMAN Senior Exec. V.P. and General Counsel Motion Picture Association of America Washington, Aug. 7, 2012 "
"Under Copyright Pressure, Google to Alter Search Results","6:58 p.m. | Updated Big media companies won a battle in the fight to combat online piracy on Friday when Google said it would alter its search algorithms to favor Web sites that offered legitimate copyrighted movies, music and television.Google said that beginning next week its algorithms would take into account the number of valid copyright removal notices Web sites have received. Web sites with multiple, valid complaints about copyright infringement may appear lower in Google search results.""This ranking change should help users find legitimate, quality sources of content more easily - whether it's a song previewed on NPR's music Web site, a TV show on Hulu or new music streamed from Spotify,"" Amit Singhal, Google's senior vice president of engineering, wrote in a company blog post.The entertainment industry, which has for years pressured Google and other Internet sites to act against online piracy, applauded the move.""We are optimistic that Google's actions will help steer consumers to the myriad legitimate ways for them to access movies and TV shows online,"" Michael O'Leary, a senior executive vice president for the Motion Picture Association of America, said in a statement.Cary Sherman, chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, also commended Google's move. ""Google has signaled a new willingness to value the rights of creators,"" he said in a statement.But the two men expressed caution and urged Google to carry out the change with the vigor it adopted in combating pirated videos on YouTube, which Google owns.""The devil is always in the details,"" Mr. O'Leary said. While Mr. Sherman added, similarly, that changing the search algorithm ""is not the only approach and of course, the details of implementation will matter.""The announcement comes just over six months after a heated battle between big media companies and technology companies, who were sparring over proposed legislation intended to crack down on pirated online content, particularly by rogue foreign Web sites.In January, media companies like Viacom, Time Warner and the Walt Disney Company backed two antipiracy bills, one in the Senate and the other in the House of Representatives, while Internet activists and companies like Google and Facebook argued the bills would hinder Internet freedom. Buoyed by a huge online grass-roots movement, and aided by Wikipedia's going black for a day in protest, the bills quickly died.That tension has decreased somewhat as media companies have met with Silicon Valley executives over how to solve the problem to everyone's satisfaction.Google said it would not remove pages from copyright-infringing Web sites from its search engine unless it received a valid copyright removal notice from the rights' owner. ""Only copyright holders know if something is authorized, and only courts can decide if a copyright has been infringed,"" Mr. Singhal said.Google said it had received copyright removal requests for over 4.3 million Web addresses in the last 30 days, according to the company's transparency report. That is more than it received in all of 2009. "
WikiLeaks Stirs Global Fears on Antiterrorist Software,"WASHINGTON -- A new release of stolen corporate e-mails by WikiLeaks has set off a flurry of concern and speculation around the world about a counterterrorist software program called TrapWire, which analyzes images from surveillance cameras and other data to try to identify terrorists planning attacks.''U.S. government is secretly spying on EVERYONE using civilian security cameras, say WikiLeaks,'' read a headline on Monday at the British newspaper Web site Mail Online. The article included a photograph from the movie ''The Bourne Identity.'' PC Magazine described TrapWire as ''a secret, comprehensive U.S. surveillance effort.''Though TrapWire Inc., the Virginia company that sells the software, would not comment on Monday, the reports appear to be wildly exaggerated. TrapWire was tried out on 15 surveillance cameras in Washington and Seattle by the Homeland Security Department, but officials said it ended the trial last year because it did not seem promising. A claim in the leaked e-mails that 500 cameras in the New York subway were linked to TrapWire is false, said Paul J. Browne, the New York Police Department's chief spokesman. ''We don't use TrapWire.''TrapWire is discussed in dozens of e-mails from Stratfor Global Intelligence, a private security firm in Austin, Tex., that were posted online last week by WikiLeaks. The e-mails were part of a large cache captured late last year and early this year by hackers associated with the loose-knit international collective called Anonymous, which gave the e-mails to WikiLeaks.The WkiLeaks Web site has been shut down by unidentified hackers in recent days, leading to speculation that it might be retaliation for the e-mail leaks.TrapWire was originally developed in 2004 by the Abraxas Corporation, which was founded by several former C.I.A. employees. It later spun off TrapWire, but the C.I.A. connection, along with the company's vague but impressive descriptions of the program's capabilities, appears to have fueled the furor on the Web that it was a sort of automated Big Brother.TrapWire's marketing materials say it uses video cameras and observations by security guards to develop a 10-point description of people near a potential terrorist target and an eight-point description of vehicles. It also records ''potential surveillance activity, such as photographing, measuring and signaling,'' combining in a TrapWire database ''this human-entered data with information collected by sensors.''If the same person or car is picked up in multiple locations engaging in suspicious behavior, the software is supposed to make the connection. But a privacy statement on the TrapWire Web site says the software does not capture ''personal information.''Jay Stanley, who studies threats to privacy at the American Civil Liberties Union, said many companies had tried to use technology ''to find terrorist plots in an ocean of information about everyday activities.''''But it's extremely difficult, and probably impossible, to distinguish the one-in-a-billion terrorist from innocent people doing ordinary things like taking pictures,'' Mr. Stanley said, adding that the current fears demonstrate why the government should publicly address concerns about surveillance before adopting new technologies.''We live in a democracy,'' he said, ''and that's what security agencies are here to protect.''

Russia: Hackers Derail Web Site Of Court That Jailed Punk Band,"MOSCOW - Hackers briefly seized control Monday of the Web site of the Moscow district court that sentenced three members of the feminist protest band Pussy Riot to two years in a penal colony last week.For three hours on Tuesday morning, Khamovnichesky Court's usually static Web site was enlivened with a recording of the new Pussy Riot song, ""Putin Is Lighting the Fires of Revolution,"" and an embedded copy of a music video for a song called ""Hate,"" by the Bulgarian gay icon Azis. The video was described as ""a rather sleazy and erotic gay clip,"" by the Russian news site Gazeta.ru. A headline across the top of the site read, ""Putin's Thieving Gang Is Robbing Our Country! Wake Up, Comrades!""The site's navigation tabs were altered, and other text was added to display slogans including, ""Free Pussy Riot,"" and, ""Judges - I'd have executed them all."" A video report on the hacking by the Russian business news channel RBC showed a message from the hackers in which they claimed to be part of ""American Anonymous,"" referring to a loose collective of hackers (not usually identified as American) known for revenge attacks on the Web sites of organizations and states perceived as enemies of free speech.According to a BBC News report, the hackers also wrote: ""We don't forget and we don't forgive,"" and, ""The justice system has to be transparent.""The hackers were apparently encouraged to attack the site early on Tuesday by an anonymous user of the Web forum 2ch.so - the Russian equivalent of the message board 4chan. At 6:17 a.m., a message was posted on the board with the login and password information needed to access the Web site's back end, along with a username and password that granted access to the court's e-mail in-box.Within minutes, gleeful 2ch users began posting screen shots of their progress in defacing the hacked Web site and discussing what video might be the most (in)appropriate to display.Soon, a Twitter account linked to the Russian arm of Anonymous posted a link to archived copies of messages apparently taken from one of the court's e-mail in-boxes. An analysis of the archive by the Moscow bureau of The New York Times shows that the vast majority of the 487 messages were e-mails sent to the court from users of the Web site Change.org. Last week, the site promised to deliver a ""Free Pussy Riot!"" petition signed by more than 136,000 people to the court and to officials including Russian President Vladimir V. Putin.Officials regained control of the site later on Tuesday, and Darya Lyakh, a spokeswoman for the court, told the Russian news agency Interfax that the hacking had been carried out ""by people with bad imaginations.""One of Pussy Riot's lawyers, Mark Feygin, wrote on Twitter, ""Of course I do not approve of hacking attacks, but cannot hide genuine admiration for the daredevils from Anonymous.

Struggling to Recover From a Cyberattack,"IN 2006, Peter Justen, a serial entrepreneur, founded MyBizHomepage, an online service that connected to companies' QuickBooks accounting software to help business owners monitor their financial metrics. When the site went live in 2008, it attracted significant media attention. It was free to use and the company planned to make money through advertising, a recipe that appealed to Mr. Justen's investors, who valued the company at $100 million based on the vast potential they perceived.THE CHALLENGE Rebuilding. After Mr. Justen fired his chief technology officer, strange things started happening at MyBizHomepage, including a series of cyberattacks that brought down the company's software.THE BACKGROUND Mr. Justen started MyBizHomepage in Middleburg, Va., five years after he and his co-founders had sold Pace Financial Network to TD Ameritrade, the online brokerage firm. Looking for a new challenge, Mr. Justen, a self-described numbers guy, began researching whether there was a need among small-business owners for help in understanding the financial ratios that drive their companies. He quickly determined there was. He also knew that lots of small businesses used QuickBooks to run their financials. ''My idea,'' Mr. Justen said, ''was to simplify things for business owners to give them an easy way to see the problems and opportunities in the numbers of their business.'' Mr. Justen and a team of programmers spent the next two years working on the prototype for MyBizHomepage, which would use a series of algorithms to analyze data culled from QuickBooks and create financial performance indicators that would be displayed as a financial dashboard for each business. One popular feature, for example, monitored a company's accounts-receivable balance. When the balance exceeded a set threshold, the software would send an alert. ''The idea was that by checking in on their key numbers every day, a business owner could see where he was headed,'' Mr. Justen said.To help fuel the company's growth, Mr. Justen turned to several investors to raise capital. They included Joe Silbaugh, a real estate developer, and Bryan Elicker, a friend of Mr. Silbaugh's who sold a coffin company in 2007. In 2008, Mr. Justen and his investors, who also served on his board, faced an interesting decision: They had a tentative offer to sell the company for a price close to their own valuation. But Mr. Justen and his board decided not to sell. ''We hadn't yet tapped the potential of the product, especially among a global audience,'' he said, noting that the company had barely 6,000 customers using the system at the time.Apparently the decision not to sell did not sit well with the company's chief technology officer. Mr. Justen said he was soon told that the officer, a longtime associate, had teamed up with two other senior officers in the company in an effort to start a competing company. Mr. Justen said he learned of the new venture from one of his investors who had been approached about joining the group. Furious, Mr. Justen fired the chief technology officer and his cohort, and instructed his lawyer to send them a cease-and-desist letter. That was when the real trouble began. After Mr. Justen fired his chief technology officer, the MyBizHomepage began to crash regularly. Mr. Justen and his board members also found that someone had hacked into their personal e-mail and Facebook accounts and had begun sending people on their contact list messages impugning the ethics of Mr. Justen and the board members. The messages claimed that MyBizHomepage was defrauding investors, a claim that was repeated on several Web sites. ''It hurts your reputation when someone Googles your name and finds that,'' said Mr. Silbaugh, who had invested more than $1 million in MyBizHomepage.When Mr. Justen contacted authorities about the attacks and explained what he thought was happening, he said he learned something else about his former chief technology officer: there was little, if any, official proof that he existed. Mr. Justen said he knew that the officer was unusual, that he had been arrested on an outstanding warrant after being pulled over on suspicion of driving with a fake license plate. But Mr. Justen said he did not realize that the chief technology officer had no official identity: no driver's license, no credit cards, no tax returns. The chief technology officer apparently had been living off the grid, which made tracking him down almost impossible even with the help of the authorities.Mr. Justen said he concluded that the chief technology officer had built multiple ''backdoor'' entrances into the MyBizHomepage software and had compromised the company's backup data. It became clear that the site would need to be shut down indefinitely, essentially putting the company out of business.THE OPTIONS Given the security breaches and the destruction of the backup copies of the code, Mr. Justen said he knew that he would have to start from scratch if he wanted the company to continue. But he was reluctant to go back to his original investors for more money, and he knew he would have a hard time raising capital after the 2008 credit crisis. He considered having the company declare bankruptcy, but he knew that meant his investors would lose everything.He also struggled with how public to make what had happened, particularly given that his customers had trusted him with delicate information. They might not be eager to re-enlist, knowing the service had been hacked by an insider. While he had been working with authorities to track down his former chief technology officer, Mr. Justen also considered his legal options if the officer were located.Finally, Mr. Justen, who had a family to support, considered simply shutting the doors to the business and walking away for good.WHAT OTHERS SAY Norm Brodsky, a serial entrepreneur and columnist for Inc. magazine in New York City: ''Mr. Justen should focus on restructuring or starting a new company using his intellectual property. Bankruptcy won't help. His only asset is his software, which they will just auction off and sell to the highest bidder. He should also be honest about how he played a role in what went wrong. Why didn't he run a background check on his C.T.O.? And why did he fire him without first putting a plan in place to protect the software? He can't afford to make those mistakes again. I always say you should trust everyone but also keep your eyes open.''Mark Davis, senior director at the White House Writers Group, a consulting company in Washington, and the co-author of ''Digital Assassination,'' a book on cyberterrorism: ''Mr. Justen has no choice but to go public with an apology and an explanation. He should put up a YouTube video explaining what happened and what action steps they are taking to rectify the situation.''Joy R. Butler, a business and entertainment lawyer in Washington who wrote ''The Cyber Citizen's Guide Through the Legal Jungle'': ''Mr. Justen and his company have limited legal options going forward unless they can locate the C.T.O. The company might then seek redress by suing for breach of any noncompete or confidentiality provisions that may have been in the former C.T.O.'s employment agreement.''John Mutch, chief executive of BeyondTrust, a global provider of security software: ''Unfortunately for Mr. Justen, he probably needed to lock the system down before firing his C.T.O. If he decides to go forward, he should consider building role-based security around his company's critical assets that limits who can access what.''THE RESULTS Offer your thoughts on Mr. Justen's decision on the You're the Boss blog at nytimes.com/boss. Next week, on the blog and in this space, we will explain how the company is doing. "
Starting Over After Cyberattack,"A case study we've just published explains the challenges faced by Peter Justen, chief executive of MyBizHomepage, a Middleburg, Va., provider of business accounting software. The business was shut down by a wave of cyber attacks that apparently came from a disgruntled former employee.Mr. Justen founded the company in 2006 to give small-business owners an easy way to view their financials and isolate important metrics. A serial entrepreneur, Mr. Justen raised several million dollars from investors to start the company, which its investors valued at $100 million at its peak in 2008. At about that time, Mr. Justen and his board, seeing tremendous growth opportunity for the business, especially in international markets, turned down an offer to buy the company. Mr. Justen believes the decision not to sell rankled the company's chief technology officer, who decided to try to form a competing software company. Upon learning of his technology officer's action, Mr. Justen says he fired him. A series of cyber attacks against the MyBizHomepage Web site followed and essentially shut the company down. You can read the case study to learn the details.We asked a business owner and several experts in the realm of digital law and security what they thought Mr. Justen should do to save his company. Please tell us what you think in the comments section below, and next week, we'll follow up with another blog post that will explain what Mr. Justen decided to do.Norm Brodsky, a serial entrepreneur and columnist for Inc. magazine in New York City: ""Mr. Justen should focus on restructuring or starting a new company using his intellectual property.

On the other hand, he does need to let his customers know about the fact that there was a security breach or the company could face legal ramifications itself.""John Mutch, chief executive of BeyondTrust, a global provider of security software: ""I think the first wave of security was focused on external threats.

"Hackers Post ID Numbers for Apple Devices, Claiming They Are From F.B.I.","8:00 p.m. | Updated Hackers released a file that they said contained a million identification numbers for Apple mobile devices, claiming that they had obtained it by hacking into the computer of an F.B.I. agent. The F.B.I. said it had no evidence that this was true.The hacking group, known as AntiSec - a subset of the loose hacking collective known as Anonymous - posted copies of the file on Sunday and claimed to have a total of 12 million numbers for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices, along with some phone numbers and other personal data on their owners. They said their goal in releasing a slice of the data was to prove that the F.B.I. used device information to track people. While the leaked identification numbers appeared to be real, security experts said the release posed little risk. They said that without more information on the devices' owners - like e-mail addresses or date of birth - it would be hard for someone to use the numbers to do harm.And the actual source of the file was not clear. The F.B.I. said in a statement that ""at this time there is no evidence indicating that an F.B.I. laptop was compromised or that the F.B.I. either sought or obtained this data.""The F.B.I. has been a frequent target of so-called hacktivists, hackers who attack for political causes rather than for profit. In February, Anonymous hackers intercepted a call between the bureau and Scotland Yard. But the frequency of such attacks tapered off after several members of Anonymous and a spinoff group, LulzSec, were arrested in March.Apple's unique device identifiers - known as U.D.I.D.'s - are 40-character strings of letters and numbers assigned to Apple devices. Last year, Aldo Cortesi, a New Zealand security researcher, demonstrated how in some cases U.D.I.D.'s could be used in combination with other data to connect devices to their owners' online user names, e-mail addresses, locations and even Facebook profiles.""A U.D.I.D. is just a jumble of digits,"" said Jim Fenton, the chief security officer of OneID. ""It is only powerful when it is aggregated with other information.""Security experts said the identification numbers appeared legitimate, and one number in the file matched that of a New York Times employee's iPad. ""The structure and format of the data indicates this is a real breach,"" said Rob Rachwald, director of security at Imperva, a computer security firm. An Apple spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.The hackers released only U.D.I.D.'s, a separate Apple-specific identifier and the device names that owners give their devices, like ""Lori's iPad."" Only a few identifiers were tied to e-mail addresses, apparently because the device's owner chose to use an e-mail address when naming it.Apple stopped letting app developers take advantage of device identifiers last year, to make it harder for marketers to track its customers as they moved from app to app.The hackers claimed to have obtained the file from the computer of Christopher K. Stangl, a supervisory agent of the F.B.I.'s Cyber Action Team. In 2009, Mr. Stangl appeared in a Facebook promotional video titled ""Wanted by the FBI: Cyber Security Experts"" that encouraged hackers to get involved with the F.B.I.He was also one of 44 law enforcement agents invited to participate in the F.B.I.-Scotland Yard conference call that hackers intercepted.But security experts said the file could have come from a number of places.""There are a million ways this could have happened,"" said Marcus Carey, a researcher at Rapid7. ""Apple could have been breached. AT&T could have been breached. A video game maker could have been breached. The F.B.I. could have obtained the file while doing forensics on another data breach.""In their statement, the hackers said they would not grant any interviews about the breach until a reporter for Gawker, Adrian Chen, posed for his employer's site, for a full day, in a ballet tutu with a shoe on his head.On Tuesday evening, Mr. Chen complied.

Series on Cyberterrorism Is at Home on the Web,"When you've created ''CSI,'' you don't have a lot left to prove in the entertainment business. But Anthony E. Zuiker isn't resting on his television laurels. He writes multiplatform ''digi-novels'' and is a partner in a YouTube channel, BlackBoxTV, that has more than 333,000 subscribers.Now Mr. Zuiker is taking his biggest step so far into new media with ''Cybergeddon,'' a nine-part series that will be released, beginning on Tuesday, on the Yahoo! Screen video site. An executive producer, along with Matthew Weinberg and Bill O'Dowd, Mr. Zuiker is calling the video -- which should total about 95 minutes and be available in 10 languages -- a ''motion picture event'' distributed in installments directly to Yahoo's huge worldwide audience, should that audience happen to find it. (It has its own tab at the top of the Yahoo! Screen home page.)Judging from the first three installments, ''event'' might be an optimistic description of ''Cybergeddon,'' but ''better than your average TV-movie thriller'' probably fits. Written by Miles Chapman (''Roadhouse 2: Last Call'') and directed by Diego Velasco (''The Zero Hour''), it would look at home on the Syfy or USA channels and has a network star, Missy Peregrym of the ABC series ''Rookie Blue.''Mr. Zuiker's show is a conspiracy tale, as was Yahoo's first original drama, the animated series ''Electric City,'' created by Tom Hanks, which went up in July. But Mr. Hanks's was set in a dreamy, postapocalyptic steam-punk future.''Cybergeddon'' is very much in the here and now, positing a malevolent European criminal mastermind (Olivier Martinez, Diane Lane's lust object in ''Unfaithful''), who begins a seemingly random series of digital attacks: the controls of a Los Angeles water plant, the accounts of a Hong Kong bank.Ms. Peregrym plays a coldly ambitious F.B.I. agent who spots the pattern but, before the first 10-minute episode ends, has been framed and arrested for cyberterrorism herself. This is not a show in which you want to sweat the plot details.This all happens quickly, as Mr. Chapman and Mr. Velasco, operating under standard Web video rules, squeeze more twists into each 10-to-11-minute episode than it should have to bear, a feat accomplished with the help of rat-a-tat dialogue out of an old movie serial. (''Agent Jocelyn! You're under arrest on three counts of cyberterrorism!'' ''Are you kidding me?'')Another sign that we're online: Ms. Peregrym's cleavage plays a larger role per minute than it does in prime time on ''Rookie Blue.''Ms. Peregrym, whose distinguishing characteristics as an actress are her sad eyes and her athleticism, makes a credible action hero but is perhaps not as convincing a tech genius. Helping Agent Jocelyn in her quest to clear her name and stop the cyberattacks is a jailed hacker named Rabbit, amusingly played by the Australian actor Kick Gurry.It would be wrong to leave a discussion of ''Cybergeddon'' without mentioning the commercial impediments to unfettered creativity in online drama. Among the logos prominently displayed in the opening credits is that of the digital-security company Symantec, which served as a consultant to the production but also has a significant role in the story.This isn't the kind of product placement in which a company's car or navigation system is used by the heroine -- this is the kind in which a sponsor is turned into a heroic character.Producers can make all the excuses they want, but that kind of synergy puts a hard cap on how seriously their work can be taken.

"Internet Law In Philippines Takes Effect, Raising Fears","MANILA -- A new Internet law that took effect in the Philippines on Wednesday could lead to imprisonment for common activities like sharing Facebook and Twitter posts, critics say.The new law, the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, which was signed by President Benigno S. Aquino III on Sept. 12, sets penalties for several computer-related crimes, including child pornography, identity theft, online fraud and illegally accessing computer networks.But critics are concerned about the law's provisions related to libel, which in the Philippines is a criminal offense that can result in imprisonment. Harry S. Roque, president of Media Defense South East Asia, an advocacy organization, said the law applied the existing legal definition of libel to the online activities of individuals, meaning that if a comment on Facebook or Twitter were deemed libelous, the writer of the item and those who shared it could be prosecuted.''It exposes Internet users to prosecution,'' said Mr. Roque, a law professor at the University of the Philippines. ''You can be sued. You can be forced to post a bond. You will need to get a lawyer. You can imagine the mayhem this can cause.''The Philippines has been a leader in Internet freedom,'' Mr. Roque continued. ''This law makes the Philippines at par with other oppressive regimes in Southeast Asia that imprison and intimidate bloggers.''There has been considerable public outcry against the law in the weeks leading up to its implementation. Hackers have attacked the Web sites of the president, both houses of Congress and a variety of government agencies. On Wednesday, some Facebook users replaced their profile pictures with black silhouettes and bloggers created blank posts to protest the law, while others took to the streets, staging a demonstration in front of the Supreme Court.Some government offices have also struggled with the new law. ''Foul words against our police officers can be used as evidence now to file a case against you in a court of law,'' a post by the Philippine National Police on its official Facebook page read Monday, in response to a negative comment by a visitor to the site. Police officials later apologized and removed the post.Philippine senators who voted for the law, many of whom are up for re-election next year, have been scrambling to address critics' concerns. Some senators have had to admit that they did not actually read the law before voting for its passage. Senator Francis G. Escudero acknowledged on Tuesday on his Web site that he had not read the provision of the law dealing with online libel, but said he had introduced a bill to decriminalize libel.Senator Edgardo J. Angara, who voted for the new law, said Wednesday that he supported amending the legislation.''Not all the laws that we pass are perfect,'' Mr. Angara told reporters. ''At least in this case we are responsive.''A spokesman for Mr. Aquino sought Wednesday to calm public fears after the barrage of protests and an announcement by Justice Secretary Leila de Lima that her department would be hiring 150 investigators to enforce the new law.''Our Constitution is clear and uncompromising in the civil liberties it guarantees all our people,'' said the spokesman, Edwin Lacierda. ''As the basic law, its guarantees cannot, and will not, be diminished or reduced by any law passed by Congress.''At least nine petitions have been filed with the Supreme Court seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent the prosecution of anyone under the law. The court has said it will rule on the matter next week.In a study released before the law was passed, the American group Freedom House ranked the Philippines sixth in the world in terms of Internet freedom. "
High Court in Philippines Suspends Contentious Internet Law,"MANILA -- The Supreme Court of the Philippines suspended a new Internet law on Tuesday that critics had said could lead to imprisonment for sharing posts on social media.''We respect and will abide by it,'' Justice Secretary Leila de Lima wrote in a text message to reporters on Tuesday, referring to the court's unanimous decision to suspend enforcement of the law for 120 days. ''Our advocacy for a safe cyberspace and interdiction of organized crime will continue.''Fifteen petitions were filed with the court opposing the law, the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, which took effect Oct. 3. A spokeswoman for the high court, Maria Victoria Gleoresty Guerra, said the government had 10 days to file an initial response to the petitions. Oral arguments are scheduled for Jan. 15, she said.The law establishes penalties for various computer-related crimes, including child pornography, identity theft, online fraud and illegally accessing computer networks. It also makes online libel punishable by imprisonment, which critics said could result in the criminalization of common activities like sharing Facebook and Twitter posts.Critics also said that the law gave the government wide-ranging powers to amass information on Internet users and to block Web sites. The passage of the law was followed by a public outcry, including street protests, social media campaigns and the hacking of government Web sites.Senator Edgardo J. Angara, the author of the legislation in the Senate, said he welcomed the suspension so that the law could be publicly debated and better understood.''What the Cybercrime Prevention Act does is only to regulate socially destructive acts,'' Mr. Angara said, ''because you cannot enjoy your right fully and confidently if others have an equal right to interfere with your right.''Others pledged to fight until the law is repealed or struck down by the Supreme Court.''A temporary restraining order, unanimously issued, is the first victory in our battle to defend our freedom and right of expression,'' said Senator Teofisto D. Guingona III, who voted against the measure. ''For a court to issue a T.R.O. unanimously is a strong message of its belief that the dangers and fears of the people are real and must be addressed.''Human Rights Watch called Tuesday for the high court to strike down the law and for any new Internet legislation to be debated openly.''All provisions in Philippine law that allow for imprisonment for peaceful expression should be repealed,'' said Brad Adams, the organization's Asia director.

Man Claiming Facebook Ownership Faces Fraud Case,"In 2010, a New York entrepreneur made an explosive legal claim: An agreement that he had with Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, entitled him to a major stake in the social-networking giant.Mr. Zuckerberg staunchly denied the allegation, and his lawyers insisted that the entrepreneur, Paul Ceglia, was a scam artist.On Friday, federal authorities sided with Mr. Zuckerberg, arresting Mr. Ceglia and charging him with a multibillion dollar scheme to defraud Facebook. Prosecutors say that Mr. Ceglia, 39, of Wellsville, N.Y., filed a sham federal lawsuit claiming to have been promised a 50 percent share of Facebook in 2003, and then doctored, fabricated and destroyed evidence to support his allegations.""Ceglia's alleged conduct not only constitutes a massive fraud attempt, but also an attempted corruption of our legal system through the manufacture of false evidence,"" said Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. ""Dressing up a fraud as a lawsuit does not immunize you from prosecution.""Mr. Ceglia is expected to make an appearance in federal court in Buffalo on Friday afternoon. His lawyer, Dean Boland, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.The improbable claims made by Mr. Ceglia received outsized attention in part because it came at around the same time as the release of ""The Social Network,"" the Academy Award-winning film that told the tale of Mr. Zuckerberg's legal battle with his Harvard schoolmates, the Winklevoss twins, over the origins of Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg paid the Winklevosses at least $65 million to settle their case.Since the lawsuit was first filed, Facebook's lawyers have raised questions about Mr. Ceglia's credibility. In 1997, he pleaded guilty to possessing hallucinogenic mushrooms. And in 2010, the New York State attorney general criminally charged him with defrauding customers in a now-defunct wood pellet manufacturing business that he had run with his wife.Questions are now also being raised about the lawyers that represented Mr. Ceglia and kept his case alive for two years.In his original complaint, filed in 2010, Mr. Ceglia was represented by Paul Argentieri, a sole practitioner in upstate New York. An amended lawsuit was filed in April 2011 by Robert W. Brownlie of DLA Piper, the world's largest law firm, and Dennis C. Vacco, a former New York attorney general now in private practice at Lippes Mathias Wexler Friedman in Buffalo.In 2011, Mr. Brownlie of DLA Piper declined a request by The New York Times to produce the original documents backing his client's legal claims. ""That will come out during the course of litigation,"" Mr. Brownlie said. ""Anyone who claims this case is fraudulent and brought by a scam artist will come to regret those claims.""Yet court records indicate that another law firm, Kasowitz Benson Friedman & Torres, had been hired by Mr. Ceglia before DLA Piper and Lippes Mathias becoming involved. Kasowitz Benson withdrew from the case and put DLA Piper and Lippes Mathias on notice that it had determined that the purported contract was a fraud.Mr. Brownlie and Mr. Vacco later withdrew from the case. They did not return calls and e-mails seeking comment.Mr. Ceglia's alleged plot dates back to 2003, when Mr. Zuckerberg was a student at Harvard University. Mr. Ceglia had placed an advertisement on Craigslist looking for a programmer for an Internet business he was trying to get off the ground. Mr. Zuckerberg responded to the ad, and Mr. Ceglia agreed to pay him $1,000 for his work.Months later, in his college dorm room, Mr. Zuckerberg started a business called Facebook.Mr. Zuckerberg did not hear from Mr. Ceglia again until 2010, when he was served with a complaint that claimed Mr. Ceglia was entitled to a substantial ownership stake in Facebook.According to the lawsuit, Mr. Zuckerberg had promised him a substantial interest in either ""The Face Book"" or ""The Page Book."" Attached to the legal papers was a contract that contained language giving Mr. Ceglia an interest in Mr. Zuckerberg's start-up. The filing also included e-mail exchanges between Mr. Ceglia and Mr. Zuckerberg that purported to show their collaboration on ideas for the social network business.Federal prosecutors say that Mr. Ceglia's claims were entirely false. Government investigators searched Mr. Ceglia's hard drive and discovered the original contract, which had no reference to Facebook. And Harvard's e-mail servers had no record of the supposed e-mails.Facebook's lawyers at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher commended the Justice Department for filing criminal charges and, in statement, indicated that it would pursue possible claims against the lawyers that represented Mr. Ceglia.""Ceglia used the federal court system to perpetuate his fraud and will now be held accountable for his criminal scheme,"" said Orin Snyder, a partner at Gibson Dunn. ""Facebook also intends to hold accountable all of those who assisted Ceglia in this outrageous fraud.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
When Hacking Was in Its Infancy,"Was Peter G. Neumann the world's first ''white hat'' computer hacker? The term ''hacker'' was popularized in Steven Levy's 1984 book ''Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution.'' It described an early generation of M.I.T. students who did not break into computers and networks -- or black hats -- but instead were passionate programmers and hardware tinkerers. Beginning in the early '60s, they would take over the then-rare mainframe computers late at night when the machines were not being used for routine tasks, and explore the limits of computing. They designed things like ''Space War,'' one of the first interactive computer games.Dr. Neumann preceded that early hacker culture by more than half a decade. At Harvard, he was one of the first programmers to have solo access to his own ''personal'' computer -- at least on weekends.The Mark IV was one of the world's first stored-program computers, and in 1954 Dr. Neumann earned the trust of its designer, Howard Aiken. Every Friday at 5 p.m., he would take over care of the machine from its regular operators. He would have the run of the system for the weekend and wouldn't leave until Monday morning.''I was the operator, maintainer and guru,'' he said. His undergraduate thesis was on computing elliptic integrals, and he used the machine to generate a large number of tables.He also used the Mark IV to do early work in computer music. For a course on computational linguistics, Dr. Neumann and other students -- including Fred Brooks, who would later lead the design of the legendary I.B.M. 360 -- used a statistical technique to analyze 37 hymn tunes and then create 600 new tunes based on the patterns they discovered.It was a hacker's paradise.But does that make him the very first hacker? Hard to tell, said George Dyson, a computer historian and author of ''Turing's Cathedral'' (Random House, 2012), which chronicles computer research at Princeton in the 1950s.''Nineteen fifty-four was very early,'' Mr. Dyson said, but at the same time, researchers at Princeton were hanging around the computer center ''at all hours, doing strange things.'' "
F.B.I. Inquiry Into E-Mails Raises Questions on Motives,"WASHINGTON -- Is a string of angry e-mails really enough, in an age of boisterous online exchanges, to persuade the F.B.I. to open a cyberstalking investigation?Sometimes the answer is yes, law enforcement officials and legal experts said Monday -- especially if the e-mails in question reflect an inside knowledge of the director of the Central Intelligence Agency.That was true of the e-mails sent anonymously to Jill Kelley, a friend of the C.I.A. director, David H. Petraeus, which prompted the F.B.I. office in Tampa, Fla., to begin an investigation last June. The inquiry traced the e-mails to Mr. Petraeus's biographer, Paula Broadwell, exposed their extramarital affair and led Friday to his resignation after 14 months as head of the intelligence agency.On Monday night, F.B.I. agents went to Ms. Broadwell's home in Charlotte, N.C., and were seen carrying away what several reporters at the scene said were boxes of documents. A law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the case remains open, said Ms. Broadwell had consented to the search. Some commentators have questioned whether the bureau would ordinarily investigate a citizen complaint about unwanted e-mails, suggesting that there must have been a hidden motive, possibly political, to take action. F.B.I. officials are scheduled to brief the Senate and House intelligence committees on Tuesday about the case.But law enforcement officials insisted on Monday that the case was handled ''on the merits.'' The cyber squad at the F.B.I.'s Tampa field office opened an investigation, after consulting with federal prosecutors, based on what appeared to be a legitimate complaint about e-mail harassment.The complaint was more intriguing, the officials acknowledged, because the author of the e-mails, which criticized Ms. Kelley for supposed flirtatious behavior toward Mr. Petraeus at social events, seemed to have an insider's knowledge of the C.I.A. director's activities. One e-mail accused Ms. Kelley of ''touching'' Mr. Petraeus inappropriately under a dinner table.''There was a legitimate case to open on the facts, with the support of the prosecutors,'' said the official who described the search at Ms. Broadwell's home. He added, ''They asked, does somebody know more about Petraeus than you'd expect?''Ms. Kelley, a volunteer with wounded veterans and military families, brought her complaint to a rank-and-file agent she knew from a previous encounter with the F.B.I. office, the official also said. That agent, who had previously pursued a friendship with Ms. Kelley and had earlier sent her shirtless photographs of himself, was ''just a conduit'' for the complaint, he said. He had no training in cybercrime, was not part of the cyber squad handling the case and was never assigned to the investigation.But the agent, who was not identified, continued to ''nose around'' about the case, and eventually his superiors ''told him to stay the hell away from it, and he was not invited to briefings,'' the official said. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Monday night that the agent had been barred from the case.Later, the agent became convinced -- incorrectly, the official said -- that the case had stalled. Because of his ''worldview,'' as the official put it, he suspected a politically motivated cover-up to protect President Obama. The agent alerted Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, who called the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, on Oct. 31 to tell him of the agent's concerns.The official said the agent's self-described ''whistle-blowing'' was ''a little embarrassing'' but had no effect on the investigation.David H. Laufman, who served as a federal prosecutor in national security cases from 2003 to 2007, said, ''there's a lot of chatter and noise about cybercrimes,'' and most of it does not lead to an investigation. But he added, ''It's plausible to me that if Ms. Kelley indicated that the stalking was related to her friendship with the C.I.A. director, that would have elevated it as a priority for the bureau.''Orin S. Kerr, a George Washington University law professor who specializes in computer crime issues, said it was ''surprising that they would devote the resources'' to investigating who was behind a half-dozen harassing e-mails.''The F.B.I. gets a lot of tips, and investigating any one case requires an agent or a few agents to spend a lot of time,'' he said. ''They can't do this for every case, and the issue is, why this one case?''Still, Mr. Kerr -- a trial attorney in the Justice Department's computer crimes and intellectual property section from 1998 to 2001 -- said it was likely that several factors, in addition to the Petraeus connection, made the complaint stand out. Ms. Kelly was fairly prominent in Tampa social circles and had previously had dealings with the F.B.I. agent who took her complaint.Moreover, he said, the F.B.I. has been putting more resources into investigating cyberstalking crimes in recent years.A government official clarified on Monday that F.B.I. agents' first interview with Ms. Broadwell -- at which she is said to have admitted having had an affair with Mr. Petraeus, and voluntarily allowed agents to search her computer -- took place in September. An earlier account had put that interview during the week of Oct. 21.Before Ms. Broadwell spoke to the F.B.I. agents, Mr. Petraeus had learned that she had sent offensive e-mails to Ms. Kelley and asked her to stop, another official said. By the time agents interviewed the C.I.A. director during the week of Oct. 28, he was aware of the cyberstalking investigation and readily acknowledged his affair with Ms. Broadwell, the official said.Mr. Petraeus's former colleagues in the Obama administration have said little about the circumstances preceding his resignation. But on Monday, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, the director of the C.I.A. before Mr. Petraeus, criticized the F.B.I. for not informing members of the Congressional intelligence committees of its investigation.''As a former director of the C.I.A., and having worked very closely with the intelligence committees, I believe that there is a responsibility to make sure that the intelligence committees are informed of issues that could affect the security of those intelligence operations,'' he said on a flight to Australia.His remarks were similar to those by the Senate Intelligence Committee's chairwoman, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, on Sunday.Mr. Petraeus's former spokesman, Steve Boylan, told ABC's ''Good Morning America'' on Monday that the C.I.A. director was ''devastated'' over the affair and its consequences.''He deeply regrets and knows how much pain this causes his family,'' he said.Mr. Boylan, a retired Army colonel, said Holly Petraeus, Mr. Petraeus's wife of 38 years, ''is not exactly pleased right now.''''Furious would be an understatement.'' "
F.B.I. Agent in Petraeus Case Is Called a Relentless Veteran,"DOVER, Fla. -- The F.B.I. agent who spurred the investigation that led to the resignation of David H. Petraeus as C.I.A. director is a ''hard-charging'' veteran who helped investigate the foiled millennium terrorist plot in 1999, colleagues said on Wednesday.The agent, Frederick W. Humphries II, 47, is also described by former colleagues as relentless in his pursuit of what he sees as wrongdoing, which appears to describe his role in the F.B.I. investigation involving Mr. Petraeus. Suspecting that the case involved serious security issues and was being stalled, possibly for political reasons -- a suspicion his superiors say was unjustified -- he took his concerns to Congressional Republicans.''Fred is a passionate kind of guy,'' one former colleague said. ''He's kind of an obsessive type. If he locked his teeth onto something, he'd be a bulldog.'' The question of how and why the F.B.I. opened the investigation that has had such momentous consequences has been central from the moment Mr. Petraeus stepped down Friday. The emerging portrait of the agent who initiated the inquiry is another step toward an answer.Mr. Humphries, who was identified on Wednesday by law enforcement colleagues, took the initial complaint from Jill Kelley, a Tampa woman active in local military circles and a personal friend, about anonymous e-mails that accused her of inappropriately flirtatious behavior toward Mr. Petraeus.The subsequent cyberstalking investigation uncovered an extramarital affair between Mr. Petraeus and Paula Broadwell, his biographer, who agents determined had sent the anonymous e-mails. It also ensnared Gen. John R. Allen, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, after F.B.I. agents discovered what a law enforcement official said on Wednesday were sexually explicit e-mail exchanges between him and Ms. Kelley.A spokesman for Ms. Kelley provided her version of events in two conference calls with reporters on Wednesday. Ms. Kelley's concern when she took the e-mails to Mr. Humphries was that she feared the sender was ''stalking'' Mr. Petraeus and General Allen, said the spokesman, who asked not to be identified.''She asks the agent, 'What do you make of this?' '' the spokesman said. ''The agent said: 'This is serious. They seem to know the comings and goings of a couple of generals.' ''General Allen himself had received a similar anonymous e-mail message, sent by someone identified as ''kelleypatrol,'' advising him to stay away from Ms. Kelley. The general forwarded it to Ms. Kelley, and they discussed a concern that someone was cyberstalking them.On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said he had asked the Senate to postpone a confirmation hearing for General Allen's next assignment while the department's inspector general reviewed his e-mail correspondence with Ms. Kelley, which was discovered by F.B.I. agents investigating her initial complaint.Pentagon officials said the review covered more than 10,000 pages of documents that included ''inappropriate'' messages. But associates of General Allen have said that the two exchanged about a dozen e-mails a week since meeting two years ago and that his messages were affectionate but platonic.A law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, disputed that assertion on Wednesday, saying some messages were clearly sexual. Investigators were confident ''the nature of the content warranted passing them on'' to the inspector general, the official said.In a statement on Wednesday, General Allen's military counsel said he intended to cooperate fully with the inspector general's investigation. ''To the extent there are questions about certain communications by General Allen, he shares in the desire to resolve those questions as completely and quickly as possible,'' said the statement from Col. John G. Baker, the chief defense counsel of the Marine Corps.The F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, and the deputy director, Sean Joyce, briefed leaders of the Senate and House intelligence committees about the investigation. Mr. Petraeus is expected to speak to the panel behind closed doors on Friday about the attack on the American Mission in Benghazi, Libya. The events leading to his resignation are certain to come up.A Pentagon official said the security clearance of Ms. Broadwell, a West Point graduate and officer in the Army Reserve, had been suspended pending the outcome of the F.B.I. investigation. F.B.I. agents on Monday night carried boxes of documents and a computer out of the house she shares with her husband and two sons. The law enforcement official said that Ms. Broadwell had cooperated with investigators in their effort to remove all classified material, which by law cannot be kept in an insecure facility.The officials said Ms. Kelley was no longer permitted to enter MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa ''with a wave,'' as she has for years as a regular volunteer and visitor to ranking officers there. Now she has to get approval and sign in at the visitor's gate, the official said.Ms. Kelley, whose house has been besieged by reporters and television crews, has called 911 several times to complain about snooping reporters, according to tapes and transcripts of the calls posted on the Web. In at least one call, she asked for ''diplomatic protection,'' saying she is an ''honorary consul general,'' a designation she reportedly received from South Korean diplomats.By all accounts, Mr. Humphries doggedly pursued Ms. Kelley's cyberstalking complaint. Though he was not assigned to the case, he was admonished by supervisors who thought he was trying to improperly insert himself into the investigation.In late October, fearing that the case was being stalled for political reasons, Mr. Humphries contacted Representative Dave Reichert, a Republican from Washington State, where the F.B.I. agent had worked previously, to inform him of the case. Mr. Reichert put him in touch with the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, who passed the message to Mr. Mueller.Lawrence Berger, the general counsel for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, who spoke with Mr. Humphries, said Mr. Humphries only received the information from Ms. Kelley and never played a role in the investigation.Mr. Berger said Mr. Humphries and his wife had been ''social friends with Ms. Kelley and her husband prior to the day she referred the matter to him.''''They always socialized and corresponded,'' he said.Mr. Berger took issue with news media reports that said his client had sent shirtless pictures of himself to Ms. Kelley.''That picture was sent years before Ms. Kelley contacted him about this, and it was sent as part of a larger context of what I would call social relations in which the families would exchange numerous photos of each other,'' Mr. Berger said.The photo was sent as a joke, he said, and was of Mr. Humphries ''posing with a couple of dummies.'' Mr. Berger added that it was not sexual in nature.Two former law enforcement colleagues said Mr. Humphries was a solid agent with experience in counterterrorism. He has conservative political views and a reputation for being aggressive, they said.Colleagues and news reports described the role of Mr. Humphries, who in 1999 was in his third year at the F.B.I., in building the case against Ahmed Ressam, who was detained as he tried to enter the United States from Canada with a plan to set off a bomb at Los Angeles International Airport.In May 2010, after he had moved to the Tampa field office, Mr. Humphries fatally shot a knife-wielding man near a gate of MacDill Air Force base. A state prosecutor declined to prosecute the case, and the Justice Department's civil rights division and an internal F.B.I. review board each also found that the use of force had been justified, according to bureau records.A large American flag was flying on Wednesday in front of Mr. Humphries's house in Dover, a half-hour drive from Tampa. A man standing in the driveway who appeared to be Mr. Humphries, approached by a reporter seeking comment, said his first name was not Fred. The man then walked into the house, closed the front door and did not respond to the doorbell.In regard to his client's speaking with Mr. Cantor, Mr. Berger declined to address the issue, saying only that his client ''had followed F.B.I. protocols.''''No one tries to become a whistle-blower,'' he said. ''Consistent with F.B.I. policy, he referred it to the proper component.''A law enforcement official said disclosing a confidential investigation even to Congress members could sometimes violate F.B.I. rules. The official said that Mr. Humphries's conduct was under review and that he had not been punished in any way.On Wednesday, Mr. Cantor said he had no intention of ''politicizing'' the tip from Mr. Humphries, whom he did not name. ''The information that was sent to me sounded as if there was a potential for a national security vulnerability,'' Mr. Cantor said. "
Hacking General Petraeus,"Charles M. Blow is off today.This is not going to end well for the F.B.I.We are now entering the second phase of the David Petraeus scandal. The first phase began on Nov. 9 when Petraeus revealed that he had had an affair and resigned as C.I.A. director. For the next week, the press scrambled to keep abreast of every head-spinning new plot twist. General Petraeus slept with whom? Jill Kelley did what? Petraeus's biographer/mistress titled her book what? Phase 1 of any big national scandal ends when the New York tabloids stop writing their laugh-out-loud cover headlines (''Cloak and Shag Her'' screamed The New York Post) and relegate the story to the inside pages. That happened on Friday.In Phase 2, people begin to grapple with the scandal's larger meaning, assuming, of course, that it has some larger meaning. The sordid John Edwards affair, for instance, showed that he had never been fit for public office, much less the vice presidency. The Bernie Madoff scandal showed that investors will happily suspend disbelief when their fund manager's returns are too good to be true. But the Petraeus scandal could well end up teaching some very different lessons. If the most admired military man in a generation can have his e-mail hacked by F.B.I. agents, then none of us are safe from the post-9/11 surveillance machine. And if an affair is all it takes to force such a man from office, then we truly have lost all sense of proportion.Let's go back to the scene of the so-called crime, to Tampa, Fla., where Kelley, an attractive wannabe socialite, gets some unsettling e-mails from an anonymous sender. If she had any sense, she would block the e-mail address and be done with it. But because she knows that men will bend the rules for her -- after all, high-ranking military officers granted her unfettered access to MacDill Air Force Base -- she goes to her (male) F.B.I. friend, who advocates with his superiors for an investigation. They agree.But on what grounds? I looked up the cyber-stalking statute. It says that a crime has been committed when e-mail ''causes substantial emotion distress'' or places the victim in ''reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury.''This strikes me as a pretty high standard. It is possible, I suppose, that the anonymous e-mails Kelley was getting from Paula Broadwell, Petraeus's former mistress, met that standard. And the F.B.I. has worked hard to make Broadwell's e-mails sound as threatening as possible. But once they leak out, as they surely will, I strongly suspect that we'll see that the law was just a fig leaf.So, too, with the ''classified information'' Broadwell is supposed to have. (And didn't you love the F.B.I.'s big show of carting away her computers?) Given the government's propensity, since 9/11, to stamp ''classified'' on every piece of paper short of the paper towels in the commissary, my guess is that this claim is also going to turn out to be less than earth-shattering. Once the F.B.I. learned the truth -- that it was just about sex -- it needed a high-minded rationale to keep snooping. Broadwell did the F.B.I. a huge favor by leaving ''classified'' information on her computer.I understand why Petraeus felt he needed to resign; the affair had violated his own code of honor. I also understand that his propensity for publicity and control made him unpopular among the C.I.A. rank-and-file. But I still wish President Obama had refused his request to resign.I wish the president had said that although General Petraeus had made a mistake in his personal life -- an all-too-human mistake, made by millions of people every day -- the consequences of that mistake should be dealt with by him, his wife and his former lover. I wish he had said that the affair should not trump his decades of public service, or stop him from continuing to serve. I wish he had said that the Justice Department's inspector general was going to conduct an inquiry into whether the F.B.I. had acted appropriately in handling Kelley's complaint.On MSNBC on Friday afternoon, Andrea Mitchell spoke to Senator Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri, who had just come from a closed-door Intelligence Committee meeting where Petraeus had testified.''Do you think he had to resign?'' she asked.''Based on what I know, I wouldn't think so,'' Blunt replied. ''Clearly,'' he added, ''this is not someone who is going to be subject to blackmail.'' Thus did Blunt swat away the one legitimate rationale for forcing Petraeus from his job because of his affair.In the weeks to come, a lot more people are going to come to the same conclusion -- and are going to ask the same questions about the ease with which the government can look at our e-mails and peep into our bedrooms. Such a rethinking is long overdue. "
Head of Tehran's Cybercrimes Unit Is Fired Over Death of Blogger,"TEHRAN -- Iranian's national police chief fired the commander of Tehran's cybercrimes police unit on Saturday for negligence in the death of a blogger in prison.The dismissal of the commander, Gen. Saeed Shokrian, follows investigations by Parliament and Iran's judiciary into the unexplained death of the blogger, Sattar Beheshti, 35, who died in early November just a few days after being arrested by the cybercrimes police unit, known here as FATA.''Tehran's FATA should be held responsible for the death of Sattar Beheshti,'' said Iran's national police chief, Ismael Ahmadi-Moqaddam, according to the Iranian Labor News Agency. It is unclear whether General Shokrian will also face judicial charges over the blogger's death.The public nature of his dismissal suggests that he will bear most of the responsibility for the death. In similar cases in the past, officials have been punished, but it is rare for them to be named and publicly dismissed on the same day.Mr. Beheshti's Web site, My Life for My Iran, criticized Iran's financial contributions to the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon. Mr. Beheshti posted pictures of Lebanese youths having parties alongside images of Iranians living in poverty.The exact cause of Mr. Beheshti's death remains murky. Mr. Ahmadi-Moqaddam said Tuesday that investigations had ruled out torture as a cause of death, saying it was possible that Mr. Beheshti, who in pictures looks big and strong, died of ''psychological shock.''Iranian activists and bloggers say Mr. Beheshti died of injuries following beatings. Iran's judiciary spokesman, Gholam Hussein Mohseni-Ejei, recently admitted that Mr. Beheshti -- while in prison -- had lodged a written complaint against an interrogator, in which he accused the man of having beaten him during his detention in Tehran's Evin prison.''I, Sattar Beheshti, was arrested by FATA and beaten and tortured with multiple blows to my head and body,'' read the document, published by the opposition Kalame Web site. He added, ''If anything happens to me, the police are responsible.''Mr. Ahmadi-Moqaddam said that Mr. Beheshti was given tranquilizers while in the prison's clinic, but that when handed over to the cybercrimes unit its officers denied him the same tranquilizers. ''This might be regarded as neglect,'' he said. ''However, there were no signs of beatings on his body.''Official statements on the cause of death have been contradictory. An influential member of Parliament who earlier denied that Mr. Beheshti had been tortured in any way told the Tabnak Web site that the blogger had been beaten, but died of shock and fear.''Definitely he was beaten inside the FATA detention center,'' the lawmaker, Alaeddin Borujerdi, told the Web site, ''but he didn't die as a result of these beatings.'' He also stressed that the cybercrimes unit must change the way it deals with prisoners.Iranian activists who have been in contact with Mr. Beheshti's family say his relatives were not allowed to see his body before a hurried funeral on Nov. 6 in his hometown, Robat Karim, 30 miles southwest of the capital, Tehran.In Mr. Beheshti's final post, on Oct. 29, a day before his arrest, he said he was being threatened by security officials. ''They told me that if I didn't close my big mouth my mother should prepare to wear black clothes,'' for mourning.The Iranian Parliament's special investigator into the case, Mehdi Davatgari, said he welcomed the commander's removal. ''This move shows the civil rights of our citizens are our top priority,'' he said. "
At Dawn We Sleep,"Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, are, respectively, the chairman and senior Republican on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.WashingtonIF you read the newspapers on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, you would have been led to believe that Japan was poised to attack -- but in Southeast Asia, not Pearl Harbor. Few experts believed that Japan was prepared to take on the United States; war, they believed, was not necessarily imminent.''In view of the presence of new British naval strength at Singapore and powerful American squadrons in the rear of any southward Japanese expedition, it is believed there is no immediate likelihood of a large-scale invasion or bombing,'' The Times quoted an Australian official as saying. On this anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, it's worth remembering that enemies will attack at a time of their choosing.In fact, they rely on surprise.A storm is surely gathering again, and we must resist the false sense of calm. The attack is not a matter of if, but when. It will not be launched from aircraft carriers, missile silos or massed armies. It will come through cyberspace and will strike our most vital computer systems, those that manage our electricity grids, oil and gas pipelines, telecommunications networks and financial markets.We know that our digital networks are being tested, on a minute by minute basis, by would-be cyberterrorists, criminal gangs, rogue hackers and rival nations who look for unguarded digital back doors that would allow them to seize control of our most essential computers.In invoking Pearl Harbor, we're not trying to be alarmist -- we're borrowing an analogy the defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, himself used in an Oct. 11 speech about what a catastrophic cyberattack might look like.''An aggressor nation or extremist group could use these kinds of cyber tools to gain control of critical switches,'' he said. ''They could, for example, derail passenger trains or even more dangerous, derail trains loaded with lethal chemicals. They could contaminate the water supply in major cities or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country. The most destructive scenarios involve cyber actors launching several attacks on our critical infrastructure at one time, in combination with a physical attack on our country. Attackers could also seek to disable or degrade critical military systems and communication networks.''Mr. Panetta added: ''The collective result of these kinds of attacks could be a cyber-Pearl Harbor, an attack that would cause physical destruction and the loss of life. In fact, it would paralyze and shock the nation.''The harsh reality is that such an attack does not require extensive computer skills. Earlier this year, The Washington Post reported on an overseas hacker who gained control of a small Texas water utility using Internet tools available to anyone. It took him just 10 minutes. The utility learned of the attack only when proof of it appeared online -- the hacker's warning of how susceptible the plant was.Given these warnings and actual evidence of successful attacks, you would hope that Congress would be working urgently to strengthen the cyberdefenses of our critical infrastructure -- to make them well-defended forts, rather than undefended targets.But twice this year the Senate failed to pass bipartisan cybersecurity legislation, with the United States Chamber of Commerce leading the opposition.What made this so frustrating was that we -- along with our Democratic co-sponsors, Senators Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, Dianne Feinstein of California and John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia -- had already agreed to a major compromise to address the concerns of the chamber and its Senate allies by replacing mandatory cybersecurity requirements with voluntary, industry-developed standards that would also have protected from lawsuits companies that chose to implement the new standards.Indeed, the concept of a voluntary, incentive-based system was proposed by the chamber and other industry groups in a March 2011 white paper and endorsed by a Republican-led House task force in October 2011.Our willingness to compromise and adopt this reasonable, moderate approach was met with irrational resistance -- even after the chamber learned -- thanks to the F.B.I. -- that it had been the victim of Chinese cyberespionage.One of the biggest mistakes that enabled the attack on Pearl Harbor was a belief that Japan lacked the capacity to mount devastating aerial bombing attacks so far from its borders.For a modern-day equivalent, look at the recent attack against one of the world's largest energy businesses, the Saudi oil business Aramco, which had 30,000 of its computers crippled in a cyberattack, wreaking havoc on the company's operations. If that wasn't a clear enough warning, the destroyed computers' files were replaced with pictures of burning American flags.Recently, the consumer banking sites of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, PNC and others came under the largest sustained denial of service attack in history. The attacks went on for weeks, knocking many of these sites off line or slowing them to a crawl.These attacks did not have to be initiated from within the United States or even a few miles offshore. Cybersecurity experts believe Iran is the likely culprit in both attacks, and we fear this is just the beginning.The headlines before the attack on Pearl Harbor turned out to be delusional. No one can reasonably entertain such a delusion about our adversaries' capacity to attack us in cyberspace today.Time has almost run out in this session of Congress, and President Obama will soon issue an executive order that will establish cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure according to the statements of his top cabinet officials.But the president's powers are limited, and the issuance of an executive order is controversial even among some supporters of cybersecurity legislation. The new Congress must take up this issue, and pass comprehensive legislation to defend our nation against this gathering cyberthreat. If it doesn't, the day on which those cyberweapons strike will be another ''date which will live in infamy,'' because we knew it was coming and didn't come together to stop it. "
Hackers Demanding Apology In Rape Case,"Computer hackers hijacked the Web site of a prominent Ohio high school football team late Sunday, threatening to release the personal data of school officials, coaches and every player on the team if those involved in a suspected rape did not publicly apologize to the girl and her family.A group calling itself Anonymous, a hacker collective, and KnightSec posted a note and a video on the Web page of the Steubenville High School Big Red football team, a program in the Ohio Valley known for its dominance. The note stated that the city of Steubenville was protecting its beloved team by charging only two of its players with the rape of a girl ''when everyone present was guilty.'' The rape case was the subject of an article last week in The New York Times.In the video, a person wearing a Guy Fawkes mask said that the names, Social Security numbers, addresses, names of relatives and phone numbers of people connected to the case were being compiled and would be made public if an apology from those involved did not come before Jan. 1.''This is a warning shot to the school faculty, the parents of those involved and those involved especially,'' the person said in a computerized voice.Anonymous is a hacker group that has coordinated cyberattacks on the Web sites of major corporations, like MasterCard, and the government, including the United States Department of Justice. In 2010, it attacked sites of corporations it considered hostile to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, and made some Web sites inoperable or slow. It also has been campaigning against the Westboro Baptist Church, most recently because church members had threatened to picket a vigil for the victims of the Newtown, Conn., school shootings.The hackers' crusade against the Big Red football team on Sunday ignited activity on the Web about the rape case. The video that Anonymous posted on the team's Web site was removed from the site Monday morning.A statement from the Steubenville City Schools said the school system does not own or control the hacked Web site, Rollredroll.com, nor does it have any connection with it.''We will continue to monitor our Web sites for any inappropriate content,'' the statement said.The unauthorized video posted on the team's Web site referred to the case of a 16-year-old girl who prosecutors said was raped on the night of Aug. 11 at a series of parties in and around Steubenville. Twitter comments, a photograph on Instagram and at least one video that was posted on YouTube that night documented the rape, the police said. Twitter users wrote the words #rape and #drunkgirl, and some referred to the girl as ''the dead body.'' At least one Twitter comment suggested that the girl had been urinated on.Trent Mays, 16, of Bloomingdale, Ohio, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, of Steubenville -- two sophomore standouts on the football team -- remain on house arrest on charges that they raped the girl when she was too drunk to resist. Their trial has been set for Feb. 13 in juvenile court.The case has shaken the football team, which has been the pride of the community for more than 100 years, and has divided Steubenville. The night of the party, residents began taking sides, with some blaming the girl, saying she was trying to defame the team with her accusation. Others said the suspected rape occurred as a result of a hero-worshiping culture of a city obsessed with high school football.At a hearing in early October, two Big Red football players and one Big Red wrestler testified for the prosecution at a probable cause hearing, with one witness stating that he had seen Mays rape the girl in the back seat of a car while the girl was slurring her words and was unable to walk on her own. That witness said he videotaped the rape, but later deleted the video from his phone. Another witness testified he saw Richmond rape the girl while she was motionless and naked on the basement floor at one party.The hackers posted the names of those witnesses, as well as the names of other witnesses they said saw the rape that night in August. They referred to those witnesses as ''targets.'' They also released basic information about some of those people, including addresses, phone numbers and names of their parents. "
Software Helps Identify Anonymous Writers or Helps Them Stay That Way,"Your writing style is a little like your fingerprint. Your word choice, spelling, punctuation, sentence structure and syntax are all dead giveaways.Stylometry, the study of linguistic style, has been used to out the authors behind some of history's most disputed documents, from Shakespearean sonnets to the Federalist Papers. In the latter, James Madison's penchant for the word ""whilst"" was a big distinguisher;  Alexander Hamilton preferred plain old ""while.""Now graduate students at Drexel University have released two potentially provocative stylometry tools, which could have larger repercussions for whistle-blowers, human rights advocates, hackers and, well, anyone who doesn't want their writing traced back to them down the road. One tool helps identify the author of a disputed document, and another helps authors avoid detection. The students released early, ""alpha"" versions of their tools on Thursday at a convention of the Chaos Computer Club, a hackers' group, in Berlin.The tools, which are still young, imperfect and buggy, build on existing author recognition tools like Signature, a program created by Peter Millican of Oxford University, and the Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program, or JGAAP, a similar program designed by Patrick Juola of Duquesne University.The researchers said their recognition tool, JStylo, works best within a limited suspect pool (50 people or less), when there are 6,500 words of available writing samples per suspect (Tweets, e-mails and instant messages will do) and if the disputed document is 500 words or longer. Within those parameters, Drexel researchers said, they can identify an author ""with a very high level of accuracy.""Practically speaking, that means the tool could be most effective in, say, a corporate whistle-blowing case where an employer could narrow a list of suspects to its employees and compare any anonymous documents to employee e-mails or reports. Identifying a human rights advocate would widen the suspect pool and make recognition more difficult, but not impossible.This is partly why researchers say they developed a second tool, Anonymouth, which helps authors disguise their writing.""Authorship recognition can be a legitimate threat to privacy and anonymity,"" the researchers said in their presentation on Thursday.Anonymouth builds on JStylo's findings to suggest ways to modify documents - by adding more sentences, using more complex words or switching up punctuation - to help authors mask their writing.Both tools are ""still a work in progress,"" Rachel Greenstadt, the faculty adviser for the project, said in an interview on Thursday. But it's easy to see how they could be pushed into practical use.A report commissioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that was published in 2009 warned of ""a growing need to identify writers not by their written script, but by analysis of the typed content.""

"Fighting Antipiracy Measure, Activist Group Posts Personal Information of Media Executives","The online activist group known as Anonymous, which has targeted opponents of the Occupy Wall Street movement and businesses that stopped providing services to WikiLeaks, has set its sights on a new adversary: media executives.In protest of antipiracy legislation currently being considered by Congress, the group has posted online documents that reveal personal information about Jeffrey L. Bewkes, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, and Sumner M. Redstone, who controls Viacom and the CBS Corporation. Those companies, like almost every major company in the media and entertainment industry, have championed the Stop Online Piracy Act, the House of Representatives bill, known as SOPA, and its related Senate bill, called Protect I.P.The documents, culled from various databases, included Mr. Bewkes's home addresses and phone numbers, and encouraged users to bombard the company and its executives with e-mails, faxes and phone calls. Mr. Bewkes has received intimidating phone calls and a barrage of e-mails, according to supporters of the legislation who have knowledge about the matter but are not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.The documents also included the corporate contact information for a range of companies including NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures Entertainment and the Walt Disney Company.A Disney spokeswoman said neither the company nor its chief executive, Robert A. Iger, had received threats. Time Warner declined to comment. The file that was posted regarding Mr. Redstone has details about his family, home and career but does not include private contact information. A Viacom spokeswoman declined to comment.Anonymous, a loosely organized collective of so-called hacktivists, has called its effort ""Operation Hiroshima."" It began on Jan. 1, when the group dropped a trove of documents on Web sites that facilitate anonymous publishing, like Pastebin.com and Scribd.com. The documents included information about media executives and government figures like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and New York City Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, and data on corporations and government entities that the group opposes.""They should feel threatened,"" said Barrett Brown, a Dallas-based online activist who has worked with Anonymous, referring to backers of the antipiracy legislation. ""The idea is to put pressure on the politicians and companies supporting it.""The online effort underscores how heated the arguments have become over legislation that may seem like arcane government regulation. Media companies say the legislation, which has bipartisan support, will crack down on illicit downloads of movies, music and television, especially from overseas Web sites. SOPA would expand the ability of the government and private companies to hold Web sites responsible for content the companies believe infringes on their copyrights, allowing greater use of court orders and lawsuits that could ultimately shut down the sites.The technology industry, including giants like Google and Yahoo, and advocates for Internet freedom say the bills would censor the Internet, stifle free speech and give the government too much power to regulate and shut down Web sites in the United States. Both sides have spent millions on lobbying in Washington. But at the grass-roots level, the issue has galvanized Internet activists, who lack lobbying power but have promoted the cause among the online community.""You take our speech, you take our Internet, you take our Bill of Rights, you take our Constitution, we fight back,"" said a monotone voice on a YouTube video posted by Anonymous before the Operation Hiroshima document drop.Lawmakers and their aides have also been targets. A photograph of a 25-year-old aide for the House Judiciary Committee was superimposed into pornography by a group related to Anonymous, according to another aide who was briefed on security threats to lawmakers and their staffs. ""Why can't they just hire a lobbyist like everyone else?"" this aide said.The vast majority of SOPA opponents convey their views through legitimate means. Hundreds of Web sites have encouraged blackouts and boycotts to protest the legislation. According to BlackoutSOPA.org, nearly 12,000 users have changed their Twitter profile pictures to a ""Stop SOPA"" badge.""The more outrage expressed on the Internet in the coming days, the better,"" said Fred Wilson, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a venture capital firm and an early investor in Twitter. He said he did not condone threats or ""any kind of intimidation"" by hackers.Last month Scribd.com introduced a function that made the words on documents gradually fade away. As they did, a pop-up prompted users to contact their representatives. ""Don't let the Internet vanish before your eyes,"" it read.The tactics have succeeded in some cases. Initially a supporter, the Web hosting company Go Daddy reversed its position on SOPA after Wikipedia and thousands of other Web sites said they would withdraw their domains from the service. ""Go Daddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it,"" Warren Adelman, Go Daddy's chief executive, said in a statement.Companies like Time Warner, which owns HBO, CNN and the Warner Brothers studio, and Viacom, which owns MTV and the Paramount studio, have experienced security teams, but they are not necessarily trained to handle anonymous online threats, said Josh Shaul, chief technology officer at Application Security Inc., a New York-based provider of database security software.""It's easy to get something taken off a Web site, but it's impossible to erase things off the Internet,"" he said.Less than a week after the Operation Hiroshima documents were posted, a Twitter message linking to Mr. Bewkes's home phone numbers and addresses, his annual income and his wife's name and age had spread across the Internet. The message included #OpHiroshima, the shortened Twitter code for the effort.The global activists in the nebulous collection known as Anonymous often use computer skills to support political causes. For example, Anoymous demanded a full Christmas dinner for Pfc. Bradley Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst who is in prison facing charges of leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks.Last month, hackers associated with Anonymous published a trove of e-mail addresses and the personal information of subscribers of Stratfor, a security group based in Austin, Tex. Last year, a splinter group affiliated with Anonymous attacked the Sony Corporation, shutting down its PlayStation online network. The attack cost the company around $171 million, according to industry estimates. Movements like Anonymous often squabble among themselves, but SOPA is a uniquely unifying cause, said Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University and an expert on hacking. To these activists, she said, ""Internet freedom is not controversial."" "
A TV Debate on Antipiracy,"A pair of bills that would strengthen antipiracy laws - and that could essentially censor the Internet, according to heavyweights like Google - have received scant coverage from the major television networks. The parent companies of the TV networks are among the chief supporters of the bills, having lobbied Congress to write them in the first place.Those two facts, taken together, have caused conspiracy theories to flourish online about corporate interference in news coverage.Chris Hayes and the staff of his show on MSNBC, ""Up,"" knew that when they invited Richard Cotton - the chief lawyer for NBC Universal, MSNBC's parent company - and a prominent opponent of the bills, Alexis Ohanian of Reddit.com, on their Sunday morning broadcast. They viewed the bookings as an implicit rebuttal to the conspiracy theories, but also as a reminder that the parent companies of news organizations do indeed take sides sometimes.NBC Universal ""is not at all neutral in this legislative battle,"" Mr. Hayes said in his introductory segment, noting for effect the coffee mugs in an MSNBC kitchen that read, ""Steal this mug! But not our content (and our jobs)."" NBC distributed the mugs to employees to rally support for the bills - known as SOPA, short for Stop Online Piracy Act, and the Protect IP Act - a few months ago.During the long debate that ensued, Mr. Hayes, a progressive journalist and anchor who joined MSNBC full time last fall, clashed with Mr. Cotton, the longtime general counsel for NBC Universal who has led the media industry's fight against content piracy. ""This legislation,"" he said, ""would not affect a single site in the United States,"" while Mr. Hayes and Mr. Ohanian contended that it would.Mr. Cotton frequently gives interviews, but appearances by him on networks owned by NBC are rare. His appearance on MSNBC on Sunday morning was arranged by the company's press office.""Up"" staffers joked afterward about Mr. Hayes having to clean out his desk, and he wrote on Twitter, also humorously, that ""that show took a few years off my life.""

Google Plans to Protest SOPA on Its Home Page,"11:42 a.m. | Updated .Google will join the group of Internet companies that are planning to protest two controversial Internet piracy bills on Wednesday.But Google will not shut its Web site for the day, as Wikipedia and a few other sites plan to do. Instead, it will use its home page, which receives over a hundred million unique visitors a month, to link to a Web site that it says will educate Internet users about the legislation and explain Google's stance.A Google employee has also posted instructions to Webmasters explaining how to close their Web sites for the day without hurting their standing in Google search results.The bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect IP Act, known as SOPA and PIPA, would require search engines and Internet service providers to restrict access to Web sites that posted or linked to copyrighted material. The bills are supported by the movie and music industries, among others.The technology industry has loudly opposed the bills. Tech entrepreneurs, executives and investors have said that it could hamper innovation by making it difficult for start-up Web companies to emerge, and hurt Internet users by shutting Web sites that link to illegal material but otherwise operate legally.""Like many businesses, entrepreneurs and Web users, we oppose these bills because there are smart, targeted ways to shut down foreign rogue Web sites without asking American companies to censor the Internet,"" Google said in a statement. ""So tomorrow we will be joining many other tech companies to highlight this issue on our U.S. home page.""In addition to Google and Wikipedia, Reddit, BoingBoing and WordPress plan to join the protest on Wednesday.The controversy, which has been growing for months, reached a crescendo over the weekend when the White House said it strongly opposed crucial elements of the bills. "
Behold the Power of Google,"Talk about instant gratification.Big Internet companies such as Google, and the English-language version of Wikipedia, are holding a one-day protest today against anti-piracy bills moving through Congress. Many people (including the members of the Times editorial board) have been fighting these bills for months, without much visible success. But within hours of the black bar appearing on Google's home page, D.C. reacted.Marco Rubio of Florida started things off. He announced this morning that he was no longer backing the Protect Intellectual Property Act. This was interesting not just because he's a right-wing favorite who is talked about as White House material, but because Senator Rubio actually co-sponsored that bill.Later, Senator John Cornyn of Texas also said he would no longer back the bill and said Congress should slow down on this sweeping legislation. He said on his Facebook page that it was better to get this bill right, rather than ""fast and wrong."" That was refreshing because I can't remember the last time Mr. Cornyn acted sensibly. His voice matters, because he heads the Senate campaign committee, which controls millions of dollars in re-election funds.Congress should certainly take more time on the Senate bill, and on the House version, the Stop Online Piracy Act, but it shouldn't abandon the issue entirely.There's a lot of hysteria on both sides of this debate. The current legislation  go too far, and could cause real harm to free speech and innovation on the Web. It would give copyright holders too much power, allowing Internet service providers to block sites that seem to enable intellectual property infringement, without legal oversight. But online piracy  a gigantic problem. Millions of people routinely steal other people's intellectual property every day without a moment's hesitation.We're written about these issues in detail on the editorial page and will have more to say on the subject. With patience and political courage, the two sides could find middle ground. Requiring court orders in lieu of pre-emptive strikes against sites suspected of wrongdoing would go a long wayBut the fact is, Google and Wikipedia did everyone a big service, and the swift reaction of lawmakers was gratifying. Now, if Mr. Cornyn and Mr. Rubio would pay as much attention to the Occupy protesters and the pain of the middle class, the country would be even better off.An earlier version of this post stated that the Protect Intellectual Property Act is a House bill. It's actually a Senate bill.  "
How Wikipedia Turned Off the Lights,"On Wednesday, Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, directed its English-language visitors to a spooky, black-and-white Web page that read, ""Imagine a World Without Free Knowledge."" The page, part of a protest against two online piracy bills, was simple and minimalistic. But the path to its publication was more complicated.In December, about 2,000 members of the Wikipedia community - people who voluntarily create and edit pages for the site - began discussing a plan for action against the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect IP Act, which opponents say would restrict Internet freedoms.In dozens of conversations in e-mails, chat rooms and comments documented on Wikipedia, they discussed what they could do about the bills, and three administrators guided the discussion until a consensus was reached. The decision to do a Wikipedia ""blackout"" wasn't reached until Monday, said Matthew Roth, a spokesman for the Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees the site. The community decided, with 80 percent approval, that the Web site would not be entirely disabled -- the mobile version would still be available, for example. But all pages would be locked so they could no longer be edited. And instead of showing the encyclopedia entries, each page of the regular site would display the blackout image.In the day leading up to the protest, 100 community members worked with 40 Wikimedia employees to prepare the blackout page. They discussed the design - ""The shadow design is more meaningful when the page is threatened to be engulfed by darkness,"" one member commented - and how to make the page load. Over those 48 hours, they also programmed a tool that would let Wikipedia visitors search for their Congressional representatives to contact them about the bills.On Tuesday night, as the clock reached 9 p.m. at the Wikimedia headquarters in San Francisco, its operations staff flipped the switch, changing a single line of code from ""false"" to ""true."" This locked all pages so they could no longer be edited. Then, right at 9, they activated the blackout page.""It made me think of certain science fiction movies when they power down the core reactor,"" Mr. Roth said.Someone in the office flipped on a projector that was aimed at a wall, showing a live feed from Twitter of messages with the hashtag ""#wikipediablackout.""""It went from very little movement to moving way faster than you could possibly read it,"" Mr. Roth said.He said that the community did not want to repeat this protest -- and that it hoped to be invited to participate in future discussions about how to address online piracy while maintaining the freedom of the Web.""We can say with conviction that we don't want this to happen again,"" Mr. Roth said. ""Our mission is to give free knowledge to the world, not have a blackout. But we need to see SOPA and PIPA defeated."" "
McConnell Urges Delay on Piracy Bills,"      Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, lent his voice Thursday to the growing chorus of lawmakers distancing themselves from legislation aimed at curbing Internet piracy that has lit up the Web with netizen protests. Mr. McConnell released a statement calling on the majority leader, Harry Reid, to set aside a procedural vote on the Senate measure scheduled for Tuesday.  ""While we must combat the online theft of intellectual property, current proposals in Congress raise serious legal, policy and operational concerns,"" Mr. McConnell wrote. Two bills - the Protect Intellectual Property Act, or PIPA, in the Senate and the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, in the House - garnered widespread, bipartisan support when they were first introduced. The Senate measure, drafted by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, had 40 co-sponsors of every ideological stripe. Mr. McConnell was not one of them. Then, with the online encouragement of Internet sites like Google, Facebook, Wikipedia and Twitter, Internet users rose up, charging that the bills would have unintended consequences, stifle innovation on the Web and open the Internet to unreasonable police actions. A day of action on Wednesday darkened some Web sites and mobilized others against the bills. One by one, advocates backed off. Mr. Reid, Democrat of Nevada, scheduled the vote next week to see if the measure still had the 60 votes needed to move it to the Senate floor for final debate. But he has also told its drafters to see if they can negotiate a new version that passes muster with the Internet opponents. Few think that is possible. A Reid staff aide said the discussions remained ""fluid,"" hinting at developments to come.  "
Put Down the Pitchforks on SOPA,"By now, you've probably heard of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect I.P. Act (PIPA). These are antipiracy bills that had been making their way through the House and Senate, respectively. You might have been made aware of these proposed bills on Wednesday, when Wikipedia and other Web sites ""went dark"" in protest. (Google covered up its logo with a big black rectangle, as though censored.)I've been watching these doings with fascination. One reason: it's the first time so many big Web sites have banded together for a political action. (Jenna Wortham in The New York Times offers a great analysis of this sea change here.) But I've also been a little alarmed. Of the millions joining in outraged protests, I'll bet that only a few have actually read the proposed bills. Everyone else is, no doubt, swept away by the Web sites' shock language. These bills, say the opponents, will allow Hollywood to censor free speech, kill innovation, and ""fatally damage the free and open Internet,"" as Wikipedia put it. Light the torches! Grab the pitchforks!In a perverse stroke of curiosity, I thought maybe I would actually study these bills. Nobody is disputing that these bills have been put together by the entertainment industries - movies, TV, music. The bills are intended to address their chronic frustration: that most of the piracy sites, which make movies, TV, music and book files available free, are overseas. Even though they get more visits than Google or Wikipedia, American laws cannot touch them. The SOPA and PIPA bills would try to shut down these overseas piracy sites by exerting leverage on companies here in the United States, where they do have jurisdiction. For example, they would require American service providers to block the domain names (for example, ""piracy.com"") of overseas piracy sites. They would allow the government to sue American sites like Google and Facebook -- and even blogs -- to remove links to the piracy sites. And they would give the government the right to cut off the piracy sites' funding; they could require American payment companies (like PayPal) and advertisers to cut off the foreign accounts.The outrage reminds me of the controversy over global warming. Yes, there are climate-change deniers. But nobody seems to notice that they are in two totally different camps, making totally different arguments. Some people deny that there has been any climate change at all. Others acknowledge the climate change, but deny that people have anything to do with it. These two categories of people actually are not on the same side at all.In the case of SOPA and PIPA, too, there are two groups. Some people are O.K. with the goals of the bills, acknowledging that software piracy is out of control; they object only to the bills' approaches. If the entertainment industry's legal arm gets out of control, they say, they could deem almost anything to be a piracy site. YouTube could be one, because lots of videos include bits of TV shows and copyrighted music. Facebook could be one, because people often link to copyrighted videos and songs. Google and Bing would be responsible for removing every link to a questionable Web site. Just a gigantic headache. But there is another group of people with a different agenda. They don't even agree with the purpose of the bills. They don't want their free movies taken away. A good number of them believe that free music and movies are their natural-born rights. They don't want the big evil government taking away their free fun. For the record, I think the movie companies have approached the digital age with almost slack-jawed idiocy. The rules for watching online movies from authorized sites are absurd (24 hours to finish the movie? Have they never heard of bedtime?). And there are plenty of movies, even big ones, that you can't rent or stream online at all. (The original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, the first three ""Indiana Jones"" movies and hundreds of others.)It should occur to these movie studios that if you do not give people a legal way to buy what they want, they will find another way to get it.At the same time, what the piracy sites are doing doesn't seem quite fair, either. Yes, it's a quirk of the Internet that you can duplicate something infinitely and distribute it at no cost. But that does not make it O.K. to shoplift, especially when the stolen goods are for sale at a reasonable price from legitimate sources. Yes, even if the company you are robbing is huge, profitable and led by idiots.In this case, the solution is to work on the language of the bills to rule out the sorts of abuses that the big Web sites fear. (And to fix the other minor point, which is that the bills will not work. For example, they would make American Internet companies block your access to domain names like ""piracy.com,"" but you would still be able to get to them by typing their underlying numerical Internet addresses, like 197.12.34.56. In other words, anybody with a modicum of technical skill would easily sidestep the barriers.)As it turns out, that is exactly what's happening. Dozens of members of Congress, and the White House itself, have dropped support of the bills; their sponsors are considering big changes to the proposals. (They might look, for starters, at the suggestions in Wednesday's Times editorial: ""The legislation could be further amended to narrow the definition of criminality and clarify that it is only aimed at foreign sites. And it could tighten guarantees of due process. Private parties must first get a court order to block business with a Web site they deem infringing on their copyrights."")In other words, the protests were effective. There is no chance that the bills will become law in their current forms. But it was a sloppy success. The scare language used by some of the Web sites was just as flawed as the Congressional language that they opposed. (I actually have sympathy - just a tiny bit - for the frustration of the music business. It was put nicely by Cary Sherman, chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America: ""It's very difficult to counter the misinformation when the disseminators also own the platform."")Finally, not enough people have acknowledged that the opposition was arguing two totally different points - the ""you're going about it the wrong way"" group and the ""we want our illegal movies!"" group.In the new world of Internet versus government, the system worked. The people spoke, government listened, and that's good. But let us do it responsibly, people. Both sides have an obligation to do the right thing. "
"After Protest, Wikipedia Says 'We're Not Done Yet'","The (day)long national nightmare is over.After midnight on Thursday, 24 hours after Wikipedia's blackout began as part of a protest against two online piracy bills, the site returned to normal. Gone was the spooky black-and-white Web page from Wednesday with an accompanying message: ""Imagine a World Without Free Knowledge.""Across its banner on Thursday, Wikipedia thanked visitors for ""protecting"" the site. ""We're not done yet,"" a new message read, parenthetically.The Stop Online Piracy Act in the House and the Protect IP Act in the Senate are intended in large part to curb illegal downloading of TV shows and movies online. But critics fear the legislation would give media companies too much power to shut down sites they deem to be copyright abusers.According to Wikipedia, more than 162 million people saw the site's protest on Wednesday. More than 12,000 commented on a blog post announcing the blackout, with a ""breathtaking majority"" supporting it, the site said. Wikipedia also cited some of the day's popular topics on Twitter: #factswithoutwikipedia, #SOPAstrike, and #wikipediablackout.And about eight million visitors, Wikipedia said, looked up their elected representatives' contact information Wednesday using a tool provided on the site.""You shut down Congress's switchboards,"" the site said. ""You melted their servers. Your voice was loud and strong. Millions of people have spoken in defense of a free and open Internet.""The site warned that ""SOPA and PIPA are not dead"" but merely ""waiting in the shadows.""""As Wikipedia went dark, you've directed your energy to protecting it,"" the message continued. ""We're turning the lights back on. Help us keep them shining brightly."" "
Investment Firm Y Combinator Goes on Offensive Against Hollywood,"After the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect Intellectual Property Act were shelved on Friday, some Web sites and venture capitalists went on the offensive against the people and companies behind the controversial piracy bills.Y Combinator, an early stage investment company, announced on its Web site that it planned to finance start-up companies that would go after Hollywood and the movie industry.Referring to Hollywood, Y Combinator wrote: ""The people who run it are so mean and so politically connected that they could do a lot of damage to civil liberties and the world economy on the way down. It would therefore be a good thing if competitors hastened their demise.""The blog post, which was titled ""Kill Hollywood,"" also offered advice to start-ups and entrepreneurs who wanted to help to hasten its demise. Suggestions included developing start-ups that created new ways to produce and distribute shows, and games that were similar to traditional shows but were more interactive.Marco Arment, a developer and the founder of Instapaper, wrote a similar post on his Web site, stating that people needed to fight back against Hollywood after it managed to get the piracy bills into Congress.""Such ridiculous, destructive bills should never even pass committee review,"" Mr. Arment wrote. The real problem, he added, is ""the MPAA's buying power in Congress,"" a reference to the Motion Picture Association of America. ""This is a campaign finance problem."" "
Fleet of Pricey Cars Seized at Megaupload Founder's Mansion," Updated | 11:55 a.m. As our colleague Ben Sisario reports, authorities in the United States charged the founder of Megaupload, one of the Internet's most popular file-sharing sites, and six others in charge of its operation with running a criminal piracy enterprise causing $500 million in damages to copyright owners. While the charges were announced in the United States, authorities in New Zealand swooped in by helicopter on the pastoral Auckland home of the Megaupload founder, Kim Dotcom (born Kim Schmitz) as part of a global effort to seize the Web site and roughly $50 million in personal and company assets. Those assets included art, electronics, cash and cars. Lots and lots of cars.  When he saw the news, a Web developer from Auckland named Elliott Kember rushed to the scene of the raid with a camera. Mr. Kember later uploaded several photographs of the pricey vehicles to Flickr.Among the cars, whose total value the police estimated at $4.8 million, was a Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe and a pink 1959 Cadillac. An Al Jazeera video report on the raid includes footage of the pink Cadillac being hauled away.Mr. Kember posted some of his images on Twitter from the scene, including the image below, before posting a set on Flickr and alerting TechCrunch, which published several of them.  Mr. Kamber also took note of the cars' expressive vanity plates: GOD, EVIL, HACKER, KIM COM, STONED, MAFIA, POLICE, CEO and V (presumably after the film ""V for Vendetta,"" a hacker favorite).Outside the #megaupload house still. Cars omg cars. All being towed. twitter.com/elliottkember/- Elliott Kember (@elliottkember) January 20, 2012A neighbortold the The New Zealand Heraldthat she had never met Mr. Dotcom or his associates but had often seen them driving in their cars or heard his private helicopter flying off. ""And everything's in black. They all dress in black. It's very surreal,"" she said. The woman, who did not give her name to the paper, assumed the raid by authorities was just him leaving by air again.""I thought it was his private helicopter, which is parked up behind the trees, and I thought he was going out for breakfast, as he sometimes does,"" she said.

Shuttering of Megaupload Sends File-Sharing Sites Packing,"The federal government's takedown of the file-sharing site Megaupload last week has sent file-sharing sites packing-- in some cases, to Russia.A number of file-sharing sites, spooked by the Megaupload indictment, have moved to limit piracy on their own sites. Some are shutting altogether. And elsewhere, so-called ""hacktivists"" are busy building Megaupload copycats, this time on Russian servers where American authorities cannot so easily take them down.The case against Megaupload, which is detailed in a 72-page criminal indictment, asserted that the site not only profited from the distribution of copyrighted goods but openly encouraged it with an ""Uploader Rewards"" program that offered cash incentives to users who stored the most downloaded files on the site.But Megaupload was hardly the only file-sharing site that incentivized users to upload popular content. In the last 48 hours, a number of file-sharing sites have abolished their rewards programs and begun deleting user accounts and files en masse, with others calling it quits altogether.According to TorrentFreak, a blog devoted to all things file-sharing, the storage sites 4shared, VideoBB and VideoZer have all closed their rewards programs and started deleting user accounts and files. Filesonic, Fileserve, FileJungle and UploadStation now forbid users from downloading any content they did not upload themselves. Smaller file-sharing sites like UploadBox and x7.to are closing. A message on the UploadBox site warns users, ""All files will be deleted on January 30th. Feel free to download the files you store with UploadBox until this date.""That, says Orin S. Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University, has been the goal of federal prosecutors all along.  In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Kerr told The New York Times, ""The goal of the Megaupload indictment is to push and prod other companies to take copyright infringement more seriously.""But some file-sharing operators are simply moving their operations abroad. Uploaded.to has banned United States Internet addresses from its site in an effort to keep American users - and federal prosecutors - at bay. Meanwhile, hackers affiliated with the loose collective Anonymous are working to build a Megaupload copycat site, Anonyupload.com, on Russian servers.""We hope to launch the online version of the site in less than 3 days (on Wednesday, January 25),"" a message on the site reads. ""For your safety, our infrastructure will be out of the U.S. jurisdiction (Russia).""Anthony Falzone, a lecturer at Stanford University's law school, notes piracy cases have traditionally been difficult to prosecute because they require cooperation from foreign governments. Sites containing pirated materials are often hosted in China and Russia, where government cooperation has been tenuous at best. Federal authorities were only able to take down Megaupload and arrest its operators --  the site was based in Hong Kong and its executives lived in New Zealand -- because of cooperation from Hong Kong and New Zealand.The Justice Department hasn't had the same luck in Russia, where Anonyupload.com will supposedly operate. Russia and China consistently rank at the top of the Office of the United States Trade Representative's annual Priority Watch List of the world's worst piracy offenders. (Last year, China ranked first, Russia second).Unlike Megaupload's ostentatious founder, Kim Dotcom, the developers of Anonyupload have pledged to offer their file-sharing services free. The site is now soliciting donations.Now, who wants to hand their files and credit card details over to Anonymous? "
Symantec Says Hackers Tried Extortion," Hackers made good on a threat to post the source code for Symantec's popular PCAnywhere antivirus product Monday night and threatened to post the remainder of the Symantec code in their possession on Tuesday. Symantec said the hackers offered to stop releasing the company's code if they were given money, while the hackers said the company offered payment first.The hacker group, which calls itself the Lords of Dharmaraja and says it is affiliated with the loose hacking collective Anonymous, posted 1.27 gigabytes of Symantec source code on The Pirate Bay, a file-sharing site, Monday night, as first reported by Forbes. By Tuesday afternoon, the source code had already been distributed hundreds of times. The hackers claimed to have initially discovered Symantec's source code in a hack on India's military and intelligence servers last January. On Jan. 6, the hackers released snippets of source code for two older Symantec products from 2006. In a post on the message board Pastebin, the hackers wrote, ""We have discovered within the Indian Spy Program source codes of a dozen software companies."" They said those companies had signed agreements with an Indian defense program and the country's Central Bureau of Investigation.Cris Paden, a Symantec spokesman, said that shortly after the hackers posted that initial source code,  a hacker using the name Yamatough, who claimed to represent Anonymous, contacted the company via e-mail.""Anonymous actually reached out to us first, saying that if we provided them with money, they would not post any more source code,"" Mr. Paden said. ""At that point, given that it was a clear-cut case of extortion, we contacted law enforcement and turned the investigation over to them."" Early Tuesday, Yamatough offered a different version of the story on Twitter, writing: ""You won't believe it but Symantec offered us money to keep quiet."" On Pastebin, the hacker posted a chain of e-mails between himself and someone named Sam Thomas, who Symantec later said was a law enforcement official impersonating one of its executives. In the e-mails, the hacker demands money in exchange for not releasing the remainder of Symantec's source code. ""Sam Thomas"" responds by offering to pay $50,000 in $2,500 increments. In the hackers' latest e-mail correspondence, dated Monday, they give Symantec ten minutes to wire a lump $50,000 sum to an offshore Liberty Reserve account. After Symantec asked for more time, the hackers posted the code.Mr. Paden said that because the investigation was continuing, he could not disclose which law enforcement agencies were involved. Symantec has been preparing for the likelihood that hackers would eventually release its source code, Mr. Paden said, noting that the company had developed a series of patches for its PCAnywhere product and distributed them to users on Jan. 23. He added that Symantec expects the hackers to post the remainder of the source code in their possession, including code for its Norton Antivirus Corporate Edition and Norton SystemWorks products, both of which he said ""no longer exist.""  Demanding payment in exchange for keeping proprietary information off of the Internet would be a new tactic for Anonymous-affiliated hackers. The group often attacks Web sites and organizations for activist purposes. Last year, it attacked PayPal in retaliation for its blocking of donations to WikiLeaks and invaded Sony's PlayStation Network in retaliation for lawsuits against PlayStation hackers. And just last month, it attacked the Web sites of the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, the United States Copyright Office, and others, in response to proposed anti-piracy legislation and the takedown of the popular file-sharing site Megaupload.

Man Pleads Guilty to Making Online Threats Against 'South Park' Creators,"One of the men arrested for making threatening comments about the creators of ""South Park"" on a radical religious Web site pleaded guilty on Thursday to federal charges, The Associated Press reported.The man, Jesse Curtis Morton, went by the name Younus Abdullah Mohammad when he and another man, Zachary A. Chesser, wrote on a Web site called Revolution Muslim that an episode of ""South Park,"" an animated series on Comedy Central, had insulted the Prophet Muhammad.In the episode, the denizens of South Park are introduced to a character wearing a bear costume who they are told is the Muslim prophet. When the episode was first shown in April 2010, a message appeared on Revolution Muslim saying that the ""South Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone ""will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh for airing this show."" Mr. Van Gogh was slain by an Islamic radical in 2004 after making a film about the abuse of Muslim women. After the Web site message appeared, Comedy Central censored a follow-up ""South Park"" episode in which the character in the bear suit was instead revealed to be Santa Claus.Mr. Morton was arrested in Morocco last October. He pleaded guilty at a hearing in federal court in Virginia to counts of conspiracy, communicating threats and using the Internet to intimidate, The A.P. said. Mr. Chesser, who also went by the name Abu Talhah Al-Amrikee, was arrested in July 2010 and was sentenced last year to 25 years in prison. "
Piracy Twits,"If I didn't value the First Amendment so dearly, I'd be tempted to propose a law keeping irony out of the hands of the clueless.The other day I wrote a columnsuggesting a reasoned approach to protecting writers, artists, musicians, filmmakers, journalists, etc. against online piracy. There was, in the comment thread, a lot of passionate and thoughtful discussion - much of it hostile to the idea of protecting the right of content-makers to be paid for their work, but there's no point in writing columns if everyone agrees with them. I responded to some of the critics the next day in a blog post.By coincidence, a couple of days before my column ran, another Times columnist, Joe Nocera, wrote in fulsome praise of Clark Booth, a Boston sportswriter who - in a prescient 1976 piece in the alt-weekly Real Paper - highlighted the long-term health dangers of football. Joe's column linked to a PDF file of the groundbreaking article he admired so much. Since the Real Paper is long defunct and its archives have not been digitized, this (I assume) seemed a logical way to let today's readers see Booth's work and pay it homage. This uploading of the archival article became, in the tendentious hands of a Boston Phoenix writer, a tremendous Irony - one NYT columnist endorsing stronger copyright protection while a different NYT columnist allegedly ""stole"" Booth's work. (The Phoenix is the corporate heir to the Real Paper.) And that became both an occasion for a little healthy Times-bashing, important in the currency of alt-weekly street cred, and a chance for a populist screed against laws to protect content-makers. At least, I think that was the point of the screed.What originated as a pretty clumsy polemic in The Phoenix deteriorated when it hit social media. In the reductionist world of Twitter, it became ""The Times stole our column while Keller was whining about piracy,"" or, as the issue moved down the evolutionary scale to the knuckle-draggers, ""Keller stole a column,"" though nobody has suggested I had anything to do with the disputed PDF file except - Irony! - the timing of my column on copyright. To plagiarize myself from a long-ago column: Whether or not Twitter makes you stupid, it certainly makes some smart people sound stupid.The silliness of this episode is pretty obvious on the face of it, but to be clear:In my column and blog post I disparaged some of the recent attempts to expand copyright enforcement, and said reforms of the law should be focused on genuine pirates who profit by distributing films, music, books, etc. (sure, columns, too) that belong to other people. The law should not go after minor transgressions. Moreover, I specifically said a real reform should also relax some copyright protections - such as cases where a work that is long out of print could be made widely available to a new audience. Nowhere did I suggest that the law should criminalize the illustrative uploading of a 36-year-old alt-weekly article that is otherwise unavailable.I leave to lawyers - if any care to waste the time - to argue whether making that PDF available crossed any line in the copyright law. But I think this episode fails both the so-what test and the definition of irony.By the way, when the Boston Phoenix objected, The Times took down the PDF, triumphantly depriving Clark Booth of the chance to be read by a lot of current readers. I hope the Phoenix will do its writer the favor of posting it somewhere. Joe Nocera was right. "
Google Gets a High-Profile Lobbyist,"Google has become embroiled in a slew of high-profile issues in Washington in recent months, from Internet piracy and online gambling to privacy controls and antitrust claims.Now it has a high-profile lobbyist to help it navigate the federal waters. The Internet giant announced on Thursday that it has hired Susan Molinari, the former Republican congresswoman from New York, as its Washington lobbyist in a move that seems designed to strengthen its influence among conservatives in the rough-and-tumble world of K Street.Ms. Molinari is ""a true trailblazer,"" Google's senior vice president, David Drummond, said in announcing the move. ""Her enthusiasm for our technology and its potential to change lives will be a real asset to our team in the Americas,"" he said. A lobbyist since 1999, she replaces Alan Davidson, who announced last year that he was leaving Google after building its Washington lobbying shop into an influential $11 million-a-year operation.  With about a dozen in-house lobbyists and more than 100 outside lobbyists that it uses, the company ranks as one of the biggest spenders among corporate lobbyists, and it has moved more aggressively in recent years to shape dozens of pieces of legislation that affect its search engine and Internet businesses. While Google has won many of its legislative battles, it has come under rising attack from privacy proponents, antitrust regulators, movie industry advocates and others in Washington who see its influence over the Internet as too great. Indeed, one of Ms. Molinari's first challenges may be to recast Google's image as something other than a near-omnipotent Internet force. Some lobbying analysts saw as telling the company's shift to Ms. Molinari, a longtime Washington insider with relatively little experience in Internet affairs, from Mr. Davidson, a former computer scientist who came to Google from the Center for Democracy and Technology, a policy group that pushes for an open Internet. Ms. Molinari, in contrast to Mr. Davison, is ""an experienced Washington hand"" who has represented a wide range of blue-chip corporate interests inside capital corridors, said the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit research group that analyzes lobbying.As a former congresswoman from Staten Island who is married to Bill Paxon -- another former Republican representative from New York -- Ms. Molinari also boasts extensive ties to the party's establishment. She has donated more than $200,000 exclusively to Republican candidates, while Mr. Davidson gave political contributions in much smaller amounts and mainly to Democrats, the Sunlight Foundation noted. Google, like many corporations, has looked to strengthen its Republican ties since the party took over control of the House last year.  "
"Hackers, and Soda, Head to Madison Avenue","Madison Avenue is borrowing another page from the Silicon Valley crowd as a leading media agency plays host to a weekend-long ""hackathon,"" with the involvement of the music streaming service Spotify and four big marketer clients.The hack weekend, as it is being billed, is to begin on Friday night and run through Sunday. The host is OMD, part of the Omnicom Media Group division of the Omnicom Group.The four OMD clients taking part are the CW television network, McDonald's, the Mountain Dew soft drink sold by PepsiCo and State Farm Insurance. All four use music as part of their advertising, marketing and branding initiatives.OMD is inviting hundreds of developers to hack away at the Spin table tennis club in Manhattan, with about 150 signed up to date. The developers will be asked to compete against each other and build apps or products on the new Spotify music apps A.P.I., or application programming interface.(What does that mean? Ask a hacker.)The prizes to be awarded on Sunday night will include a grand prize of $10,000.""A lot of innovation is driven by hackathons,"" said Jonathan Haber, chief innovation officer at OMD.""This is an opportunity for advertisers to push the boundaries of innovation,"" he added, ""and an opportunity for developers to build relationships with advertisers.""This is the first event for OMD like this with brand involvement, Mr. Haber said, a statement that was echoed by Jeff Levick, chief advertising officer at Spotify.""What's surprised us is the level of enthusiasm coming out of the developer community,"" Mr. Levick said.The developers are not required to include brands in what they build during the event; representatives of the brands will be on hand during the weekend for advice and consultation.""It made a lot of sense for us"" to take part ""as consumers change their behavior with how they discover music,"" said Jamal Henderson, senior brand manager for Mountain Dew at Pepsi Americas Beverages, part of PepsiCo.The Mountain Dew brand has a music initiative, Green Label Sound, and one of its bands, MNDR, will play during the hack weekend ""while the hackers hack,"" Mr. Henderson said, laughing.Also on hand will be copious quantities of Mountain Dew because of its abilities to help developers ""hack all night,"" he added.Jenny Danzi, assistant brand manager on Mountain Dew, will be at the event and serve as a judge.""Music is very important to us,"" said Caty Burgess, vice president for media strategies at CW, which is owned by CBS  and Time Warner. She will be at the hack weekend, too, she added, calling herself ""an O.K. Ping-Pong player.""""I have people in my office every day"" pitching ideas, Ms. Burgess said. ""One of the exciting things about this is that it's nice to get ahead of that.""Ed Gold, advertising director at State Farm, said he welcomed a chance to have apps and products built ""with State Farm in mind"" after seeing ""hackathons produce great new products at so many tech companies like Facebook, Google and beyond.""""State Farm has always used music as a platform to reach passionate audiences,"" Mr. Gold said, ""and with Spotify playing such a large role in how consumers enjoy music we want to be on the forefront of what they're doing.""

Interpol Site Knocked Offline Following Anonymous Arrests,"Interpol's Web site went down Tuesday just hours after the international police agency announced the arrest of 25 suspected members of the hacking collective Anonymous in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Spain.On Twitter, hackers affiliated with Anonymous took credit for the attack and openly encouraged their sympathizers to keep Interpol's site offline by flooding its servers with traffic.The attack followed Interpol's announcement Tuesday that it had arrested suspected Anonymous hackers in an operation it called Operation Unmask. With cooperation from authorities in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Spain, Interpol said it seized 250 pieces of technology equipment and mobile phones at 40 premises across 15 cities. Interpol said authorities had seized credit cards and cash from the some of the hackers, ages 17 to 40.Interpol said it started the operation in mid-February following a series of coordinated cyber attacks against Spanish political parties' Web sites; Colombia's defense ministry and presidential Web sites; Chile's national library; Endesa, a Chilean electricity company; and other targets. The same hackers who claimed credit for bringing down Interpol's site on Twitter also recently claimed credit for an attempted attack on a Vatican Web site last August that was unsuccessful.The arrest follows a string of increasingly bold attacks by Anonymous. Earlier this month, the group knocked the C.I.A. Web site offline. A week earlier, the group intercepted a conference call between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Scotland Yard and released a 16-minute recording of the call. Since then, hackers affiliated with Anonymous even threatened to ""shut the Internet down on March 31"" by attacking servers that perform switchboard functions for the Internet.As of Tuesday evening, Interpol's site was still down. "
Hackers Lash Out at LulzSec Leader Turned 'Snitch',"""The federal government is run by a bunch of cowards,"" read a post to the Twitter account of The Real Sabu, who added an unkind embellishment to describe the type of cowards he meant. ""Don't give in to these people,"" he added. ""Fight back. Stay strong.""That was Monday.The Federal Bureau of Investigations announced on Tuesday that the man behind that account, Hector Xavier Monsegur, known online as Sabu among other aliases, had pleaded guilty to computer crimes on Aug. 15, 2011. Mr. Monsegur had been cooperating with law enforcement officials to provide information on the hacking group Lulz Security, according to a report by Fox News that included pictures of a 28-year-old man said to be Mr. Monsegur.Before his arrest, Mr. Monsegur appeared to have been the leader of Lulz Security, or LulzSec, a group thought to be closely affiliated with Anonymous, a larger online collective of so-called hacktivists. (These computer activists differ from mainstream cybercriminals in that they describe their attacks as being motivated by ideals rather than financial gain.) Five other members of the group were arrested on Tuesday, as my colleague Somini Sengupta reported. Hacktivists reacted with anger at Mr. Monsegur almost as soon as the story of his cooperation with the F.B.I. emerged on Tuesday. The Twitter account of WikiLeaks, which has expressed sympathy with Anonymous and LulzSec, described him as a ""traitor"" soon after the Fox News story was posted.  Luzsec ""leader"" Sabu a traitor cooperating with feds, according to FOX foxnews.com/scitech/2012/0#anonymous#luzsec- WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 6, 2012That was followed by a string of updates, under a profane hashtag critical of Mr. Monsegur, from an account affiliated with Anonymous. The posts stressed that actions under the banner of Anonymous would not be halted by the arrests. ""You can't snitch on an idea,"" a post read.Mr. Monsegur's own Twitter account also came under scrutiny on Tuesday for signs that he had been cooperating with the federal authorities. Indeed, he posted several updates on Monday that touched on dealing with pressure from the authorities, but he appeared to advise others on Twitter against cooperating and not to let others get away with doing so. These posts had a different ring on Tuesday, as Jeffrey Carr, a computer security expert, observed. ""So you're telling me,"" he asked at one point during a discussion with another Twitter user, ""if you get locked up, and your nosey neighbor who dropped the dime on you runs free - you would simply ignore?"" He also wrote at one point on Monday: ""The feds at this moment are scouring our lives without warrants. Without judges approval. This needs to change. Asap.""Fox News reported that Mr. Monsegur, who took his alias from a Staten Island-born professional wrestler, Sabu the Elephant Boy, had been working for the F.B.I. since his arrest last August. A copy of the charges against him, filed on Aug. 15, 2011, was posted on Tuesday. Less than two months before his arrest, logs of conversations between Sabu and others at LulzSec were leaked to The Guardian after the group hacked a company affiliated with the F.B.I. Sabu reportedly told those who quit LulzSec in the wake of that attack that they were ""not up for the heat."" ""You realize we smacked the FBI today,"" he wrote. ""This means everyone in here must remain extremely secure.""Among the details to emerge on Tuesday about Mr. Monsegur's background: he lived in a public housing project on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Fox News reported, and he may have attended one of New York's elite public high schools, according to BuzzFeed. (Coincidentally, the school, Stuyvesant High School, served as the backdrop for several scenes in the 1995 film ""Hackers."")In 2007, The Times reported on a Monsegur family whose elderly matriarch lived in what appeared to be the same housing project, the Jacob Riis Houses in Manhattan. Her son, Hector Monsegur, then 40-years-old, was prevented from visiting his mother because of a drug conviction in 1997.It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Monsegur, the hacker arrested on Tuesday, was related.

"After Hacker Arrests, an Attack on the Vatican and a Growing Anxiety"," After authorities indicted five hackers on Tuesday with the help of their ringleader-turned-F.B.I.-informant, Hector Xavier Monsegur, other activist hackers faced an existential crisis and uncertain future.In online chat rooms favored by the group Anonymous, some wondered who else among them were F.B.I. informants. ""It'll be hard to clean up this whole mess,"" one member said.In an effort to show strength, hackers affiliated with Anonymous claimed credit for knocking the Web site of the Vatican offline on Wednesday. The site, www.vatican.va, was inaccessible for several hours in the afternoon and evening.Hackers hailed the attack on the online bulletin board Pastebin and listed several grievances with the church. But the real motive for their attack appeared in the proclamation, ""Anonymous is still alive.""The attack was meant to ""flex the Anonymous muscle,"" said Mary Landesman, a security researcher at Cisco Systems. ""It was intended to say 'You can cut off one head, but there are many of us here.'""For over a year, hackers had tried but failed to take down the Vatican's Web presence, mostly in an effort to drum up media attention for their cause. Last August, they tried and failed to take down a Web site set up by the Vatican to support a church-related event in Madrid.Hackers had discussed that target as early as May 2010. In an online chat room that month, hackers said an attack on the Vatican would be ""guaranteed news coverage as long as it hits hard, does damage and can be sustained for several days.""The effort on Wednesday, which lasted only a few hours, rang hollow for many who follow the group.""There is a lot of paranoia out there right now,"" said Jennifer Emick, a former Anonymous activist who left the movement and now works as a security researcher at BackTrace Security. ""The days of wild hacking sprees are over. The consequences have finally hit home.""Security experts said that contrary to Anonymous's banner, Tuesday's arrests made clear that there might no longer be such a thing as true anonymity on the Internet. Two people briefed on the federal investigation said that the F.B.I. knew the identities of Mr. Monsegur and the five other hackers for over a year, well before they arrested Mr. Monsegur and turned him into an informant last June.In most cases, hackers disclosed their identities themselves by failing to cover their online tracks with anonymity software. In some cases, they simply divulged too much about their attack tactics in public  chat rooms. After the HBGary attack in February 2011, for instance, Mr. Monsegur and Jake Davis, another hacker arrested last July, revealed the Web site they had used to attack the firm. That revelation alone disclosed their I.P. addresses.Sam Bowne, a hacking expert who teaches ethical hacking at City College San Francisco, said Tuesday's arrests were not likely to deter Anonymous's core hackers but would make any newcomers think twice.""Newcomers will be reminded the consequences are severe,"" said Mr. Bowne. ""They have been told they won't get caught, that what they're doing is legal. This is a reminder it's all lies."" "
Daily Report: Hackers Can't Trust Their Own,"From a base of operations in his late grandmother's sixth-floor apartment in a public housing project on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Hector Xavier Monsegur, known as Sabu on Twitter,  taunted law enforcement and urged fellow hackers to attack them, reports Somini Sengupta in The New York Times.On Tuesday, in what could be one of thebiggest breakthroughs in the government crackdown on a loose, large confederation of politically inspired ""hacktivists,"" law enforcement officials in New York unmasked and revealed the Anonymous hacker who they said helped them catch several fellow hackers in Europe and the United States. They said he had been informing on fellow hackers all while he instigated attacks.Four men in Britain and Ireland were charged Tuesday with computer crimes; a fifth man was arrested Monday in Chicago. The prosecutions are part of a wave of coordinated efforts to rein in a leaderless, multinational movement called Anonymous. Just last week, Interpol announced the arrests of 25 people suspected of being Anonymous members in Europe.Ars Technica reports how the F.B.I. tracked an Anonymous member in Chicago. A report in Wired.com says: ""While these arrests are devastating for the mediagenic hacking wing of Anonymous, other parts of the collective that more involved in traditional activism remain largely untouched."" Anonymous responded to the arrests, Forbes reports. Bloomberg reports on Digital Bond, a security company, that recruited elite hackers to show the world how to sabotage the computer systems that run nuclear power generators, oil and gas pipelines and other ""critical infrastructure"" - in the name of improving their safety.

Daily Report: Portrait of a Hacker,"In The New York Times on Friday, N.R. Kleinfield and Somini Sengupta paint a portrait of Hector Xavier Monsegur, known on the Internet as Sabu. As a federal informant, Mr. Monsegur, 28, helped bring down a group of politically motivated ""hacktivists"" in Europe and the United States, who were indicted on Tuesday on computer crime charges.Mr. Monsegur's base of operations was an apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He attended high school in New York, but left in 2001 without finishing the ninth grade. In recent years, he had been unemployed, the authorities said. They said he was active in computer and hacking circles as far back as the late 1990s.In 2010, Mr. Monsegur said in a magazine interview, he was drawn to Anonymous, a leaderless, anti-authoritarian movement that has taken up various political causes. The catalyst, he said, was his outrage over the arrest of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, the whistle-blower site. He became leader of a splinter group, Lulz Security, or LulzSec.Mr. Monsegur's neighbors on the Lower East Side found him an irksome presence, complaining about noise from his apartment. ""He partied all night,"" one neighbor said. ""I always made complaints to the police. Nothing was done."" "
Digital Notes: A Boss for 'Six Strikes' Copyright Enforcement,"Last summer, Internet service providers and entertainment trade groups agreed to a ""six strikes"" plan for controlling online piracy - a system of escalating pokes, prods and throttled Internet access for users suspected of infringing copyrights.A new group, the Center for Copyright Information, was set up to put the plan into effect. On Monday the group finally named an executive director and four board members, earning approving if still skeptical nods from some observers.Jill Lesser has been appointed the center's executive director. She is a former AOL executive who is on the board of the Center for Democracy and Technology and is a consultant to the Glover Park Group, a lobbying firm.The center also named several consumer advocates and research group members to its advisory board, including Gigi B. Sohn of the online rights group Public Knowledge; Jerry Berman of the Center for Democracy and Technology; Marsali Hancock of the Internet Keep Safe Coalition, which tracks online child safety issues; and Jules Polonetsky of the Future of Privacy Forum.In a statement, Ms. Lesser said she would protect the rights of artists and media companies.""The ease of distribution of copyrighted content has helped create a generation of people who believe that all content should be free,"" she wrote. ""The notion that artists and creators, and even the big companies that finance, produce and deliver their creations, don't have the right to own and control their distribution, simply cannot be.""The technology news site Ars Technica said the appointments suggested that the group might be ""making a serious effort to strike a balance between the interests of copyright holders and the rights of users."" TechDirt, another blog that has expressed doubts about the proposed system, said that the Center for Democracy and Technology is ""often on the correct side of these issues,"" but also noted that Glover Park was retained by the Motion Picture Association of America to promote the controversial Stop Online Piracy Act (which apparently, in that blog's view, represents the incorrect side).In its announcement, the copyright center said it would work with the American Arbitration Association to put in place a third-party review process for consumers. The copyright system's start is expected later this year.U2 and Dropbox: Bono and the Edge of U2 have invested in the cloud file hosting service Dropbox, as the company announced on Twitter.Executive Turntable: Ron Fair and Richard Palmese, two top former record executives, have joined Front Line Management, the artist management firm run by Irving Azoff and owned by Live Nation Entertainment. Mr. Fair helped develop the careers of Christina Aguilera, the Pussycat Dolls and the Black Eyed Peas and was most recently the chairman of Geffen Records, part of the Universal Music Group. Mr. Palmese is a radio promotion executive who has had a long association with Clive Davis, and was executive vice president for promotion at Sony's RCA Music Group.Both men have been signed to consulting deals with Front Line, which manages some 250 acts including the Eagles, Ms. Aguilera, Journey, Kenny Chesney and Jennifer Hudson. ""Our artists and managers have just hit the lottery,"" Mr. Azoff said in a statement about the appointments. "
The Twitter Hack Attack That Wasn't,"Hackers claiming to be part of the Anonymous group released what at first glance appeared to be usernames and passwords for 55,000 hacked Twitter accounts on Pastebin on Tuesday. But a closer look revealed that nearly half those accounts were duplicates and that the vast majority belonged to accounts that had been suspended by Twitter in the past.The breach was first reported on the blog, Air Demon, which aggregates news on hacking.According to Twitter, it appears that of the accounts that were supposedly hacked and pasted online, more than 20,000 were duplicate usernames. A majority of the accounts that were not duplicates appear to be suspended spam Twitter accounts.Carolyn Penner, a Twitter spokeswoman, said in an e-mail: ""We are currently looking into the situation. In the meantime, we have pushed out password resets to accounts that may have been affected. For those who are concerned that their account may have been compromised, we suggest resetting your passwords and more in our Help Center.""Many of the accounts that do have accurate usernames, have incorrect passwords, the company said.As a majority of the usernames that are listed in the Anonymous attack seem to be associated with Spam accounts, the files could have been released in retaliation for Twitter shutting down these accounts.Twitter is still taking the breach seriously though. High-profile accounts have been hacked several times in the past. The company said it is still investigating the situation. "
Following Your Children Online: How Much Is Too Much?,"I get a pitch from a P.R. person to cover some form of child-monitoring/Internet safety app, tool or device almost every day. Internet safety, however you define it, is both big business and a huge parental concern - and judging from the 230-plus comments so far on ""Big Brother? No, It's Parents"" in The Times today, we're not nearly done with  talking about how software can, and whether it should, help us monitor our children's lives online.But what is ""safety"" and what is the right kind of monitoring, or awareness, of children with mobile phones and Facebook and blogs and YouTube channels? Knowing, in some sense, what your child is doing online seems like a bare minimum, as does access to any public channels (which to my mind includes Facebook) the child is effectively broadcasting in - but from there, the lines get trickier. I find myself cheering for the app that tells the parent if a child is texting while driving (I have a friend whose husband needs to use that app on her). The risks of texting and driving are simply too great (and are shared by everyone on the road). But the father who can read every one of his child's texts? Tougher - but then, I read (or can read, I typically don't) every e-mail sent or received by my 10- and 8-year-olds. In my naïiveté as a parent of younger children, I favor the parents who trade access for access - as in, you can have a phone/Facebook account/laptop only as long as you agree that I can look at its content at any time: texts, updates, browsing history and all. But that's me now, without the problem. Ask me in seven years, when I have four teenagers in the house, and I suspect I'll say something different. That, of course, is why we see this issue covered again and again. The Internet changes, the devices change - and the teenagers and parents change as well.What's the right level of parental supervision for a child with a life online - and is privacy, or safety, the greater concern? "
Skout Reopens Social App for Teenagers,"Just one month ago, Skout, a mobile app, was forced to close down its social network for 13- to 17-year-olds when three adults were arrested after using the app to prey on minors and, authorities said, sexually assault them.On Friday, the company plans to reopen the service to children,with additional security measures in place.The company appointed a task force of security specialists last month to help it improve security and find better ways to vet users' ages online. The company will start using several of those features beginning Friday. But age verification, security experts say, can be very difficult if not downright impossible online.""We can never guarantee that our system is 100 percent bulletproof,"" Christian Wiklund, Skout's founder, said in an interview Friday. ""It never will be. What we can guarantee is that the service will be much, much safer than before.""Mr. Wiklund said the company planned to rely more heavily on Facebook - which prohibits users under the age of 13 - to verify users' ages by forcing members to enter the service through ""Facebook Connect,"" a service that allows Facebook users to log in to other Web sites through their Facebook accounts. If the birth date a user provides to Skout does not match that user's age on Facebook, Skout will automatically ban that user's smartphone from ever accessing the service.But all it takes to create an account on a social network, including Facebook, is an e-mail address and a birth date, and people can easily lie. Skout's new policies rely even more heavily on Facebook, which itself has acknowledged that children under the age of 13 find ways onto the service. Facebook has said it is exploring ways to better verify the ages of its members and ultimately plans to open the service to children under the age of 13.Until Skout banned users from its teenage forum, teenagers had the ability to see other members' locations beyond a one-mile radius. Now, Mr. Wiklund said they will be able to see users' locations only beyond a 100-mile radius. He said the service would also erase teenage users' previous connections, chats and photo comments to keep them from reconnecting with people nearby who have not been verified with the additional layers of security.Additionally, Mr. Wiklund said Skout expanded its security and privacy team and was in the process of hiring a chief privacy officer. At least four staff members will vet each teenagers' photos to ensure they are appropriate and teenagers will no longer have the option to make their photos private.The company will also continue to work with Crowdflower, a start-up that crowdsources tasks - in this case photo scanning and text analysis - to a freelance labor force. Mr. Wiklund said the company was evaluating other potential partners, such as Jumio Inc., in Linz, Austria, which markets a technology that turns the camera on a personal computer or smartphone into an I.D. scanner.Skout has always relied to some extent on members to report inappropriate behavior. Until last month, the app guaranteed users that it would respond to reports within four hours. Mr. Wiklund said Skout now planned to speed up its guarantee response time to 15 minutes.He said the company would introduce additional authentication technologies starting Friday, but would not disclose further details for fear that sexual predators would exploit that information to find a workaround.Security experts say that sequestering adults and children online is extremely difficult. The methods that the pornography and gambling industries use to confirm ages online, like credit cards and driver licenses, are not typically available for minors. And federal privacy laws make it illegal for Web companies to knowingly collect personally identifiable information about children under the age of 13.Skout knows how difficult a task that can be. It originally started with an adult-only service but opened a separate service for 13- to17-year-olds after it discovered teenagers in the adult forum. It suspended the teenage forum last month after discovering that at least three adults had posed as teenagers.In one case, a 15-year-old Ohio girl said she had been raped by a 37-year-old man she met on Skout. In the second, a 24-year-old man was accused of raping a 12-year-old girl in Escondido, Calif. In the third, a 21-year-old man from Waukesha, Wis., is facing charges that he sexually assaulted a 13-year-old boy.In the month that the teenage forum has been suspended, Mr. Wiklund said the company faced complaints from teenage users.""I wouldn't call it a riot, but maybe an online riot,"" said Mr. Wiklund. ""We essentially slammed the door in their face,""Skout noticed many of its teenage users trying to join its adult community. To keep them from doing so, Skout made it impossible for users to ever create more than one account on their phone.""We will never be able to guarantee this is 100 percent safe - no system in the world is,"" Mr. Wiklund said. ""But I do feel comfortable with what we're launching today."" "
Daily Report: A Middleman in the Fight Over Digital Piracy,"In Friday's New York Times, Somini Sengupta reports on the case of Richard O'Dwyer, a 24-year-old college student from northern England who has found himself in the middle of the fierce  battle over piracy on the Internet.At issue is a Web site he founded, TVShack.net, that helped visitors find American movies and TV shows online. Although the site did not serve up pirated content, American authorities say it provided links to some sites that did. So the Obama administration is seeking to extradite him from Britain on criminal charges of copyright infringement. The possible punishment: 10 years in United States prison.The case is the government's most far-reaching effort so far to crack down on foreigners suspected of breaking American law. That is because it goes after a middleman, who, the authorities say, made a fair amount of money by pointing people to pirated content. Mr. O'Dwyer's backers say the prosecution goes too far, squelching his free speech right to publish links to other Web sites.However Mr. O'Dwyer's legal problems are resolved, the case against him reflects the complexities of wrestling with piracy in the digital age.The entertainment industry lobbied hard for antipiracy legislation, but Congress withdrew the bill earlier this year after an online uproar led by Web companies and their consumers. Another bill has been proposed on Capitol Hill to establish intellectual property attachés in American embassies. An international antipiracy treaty, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, or ACTA, was roundly rejected by the European Parliament last week.In the last two years, the Obama administration has shuttered about 800 Web sites suspected of piracy, including TVShack.net. In the most widely publicized case, the Justice Department has sought to extradite the operators of Megaupload, a site that let users anonymously share movies and music, to face charges of criminal copyright infringement.The extradition case against Mr. O'Dwyer has turned him into something of a cause célèbre. Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, is leading a crusade to have the charges dropped, with an online petition that has gathered over 225,000 signatures worldwide in two weeks. Still, British authorities have approved the extradition order; the case is on appeal. "
Cuomo Defends Efforts to Avoid Prying Eyes,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Wednesday defended his practice of communicating with his aides largely through untraceable BlackBerry messages, suggesting he was concerned that hackers could intercept his correspondence.Mr. Cuomo, speaking to reporters during an appearance at a company in Utica, said there was nothing wrong with his office's wariness about leaving a paper trail.""This government, like anyone in any community, this company, uses a number of different electronic devices to communicate,"" he  said.""I was in the attorney general's office,"" he added. ""Hacking is a problem, and if you have a secure communication or confidential communication or information that you don't want disseminated, then you have to find a secure means to communicate it.""Mr. Cuomo's comments came after articles in The New York Times and The Daily News this week detailed his office's efforts to shield its communications from public view.Mr. Cuomo does not use e-mail. Instead, he frequently communicates with his aides using messages sent from BlackBerry to BlackBerry - which are not retained in any way. Staff members also clear out their e-mail on a regular basis so their correspondence cannot be obtained under the Freedom of Information Law.Mr. Cuomo said, contrary to the criticism of his office, his administration had actually done more than its predecessors to preserve a record of its dealings. For example, he cited guidelines on retaining certain types of documents - although not e-mail, in most cases - that his office put in place this month.""We have the first policy of any state administration this early, on exactly what should be retained and how, basically for archives,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""So we have an aggressive policy that is in place."" "
Hacker Posts False Syria Information on Reuters Blog,"Reuters News temporarily suspended its opinion blog on Friday after an anonymous hacker broke in and wrote false information about Syria.""Reuters.com was a target of a hack on Friday,"" Thomson Reuters said in a statement. ""Our blogging platform was compromised and fabricated blog posts were falsely attributed to several Reuters journalists.""The false posts included what was presented as an interview with Riad al-Asaad, the head of the Free Syrian Army. In the fake interview, the leader was believed to have said that his forces were pulling back from the northern province of Aleppo after clashes with the Syrian army, according to Thomson Reuters.Thomson Reuters denied that the interview had taken place and said that the item had been removed. The company did not provide any information about who or what group carried out the hacking. The opinion section of Reuters came back online late Friday afternoon. Reuters posted an article about the hacking on its Web site. "
A New Twist on an Old Phone Swindle,"A couple of weeks ago I started getting persistent phone calls from an overseas number. The calls repeated in groups of five or so over a roughly 15-minute period before stopping. Then they would resume hours or days later. When I checked the number, I found it was from Ukraine.When I answered the call, after a pause the line would go dead. If I picked up the call but said nothing, I could hear ambient noise of a TV in the background, but no one said anything on the other end. Knowing the shenanigans scammers are up to in that part of the world, I resisted the temptation to call back.It was a good thing. The calls may be a twist on an old swindle. ""A lot of these calls are designed to get you to call back,"" said Charlie Douglas, a spokesman for my VoIP phone provider, Comcast. ""Then you get charged an inordinate amount of money for calling the Ukraine.""That's because the phone fee is set on the receiving end. It's a golden oldie for swindlers, who pull a similar stunt with charge-per-call 900 numbers.Usually the enticement to make the foreign call is an e-mail or voice mail message saying that you have an important message waiting: you need to claim an inheritance, a family member is injured - you get the idea.The twist in my case was that the enticement was to call back to say, ""Stop calling!"" This is especially true because my phone service would not allow me to block overseas calls myself.When I called the support line I was told that foreign calls could not be blocked at all. I escalated my call to a supervisor who told me the same thing. However, Mr. Douglas said that overseas numbers can be manually blocked by Comcast, and the support staff should have known that.So the advice here is, do not return repeated calls from mysterious foreign numbers. Do make repeat calls to your phone service until you can find someone who will block the calls for you. "
Is Facebook Straying From the 'Hacker Way'?,"Has Facebook lost its hacker way?In February, when the company filed to go public with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, included a letter about the culture of the company that had a section titled ""The Hacker Way.""""Hackers try to build the best services over the long term by quickly releasing and learning from smaller iterations rather than trying to get everything right all at once,"" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. ""We have the words 'Done is better than perfect' painted on our walls to remind ourselves to always keep shipping.""That same day, Mr. Zuckerberg posted a photo on his Timeline of a poster that said ""Stay focused & keep shipping."" Next to the image, he wrote: ""My desk.""But since this inspirational photo, the products Facebook has released have not exactly conveyed a hacker-style ""ship it"" mentality.In August, for example, Facebook announced that it was adding a new feature to the Timeline that allows people to say they are ""Expecting a Baby."" In July there were minor updates to Facebook groups and photos.Perhaps the biggest update since the company announced it was going public was the release of a new mobile application called Facebook Camera. Yet even that app was in the works for over a year before it finally shipped. The company's new, speedy mobile applications for Apple iOS devices have also been delayed.In Facebook's defense, when you release a product to hundreds of millions of people, it's important to make sure it works properly, without any problems. But there has to be a balance. Toward the end of his letter,  Mr. Zuckerberg seemed to address this issue by noting that it is important to ""move fast.""""Moving fast enables us to build more things and learn faster,"" he wrote. ""However, as most companies grow, they slow down too much because they're more afraid of making mistakes than they are of losing opportunities by moving too slowly.""He added: ""We have a saying: 'Move fast and break things.'"" The idea is that if you never break anything, you're probably not moving fast enough.""The problem is, by moving too slowly, as Facebook is doing, it is at risk of breaking the biggest and most important thing of all: the culture of the company and its hacker way. "
Starting Over After a Cyberattack Shuts Down the Business,"Last week we wrote about the situation faced by Peter Justen, chief executive of MyBizHomepage, after the company's former chief technology officer set in motion a series of crippling cyberattacks against the company's Web site.Once valued by its investors at $100 million, MyBizHomepage was founded in 2006 by Mr. Justen as a way to help small-business owners access financial metrics that can help them run their companies. But then, apparently angered by Mr. Justen's decision not to sell the company, the chief technology officer tried to start a competing company. When Mr. Justen found out, he fired the officer along with two co-conspirators. And that's when the cyberattacks began. They rendered the site all but useless, and Mr. Justen struggled with what to do next. In February 2009, Mr. Justen and his board concluded that they would have to take the site offline, which would effectively close the business and saddle board members like Joe Silbaugh, who had invested more than $1 million, with a devastating loss. ""We essentially had no choice because we no longer had a product,"" Mr. Justen said. ""We also decided to be up front about the decision and explain what happened along with an apology. When bad things happen you can hide under the rug and hope it goes away or you can go public with it and take the teeth out of the tiger. Some people were understanding while others were not.""The decision did not please the company's vendors, some of whom quickly filed suit over unpaid bills. But many of the company's channel partners, who helped distribute the product, decided to stay on. ""They told me they liked our product, and they were going to stick with us,"" Mr. Justen said. ""In tough times, you really get to see who your friends really are.""Ignoring advice from his lawyers, Mr. Justen, who also had invested heavily in the company, decided not to declare corporate bankruptcy because he did not want to give anyone the opportunity to purchase the company's intellectual property. He also turned down multiple offers to leave the company and take salaried employment. Rather, he asked his original investors to support him in rebuilding the company from scratch. ""We held a shareholder meeting and I told them I would kill myself in trying to restore the company to what it should have been,"" said Mr. Justen, who also liquidated his 401(k) and his children's college funds and invested the money in the company. ""Fortunately, they gave me that chance.""Mr. Justen spent the next two years rebuilding the company, which is now called Five Plus. It features an online subscription software package that synchronizes with a company's QuickBooks software and presents an easy-to-digest version of critical financial figures such as accounts payable, accounts receivable, cost of goods sold and cash on hand. The new software also embraces social media technology, enabling users to connect with each other and to compare their financial results with those of their industry peers.While the new business is up and running, Mr. Justen said he and the business remain under cyberattack. In one instance, he was forced to fend off a denial-of-service attack against the new site that attempted to redirect his customers to a site where fraud claims against Mr. Justen and the company's investors (including Mr. Justen's 87-year-old mother and deceased father) had been posted. Mr. Justen said he continues to work with the United States Secret Service in attempting to track down the former chief technology officer.After this case study was published last week, the unnamed former employee contacted The New York Times and identified himself as James Bird. He denied that he had been on the lam and offered an address in Santa Monica, Calif., where he said he is living. While asserting that Mr. Justen owes him $25,000, Mr. Bird acknowledged that he had in fact hacked the MyBizHomepage site.Mr. Justen discussed the experience -- and responded to reader comments -- in a brief interview that has been condensed and edited.Q.A.Yes, we paid him as a contractor and did have a Social Security number for him. But what are you going to do with it? He doesn't use it for anything we could track him with. He doesn't have credit cards or bank accounts. He paid cash for everything, including his car.Q.A.I had known him for more than 15 years. I was like a mentor to him. He came over to our house for dinner six times a month and played with my kids. He was a very talented software engineer and I highly trusted him.Q.A.He had stock options in the company that would vest over different triggers or events, like a sale. He was in line to make a substantial amount of money.Q.A.Yes, I was quite surprised. One of them had worked for me for three years as a trusted financial adviser. I think they just got caught up in the drama of it all. I terminated all three individuals on the same day.Q.A.Yes, I think all three of them worked together. Jim did the technical stuff and the other guys did the rest. They went to our clients and told them they were starting a new company and that Peter's company had failed. They would even pull up the site, which Jim would then crash, as proof.Q.A.I realize I made many mistakes and I have learned a number of things from this experience. Inspect what you expect and trust but verify come to mind. A big lesson I learned was to separate business from personal. I let my personal emotions cloud my better business judgment.Q.A.When you're a start-up, you have to make some tough calls about where to spend your money. You throw nickels around like they're manhole covers. At the time, there didn't seem to be any reason for us to spend $70,000 to verify something that didn't seem to be a risk. Jim was a cyber security expert. Our software was rock solid against attacks from the outside. I just never expected someone I trusted so much and had known for so long to do what he did from the inside. That's why with our new system, no one else has all the keys to the kingdom and we keep multiple copies of our backup code in different locations. We've taken as much precaution as is humanly possible to make sure this doesn't happen again.Q.A.The customer information was never a target. As part of our design, we never collected any personal data on our customers like bank account information. That was part of our design. All we collected was data like company revenues and receivables. But it wasn't connected to any personally identifiable information.Q.A.I'll admit that I thought some of the comments must have come from people who have never stepped foot in the arena and tried to start a company -- people who never shed blood, sweat and tears trying to build something. But when you hear from customers who tell you that what you built helped save their company, that's what makes it all worthwhile. "
Cambodia's Most Unwanted,"PHNOM PENH - The municipal council recently hung a neon sign across Sisowath Quay, on the capital's popular riverfront. ""Phnom Penh - The Charming City,"" it boasted.No reason was given for this sudden outburst of civic pride, but it might have been a wishful attempt to attract a better class of visitors.About 400 meters from the sign is the Cadillac Bar. It's here that Gottfrid Svartholm Warg, co-founder of the file-sharing Web site The Pirate Bay, dined out while hiding from a Swedish arrest warrant. He was deported on Monday and sent home to serve a prison term for copyright infringements.A pasty-faced computer geek with bad facial hair, the 27-year-old was cut out of a different cloth than the hardened criminals and sexual predators who typically drift here, earning Cambodia its reputation as a sunny country for shady characters.The place appeals to all manner of crooks and gunrunners, as well as the occasional Islamic terrorist orTriad boss. In July the architect Patrick Devillers made headlines by voluntarily leaving his home in Phnom Penh and returning to China to give evidence in the sensational case of Bo Xilai, the former Communist boss who fell from grace amid a barrage of corruption charges.Before that, there was the merchant of mercy killings. Roger Graham, an American who came to Cambodia in 2003, was deported three years later for enlisting customers in his assisted-suicide program through a do-it-yourself Web site. Even after his arrest, he said, ""All I want to do is to run a little cafe and live the rest of my life in peace. I intend to die here.""Others have no intention of dying here but do, like some of the drug addicts who come because prescription pills and methamphetamines are available and cheap.Assorted pedophiles -- be they rock stars or veteran cops -- come because children in Cambodia remain vulnerable to trafficking despite laws meant to protect them.The place's ultimate appeal, though, is its well-documented culture of impunity. This is a country where the then president of the Chamber of Commerce, Theng Bunma, can complain to an airline about bad service by shooting out the tire of a planewith a pistol and never have to worry about fallout. A few months later he pulled out a gun inside a plane in order to delay takeoff so as to wait for friends who were late boarding.Life on the lam here is even better if you have connections or money. Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister of Thailand who was ousted in a coup in 2006 and has lived in exile since being found guilty of corruption, used to serve a special economic adviser to his friend Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia. The Russian businessman Alexander Trofimov came to Cambodia in 2005 and started building a $300 million tourist resort on Snake Island, off the southwest coast, entrenching himself among the ""Khmer Riche,"" the highest echelons of Cambodia's elite. That didn't spare him prison time after he was arrested, in 2007, on 17 charges of sexually abusing minors, including a six-year-old. But last December, just four years into his sentence, he obtained a royal pardon and was freed.Soon, though, Trofimov was found with a girl believed to be 11 or 12. This proved too much, even for Cambodia, and he was deported in June.Beware the vagaries of doing business with the Cambodian government. After all, if a criminal can buy himself freedom and protection with money, money can also buy them away from him.No sooner were the Swedish authorities getting ready to take delivery of Svartholm Warg than Stockholm announced a $59 million foreign aid package to promote democracy in Cambodia.

Eighth Grader Says He Broke Congressman's Office Windows," Updated, 5:13 p.m. |The vandal who smashed windows over the weekend at Representative Michael G. Grimm's campaign office on Staten Island has come forward, and he is not even old enough to vote.He is 14 years old and confessed to a counselor at his school, where he is in the eighth grade, law enforcement officials said on Tuesday.The Grimm campaign had said earlier that the vandal also broke into an office computer and erased ""confidential campaign files and polling data"" in a ""politically motivated crime"" that constituted an ""assault on democracy."" But a continuing review by New York Police Department computer experts has not, so far, found that anything was erased or tampered with, a law enforcement official said.And investigators believe that the boy did not even know that the building, on Hylan Boulevard in New Dorp, was a congressman's office until he saw news reports.On Tuesday, Mr. Grimm, a Republican, told The Staten Island Advance, ""While we still do not know what happened to the computers, and are waiting for the N.Y.P.D. computer crimes unit to determine the nature of the tampering, it is possible that a volunteer could have inadvertently compromised the computer and failed to report it.""The police said the boy was expected to be charged with criminal mischief.A law enforcement official said that on Monday the investigators from the Police Department's Computer Crimes Squad examined the computer systems in Mr. Grimm's office and found no indications that they had been sabotaged.On Tuesday, the investigators were in the process of conducting a more in-depth forensic examination, the official said. Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said Tuesday morning that the examination had just begun and that ""no determination had been made as whether there was tampering."" Mr. Browne said the time-consuming process might not be completed until Wednesday. "
What's Going On With My Bank?,"Wednesday was kind of a busy day, but late in the afternoon I tried to log in to my bank's Web site to see what checks had posted (I bank with PNC). I couldn't get in. Web sites don't load now and then, and I didn't give it much thought.Yesterday morning I was discussing the payments we expected to receive this week with my two salesmen, Don and Nate. They are responsible for sending out invoices and keeping track of whether we have been paid with a cash management spreadsheet. Nate had received verbal confirmation of a sale of a conference table on Tuesday and added it to our production queue. We normally require a deposit in hand to do this, but you know how it goes -- putting up a sales number is fun, and we were convinced the deal was a go. Why not do the client a favor and schedule manufacturing?I asked Nate whether we had received a deposit from a new customer I'll call Company T. This client had said it was  sending its deposit through an electronic funds transfer. Nate hadn't heard whether the deposit, a little more than $9,000, had been sent and suggested I check the bank Web site to see whether the payment had posted. I tried again to log in, and again couldn't connect. Hmmm. I tried refreshing several times, quitting and restarting the browser, and finally tried using two other browsers. Eventually PNC displayed a page that said the site was experiencing some technical issues and that I should try later. Again, other duties pressed and I set it aside. At the end of Thursday, Don took a credit card from a client he had been working with -- let's call it Company S. We added the client to our list, but now I had a problem: Who gets the first available production time, Company T or Company S? They both wanted their tables as soon as possible, so the first one to commit money would get it. The call from Company S happened late on Thursday, just as I was walking out the door. I figured I would sort it out on Friday morning.So when I came in on Friday, I tried again to log in, and this time nothing at all came up. This was starting to seem strange. As it happened, I needed some cash, so I hopped in my car to go to the local branch and see what was going on. When I got there, I was told that hackers had taken down the PNC Web site and that a number of major banks had been affected. The teller had no idea when it would be back up. At least I was able to see, on the bank's own computers, that Company T's transfer had gone through on Thursday.Back at the office, I tried again to log in. No luck. I've continued to try throughout the day, and even as I wrote this post (early afternoon) I couldn't get in. Now I'm a little worried. My bookkeeper won't be able to reconcile our payments for the week, and I won't be able to confirm that my cash management plans are still current. And beyond that: what's up with PNC?There hasn't been much news about this incident (The Times's Bits blog ran a post), but I was able to find out that a number of major banks had been affected. I have accounts with Chase and Wells Fargo, and I was able to get access to both of them, although it took a while to log in. PNC seems to have been hit harder or not been as nimble in response.It's disconcerting, to say the least, to find out how vulnerable my bank is to an outside attack. It's been a disruption to my business that I didn't expect, and the longer it goes on, the more worrisome it becomes.I have planned my business around ready access to up-to-date financial information and rely on it to make sure I'm solvent. This particular week I have some cushion in my accounts, but I've lived through many periods where knowing whether $9,000 had arrived or not would make all the difference in the world -- if I were trying to make payroll, for instance, or trying to make sure that critical materials shipped, or trying to avoid penalty payments on a credit card.Is anyone else having trouble seeing their accounts right now?

The Weekend Word: Up for Debate," In Today's Times: How the Obama administration handled the attack on an American consulate in Libya has become a top issue in the presidential campaign, Peter Baker and Trip Gabriel write. Debate flared up after the vice-presidential debate in which Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. seemed to contradict official statements by the White House and the State Department about the event.President Obama's aides say he will give a ""passionate and energetic"" follow-up on Tuesday to his debate performance in Denver, but not a repeat of Mr. Biden's debate styleon Thursday against Representative Paul D. Ryan, his Republican rival. Michael D. Shear writes that while conservatives took offense at Mr. Biden's performance, Democrats praised him for giving the vigorous defense they had expected from Mr. Obama.In a suburban Cleveland House race that is one of the most crucial and expensive contests in the country, the two Republican incumbents running against each other believe they aren't being heard. Jonathan Weisman explains that Representatives James B. Renacci and Betty Sutton blame a barrage of negative ads blanketing the airwaves in greater Cleveland for drowning out their competing messages.Voters in Maryland and Washington State could be easy prey for hackers seeking to disenfranchise them after computer security experts identified vulnerabilities in the states' voter databases. Nicole Perlroth explains that the experts and voting rights advocates argue that it would be relatively simple for hackers to use publicly available information to disenfranchise an individual voter or a large bloc of them. But state officials say the concerns are exaggerated.In Missouri, everyone seeking office - from Gov. Jay Nixon to Senator Claire McCaskill, even President Obama - has to make a political calculation about whether to call the state ""Missouree"" or ""Missourah."" Sarah Wheaton writes that how one pronounces the state's name can carry as much political heft as the positions one takes on the economy and social issues. The President's Weekly Address: The turnaround of the automotive industry features prominently in President Obama's weekly address. Without referring to his Republican rival by name, Mr. Obama reminds voters that Mitt Romney and other Republicans opposed Mr. Obama's decision to bail out American car makers, who now sell the most cars in the world. Mr. Obama also highlighted the positive effects of higher fuel standards and free trade agreements on the middle class. Happening in Washington: Starting Saturday, the White House will offer a week of fall garden tours for the public. The tour covers the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, the Rose Garden, the South Lawn and the White House Kitchen Garden. "
"In Latest Extradition Battle, a Victory for British Hacker","LONDON - In a victory for anti-extradition campaigners in Britain, the government ruled on Tuesday that a hacker wanted in the United States for accessing top-secret military computers will not be sent there to face trial.Theresa May, the British minister in charge of home affairs, made clear to Parliament that her decision in the case of the hacker, Gary McKinnon, was a one-time ruling linked to serious concerns about his health, not a new policy in the controversial fight over extradition of British nationals to the United States. Campaigners nevertheless welcomed a crack in an extradition regime that they claim is unfair to British suspects.In Mr. McKinnon's case, British prosecutors now have to decide whether he should face trial in Britain.  Ms. May also said she would review extradition law in order to allow British courts to decided whether defendants facing extradition should stand trial in Britain, instead.The campaign involves a controversial treaty between Britain and the United States that was intended to facilitate the extradition of terror suspects after the Qaeda attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Legislation came into force in Britain in 2004 and two years later in the United States.Opponents of the treaty say it is lopsided, although an official review by a retired British judge concluded a year ago that the law was not biased in favor of the United States. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, promptly ordered a second review by a senior member of his own Liberal Democrats. This review came to the opposite conclusion.Human rights organizations and one-issue lobbying groups like Friends Extradited have called for the scrapping of what they regard as a one-sided law. The right-leaning Daily Mail newspaper started an Affront to British Justice campaign against the law, which it called ""rotten and unfair.""In the Gary McKinnon case, the 46-year-old Scottish hacker is accused of conducting the biggest military computer hack of all time, which caused $800,000 worth of damage to military computer systems.Mr. McKinnon has admitted he hacked into dozens of U.S. computers from his London apartment, but said he was looking for unidentified flying objects.The debate in Britain on the McKinnon case has been dominated by the fact that he suffers from Asperger syndrome and had a high risk of suicide if he lost his 10-year battle against extradition. ""Psychiatrists say Gary will take his own life if he is extradited"" - mother of hacker #GaryMcKinnon calls for UK trial bbc.in/ROmuyq- BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) October 16, 2012David Allen Green, a prominent British blogger and self-described liberal journalist and lawyer, took a contrary view in the McKinnon case. He noted that the offenses were serious and sustained and that Mr. McKinnon had admitted unauthorized access to computers.Handy extended tweet on legal mythology of the #McKinnon case:bit.ly/SXwyI4- final Home Secretary decision due today. #FreeGary- Jack of Kent (@DavidAllenGreen) October 16, 2012He had also passed up the chance of a favorable plea bargain and U.S. authorities had raised no principled opposition to him applying to serve his sentence in Britain, according to Mr. Green.The extradition issue also surfaced this month when a notorious jihadist preacher and four other suspects were flown to the U.S.Few tears were shed for the departure of the main suspect, Abu Hamza al-Masri. But, in the case of two of the extradited men, human rights groups expressed doubt about the justice of sending British citizens abroad to face trial.Other Britons who failed to avoid extradition include Christopher Tappin, a 65-year-old businessman accused of selling missile-related items to Iran. He is set to go on trial in Texas next month on charges that could lead to a 35-year jail sentence.According to his wife, Elaine, ""The emotional, financial and psychological impact of extradition on all the family is hard to overstate.""In another case, three bankers - the so-called NatWest three - were extradited to the United States in 2006 on charges of wire fraud connected with the collapse of Enron, the American energy company. They pleaded guilty to one charge each and were moved to jail in Britain after starting three-year sentences in the United States.According to David Bermingham, one of the NatWest three, ""Extradition plays a vital role in our cross-border cooperation on matters of criminal justice but to my mind extradition should be a last step, not the first step.""

Start Nears on Plan to Combat Online Infringement,"Last year, five major Internet service providers and the big entertainment trade organizations announced a joint plan to fight illegal downloading through what might be called a strategy of annoyance. Instead of suing people suspected of copyright infringement, as the record labels have in the past, they would prod and poke people into good behavior through a ""six strikes"" system that escalate from friendly notices in their e-mail to, ultimately, throttled Internet access.Progress has been slow on the project, called the Copyright Alert System, since it was announced 15 months ago. But in a blog post Thursday, the group created to carry out the process said it would finally begin ""over the course of the next two months."" The post, by Jill Lesser, executive director of the new body, the Center for Copyright Information, reiterated major points of the plan and gave some new details.If a copyright holder, like a record company or movie studio, makes a complaint about possible infringement, the suspected violator will be sent the first of these alerts, explaining the problem and asking the user to stop. If it happens again, the notices continue with more severity; alerts four and five require the user to acknowledge receipt of the warning. By strikes five and six, the I.S.P. can reduce a user's Internet speed.Ms. Lesser said in her note that ""contrary to many erroneous reports, this is not a 'six strikes and you're out' system."" But in its initial announcement, the group said that I.S.P.'s might cancel a user's service if it determined that the company's terms of service had been violated.The system will affect customers of five major Internet providers: AT&T, Cablevision, Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Verizon. They, along with the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America, are financing the project.The note on Thursday also explained that a company called MarkMonitor would find infringement using ""both trained professionals and automated processes to identify illegal downloading of whole movies, TV shows and musical recordings."" Users who believe they have been targeted in error can appeal to the American Arbitration Association for a fee of $35, which will be refunded if the user wins the appeal. "
EMC Acquires Silver Tail Systems,"The data storage giant EMC said Tuesday that it had acquired Silver Tail Systems, an antifraud start-up.EMC did not disclose the price for Silver Tail, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif. But it has acquired a number of security start-ups in the past few years as it expands beyond its core business of data storage. Its largest acquisition was the 2006 takeover of RSA Security for $2.1 billion. Last year, it acquired NetWitness, another security start-up. That price was never disclosed, but people close to the acquisition talks said NetWitness sold for $400 million, more than 10 times its 12-month trailing revenue.EMC is not the only tech giant chasing security start-ups. Earlier this year, Apple, which typically avoids triple-digit million-dollar acquisitions, acquired AuthenTec, a security start-up, for $356 million, its second-largest acquisition to date. Meanwhile, venture capitalists are pouring millions into security start-ups: They collectively invested $935 million in computer security start-ups last year, almost double the $495 million they invested in 2010, according to a Moneytree report.Before founding Silver Tail four years ago, Mike Eynon and Laura Mather worked for three years on the antifraud teams at eBay and PayPal, two of the most targeted sites on the Web. From what they learned they started Silver Tail, which searches for online fraud in real time. The company maps out what normal behavior is at a Web site and uses that intelligence to spot for anomalies, like a hacker breaking in, or large volumes of transactions coming from a single computer.Mr. Eynon and Ms. Mather founded Silver Tail with an initial $2 million in backing from Leapfrog Ventures, Seraph Group and Startup Capital Ventures. Last year, the company received another $20 million from those investors as well as Andreessen Horowitz and Citi Ventures, the venture arm of Citigroup.Scott Weiss, the partner at Andreessen Horowitz who led the investment, said that in the last year, Silver Tail had grown to nearly 100 employees, from 12, and that the product was being used by several top American banks. ""There's no online site that gets hit with more fraud on earth than eBay and PayPal,"" said Mr. Weiss, who added that the experience of the start-up's founders at those companies has resonated with banks, e-commerce companies and government agencies.

Anonymous Did Not Hack PayPal,"No, Anonymous did not hack PayPal on Monday. It says it did:Paypal hacked by Anonymous as part of our November 5th protest privatepaste.com/e8d3b2b2b1 #5Nov- Anonymous Press (@AnonymousPress) November 5, 2012Members of the loose hacking collective claimed credit for dumping 28,000 passwords online that they said belonged to PayPal customers. They said the  attack was part of a much larger hacking campaign, involving PayPal, Symantec, several Australian government sites and more, that was timed to Guy Fawkes Day, the British holiday commemorating a failed 17th-century plot to blow up British Parliament. Anonymous usurped Guy Fawkes as their brand and is often seen protesting in Guy Fawkes masks ever since the release of the 2006 film ""V for Vendetta,"" which featured a Guy Fawkes-inspired protagonist.Although Anonymous's claims went viral on Twitter and were picked upby several media outlets, it appears the attack on PayPal never happened. The 28,000 passwords actually belonged to ZPanel, a free open source hosting site. Anuj Nayar, a PayPal spokesman, said the payments company had been investigating the attack since Sunday night and concluded that there was no evidence any of its data had been breached.A hacker who goes by the handle HTP on Twitter took credit for a breach on Symantec and released what HTP claimed were the passwords of Symantec employees on the Web site Pastebin. A number of media outlets attributed that attack to Anonymous, but the hackers denied any affiliation with the group. Mike Bradshaw, a Symantec spokesman, said that the company was still investigating the breach but that there was no evidence that any customer data had been compromised. Mr. Bradshaw did not clarify whether employee data had been compromised.On Sunday night, a few other Web sites, including the home page forNBC anda Lady Gaga fan site were defaced. A group called ""pyknic"" claimed credit for the vandalism and made reference to Guy Fawkes Day, writing ""Remember, remember the fifth of November,"" suggesting a tie to Anonymous. Several media outlets attributed the attack to the group but again, the connection proved tenuous. The main accounts associated with the Anonymous collective did not claim credit for the attacks on Twitter. "
British Man Could Avoid Extradition to U.S. in Piracy Case," Richard O'Dwyer, the British college student accused of copyright infringement after he created a popular video  site, could avoid extradition to the United States, according to reports in the British media. Mr. O'Dwyer, 24, had created a Web site called TV Shack that offered links to other sites that carried movies and television shows, some of them pirated.  Authorities in the United States sought to extradite him to face trial in this country on criminal charges of copyright infringement, punishable by 10 years in prison. His backers argued that Mr. O'Dwyer's site did not itself host illegal material. The case was widely watched as a test of how far the Obama administration would go to crack down on foreigners suspected of breaking American laws. On Wednesday, the BBC and other news outlets reported from the High Court that Mr. O'Dwyer had struck a deal to avoid extradition, and would instead pay a fine and promise to refrain from copyright infringement. The court was told, according to news reports, that Mr. O'Dwyer would travel to the United States in two weeks to formally agree to the deal. The United States attorney's office in New York, which is handling the case, declined to comment. His mother and most outspoken defender, Julia O'Dwyer, said on Twitter: ""Amazing news today got NO work done.""  "
The Danger Of an Attack On Piracy Online,"E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter.com/carr2nBy invoking the acronym SOPA right at the get-go, I may be daring many of you to check the next column over for something a little less chewy. After all, SOPA, which stands for Stop Online Piracy Act, sounds like a piece of arcane Internet government regulation -- legislation that entertainment companies desperately care about and that leaves Web nation and free-speech crusaders frothing at the mouth. The rest of us? What were we talking about again?Stay with me here.SOPA deals with technical digital issues that may seem to be a sideshow but could become crucial to American media and technology businesses and the people who consume their products. The legislation is the rare broadly bipartisan piece of apple pie. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to resume hearings on it this month and all indications are that it will approve the measure, setting up a vote in the full chamber. The Senate is also expected to vote on its own version of the bill when it returns from the holiday break. Virtually every traditional media company in the United States loudly and enthusiastically supports SOPA, but that doesn't mean it's good for the rest of us. The open consumer Web has been a motor of American innovation and the attempt to curtail some of its excesses could throw sand in the works of a big machine on which we have all come to rely.Rather than launch into a long-winded argument about why the legislation is a bad idea -- it is, as currently written -- I thought it might be worthwhile to boil SOPA down into a series of questions.A NONEXISTENT PROBLEM? Hardly. Regardless of what Web evangelists tell you, SOPA is an effort to get at the very real problem of rogue Web sites -- most operating from overseas -- offering illicit downloads of movies, music and more. The Motion Picture Association of America cites figures saying that piracy costs the United States $58 billion annually.Mark Elliot, an executive from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a letter to The New York Times that such piracy threatened 19 million American jobs. Those figures surely include some politically motivated hyperbole, but anybody who has spent time around a twentysomething consumer knows that piracy is a thorny fact of life for content companies.In an effort to stanch the flow, on Oct. 26 Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, introduced the legislation that has come to be known as SOPA. The Senate version, called the Protect IP Act, is seen by tech companies as less onerous because it targets domain name providers and ad networks and not Internet service providers. Both bills seek to create remedies to pirated content because most of the foreign-based sites operate outside of the United States' legal system.WOULD IT FIX THE PROBLEM? Probably not, and even if it made some progress toward reining in rogue sites, the collateral damage would be significant. Under the terms of each proposed bill, the federal Department of Justice, as well as copyright holders, could seek a court order against a Web site that illegally hosts copyrighted content and then wall off the site permanently.Under the House version, private companies would be allowed to sue Internet service providers for hosting content that they say infringes on copyright. That represents a very big change in the current law as codified in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which grants immunity to Web sites as long as they act in good faith to take down infringing content upon notification.WHY ALL THE ALARM? The bill has exposed a growing fracture between technology and entertainment companies. Digitally oriented companies see SOPA as dangerous and potentially destructive to the open Web and a step toward the kind of intrusive Internet regulation that has made China a global villain to citizens of the Web.Entertainment companies think that technology companies are aiding and abetting thieves on a broad scale, but the legislation is alarming in its reach, potentially creating a blacklist of sites and taking aim at others for unknowingly hosting a small fraction of copyrighted material. In a joint letter to Congress, Google, Facebook, Twitter, AOL, Yahoo, eBay and many other companies made it clear that they perceived a broader threat in the effort to thwart pirate sites.''We support the bills' stated goals -- providing additional enforcement tools to combat foreign 'rogue' Web sites that are dedicated to copyright infringement or counterfeiting,'' the letter read, which was published in a full page ad in The Times.''Unfortunately, the bills as drafted would expose law-abiding U.S. Internet and technology companies to new uncertain liabilities, private rights of action and technology mandates that would require monitoring of Web sites.''Laurence H. Tribe, the noted First Amendment lawyer, said in an open letter on the Web that SOPA would ''undermine the openness and free exchange of information at the heart of the Internet. And it would violate the First Amendment.''You can see why big Internet guys are upset by SOPA. Maybe you and I should be, too.WHY THE POLITICAL SUPPORT? Various amendments intended to tone down SOPA or limit its damage were voted down by large majorities in the House Judiciary Committee in mid-December, an indication that the indignation of various constituencies on the Web is having little impact.That's partly because entertainment companies have deep and long-lasting relationships inside the Beltway. Maplight, a site that researches the influence of money in politics, reported that the 32 sponsors of the legislation received four times as much in contributions from the entertainment industry as they did from software and Internet companies.There is also a cultural divide at work, according to Yancey Strickler, one of the founders of Kickstarter, a Web site that helps raise funds for creative projects, and a critic of SOPA.''The schism between content creators and platforms like Kickstarter, Tumblr and YouTube is generational,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''It's people who grew up on the Web versus people who still don't use it. In Washington, they simply don't see the way that the Web has completely reconfigured society across classes, education and race. The Internet isn't real to them yet.''The debate has highlighted how little Congress knows about the Internet they are proposing to re-tool. In a piece often cited on the Web, the computer culture journalist Joshua Kopstein watched the debate in Congress in which members bragged about their online ignorance, and he wrote an open letter on the technology Web site Motherboard titled, ''Dear Congress, It's No Longer O.K. to Not Know How the Internet Works.''Whether they know what they are doing or not, lawmakers seem intent on moving forward.Congressional supporters of piracy legislation have been in a big hurry because the Web is starting to come alive with opposition -- nearly 90,000 Tumblr users have phoned members of Congress and more than a million people have signed an online petition protesting the legislation.Last week, in a much talked about blog post, Declan McCullagh of CNet speculated that even though big Web companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook are outgunned in terms of political connections, they have the capability to turn their sites into billboards denouncing SOPA and utilizing their close, constant relationship with consumers.I like my movies (and music and television) as much as the next couch potato, probably more. And I wouldn't steal content for any reason, in part because I make a living generating a fair amount of it. But it's worth remembering that the film industry initially opposed the video cassette recorder and the introduction of DVDs, platforms that became very lucrative businesses for them and remarkable conveniences for the rest of us.Given both Congress's and the entertainment industry's historically wobbly grasp of technology, I don't think they should be the ones re-engineering the Internet. The rest of us might have to just hold our noses and learn enough about SOPA to school them in why it's a bad idea. "
"Cyberattack Exposes 20,000 Israeli Credit Card Numbers and Details About Users","JERUSALEM -- The credit card details of more than 20,000 Israelis were exposed on the Internet in two waves this week by a hacker or team of hackers who said they were Saudis. Some Israeli officials described the release of the information as cyberterrorism. Others said that it was too early to define the nature of the attack because there was still no way yet to confirm who did it.''You have to look at the facts: somebody is publishing information about Israelis in order to harm the economy,'' Yoram Hacohen, the head of the Israeli Law, Information and Technology Authority at the Justice Ministry, told Army Radio on Friday. He said the hacker or hackers ''could be a citizen of any country in the world'' and that ''investigations in the digital realm'' were no trivial matter.The initial reports on Tuesday morning were considerably more alarming: that the details of 400,000 credit card holders had been posted online by a hacker identifying himself as a 19-year-old from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who used the Web name 0xOmar. But the three credit card companies that were affected said that many of the card numbers and details had been listed multiple times and that some were incorrect.Later Tuesday, the Bank of Israel's Banking Supervision Department said in a statement that about 15,000 active accounts had been exposed.On Thursday, a second list of about 11,000 credit cards and details about the accounts was posted online, along with e-mail addresses, passwords and other personal information. The credit card companies reported that only about 6,000 of those accounts were active, Israel Radio said on Friday.The credit card companies responded swiftly, contacting the holders of the exposed cards and blocking them from being used on the Internet or by telephone. The Banking Supervision Department said that customers would not be responsible for the fraudulent use of their cards, and officials said that any financial damage would be negligible.The credit card companies had called on the government to help in protecting credit card information.In August, the Israeli government approved the creation of a National Cyber Directorate to coordinate activities of the agencies that deal with the issue. The directorate also works to secure national infrastructures against cyberattacks and to promote the issue in industry.The government said at the time that the directorate had been created in the wake of attacks like those against electricity grids in Brazil, banking systems in Estonia and computer systems at the defense contractor Lockheed Martin.The government has said that the Bank of Israel's Web site was hit in 2008 and that hackers had struck at various institutions after Israel's deadly commando raid on a Turkish ship that was part of a flotilla challenging Israel's blockade of Gaza in 2010.

U.S. Orders Venezuelan Consul General in Miami to Leave,"In a move sure to further strain relations between the United States and Venezuela, the State Department on Sunday said that it had ordered a Venezuelan diplomat based in Miami to leave the country. Officials declined to give a reason for the expulsion of the diplomat, Livia Acosta Noguera, Venezuela's consul general in Miami.Last month a news report had asserted that Ms. Acosta had taken part in discussions about possible cyberattacks against the United States while she was stationed in the Venezuelan Embassy in Mexico.The report, broadcast on Univision, a Spanish-language network, included fragments of what it said were taped conversations with Ms. Acosta. In response to the report, several members of Congress called for an investigation and for the expulsion of Ms. Acosta if the allegations were proved to be true.Efforts to reach officials at the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington or at the consulate in Miami were not successful. After the broadcast of the Univision report last month, the Venezuelan government dismissed it as false.William Ostick, a State Department spokesman, said the department had informed Venezuela on Friday that Ms. Acosta had been declared persona non grata. She was required to leave the country by Tuesday.The Univision report outlined a conspiracy that might seem at home in the pages of a fictional thriller. It featured members of a group identified as former Mexican university students who claimed to have taped conversations as far back as 2007 with officials at the Iranian and Venezuelan Embassies in Mexico in which they discussed possible cyberattacks on companies or nuclear power plants in the United States.The former students, who said they had never intended to undertake such attacks, claimed the idea had originated with the Cuban government.In one recording made by the former students, a person they identified as Ms. Acosta can be heard claiming that she could pass on information about the scheme to Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez.But the report offers no concrete evidence that either Iranian or Venezuelan officials took the would-be hackers seriously or that they intended to accept their offer.There was no indication that American officials had been able to substantiate the allegations aired by Univision. But the decision to expel the diplomat coincided with the Obama administration's expression of disapproval for Venezuela's willingness to maintain friendly relations with Iran, despite international efforts to isolate it over its nuclear program. On Sunday night, President Chavez was preparing to welcome President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran in Caracas on the first leg of a Latin American tour.Mr. Chavez has long used his ties with Iran as a way to taunt the United States, which he casts as an imperialist aggressor seeking to topple his socialist government.He expelled the American ambassador to Venezuela, Patrick D. Duddy, in September 2008, charging that the United States was backing a group of military officers plotting a coup against him. In response, the United States expelled the Venezuelan ambassador. At the same time it accused two top officials in Mr. Chavez's government of involvement in drug trafficking. One of those officials, Gen. Henry Rangel Silva, was named defense minister by Mr. Chavez last week.The United States and Venezuela have yet to allow the return of their ambassadors. But the two countries continue to have deep economic ties. Venezuela is the fourth-largest supplier of crude oil to the United States. "
Fighting Online Piracy,"To the Editor:''The Danger of an Attack on Online Piracy,'' by David Carr (Media Equation column, Jan. 2), unfairly criticizes the Stop Online Piracy Act, which I introduced, but it does not point to any language in the bill to back up the claims. SOPA targets only foreign Web sites that are primarily dedicated to illegal and infringing activity. Domestic Web sites, like blogs, are not covered by this legislation.The SOPA debate is not just between the entertainment industry and high-tech companies. SOPA protects intellectual property of all kinds, which is why it's supported by more than 120 groups and associations across diverse industries, including the United States Chamber of Commerce.We need to examine the real motives of the ''big Internet guys,'' like Google, that oppose SOPA. Google made huge profits by directing consumers to illegal foreign Web sites, so its opposition is self-serving. In fact, Google recently paid half a billion dollars to settle a criminal investigation because of its promotion of foreign pharmacies that sold counterfeit and illegal drugs to American patients, possibly endangering their health.We need to protect American consumers and businesses. The illegal theft of American intellectual property and the counterfeiting of goods like medicine, automotive parts and even baby food pose a serious threat to the health of American consumers.LAMAR SMITH Washington, Jan. 6, 2012The writer, a Republican from Texas, is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

Iran Adversaries Said To Step Up Covert Actions,"WASHINGTON -- As arguments flare in Israel and the United States about a possible military strike to set back Iran's nuclear program, an accelerating covert campaign of assassinations, bombings, cyberattacks and defections appears intended to make that debate irrelevant, according to current and former American officials and specialists on Iran.The campaign, which experts believe is being carried out mainly by Israel, apparently claimed its latest victim on Wednesday when a bomb killed a 32-year-old nuclear scientist in Tehran's morning rush hour.The scientist, Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, was a department supervisor at the Natanz uranium enrichment plant, a participant in what Western leaders believe is Iran's halting but determined progress toward a nuclear weapon. He was at least the fifth scientist with nuclear connections to be killed since 2007; a sixth scientist, Fereydoon Abbasi, survived a 2010 attack and was put in charge of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization. Iranian officials immediately blamed both Israel and the United States for the latest death, which came less than two months after a suspicious explosion at an Iranian missile base that killed a top general and 16 other people. While American officials deny a role in lethal activities, the United States is believed to engage in other covert efforts against the Iranian nuclear program.The assassination drew an unusually strong condemnation from the White House and the State Department, which disavowed any American complicity. The statements by the United States appeared to reflect serious concern about the growing number of lethal attacks, which some experts believe could backfire by undercutting future negotiations and prompting Iran to redouble what the West suspects is a quest for a nuclear capacity.''The United States had absolutely nothing to do with this,'' said Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the National Security Council. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared to expand the denial beyond Wednesday's killing, ''categorically'' denying ''any United States involvement in any kind of act of violence inside Iran.''''We believe that there has to be an understanding between Iran, its neighbors and the international community that finds a way forward for it to end its provocative behavior, end its search for nuclear weapons and rejoin the international community,'' Mrs. Clinton said.The Israeli military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, writing on Facebook about the attack, said, ''I don't know who took revenge on the Iranian scientist, but I am definitely not shedding a tear,'' Israeli news media reported.Like the drone strikes that the Obama administration has embraced as a core tactic against Al Qaeda, the multifaceted covert campaign against Iran has appeared to offer an alternative to war. But at most it has slowed, not halted, Iran's enrichment of uranium, a potential fuel for a nuclear weapon. And some skeptics believe that it may harden Iran's resolve or set a dangerous precedent for a strategy that could be used against the United States and its allies.Neither Israeli nor American officials will discuss the covert campaign in any detail, leaving some uncertainty about the perpetrators and their purpose. For instance, Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he believed that at least some of the murdered scientists might have been killed by the Iranian government. Some of them had shown sympathy for the Iranian opposition, he said, and not all appeared to have been high-ranking experts.''I think there is reason to doubt the idea that all the hits have been carried out by Israel,'' Mr. Sadjadpour said. ''It's very puzzling that Iranian nuclear scientists, whose movements are likely carefully monitored by the state, can be executed in broad daylight, sometimes in rush-hour traffic, and their culprits never found.''A more common view, however, is expressed by Patrick Clawson, director of the Iran Security Initiative at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''I often get asked when Israel might attack Iran,'' Mr. Clawson said. ''I say, 'Two years ago.' ''Mr. Clawson said the covert campaign was far preferable to overt airstrikes by Israel or the United States on suspected Iranian nuclear sites. ''Sabotage and assassination is the way to go, if you can do it,'' he said. ''It doesn't provoke a nationalist reaction in Iran, which could strengthen the regime. And it allows Iran to climb down if it decides the cost of pursuing a nuclear weapon is too high.''A former senior Israeli security official, who would speak of the covert campaign only in general terms and on the condition of anonymity, said the uncertainty about who was responsible was useful. ''It's not enough to guess,'' he said. ''You can't prove it, so you can't retaliate. When it's very, very clear who's behind an attack, the world behaves differently.''The former Israeli official noted that Iran carried out many assassinations of enemies, mostly Iranian opposition figures, during the 1980s and 1990s, and had been recently accused of plotting to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States in Washington.''In Arabic, there's a proverb: If you are shooting, don't complain about being shot,'' he said. But he portrayed the killings and bombings as part of a larger Israeli strategy to prevent all-out war.''I think the cocktail of diplomacy, of sanctions, of covert activity might bring us something,'' the former official said. ''I think it's the right policy while we still have time.''Israel has used assassination as a tool of statecraft since its creation in 1948, historians say, killing dozens of Palestinian and other militants and a small number of foreign scientists, military officials or people accused of being Holocaust collaborators.But there is no exact precedent for what appears to be the current campaign against Iran, involving Israel and the United States and a broad array of methods.The assassinations have been carried out primarily by motorcyclists who attach magnetic bombs to the victim's car, often in heavy traffic, before speeding away.Iran's Mehr news agency said Wednesday's explosion took place on Gol Nabi Street, on Mr. Roshan's route to work, at 8:20 a.m. The news agency said the scientist, who also taught at a technical university, was deputy director of commercial affairs at the Natanz site, evidently in charge of buying equipment and materials. Two other people were wounded, and one later died in a hospital, Iranian officials said.Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Khazaee, sent a letter of protest to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, blaming ''certain foreign quarters'' for what he called ''terrorist acts'' aimed at disrupting Iran's ''peaceful nuclear program, under the false assumption that diplomacy alone would not be enough for that purpose.''The ambassador's letter complained of sabotage, a possible reference to the Stuxnet computer worm, believed to be a joint American-Israeli project, that reportedly led to the destruction in 2010 of about a fifth of the centrifuges Iran uses to enrich uranium. It also said the covert campaign included ''a military strike on Iran,'' evidently a reference to a mysterious explosion that destroyed much of an Iranian missile base on Nov. 12.That explosion, which Iran experts say they believe was probably an Israeli effort, killed Gen. Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam, who was in charge of Iran's missile program. Satellite photographs show multiple buildings at the site leveled or heavily damaged.The C.I.A., according to current and former officials, has repeatedly tried to derail Iran's uranium enrichment program by covert means, including introducing sabotaged parts into Iran's supply chain.In addition, the agency is believed to have encouraged some Iranian nuclear scientists to defect, an effort that came to light in 2010 when a scientist, Shahram Amiri, who had come to the United States, claimed to have been kidnapped by the C.I.A. and returned to Iran. (Press reports say he has since been arrested and tried for treason.) A former deputy defense minister, Ali-Reza Asgari, disappeared while visiting Turkey in 2006 and is widely believed to have defected, possibly to the United States.William C. Banks, an expert on national security law at Syracuse University, said he believed that for the United States even to provide specific intelligence to Israel to help kill an Iranian scientist would violate a longstanding executive order banning assassinations. The legal rationale for drone strikes against terrorist suspects -- that the United States is at war with Al Qaeda and its allies -- would not apply, he said.''Under international law, aiding and abetting would be the same as pulling the trigger,'' Mr. Banks said. He added, ''We would be in a precarious position morally, and the entire world is watching, especially China and Russia.''Gary Sick, a specialist on Iran at Columbia, said he believed that the covert campaign, combined with sanctions, would not persuade Iran to abandon its nuclear work.''It's important to turn around and ask how the U.S. would feel if our revenue was being cut off, our scientists were being killed and we were under cyberattack,'' Mr. Sick said. ''Would we give in, or would we double down? I think we'd fight back, and Iran will, too.'' "
Texan's Anti-Piracy Bill Gets Home State Pushback,"baaronson@texastribune.orgUnited States Representative Lamar Smith says online piracy is damaging the United States economy and putting American lives at risk. Foreign Web sites that distribute American-made entertainment and counterfeit products, like fake pharmaceuticals, are ''stealing our profits, they're stealing our jobs and they may be endangering the health of Americans,'' said Mr. Smith, a Republican from San Antonio.He introduced the Stop Online Piracy Act in October to tackle the problem, but the bill has received a cold reception in Mr. Smith's home state. Technology companies and business advocates in Texas agree that cyber crimes are a problem, but they contend that Mr. Smith's bill would cause greater economic damage, particularly to Texas' growing technology sector. And they say that online pirates could find ways to evade the law. Rackspace, Facebook and eBay, which have received economic incentives from the state to create jobs in Texas, are among the companies opposing the bill.''In the name of policing the online theft of intellectual property, key lawmakers are pushing a cure that's worse than the disease,'' Lanham Napier, the chief executive of Rackspace, a Web hosting business, wrote on the company's blog in December.Existing United States laws -- used by copyright holders and law enforcement authorities to remove copyrighted or illegal content from the Internet -- do not apply to foreign Web sites that operate outside the jurisdiction of American courts. To effectually shut down a foreign site engaging in illegal activity, the Stop Online Piracy Act, known as SOPA, would allow a court to order domestic companies to cut financial ties and block American customers' access to the site.The bill has bipartisan support from a majority of the House Judiciary Committee, for which Mr. Smith is chairman, and is likely to pass out of committee when Congress reconvenes late this month. Mr. Smith said there was no language in the bill that would harm American businesses.''Unless Rackspace is a foreign Web site primarily dedicated to illegal activity, it's not going to affect them or Facebook or any of the others,'' he said.The technology industry strongly disagrees.Ed Black, the chief executive of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, said the bill would fundamentally change technology companies' relationships with customers.''The harm is it ruins the business models for companies,'' Mr. Black said. ''We don't want companies in a free society to act as secret police.''If the current bill passes, a plaintiff could obtain a court order without giving the defendant notice.A foreign Web site accused of breaking United States law would have 48 hours to request an appeal of the court's decision. If it does not appeal, American companies would have five days to obey the court order or face liability for enabling illegal activity.Google and Yahoo would be required to remove hyperlinks to the accused Web site in search results, PayPal and Visa would have to stop payment transactions on the site, and Google AdWords would have to discontinue advertisements. (All of those companies oppose the bill.)Internet service providers and companies like Rackspace would be required to block American users from accessing the Web site, or, as Mr. Napier put it in his blog post, ''censor their customers with little in the way of due process.''Rackspace estimates that a quarter of the business it conducts with its more than 160,000 customers is overseas. Its headquarters is in an area of San Antonio just outside Mr. Smith's district, though he represents many of the 2,300 employees who work there.Despite the outcry, Mr. Smith stands behind the bill, which he said would protect Texans against intellectual property theft. Mr. Smith also pointed to Austin as a ''ripe target'' because of its thriving music and film industries.''There is an imbalance in the degree to which intellectual property rights are protected online,'' said Chris Castle, a lawyer who represents musicians in Austin and supports SOPA.He said Texans would benefit from a more clearly defined set of property rights, because the bill would encourage investment in legitimate Internet businesses that can profit from legally distributing artists' work. SOPA would force American companies and individuals to take responsibility for promoting criminal activity.The bill faces opposition from fellow conservatives in Mr. Smith's home state and elsewhere. Gov. Rick Perry does not support the bill, nor does the conservative business advocacy group Americans for Job Security.The measure would force technology companies to divert resources they could spend on innovation, job growth and marketing for ''compliance with this new regulatory regime,'' said Stephen DeMaura, the president of Americans for Job Security. The extra spending on legal counsel would hurt hundreds of technology companies in Texas, he added, and especially harm start-ups and small businesses.Organizations and people opposed to SOPA say the bill would ''nuke'' high-tech companies in Mr. Smith's district, and they accuse Mr. Smith of representing the interests of the entertainment industry over his constituents.According to Opensecrets.org, which is run by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit that tracks money in politics, the majority of Mr. Smith's campaign financing, $59,300 in this year's election cycle, has come from the entertainment industry.But Opensecrets also reports that Mr. Smith has received $392,995 from the entertainment industry and $387,440 from the technology industry since 1998 -- a small difference over all.The technology industry remains convinced that its views were under-represented at a committee hearing on the bill and that pirates would find ways to evade the measure's provisions. Federal lawmakers are trying to move the bill quickly, Mr. Black said, without conducting extensive economic studies or consulting technical experts on cybersecurity.''You would at least hope that there would be an attempt to hear out all stakeholders,'' Mr. Black said, ''so there could be a consensus of understanding where there's common ground and where there are different views to try to bend.''

Protest on Web Takes on 2 Bills Aimed at Piracy,"With a Web-wide protest on Wednesday that includes a 24-hour shutdown of the English-language Wikipedia, the legislative battle over two Internet piracy bills has reached an extraordinary moment -- a political coming of age for a relatively young and disorganized industry that has largely steered clear of lobbying and other political games in Washington.The bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act in the House and the Protect IP Act in the Senate, are backed by major media companies and are mostly intended to curtail the illegal downloading and streaming of TV shows and movies online. But the tech industry fears that, among other things, they will give media companies too much power to shut down sites that they say are abusing copyrights.The legislation has jolted technology leaders, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, who are not accustomed to having their free-wheeling online world come under attack. One response is Wednesday's protest, which will direct anyone visiting Google and many other Web sites to pages detailing the tech industry's opposition to the bills. Wikipedia, run by a nonprofit organization, is going further than most sites by actually taking material offline -- no doubt causing panic among countless students who have a paper due.It said the move was meant to spark greater public opposition to the bills, which could restrict its freedom to publish.''For the first time, it's very clear that legislation could have a direct impact on the industry's ability to do business,'' said Jessica Lawrence, the managing director of New York Tech Meetup, a trade organization with 20,000 members that has organized a protest rally in Manhattan on Wednesday. ''This has been a wake-up call.''Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School, said that the technology industry, which has birthed large businesses like Google, Facebook and eBay, is much more powerful than it used to be.''This is the first real test of the political strength of the Web, and regardless of how things go, they are no longer a pushover,'' said Professor Wu, who is the author of ''The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires.'' He added, ''The Web taking a stand against one of the most powerful lobbyers and seeming to get somewhere is definitely a first.''Under the proposed legislation, if a copyright holder like Warner Brothers discovers that a foreign site is focused on offering illegal copies of songs or movies, it could seek a court order that would require search engines like Google to remove links to the site and require advertising companies to cut off payments to it.Internet companies fear that because the definitions of terms like ''search engine'' are so broad in the legislation, Web sites big and small could be responsible for monitoring all material on their pages for potential violations -- an expensive and complex challenge.They say they support current law, which requires Web sites with copyright-infringing content to take it down if copyright holders ask them to, leaving the rest of the site intact. Google, which owns YouTube and other sites, received five million requests to remove content or links last year, and it says it acts in less than six hours if it determines that the request is legitimate.The major players supporting the legislation, including the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Motion Picture Association of America, say those measures are not enough to protect intellectual property. They emphasize that their primary targets are foreign Web sites that sell counterfeit goods and let people stream and download music and video at no charge -- sites that are now largely out of reach of United States law enforcement. And they are fighting against what they characterize as gimmicks and distortions by Internet companies opposed to the bills.With talk of censorship and loss of Internet freedom, ''the current debate has nothing to do with the substance of the bills,'' David Hirschmann, who leads the Chamber of Commerce's initiative on intellectual property, said in an interview. ''We will certainly use every tool in our toolbox to make sure members of Congress know what's in these bills.''With financial resources that few other groups can match, the chamber is one of Washington's most powerful lobbying forces and has shown the ability to alter Congressional debate on its own.Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and author the Protect IP Act, accused opponents Tuesday of trying to ''stoke fear'' through tactics like the Wikipedia blackout. ''Protecting foreign criminals from liability rather than protecting American copyright holders and intellectual property developers is irresponsible, will cost American jobs, and is just wrong,'' he said in a statement.Opponents of the legislation have clearly seized the momentum in the debate. Their protests have gained traction in that key provisions were stripped out of one bill and the Obama administration has raised concerns. Legislators have already agreed to delay or drop one ire-inducing component of the bills, Domain Name System blocking, which would prevent access to sites that were found to have illegal content.A total of 115 companies and organizations have lobbyists working on the antipiracy bills, spending millions of dollars to sway the outcome, according to federal disclosure records. They include corporate and technology giants on both sides of the legislation, with entertainment groups like News Corporation and the Recording Industry Association of America backing it and Internet firms like Google and Facebook raising concerns about it.The largest advocates for the bills disagree with the tech industry's main rallying cry, which is the notion that they will hurt the average Internet user or interfere with their online activities.''The bill will not harm Wikipedia, domestic blogs or social network sites,'' said Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas and a primary sponsor of the House bill.Most people in the tech world agree that the problem of piracy needs to be addressed. But they say their main concern is that the tech industry had little influence on the language of the legislation, which is still in flux and so broadly worded that it is not entirely clear how Internet businesses will be affected. Big Internet companies say the bills could prevent entire Web sites from appearing in search results -- even if the sites operate legally and most content creators want their videos or music to appear there.''It shouldn't apply to U.S. Web sites, but any company with a server overseas or a domain name overseas could be at risk,'' said Andrew McLaughlin, vice president at Tumblr, a popular blogging service.Mr. McLaughlin said the fear is that on large and diverse Web communities like Tumblr, any user who uploads an unauthorized clip from a movie or an unreleased track from an album is putting the whole company in the line of fire.In November, Tumblr rigged a tool that ''censored'' the page its users see when they log into the site, explained the legislation and routed them to contact information for their representatives in Congress. The stunt resulted in 80,000 calls to legislators in a three-day period. Mr. McLaughlin said the company was planning a similar approach for Wednesday.Some who oppose the bill, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online rights group, see a bright spot in a potential compromise called the OPEN Act, which would provide for the International Trade Commission to judge cases of copyright or trademark infringement. If the commission found that a foreign site was largely devoted to piracy, it could compel payment processors and online advertising companies to stop doing business with it.Silicon Valley has championed companies that provide alternatives to piracy, like Spotify and Netflix. And the industry says that the problem could be solved by letting it do what it does best -- innovating.''It's something that could be solved using technology through collaboration with these start-ups,'' said Ms. Lawrence of New York Tech Meetup.

"With Twitter, Blackouts and Demonstrations, Web Flexes Its Muscle","The Web buzzed with protests large and small on Wednesday as the tech industry rallied against Congressional legislation to curb Internet piracy.Some sites blacked out -- among them, the English-language Wikipedia, though it was possible to access the encyclopedia through several clever workarounds -- while others, including Google and Craigslist, draped their pages with information about the bills, or restricted access.Many start-ups quickly cobbled together tech solutions to support their cause. HelloFax, for example, created a tool that let people send their representatives faxes voicing their opinions through the Web.The effort was an unusual orchestration that began gathering steam online late Tuesday night and escalated early Wednesday morning, eventually whipping the Web into a frenzy. Google said 4.5 million people signed its online petition to Congress, voicing displeasure at the legislation; Twitter said more than two million posts on the subject flowed through the site by early afternoon, nearly four times as many as usual.Engine Advocacy, a service that helps people call their local members of Congress, said that as many as 2,000 a second were trying demand so heavy that many of the calls could not be completed. And Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit organization that oversees Wikipedia, said four million people used its blacked-out site to look up contact information for their local representative.Opponents of the legislation also took their demonstrations into the real world in New York, San Francisco and Seattle, but drew relatively modest numbers of protesters. Still, for a group that tends to be more comfortable showing solidarity from behind the warm glow of a computer screen -- by changing a profile picture or reposting a favorite motto -- it was a considerable showing.The New York rally, organized by a tech industry trade group, attracted about a thousand protesters in Midtown Manhattan. Sebastian Delmont, 38, who works at StreetEasy, a real estate search site, said about half of his co-workers attended the protest. ''Our worry is that they are building something like a Great Firewall, like in China and the Middle East,'' he said.In Washington by Wednesday morning, several lawmakers had reconsidered their support of the bills -- one in the House, one in the Senate. The legislation is intended to curtail copyright abuses by preventing American search engines and Web sites from directing users to the mostly foreign sites that allow for the distribution of stolen materials like music, movies, television shows, software and other content.The tech industry has argued that the bills are too broad, threaten free speech, stifle innovation and most likely will not even effectively eliminate piracy.A freshman senator, Marco Rubio of Florida, a rising Republican star, announced that he would no longer back the Senate bill, the Protect Intellectual Property Act, or PIPA, which he had co-sponsored. Senator John Cornyn, the Texas Republican who heads the campaign operation for his party, urged Congress take more time to study the measure.''Concerns about unintended damage to the Internet and innovation in the tech sector require a more thoughtful balance, which will take more time,'' he posted on his Facebook page at 9 a.m.Supporters of the bills, like major media and entertainment companies, struggled to get their message out, but found the going rough. ''It's very difficult to counter the misinformation when the disseminators also own the platform,'' said Cary H. Sherman, chairman and chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group that represents the United States music industry, referring to Google and Facebook.Mike Nugent, executive director of Creative America, a coalition of major entertainment companies and industry unions, said he was taking the long view on the issue and not focusing on the Internet protests this week. ''We're digging in for a tough fight over the next week and in the longer term,'' he said.On Wednesday, the corporate group began its second nationwide advertising campaign in print, radio and television to push the legislation. A banner ad with the headline ''What to Do During an Internet Blackout'' appeared on select Web sites and on a Times Square billboard. Suggestions included: ''Read a book. Listen to music. Go to a movie. Watch the game. Tune into a show'' -- all copyrighted content the legislation intends to protect.The group will also hold town hall meetings and place robo-calls in certain districts to educate constituents on the need for these bills, Mr. Nugent said. ''It really comes down to 'Don't steal our stuff,' '' he said.But the issue is difficult for some in the entertainment industry. Andy Samberg of ''Saturday Night Live,'' for example, and his colleagues in the video comedy group the Lonely Island, as well as a number of musicians and authors, wrote a letter to Congress saying they had serious concerns about the legislation as written.''Online piracy is harmful and it needs to be addressed, but not at the expense of censoring creativity, stifling innovation or preventing the creation of new, lawful digital distribution methods,'' they said in the letter.The activity on the Web touched many different kinds of sites. More than 25,000 blogs on the popular platform WordPress chose to go black to support the cause, and 12,500 others added a ''Stop Censorship'' ribbon to their sites. Fight for the Future, a nonprofit group helping coordinate efforts around the Web, said 50,000 sites had promised their allegiance and pledged participation in the online demonstration.I Can Has Cheezburger, a hub for humorous pictures of cats, and Etsy, a marketplace for crafts, greeted users with banners of information about the bills. Reddit, a community discussion site; Boing Boing, the culture blog; and the comedy video site My Damn Channel were blacked out.The mobile restaurant finder UrbanSpoon and some news organizations, including Wired.com, blacked out some content.Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook who had previously remained silent about the bills, weighed in by late Wednesday afternoon. He posted on his own Facebook page, saying: ''The world today needs political leaders who are pro-Internet. We have been working with many of these folks for months on better alternatives to these current proposals.''Within an hour, more than 200,000 Facebook users had clicked the Like button on his post.Even a few in Congress joined in the online efforts. Representatives Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California who represents part of Silicon Valley, and Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, blacked out their Congressional sites for the day. And by late Wednesday afternoon, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat in New York who was a co-sponsor of the PIPA bill, posted this message on her Facebook page: ''I agree there are real concerns with the current legislation & I'm working to make important changes to the bill. We must work to strike a balance between ending online piracy to protect New York jobs & ensuring Internet freedom so our tech community can continue to flourish.''In San Francisco, 60 people gathered at the stairs of City Hall to join the protest.''I don't go to rallies,'' said Anis Salvesen, 33, the marketing manager for Tripping, a travel start-up based in San Francisco. ''I've been to one other rally in my life. But this legislation is bad, it would directly impact our company.''Nate Westheimer, executive director of the New York Tech Meetup, which organized the Midtown Manhattan rally, said: ''We've made our point. The next move is on them and if they don't respond, then we will keep at them.''Correction: January 20, 2012, FridayThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about an online protest of antipiracy bills in Congress misattributed a quotation.

The False Ideals of the Web,"Berkeley, Calif.WE who love the Internet love the fact that so many people contribute to it. It's hard to believe that skeptics once worried about whether anyone would have anything worthwhile to say online.There is, however, an outdated brand of digital orthodoxy that ought to be retired. In this worldview, the Internet is a never-ending battle of good guys who love freedom against bad guys like old-fashioned Hollywood media moguls. The bad guys want to strengthen copyright law, and make it impossible to post anonymously copied videos and stories.The proposed Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, which is being considered in the House while the Senate looks at a similar bill, is deemed the worst thing ever. Popular sites like Wikipedia staged a blackout on Wednesday to protest the bills. Google put a black banner over its name. Nothing quite like that has ever happened before. This is extraordinary, because it shows that belief in the priority of fighting SOPA is so absolute as to trump the stated nonpartisan missions of these sites. The legislation has indeed included draconian remedies in various drafts, so I join my colleagues in criticizing the bills. But our opposition has become so extreme that we are doing more harm than good to our own cause. Those rare tech companies that have come out in support of SOPA are not merely criticized but barred from industry events and subject to boycotts. We, the keepers of the flame of free speech, are banishing people for their speech. The result is a chilling atmosphere, with people afraid to speak their minds.Our melodrama is driven by a vision of an open Internet that has already been distorted, though not by the old industries that fear piracy.For instance, until a year ago, I enjoyed a certain kind of user-generated content very much: I participated in forums in which musicians talked about musical instruments.For years, I was warned that old-fashioned control freaks like media moguls might separate me from my beloved forums. Perhaps a forum would be shut down because it was hosted on some server with pirated content.While acknowledging that this is a possible scenario, a very different factor -- proprietary social networking -- is ending my freedom to participate in the forums I used to love, at least on terms I accept. Like many other forms of contact, the musical conversations are moving into private sites, particularly Facebook. To continue to participate, I'd have to accept Facebook's philosophy, under which it analyzes me, and is searching for new ways to charge third parties for the use of that analysis.At the moment that wouldn't bother me much, because I know a lot of people at Facebook and I know they are decent. But I've seen what happens to companies over time. Who knows who will be using my data in 20 years?You might object that it's all based on individual choice. That argument ignores the consequences of networks, and the way they function. After a certain point choice is reduced.And it's not Facebook's fault! We, the idealists, insisted that information be able to flow freely online, which meant that services relating to information, instead of the information itself, would be the main profit centers. Some businesses do sell content, but that doesn't address the business side of everyday user-generated content.The adulation of ''free content'' inevitably meant that ''advertising'' would become the biggest business in the open part of the information economy. Furthermore, that system isn't so welcoming to new competitors. Once networks are established, it is hard to reduce their power. Google's advertisers, for instance, know what will happen if they move away. The next-highest bidder for each position in Google's auction-based model for selling ads will inherit that position if the top bidder goes elsewhere. So Google's advertisers tend to stay put because the consequences of leaving are obvious to them, whereas the opportunities they might gain by leaving are not.The obvious strategy in the fight for a piece of the advertising pie is to close off substantial parts of the Internet so Google doesn't see it all anymore. That's how Facebook hopes to make money, by sealing off a huge amount of user-generated information into a separate, non-Google world. Networks lock in their users, whether it is Facebook's members or Google's advertisers.This belief in ''free'' information is blocking future potential paths for the Internet. What if ordinary users routinely earned micropayments for their contributions? If all content were valued instead of only mogul content, perhaps an information economy would elevate success for all. But under the current terms of debate that idea can barely be whispered.To my friends in the ''open'' Internet movement, I have to ask: what did you think would happen? We in Silicon Valley undermined copyright to make commerce become more about services instead of content -- more about our code instead of their files. The inevitable endgame was always that we would lose control of our own personal content, our own files. We haven't just weakened Hollywood and old-fashioned publishers. We've weakened ourselves. "
"Public Outcry Over Antipiracy Bills Began as Grass-Roots Grumbling: Suddenly, Hollywood Wants to Sit Down and Talk","WASHINGTON -- When Jack Valenti walked the halls of Congress, friends by the dozen gripped, grinned and took note of what was worrying the movie industry's dapper chief lobbyist.Christopher J. Dodd now fills Mr. Valenti's shoes. But he stays out of those halls, thanks to restrictions on his ability to lobby Congress until 2013.It just cost him a big one.A major push by copyright holders -- including those in the Motion Picture Association of America, of which Mr. Dodd is chairman -- for a tough federal law to control foreign online piracy collapsed this week under stiff resistance from technology companies and their allies. On Wednesday, as Web sites expressed opposition to the legislation, important lawmakers withdrew their support, leaving Mr. Dodd and his associates scrambling to find what could be salvaged.In an interview Thursday, Mr. Dodd said he would welcome a summit meeting between Internet companies and content companies, perhaps convened by the White House, that could lead to a compromise. Looming next Tuesday is a cloture vote scheduled in the Senate, which appears to promise the death of the legislation in its current form.''The perfect place to do it is a block away from here,'' said Mr. Dodd, who pointed from his office on I Street toward 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.But the startlingly speedy collapse of the antipiracy campaign by some of Washington's savviest players -- not just the motion picture association, but also the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Recording Industry Association of America -- signaled deep changes in antipiracy lobbying in the future. By Mr. Dodd's account, no Washington player can safely assume that a well-wired, heavily financed legislative program is safe from a sudden burst of Web-driven populism.''This is altogether a new effect,'' Mr. Dodd said, comparing the online movement to the Arab Spring. He could not remember seeing ''an effort that was moving with this degree of support change this dramatically'' in the last four decades, he added.That shift was exposed this week partly because Mr. Dodd found himself in a political knife fight while being forced to sheathe his most powerful weapon: 36 years of personal relationships with a Congress in which he had served as a representative and then senator since 1975, before joining the motion picture association last March.Under legislation passed in 2007, Mr. Dodd is barred from personally lobbying Congress for two years after leaving office. Hired as the consummate Washington insider to carry the film industry's banner on crucial issues like piracy, Mr. Dodd ended up being more coach than player. He helped devise a strategy that called for his coalition to line up a strong array of legislative sponsors and supporters behind two similar laws -- the Stop Online Piracy Act in the House, and the Protect I.P. Act in the Senate -- and then to move them through the Congress quickly before possible opposition from tech companies could coalesce.But slow pacing gave the Internet and free speech advocates time to wake up and mobilize, turning what might have been a relatively simple exercise for Mr. Dodd and his allies into a bitter struggle. The delays violated a cardinal rule among professional lobbyists, who generally believe the worst enemy of a proposed law is the legislative clock.Mr. Dodd said that the entire industry was surprised by the intensity of the objections that arose in the last couple of weeks. ''This was a whole new different game all of a sudden,'' he said. ''This thing was considered by many to be a slam dunk.''Data shows that copyright holders and supporters of the bills outspent opponents substantially in the early stages of the debate. But by many accounts the tech industry has stepped up its lobbying efforts in recent weeks. New spending reports expected shortly indicate whether the balance has shifted.The Senate vote on Tuesday will show whether opponents like Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, have succeeded in derailing that chamber's version of the law.On Thursday, however, Mr. Dodd appeared to have all but thrown in the towel on the bills in their current form, and was talking about lessons learned. He acknowledged his side had committed a misstep by allowing Hollywood to become the face of laws that were intended to protect not just movies, but also more mundane products -- for instance, home smoke alarms -- that are frequently counterfeited abroad, sometimes with disastrous effects.''In terms of public perception, I'm Exhibit A,'' said Mr. Dodd, who spent last weekend hobnobbing with stars at the Golden Globes. ''This is seen as a red carpet business.''It was a further problem, he said, that Hollywood's writers, directors, producers and blue-collar workers -- whose unions squarely backed the new law -- never personally campaigned in a way that might have helped to counter the Web assault.''There's a disconnect between the business interests and the politics of Hollywood,'' Mr. Dodd said, meaning that the film industry and its denizens provided money for many campaigns, including those of Mr. Obama, without pushing its issues to the fore.Mr. Wyden said the public resistance confirmed his longstanding belief that the measures would become wildly unpopular once people saw their potential for censoring Web sites and unleashing litigation against entrepreneurs, both large and small.''I will use every ounce of my strength to fight'' to stop PIPA in next week's procedural vote, said Mr. Wyden, who has been pushing what he said was a less intrusive alternative. The fight has been a challenge for Mr. Dodd in other ways as well. A silver-haired 67-year-old, Mr. Dodd risks looking like a scold in public appearances that find him lecturing opponents about damage to the economy, including some $58 billion in estimated annual losses to copyright thieves.In his office on Thursday, he pointed his finger while recalling how he had recently admonished high school-age students on a Massachusetts film set. The next time they are tempted to steal a film, he told them, think about the makeup artists and grips whose jobs are at stake.''I think Chris Dodd has done a spectacular job,'' said Jim Gianopulos, co-chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, who spoke by telephone on Thursday. ''He's been unable to do direct lobbying, but as a strategist, he's been superb,'' said Mr. Gianopulos. Misinformation about the antipiracy bills had complicated a campaign that is not yet over, he said.While Mr. Dodd is barred from Congressional contact, he has had a free hand in lobbying the White House and federal agencies. On Saturday, however, the Obama administration dealt his efforts a blow by announcing publicly, in response to online petitions, that it had reservations about a provision in the proposed laws that called for blocking user access to offending sites.Mr. Dodd spoke with barely concealed anger at what he called a ''really gratuitous'' statement delivered by what he had presumed was a sympathetic administration, which came after the blocking provisions had effectively been killed in Congress.The real message, said Mr. Dodd, may be that further change is in order for the motion picture association, which represents Walt Disney Studios, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, Universal Studios and Warner Brothers. The group, he said, lost focus and energy after Mr. Valenti's retirement in 2004.The companies, Mr. Dodd said, are ''rethinking everything,'' not just about the bills, but about their relationship with an estranged Silicon Valley.That need for rapprochement, he said, ''has come home in a way that no rhetoric of mine could express.'' "
Antipiracy Bills Delayed After an Online Firestorm,"WASHINGTON -- Congressional leaders on Friday indefinitely shelved two antipiracy bills that had rallied the Internet and rocked Capitol Hill, dealing a major defeat to the traditional media industry while emboldening a new breed of online political activists.Using a medium that helped organize protests against the legislation, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, announced via Twitter that the vote would be delayed. But he indicated that the issue, which had been scheduled for a vote Tuesday, had not died.''There's no reason that legitimate issues raised about PROTECT IP can't be resolved,'' he wrote, referring to the Senate bill by its shorthand name. ''Counterfeiting & piracy cost 1000s of #jobs yearly. Americans rightfully expect to be fairly compensated 4 their work. I'm optimistic that we can reach compromise on PROTECT IP in coming week.'' In the House, Representative Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, called off plans to formally draft his version of the antipiracy bill next month.After vowing two days ago to move forward, Mr. Smith said in a statement on Friday: ''The committee remains committed to finding a solution to the problem of online piracy that protects American intellectual property and innovation.'' But he added, ''The House Judiciary Committee will postpone consideration of the legislation until there is wider agreement on a solution.''Speaker John A. Boehner, talking with reporters Friday in Baltimore, where House Republicans held their annual retreat, called the bill ''well meaning,'' but said it needed ''more consensus.''Supporters of the shelved bills as well as opponents pushing an alternative backed by the Internet giants Google and Facebook said differences could be bridged. But privately, Congressional aides and lobbyists say the pressures of an election year make action this year unlikely. Lawmakers will not be eager to brave another firestorm incited by Google, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia and other popular Web sites.Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and a key opponent of the bills, said lawmakers had collected more than 14 million names -- more than 10 million of them voters -- who contacted them to protest the once-obscure legislation.''It's going to be a new day in the Senate,'' said Mr. Wyden, who is the co-author with Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, of an alternative bill that seeks to choke off money flows to Internet pirates. ''The way citizens communicate with their government is never going to be the same.''Mr. Wyden spoke briefly to Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who was the author of the shelved bill, and both men said they pledged to find a way forward.But Mr. Leahy, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made it clear that proponents of his bill, the Protect I.P. Act, felt burned by Internet companies that they said misled citizens into believing the bill would cripple the Internet. The opposition turned illegal on Thursday when the online hacker group Anonymous brought down the Department of Justice's Web site.''Assuming everyone's telling the truth, that they want to stop the theft of property, that they want to stop endangering people with counterfeit goods, then we ought to be able to find common ground,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''I hope people, when they're dealing, will deal honestly with you.''The Protect I.P. Act and its counterpart in the House, the Stop Online Piracy Act, had broad bipartisan support when they were drafted by Mr. Smith and Senator Leahy. The bills were pushed hard by the Hollywood studios, recording industry, book publishing world and United States Chamber of Commerce as antidotes to rampant piracy of American cultural wares by offshore Web sites.But many Internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Reddit, saw the bills as a threat, and said they would stifle creativity on the Internet while forcing search engines and social media to become police officers for the Department of Justice. Other outlets, such as Wikipedia, objected to any proposed laws that could crimp the free flow of information on the Internet.The Internet giants rallied their troops to rise up against such Washington stalwarts as the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America. What had started as a nonpartisan issue began turning to Republican advantage, as Republicans led the flight away from the bill.By Thursday night, senior Republican staff members were boasting that the remaining supporters of the bills were largely Democrats, even though members of both parties had helped draft them.Mr. Leahy went along with Mr. Reid's decision to back off but made it clear that he was doing so reluctantly.''More time will pass with jobs lost and economies hurt by foreign criminals who are stealing American intellectual property and selling it back to American consumers,'' he said in a statement.''The day will come when the senators who forced this move will look back and realize they made a knee-jerk reaction to a monumental problem,'' he added. ''Somewhere in China today, in Russia today, and in many other countries that do not respect American intellectual property, criminals who do nothing but peddle in counterfeit products and stolen American content are smugly watching how the United States Senate decided it was not even worth debating how to stop the overseas criminals from draining our economy.''

A Crackdown's Long Shadow: File-Sharing Site Operator Sought the Limelight,"BERLIN -- Some uninvited guests showed up at Kim Dotcom's mansion outside Auckland, New Zealand, on Friday: the police, in two helicopters.They had an arrest warrant for Mr. Dotcom, 37, who was born Kim Schmitz and is accused by United States authorities with criminal copyright infringement through the Web site Megaupload, which he founded.Finding their target was not easy. When Mr. Dotcom, who holds Finnish and German citizenship, first saw the police, he ran inside and activated several electronic locks, part of the estate's sophisticated security system. As the police made their way through those, he barricaded himself in a safe room. Officers cut their way through to get him, standing near a firearm that they said looked like a sawed-off shotgun. ''It was definitely not as simple as knocking at the front door,'' said Grant Wormald, a detective inspector.In what the American authorities have called one of the largest criminal copyright cases ever brought, the Justice Department and the F.B.I. shut down Megaupload.com and instigated the arrest of Mr. Dotcom and three other people in New Zealand. In all, seven people connected with the site were charged with running an international enterprise based on Internet piracy.The arrests come in the middle of a controversy over Congressional efforts in the United States to curtail Internet piracy.Megaupload, a so-called locker service, allows users to transfer large files like movies and music anonymously over the Internet, and media companies have long complained that some files are being transferred in violation of copyright law.A grand jury indictment says seven people in all were part of a criminal conspiracy involving Megaupload, charging each with five counts of copyright infringement and conspiracy. The possible penalty is 20 years in prison. The indictment says Megaupload caused $500 million in damages to copyright owners and made $175 million by selling ads and premium subscriptions.Megaupload's lawyer has said that ''the government is wrong on the facts, wrong on the law.''The police in New Zealand said they were continuing to search the Auckland property. In all, about 20 search warrants connected to the case were executed in the United States and in eight other countries, including New Zealand.About $50 million in assets were also seized, as well as a number of servers and 18 domain names that formed Megaupload's network of file-sharing sites. The police said they seized 6 million New Zealand dollars ($4.8 million) in luxury vehicles, including a Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe and a pink 1959 Cadillac. They also seized art and electronic equipment and froze 11 million dollars in cash in various accounts.The arrest of Mr. Dotcom, the central figure in the case, was not his first encounter with the law.In February 2001, Mr. Dotcom told Die Welt that he had spent three months in a Munich jail in 1994 and had served two years' probation for breaking into Pentagon computers and observing real-time satellite photos of Saddam Hussein's palaces during the Persian Gulf war of 1991. In the mid-1990s, Mr. Dotcom received a suspended two-year sentence for a swindle that made use of stolen phone card numbers.In 2001, at the height of the dot-com hysteria, Mr. Dotcom was accused in what was then the largest insider-trading case in German history. Prosecutors in Munich said he bought shares in a struggling online business, letsbuyit.com, then announced that he planned to make a major investment in the company and rescue it from insolvency.Mr. Dotcom reportedly made more than $1 million when the shares soared.Around that time, Mr. Dotcom, then still going by his former name, disputed the accusations mounting against him during an appearance on the Harald Schmidt Show, a popular late-night talk show in Germany.''It is true that I offer a lot of open flank to attack because of my lifestyle and the public way I live with my success,'' a congenial Mr. Dotcom, with a crew cut and black clothing, said. ''It's clear that that's why people are looking for things to hang on me.''Mr. Dotcom eventually fled Germany to escape those charges but was captured in Thailand, extradited and convicted in 2002. He spent five months in jail awaiting trial but received a suspended sentence on the underlying charges.Mr. Dotcom dropped from view until last year, when German newspapers started reporting rumors of his luxury compound in New Zealand and possible involvement in Megaupload.In the German television interview, which is posted on YouTube, Mr. Dotcom attributed the rumors swirling around him to a German tendency to envy those who have more. ''If I were in the United States, I would be just one of many with my lifestyle and would not draw any attention to myself,'' Mr. Dotcom said.Mr. Dotcom and the three others who were arrested in New Zealand appeared in court Friday afternoon and were denied bail. Extradition proceedings will continue Monday.The police said the other men arrested in New Zealand were Finn Batato, 38, a German citizen and resident; Mathias Ortmann, 40, a German citizen who is a resident of Hong Kong; and Bram van der Kolk, 29, a Dutch citizen who is a resident of New Zealand.

Internet Antipiracy Bills,"To the Editor:Re ''Online Piracy and Political Overreach'' (editorial, Jan. 19): We agree that legislators' ''newfound caution about the potential consequences'' of the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect I.P. Act offers encouragement that a workable compromise can be found that meets the competing interests of copyright owners and technology companies.We respect the protection of a company's or an individual's intellectual property rights, while also firmly believing in the freedom of expression and the continuation of an open and unrestricted Internet. As such, we oppose the bills, believing that they overreach and threaten the innovation and development of the Internet.Consumers should have access to legitimate content. Copyright owners should have practical means of protecting their works that also consider and serve the public interest. And technology companies should be free from undue legal or regulatory burdens.It is our hope that lawmakers will not impede the growth of the Internet or the public's access to online content by passing laws that aim to censor and unnecessarily target content providers and search engines in an arbitrary and capricious manner.GERARD F. CORBETT Chairman and Chief Executive Public Relations Society of America New York, Jan. 19, 2012 "
Beyond SOPA,"We welcomed the collapse this month of two flawed bills to prevent online piracy, bills that could have stifled speech and undermined Internet safety. But piracy by Web sites in countries like Russia and China, which offer high-quality bootleg copies of movies and music, is a real problem for the nation's creative industries. And there is legislation that could curb the operation of rogue Web sites without threatening legitimate expression. The Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade (OPEN) Act, sponsored by Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Darrell Issa, offers a straightforward and transparent approach to the problem. Content owners could ask the International Trade Commission to investigate whether a foreign Web site was dedicated to piracy. The Web site would be able to rebut the claim. If the commission ruled for the copyright holder, it could direct payment firms like Visa and PayPal and advertising networks like Google's to stop doing business with the Web site.The bill addresses concerns of copyright holders that the process would be too slow to match the pirates' speed. It would allow them to request temporary restraining orders when there is urgency to, say, stop a Russian Web site from illegally streaming the Super Bowl. That Web site would still have a chance to respond, but it would have to move more quickly to make its case.The OPEN Act also avoids some of the pitfalls of the previous bills. The legislation backed by movie studios and record labels would have penalized Web sites accused of the vague crimes of enabling or assisting piracy. OPEN would penalize only Web sites dedicated ''willfully and primarily'' to the infringement of copyrights or trademarks, a well-established standard used in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to prevent domestic piracy.OPEN would not give copyright holders the authority to direct payment processors and ad networks to stop doing business with a given Web site: that would have opened a door for abuse. And the Justice Department would not be able to ''disappear'' rogue Web sites by tinkering with their addresses -- a provision too much like hacking, which worried safety experts.By giving the International Trade Commission sole authority to determine infringement, OPEN would also prevent copyright holders from shopping around for sympathetic courts, making the process more consistent and less likely to spark trade conflicts and retaliatory moves.The new bill may not be perfect; some Web sites that aid or abet pirates may avoid punishment. But it gives copyright holders powerful new tools to protect themselves. And it goes a long way toward addressing the concerns of Internet companies, protecting legitimate expression on the Web from overzealous content owners. The two sides need to move beyond their resentments and push for its passage. "
Phone Security For the Military,"The military has long needed computers that are tough enough on the outside to withstand the rough and tumble of the battlefield. Now, with the proliferation of smartphones and tablets in the hands of soldiers, those devices also have to be strong on the inside. They are loaded with contacts, location information and all kinds of military-grade applications, so it can be deadly for a soldier to lose a mobile device or have its data leak out unwittingly.The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, has now assigned Invincea, a company based in Fairfax, Va., to fortify Android-based phones and tablets so they are safe in soldiers' hands. The $21 million grant to the company is a window into how pervasive networked technologies have become in the military - and the market that has opened up to secure them. Part of the problem, said Anup Ghosh, a professor at George Mason University and the founder of Invincea, is that soldiers often want to use their mobile devices to communicate with families back home, and to entertain themselves when they can. And so military applications sit side by side with games, social networking apps and other distractions.The risks can be unexpected. Soldiers playing games on an Army base in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, can easily and unknowingly transmit the names of their friends. A piece of malware can penetrate the operating system and suck out location information.At the same time, mobile devices are beginning to change the work and lives of soldiers as they have for everyone else, as the Department of Defense acknowledged in a strategy paper earlier this month.''Through faster access to information and computing power from any location, field units can maneuver unfamiliar environments with real time mapping and data overlay capabilities; soldiers can identify friendly forces; engineers can take pictures of mechanical parts for immediate identification and replacement ordering; and military health care providers can diagnose injuries and remotely access lab results while away from hospital premises,'' the department's chief information officer, Teresa Takai, wrote.The strategy paper called for ''a wireless security architecture that mitigates the risk of mobile device exploitation while leveraging new and emerging technical capabilities.''Invincea's first project for Darpa was to protect soldiers' smartphones from loss and theft. It developed software that encrypts files in the operating system and fills up the memory of a lost device with random, useless data; on a standard phone, wiping your data can still leave behind enormous amounts of information.That software is already being used by more than 3,000 soldiers stationed in Afghanistan.Its next project is to make sure that malware doesn't get in through an application, and that sensitive data does not get out. It is working on creating a virtual environment in which applications can run. In other words, it is trying to trick an ordinary application -- Facebook or Words With Friends -- into thinking that it is running in the phone's operating system, when it is actually sequestered in a separate virtual environment. The application, in that way, can be prohibited from gaining access to certain information: the phone's location, for instance, or the contacts that it contains.It can also be kept from gaining root privileges to the phone's operating system and taking over the device. That is especially important these days, as tools of war are also contained in those same devices, including applications that identify enemy and friendly forces.''By separating untrusted apps and content we are preventing the compromise of the operating system,'' Mr. Ghosh said.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Readers and Experts Weigh In on a Site Owner vs. Google," Malware may be the digital equivalent of bedbugs: suddenly ubiquitous, hard to treat and a real menace for those infested. That might explain why a Bits post on Thursday, ""One Man's Fight With Google Over a Security Warning,"" stoked such impassioned responses.One commenter likened Dr. Epstein's predicament with malware to ""a catastrophe in plain sight problem,"" like ""space junk, fracking, global warming."" He wrote, ""The day is fast approaching (or may have already passed) when the problem surmounts any attempt to solve it. There is a point when the utility of the Net is overwhelmed by ubiquitous evil.""Most commenters thought Dr. Epstein was too quick to shoot the messenger, in this case Google. ""You need to stop getting hacked, rather than blame Google for pointing out that you run an insecure and potentially malicious site,"" one person wrote. ""It may seem unfair,"" said another, ""but if you are going to run a Web site on the Internet you absolutely must ensure the security and integrity of the content on the site. This is not the responsibility of Google, Yahoo, Yandex, Baidu or any other service.""Some offered up their own tales of malware attacks, detailing their initial denial (""I thought surely Google must have made a mistake"") to blissful resolution (""It was only after I pored over the raw source code that I found subtle malicious code injected into the site. After removing the code, I put a request through Google's webmaster tools to re-scan the site, which they did promptly and removed the warning."")Google passed along a defense of the company from Niels Provos, principal software engineer on its security team: ""In this case, Google's warning protected users from a very real malware threat. Google uses a technology we call Safe Browsing to help protect millions of people every day from dangerous Web sites that could infect their computers with malware or do other harmful things."" Mr. Provos acknowledged that it could be hard to clean up a hacked site, but said Google offered information and tools to help, as did other sites including StopBadware.org.Still, some thought Google could afford to do more. ""By becoming the big elephant in the Internet tent, Google owes its users the ability to talk to a knowledgeable Google employee in this kind of situation. Will it cost them something? Yes. Can they afford it? Of course, with billions left over,"" John V. Kjellman wrote.Several readers went out of their way to investigate Dr. Epstein's site themselves. Maxim Weinstein, who runs StopBadware.org, found the site had been compromised and commended Google for protecting Web users. ""If Google's warning didn't exist, and for users visiting from other popular search engines like Bing or Yahoo, users are automatically redirected"" to malicious sites in India, he commented.Richard M. Smith, an Internet security consultant, e-mailed Dr. Epstein and The New York Times to report he found more than 500 spam pages promoting fake Adobe products on Dr. Epstein's site. ""It's clear his site has been badly compromised,"" Mr. Smith said by phone. ""Cleaning up these problems is not an easy thing to do. I can sympathize with his frustrations but the real story here is that Web site owners, who often aren't tech-savvy, are too quick to blame the messenger."" "
Android Malware Creeps Into Cellphone Bills," Smartphones are meant to be headache-free compared with old-school computers. But malicious software written for Android devices can be even sneakier than the malware that invaded PCs. The most prevalent form of Android malware scrapes small amounts of money from smartphone owners by making secret charges to their phone bills, according to a report published by Lookout, a mobile security company in San Francisco. This type of malware is called toll fraud, and it has the potential to fool plenty of people who don't pay close attention to their phone bills every month.But how does toll fraud work if the carriers control our bills? The process is actually very complex, said Derek Halliday, a product manager at Lookout.First, it helps to understand a legitimate transaction involving text messages. Say, for example, a person wants to send a text message to a service to buy a new ringtone. When this happens, the cellular network forwards the text message to a middleman service, which handles the transaction between the wireless provider and the ringtone provider. The ringtone provider then shoots a message to the cellphone owner asking for confirmation of the order. When the customer confirms the order, he receives the ringtone, his cellphone bill is charged, and the carrier takes a cut and gives the rest of the money to the ringtone provider and the middleman service.Here's how toll fraud works: A person downloads a malicious app. The app invisibly sends a text message to a service that uses a middleman service that has a relationship with the malware author. A confirmation message is sent back to the malware, which blocks it from being seen by the customer and confirms the charge. The charge goes to the user's bill, and the carrier takes its cut and gives the rest of the money to the service and the middleman, and thus the malware author.In its  report, Lookout estimates that from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2013, 18 million Android users may encounter malware. About 72 percent of the malware that Lookout detected this year was toll fraud, and the company expects this number to grow, because even though the process is complex, the code isn't difficult to replicate. The company advised cellphone owners to regularly check their bills for suspicious charges. "
Facebook Test: How to Please The New Faces,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief, has managed to amass more information about more people than anyone else in history.Now what?As Facebook turns to Wall Street in the biggest public offering ever by an Internet company, it faces a new, unenviable test: how to keep growing and enriching its hungry new shareholders.The answer lies in what Facebook will be able to do -- and how quickly -- with its crown jewel: its status as an online directory for a good chunk of the human race, with the names, photos, tastes and desires of nearly a billion people.Facebook's shares are expected to begin trading as early as this week. Already, lots of investors are scrambling to buy those shares, with giddy hopes that it will become a big moneymaker like Google. Because of that high demand, Facebook is expected to increase its offering price from its initial range, giving the company a valuation possibly as high as $104 billion. In the eight years since it sprang out of a Harvard dorm room, Facebook has signed up users at breakneck speed, kept them glued to the site for longer stretches of time and turned a profit by using their personal information to customize the ads they see.Whether it can spin that data into enough gold to justify a valuation of as much as $104 billion remains unclear.''We know Facebook has an awful lot of data, but what they have not worked out yet is the most effective means of using that data for advertising,'' said Catherine Tucker, a professor of marketing at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''They are going to have to experiment a lot more.''Analysts, investors and company executives can rattle off any number of challenges facing the company. As it works to better match ads to people, it has to avoid violating its users' perceived sense of privacy or inviting regulatory scrutiny. It needs to find other ways to generate revenue, like allowing people to buy more goods and services with Facebook Credits, a kind of virtual currency. Most urgently it has to make money on mobile devices, the window to Facebook for more and more people.All the while, its ability to innovate with new features and approaches -- to ''break things,'' in the words of Mr. Zuckerberg -- may be markedly constrained once it has investors to answer to.''They are going to have to think about whether they can continue with the motto 'Done is better than perfect,' '' said Susan Etlinger, an industry analyst at the Altimeter Group. ''When you're operating as a public company, life is very different. We haven't seen that play out yet. It's going to take a few quarters to figure out what a public Facebook is going to look like.''Skeptics point out that the company's revenue growth showed signs of slowing in the first quarter of 2012. And a Bloomberg survey of 1,253 investors, analysts and traders found that a substantial majority were dubious about the eye-popping valuation Facebook was seeking. ''It's a risky asset. No doubt about that,'' said Brian Wieser, of Pivotal Research Group. ''Google was less risky.'' No matter. Mr. Wieser says he thinks that Facebook is worth $83 billion and that its revenue will grow by at least 30 percent for the next five years.The comparisons to Google are inevitable. When that company went public in 2004, there were so many doubters that the company lowered its offering price to $85 a share. It closed at just over $100 on the first day of trading, and now sells for more than $600. Facebook is farther along than Google was in terms of revenue, having brought in nearly $4 billion last year, or $5.11 a user, compared with Google's $2 billion in 2003.One Facebook investor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of market regulations as the offering draws near, noted that when Google went public it already had a clear business strategy. By contrast, he described Facebook this way: ''They have built an incredibly valuable asset -- as opposed to a business they have executed well.''The most pressing issue for Facebook executives may be the mobile challenge. Already, over half of Facebook's 901 million users access the site through mobile devices. In regulatory filings, the company says mobile use is growing fastest in some of Facebook's largest markets, including the United States, India and Brazil. Facebook goes on to acknowledge that it makes little to no money on mobile and that ''our ability to do so successfully is unproven.''There is not much space on mobile screens to show advertisements. And Google and Apple, two of Facebook's biggest rivals, control the basic software on most smartphones, which could make it harder for the company to make inroads there. Facebook's response to this challenge so far has been to aggressively acquire companies focused on mobile, including Instagram, for which it paid $1 billion in April. But it warned in a revision to its offering documents last week that the mobile shift meant it was adding users faster than it was increasing the number of ads it displayed.What Facebook already has -- more than any other digital company -- is a spectacularly rich vault of information about its users, who cannot seem to stay away from the site. Americans, on average, now spend 20 percent of their online time on Facebook alone, thanks to the ever-growing menu of activities the company has introduced, from playing games to sampling music to posting pictures of baby showers and drunken escapades. Some 300 million photos are uploaded to the site daily.How Facebook exploits its users' information -- and how those users react -- is the next reckoning. David Eastman, worldwide digital director for the advertising agency JWT, said Facebook would need to give marketers more data about what kinds of users click on what kinds of advertising, and about their travels on the Internet before and after they click on an ad. Most brands want to have a presence on Facebook, he said, but they do not quite understand who sees their pitches and whether they lead to greater sales.''They need to make the data work more,'' Mr. Eastman said. ''They need to provide deeper data. Right now the value of Facebook advertising is largely unknown.''While the bulk of Facebook's revenue comes from North America, it is banking on international growth. The company has expanded its global footprint so rapidly that four out of five Facebook users are now outside the United States. It is the dominant social network in large emerging markets like Brazil and India, though it shows no signs of penetrating China -- where it would face not only government censorship but stiff competition from homegrown social networks.Mr. Zuckerberg, who has studied Mandarin, signaled his ambitions to crack the vast Chinese market as far back as 2010. He suggested that Facebook would first try to advance deeper into markets like Russia and Japan before it took on a country as ''complex'' as China.With international growth comes international regulatory headaches. Facebook already faces audits in Europe on whether the company is living up to promises made to consumers about how it uses their data -- and now, a stringent new data protection law. In India, it has been sued for spreading offensive content. And in the United States, it faces privacy audits by the Federal Trade Commission for the next 20 years. In its offering documents, Facebook repeatedly warns of legislative and regulatory scrutiny over user privacy, ''which may adversely affect our reputation and brand.''Maintaining brand loyalty is excruciatingly difficult in the Internet business. Across Silicon Valley, investors are plotting the next big thing in social networks. Already, the clock may be ticking for Facebook.''There is no consumer-facing Internet brand or site that ever keeps consumers' attention for more than 10 years,'' said Tim Chang, a managing director at Mayfield Fund. ''It is not hard to imagine that in 10 years, people are going to be off of Facebook even.''Mr. Zuckerberg has an answer to that. In the video for investors released this month, Mr. Zuckerberg hinted at the ambitions he had for the company. Facebook, in his vision, will hook itself into the rest of the Web, making itself indispensable. Already Facebook serves as a de facto Internet passport, allowing users to log in with their Facebook identities and explore millions of other Web sites and applications.''I think that we're going to reach this point where almost every app that you use is going to be integrated with Facebook in some way,'' Mr. Zuckerberg says in the video. ''We make decisions at Facebook not optimizing for what is going to happen in the next year, but what's going to set us up for this world where every product experience you have is social, and that's all powered by Facebook.''

"On Facebook, A Way to Use Real Money","It knows who you are. It knows what you like. Now it wants to make it easier for you to buy things, in your own currency.Facebook on Tuesday signaled its ambitions to grow as a payment platform, with changes to how its users can buy goods and services without leaving its site. It is also a clear indication to Wall Street that the company is pushing to make more money. Concerns about the company's revenue prospects have held back its shares since its public offering last month. Until now, Facebook has had its own virtual currency, called Facebook Credits, which was used mainly to buy virtual goods in games like FarmVille. Facebook took a 30 percent cut from those sales, bringing in a hefty 15 percent of total revenue last year. The changes announced on Tuesday are designed to encourage companies well beyond game developers to sell their wares on the Facebook platform itself. It carries the additional benefit of potentially keeping Facebook users on the site longer and harnessing more data about what they buy.The changes announced are twofold. First, Facebook users will be able to subscribe to services that require monthly payments. In the past, the service allowed one-time payments only. Second, users will be able to pay for things on Facebook in their own currency, rather than credits, which is vital for Facebook because it is a global network.''By supporting pricing in local currency, we hope to simplify the purchase experience, give you more flexibility, and make it easier to reach a global audience of Facebook users who want a way to pay for your apps and games in their local currency,'' Facebook said in a blog post for app developers.The new system will allow users to plug in their credit card information once and store it on Facebook, just as they could to buy Facebook Credits. But now, with one click, they will be able to buy whatever is on offer, priced in their own currency: a magazine subscription in euros, say, or concert tickets in dollars or games in Indian rupees.At the moment, there isn't a whole lot to buy on Facebook, though companies like Spotify, which offer music streaming, or Milyoni, which streams movies and concerts on Facebook, can take immediate advantage of the monthly subscriptions and seamless payments.The changes will begin next month, the company said, and are designed to work on mobile devices as well.Facebook is far from becoming iTunes, which is Apple's online entertainment store. But the tweaks announced Tuesday are a nod to the Apple model, where you pay in dollars and cents, not a whimsical currency. It is also a window into how Facebook is seeking to bring in more revenue from sources other than advertising.''They are showing us we care about driving revenue, and I think that's great,'' said Michael Pachter, an equities analyst with Wedbush Securities. ''That's what investors want to see.''This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Doing Apps and Start-Ups While Still in High School,"PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Like many young entrepreneurs here in Silicon Valley, Matthew Slipper knows that success does not come easy. His first start-up, an online education venture, flopped. His second, a video-sharing app for the iPhone, has sold only 20 copies.But Mr. Slipper is optimistic. He should be. He's just 18, a founding member of the Paly Entrepreneurs Club, an extracurricular group at the local high school that sprang into existence last September -- the brainchild of about a dozen students committed to inventing the future.''I want to build something that is tied to what is happening next,'' he said.While budding moguls in high school clubs like the Future Business Leaders of America invest make-believe money in the stock market or study the principles of accounting, the Entrepreneurs Club members have a distinctly Silicon Valley flavor: they want to create start-ups. They have met weekly during the school year to discuss their ventures and ideas, explore matters like money-raising strategies and new markets, and host guest speakers. Once, they held a Skype chat with a software engineer in Sweden who described the intricacies of running an online music business.Founding a company in high school is ''a great opportunity,'' said Vincent Gurle, 18. Later in life, ''if you fail at business you might have to go live with your parents,'' he said. ''But we're already doing that.''Mr. Gurle, who will attend the University of California, Santa Cruz in the fall, started a business last year aimed at supplying students to companies as software testers. It sputtered when he could not find enough companies interested in buying the service. He counts the effort a success anyway, he told the club at a recent meeting, figuring that the people he met will remember him when he returns with his next idea.Now he is learning how to program for Microsoft's new mobile operating system.Club members have been working on projects like a social network to help teenagers quickly organize study groups and a trading network for Bitcoin, a virtual currency. They have brainstormed ideas for mobile geolocation games and new kinds of grocery store scanners.At a recent meeting, about a dozen boys gathered in an empty economics classroom at Palo Alto High, known as Paly. The demographic somewhat reflects Silicon Valley, too; there were no girls, though all the boys say they wish some would join their club.There also were few laptops or even tablets in the room, befitting a post-PC world. All the boys had their work on paper or smartphones. They passed these around to show off their latest concepts.Mr. Slipper, who plans to attend the University of California, Santa Barbara in January after a stint in R.O.T.C. boot camp, demonstrated his video-sharing app, speaking quickly so as to leave time for everyone to talk about their ideas before the lunch bell rang.''The syntax wasn't hard,'' he said, explaining the coding involved. ''Objective C in the iOS framework took me about two weeks to learn. I've modeled the business on Instagram, leveraging speed and ease of loading.'' Sympathetic young heads nodded.''How will you protect your intellectual property?'' asked Aaron Bajor, 18, one of the group's founders. He was waiting to discuss a diagram of his own project, a social network for entrepreneurs entering college.''Someone can always copy your idea, but that will be half-baked,'' Mr. Slipper said confidently. ''It's not theirs.''James Maa, another club founder, was up next to discuss his project, the study group social network.''We're not out in public yet,'' he said, apologetically. Mr. Maa, 18, plans to study computer science at the University of California, Berkeley in the fall. His social life, which included attending many events for start-ups, had gotten in the way of building the network, which he calls Bubble.Not everyone had a project to present, and that was acceptable.''The goal here is inspirational,'' said Mr. Bajor, who is headed to the University of Southern California to study entrepreneurship. ''A great idea can hit you any time. Even if you do not have a great idea yet, if you have capabilities and passion others will want you on their team.''Not every would-be tech titan at Paly belongs to the club. Some were distracted by college applications and plans for the prom. Or other things. ''There are probably a half-dozen other kids who should be in this club,'' Mr. Bajor said, but they just didn't have time. ''They are too busy starting their own companies.''Start-up fever for these students is something they breathe in the air, or learn at home, with parents who work in the tech industry. Fern Mandelbaum, a partner at the venture capital firm Monitor Ventures, and a parent at the school, attended a club meeting to explain how her business works.The students in the club were not the only beneficiaries of Ms. Mandelbaum's advice: Her daughter, Skylar Dorosin, started and for several years ran a summer camp. Ms. Dorosin, 17, is heading to Stanford in the fall, and has turned the camp over to her 11-year-old brother, Miles Dorosin.''The kids here have such an unfair advantage,'' said Aaron Levie, 27, the chief executive of a data storage company, Box, referring to students throughout the Valley. He recently spoke during Science Week at another local high school, nearby Los Altos High. ''In Seattle we had lots of computers, but we never had venture capitalists drop by.''At his talk in Los Altos, he had this advice.''I told them to make friends and leverage their four years of freedom,'' he said. ''If you look at Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, you see that lots of foundational things can happen among high school friends.'' Like those other companies, he said, Box, valued at about $350 million, was built by several high school friends.Deborah Whitson, a Paly economics teacher who is the club's faculty adviser, said that in recent years she had noticed a shift in the kinds of projects that interest business-minded students. ''In the 'olden days' we'd have a few jewelry designers or dog walkers among the students,'' she said. ''The Internet started to change that. In the past five years, things have boomed because of the iPhone.''Ms. Whitson worries that the club may not survive without its enthusiastic leaders. Mr. Bajor, however, said his brother, who just finished his sophomore year, is eager to pursue his own start-up dreams.Another sophomore, 15-year-old Max Bernstein, helped the club recruit some speakers this year, but had to drop out of meetings because of time conflicts with the robotics club. Next year, though, he said he would have more time for the Entrepreneurs Club. He won't have to take gym class. "
"'Good Wife' Watch: Jason Biggs, Jim Cramer and Bitcoin Get in on the Action","It was a curious choice for ""The Good Wife"": an episode built around an obscure digital currency called Bitcoin that many of the show's viewers probably assumed was fictional. (If any Bitcoin evangelists find their way to this post, they can abuse me for calling the virtual money system, which went online in 2009, ""obscure."") The writers clearly loved the case at the center of ""Bitcoin for Dummies"" on Sunday night, though -- I didn't put a stopwatch on it, but it felt as if the Case of the Week received more time than it had for quite a while.Clearly someone on the show's staff was familiar enough with the Bitcoin story to know that beyond all the technological, economic and legal issues it raises -- which were treated superficially but reasonably intelligently during the episode -- lies a terrific real-life mystery: who invented it? The  developer of record, Satoshi Nakamoto, is assumed to be a pseudonym; Nakamoto wasn't mentioned, as far as I could tell, but the true identity of the Bitcoin inventor was the crux of the episode (which involved a federal investigation that as yet has no parallel in the real world). Spoiler alert:  from among the theories that have been floated, the writers chose the multiple-inventors-under-one-name option, though in a nice touch Kalinda was the only character who figured it out. Alicia, in line with the show's cutesy habit of having the (formidably intelligent) parents turn to their children for tech support, said during the Bitcoin discussions, ""This stuff makes me feel so dated,"" which only succeeded in making the show feel dated.Jason Biggs was the main guest star, as the central suspect in the government's investigation; it's still hard for me to see him as anything other than a comedian, but he was good here in a form-fitting role as a smart-aleck geek. Jennifer Ferrin, known for  noble, suffering mothers (""Life on Mars,"" ""The Cape""), got to play sharp and sexy for a change as another of the suspects. Not so pleasant: the self-promoting appearance in the witness stand by Jim Cramer of CNBC.But I'm burying the lede here. There were major developments in Will's corruption case (the one that threatens to bring down Lockhart Gardner but is played out in brief, interstitial scenes). After weeks of wondering what the actual evidence might be against Will, we were let in on the secret: when he stopped gambling, he still owed his bookie $8,000, and the bookie forgave the debt. That's it? $8,000? Apparently it's enough to create an impression that the bookie's presence at Will's pick-up basketball games was a quid pro quo. But my immediate reaction was, come on, that's the best you can do? Did someone think that up during a bathroom break? (And are we really supposed to believe that that would be enough to make Will let the bookie into the games,  a lapse that has never made sense? Or are we supposed to think that it was just Will's addictive, aggressive personality?)Other revelations and skullduggery followed, revealed through  the Kalinda-Dana flirtation. The state plans to use Alicia's allegedly forged signature on the divorce document from the previous episode as a wedge against Will, forcing him into a legal and romantic corner and allowing for some highly charged future scenes. The immediate problem, though, is a Lockhart Gardner case file that contains information damaging to Will. He can't ask Kalinda to do anything with it, but his stare at her across the desk is meant to communicate something.  We might expect her to get rid of it, but the next time we see the file, Kalinda is delivering it to Will's persecutors, in the person of Dana. This of course can't be as straightforward as it looks. But what game is Kalinda playing? Has she doctored the contents of the file? Is she selling out Will to protect Alicia? Is she working a back-door deal with Cary? Your guesses are welcome in the comments.Best moment in the episode: Zach's guileless manipulation of his mother, using Alicia's liberal guilt and her hatred of Jackie to ensure an open-door policy for his new girlfriend, Nisa. Other nominations?  "
Canada Seeks to Turn Coins Into Digital Currency,"Last month, Canada announced that it would eliminate its penny. Now the Royal Canadian Mint is using one of the oldest forms of currency, gold, to attract software developers to its project, the MintChip Challenge, to transform the country's remaining coins into digital currency.The creators of the best digital payment application entered in the contest will receive a gold wafer currently worth about $17,000.Unlike some digital payment systems, the MintChip has low aspirations. It is only intended to pay for low-value items, physically or online. Since Canada long ago replaced $1 and $2 banknotes with coins, that effectively means anything worth less than $5 to $10.Despite its name, the MintChip is more a protocol and system than a physical device. While the mint currently has prototype versions based on a chip, it said the system could be included in mobile phones or, for people interested only in online transactions, remain entirely on servers. When used in a physical form, the MintChip does not require an Internet connection for payments and, unlike debit and credit cards, its transactions are not run through third parties.The lure of gold appears to have had the effect the mint desired. Although it had originally planned to accept submissions until Aug. 1, a note on the mint's Web site indicates that it is no longer accepting entries ""due to a very high level of interest."" Between all of the prizes, the mint will distribute about two pounds of gold in total with a value of about $50,000.With MintChip, or Cybermonnaie as it is known in Canada's other official language, the mint joins a long list of organizations and corporations, including Canada's Research In Motion, that are hoping to set standards for digital currency and, in many cases, take a cut of the action. Osama Bedier, the vice president for payments at Google, is among the MintChip Challenge judges. "
The New Pay Phone and What It Knows About You,"The term pay phone has a new meaning today. For consumers who wish to ditch their wallets, paying through a mobile phone can be awfully convenient. Those same consumers can also, often unwittingly, give up valuable information about themselves to merchants that want to sell them things. A new survey by law professors at the University of California, Berkeley, suggests that most Americans are uneasy with the idea that their phones could divulge behavioral and personal information, like phone numbers and in-store browsing habits. The survey was created by Chris Hoofnagle and Jennifer Urban, who study digital privacy issues, and financed by Nokia, which makes cellphones. The survey posed a variety of questions by phone to 1,200 people nationwide. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.It found that four out of five of those surveyed ""objected to the transfer of their phone number to a store where they purchase goods,"" while 15 percent said they would ""probably allow"" transmission of that information and only 3 percent said they would ""definitely allow it.""  It also found that consumers were less worried about giving up their e-mail addresses. Although half of the respondents said they would not want to share their e-mail addresses with the merchant, one-third said they would be ""willing"" or ""probably willing"" to do so. The most visceral reaction was elicited by a question that asked whether consumers would be willing to share ""information about you with the stores that you visit, when you are just browsing."" An overwhelming 96 percent said they would ""definitely not allow"" or ""probably not allow"" it. Mobile payment is common in many parts of the world, and slowly gaining acceptance in the United States, particularly with young consumers. A Federal Reserve survey found those in the age bracket of 18 to 44 represented more than two-thirds of mobile payment users. It is not always clear to users of mobile payment services exactly what kinds of information is recorded and retained by the company that owns the mobile platform - say Apple, in the case of purchases made on iTunes, or eBay in the case of mobile payments using PayPal - or how that is used for marketing purposes.  The researchers wrote that the new wave of mobile payment services could profoundly alter the relationship between customers and those service providers.  ""Further,"" they concluded, ""there is no guarantee that this shift would be apparent to consumers using mobile payments systems to complete sales transactions."" Facebook allows its users to buy virtual goods with a currency that it calls Facebook Credits. The Berkeley professors warned of the prospect that ""social network services with payment systems could add transaction histories to their already rich databases of behavioral information."" "
"Don't Be Shocked by More Big Acquisitions, Facebook Says"," If you thought the $1 billion Instagram buy was big, don't be surprised by more big buys: Facebook will continue to invest in things that rev up its presence on mobile phones. That's one crucial message that Facebook executives are conveying to would-be investors in the company's roadshow video, posted online Thursday.""Expect us to invest heavily in our mobile presence, even if mobile monetization is uncertain and will take time,"" David Ebersman, the company's chief financial officer, says toward the end of the 32-minute video. Mr. Ebersman said the company was in a heavy investment stage, adding that it had to spend significantly already on building the infrastructure required to accommodate high volumes of data.  Mr. Ebersman is expected to take a lead role in the roadshow, and he comes across as an executive that Wall Street might recognize. He wears a striped blue shirt. Mark Zuckerberg, the company's co-founder and chief executive, is dressed in a gray short-sleeved T-shirt and jeans. The video devotes considerable time to convince investors that advertising, which is Facebook's principal revenue source, is a promising business. Executives from Ben and Jerry's and American Express promote the value of Facebook advertising, and Sheryl Sandberg, its chief operating officer, offers the example of a Minneapolis-area wedding photographer who, according to Facebook, spent $1,500 on advertising on Facebook in 2011 and generated $70,000 in revenue.   Ms. Sandberg speaks directly to advertisers. Facebook, she says, can match businesses to people who will value their services and allow brands to reach new consumers by leveraging their friends' recommendations. ""People trust recommends from their friends more than any other source,"" Ms. Sandberg says. She talks about ""sponsored stories,"" which refers to an advertisement that shows up on a Facebook users' news feed, on the computer and mobile device. Facebook earned more than $3 billion from advertising in 2011, and it will have to increase that revenue to keep its future investors happy. Its only other real source of revenue so far is a currency system known as Facebook Credits. These are largely used to play games on the Facebook platform, and Facebook earns a hefty 30 percent commission from each transaction. Mr. Ebersman suggested that the company might extend Facebook Credits to other products and services and hinted that it could reduce its fees. A previous version of this post misspelled  the surname of Facebook's chief financial officer. It is David Ebersman, not Ebersmann. "
Daily Report: Facebook's Growth Prospects,"As Facebook turns to Wall Street in the biggest public offering ever by an Internet company, it faces a new, unenviable test: how to keep growing and enriching its hungry new shareholders, reports Somini Sengupta of The New York Times. Analysts, investors and company executives can rattle off any number of challenges facing the company. As it works to better match ads to people, it has to avoid violating its users' perceived sense of privacy or inviting regulatory scrutiny. It needs to find other ways to generate revenue, like allowing people to buy more goods and services with Facebook Credits, a kind of virtual currency. Most urgently, it has to make money on mobile devices, the window to Facebook for more and more people.All the while, its ability to innovate with new features and approaches - to ""break things,"" in the words of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg - may be markedly constrained once it has investors to answer to.""They are going to have to think about whether they can continue with the motto 'Done is better than perfect,' "" said Susan Etlinger, an industry analyst at the Altimeter Group. ""When you're operating as a public company, life is very different. We haven't seen that play out yet. It's going to take a few quarters to figure out what a public Facebook is going to look like.""  "
Deal Will Allow One-Tap Purchases Through Facebook,"Bango, a British company that few will have heard of on this side of the Atlantic, wants to help Facebook make money on mobile devices -- not by showing advertisements, but by making it easy to buy things when you log into Facebook on your phone.You might want to buy a game or concert tickets or an astrological forecast. Careful where your fingers go. One tap, and a charge will show up on your phone bill. ""Frictionless"" payment is how Bango puts it.Bango will get a cut of each click; it declined to say how much. Details will emerge when Bango, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, reports its next quarterly earnings. The telephone carrier will get a fee as well; Bango says it has negotiated a range with carriers.The arrangement could provide an additional benefit to Facebook: It allows the social network to bypass rivals like Apple and Google and avoid sharing a slice of revenue with them.The payment tool works on the mobile Web version of Facebook, not in its apps. More than half of Facebook's 955 million users worldwide use the social network on their mobile phones.Making money from mobile devices is Facebook's most urgent challenge, as its stock price languishes below $20, nearly half of its worth when it went public in May. Advertising is its principal money maker, though it has been experimenting with other revenue channels as well. It gets 30 cents of every dollar that users spend with its social gaming partner, Zynga.As part of its mobile strategy, on Thursday Facebook released upgrades to its Apple apps to make them faster.In June, the company signaled its ambitions to grow as a payment platform when it announced that it would eliminate its virtual currency, Facebook Credits, and instead let users pay for virtual goods and services using their credit cards.Facebook now allows its users to buy what they wish on the Facebook platform using their own national currency. This could serve as an important source of profit in the near future.There is an important caveat. It remains to be seen whether ordinary Facebook users will feel comfortable buying things with no more than a tap on their phones. "
Another Shoe Drops on Facebook,"E-mail: haggler@nytimes.com Keep it brief and family-friendly, include your hometown and go easy on the caps-lock key. Letters may be edited for clarity and length.FACEBOOK'S initial public stock offering caused a lot of well-publicized agita. But if you think investors were the only ones fuming at the company, read on.Q. In mid-April, my Facebook profile was hijacked. I could not sign into my account, and someone started posting photographs of sneakers on my home page, along with comments -- mine, it seemed, to anyone who visited -- like ''Nike Air Jordan super sale, 75 percent off!'' Soon after, my friends were getting messages urging them to buy sneakers.I followed all of Facebook's suggestions for reporting the abuse and had my friends report that someone was pretending to be me, to no avail. Just as bad, getting someone at the company to help proved impossible. I have close to 2,000 Facebook friends and do not want to start from scratch creating a new profile and page. I understand that I signed off on Facebook's terms of service, but it seems as if the world's largest social network ought to handle a problem like this a lot more efficiently.Can you help? Samuel ReedPhiladelphiaA. Before we solve Mr. Reed's problem, let's pause a moment and consider the business model of the spammer who took over his account. The idea, apparently, is to fool the Facebook friends of Mr. Reed -- a public-school teacher and a grandfather -- into thinking that he had suddenly become a sneaker freak. And not just any sneaker freak, but one with links to an e-commerce site, Streetretro.com, which sells merchandise at discounts.Regardless of who was behind this hijacking -- an e mail to Streetretro.com was not returned -- it is hard to imagine that as a sales strategy, this one is very effective. But a lot of spammers try variations on this theme, as any Internet search will show.Fred Wolens, a spokesman for Facebook, says it thwarts 600,000 attempts a day to hack into user accounts. Mr. Wolens did not say how many attacks get past Facebook's defenses.How was Mr. Reed's account hijacked? He was probably phished, Mr. Wolens says. You can be phished when you enter your account information into a Web site other than Facebook's. Sometimes these sites look like Facebook's sign-in page; others proclaim offers for freebies of various kinds.Facebook has a page about how to avoid phishing. It also has a page about what to do if you're locked out of your own account, but the Haggler strongly recommends that you avoid this page unless you have actually been hacked, particularly if you are a Facebook user who is logged in. The site assumes that you've been attacked, and unless you hit ''cancel'' -- one of two options you'll have -- you will be forced to change your password and security question. And you'll learn very little about the hacking problem.Mr. Reed got to know the hack page quite well, and he says he followed all instructions posted there. None worked, he said, and all he got from Facebook were some unhelpful automated e-mails. So the Haggler contacted Facebook and quickly heard back from Mr. Wolens. He said it would reach out to Mr. Reed through its User Ops team, which the Haggler likes to think is made up of men and women in Ninja costumes, saluting one another in a darkened room.Soon after, a User Ops member sent an e-mail to Mr. Reed, asking him to e-mail a photocopy of a government identification card, like a driver's license. Which Mr. Reed did. It would be nice to report that a speedy resolution followed, but for some reason, Facebook asked Mr. Reed to gain entry to his account using an e-mail address that wasn't his. The Haggler conveyed this to Mr. Wolens, and not long afterward, Mr. Reed was back in his account, with instructions on how to delete all those sneaker ads.How did Facebook perform through all this? Better than its shares! (The Haggler can't resist a cheap joke at the expense of billionaires. It's a weakness.)Actually, it's surprisingly hard to pin down exactly how much of Mr. Reed's travails can be pinned on Facebook, because it is surprisingly hard to figure out what happened here. Mr. Wolens says Mr. Reed initially sent a message to Facebook through a queue that wasn't in use anymore -- in a ''deprecated'' queue, in the company's parlance. But Mr. Wolens also said that Mr. Reed, after writing to that queue, was forwarded to the company's standard help page. This is a confounding detail, and the Haggler is leaving out several others, mostly because they are very boring.Suffice it to say, Facebook is obliged to make its system safe, but it's hard to imagine how it can respond in some personal way to the woes of individual users. That said, the Haggler had to laugh when Mr. Wolens said that Facebook believes that its users prefer ''self-remediation'' -- basically, online solutions they find without help -- to dealing with Facebook employees.After a few attempts at self-remediation, the Haggler thinks most people would prefer speaking to a human.Let's close by noting that Mr. Reed -- who, by the way, teaches his students about how to deal with social media -- says he thinks that Facebook deserves poor marks for the way it dealt with him. Facebook's aloof and generic responses irked him. He made this point on the phone, when the Haggler wondered whether he could really describe himself, as he'd been doing, as a ''Facebook customer.''''Facebook makes its money from my personal information and the personal information of millions of other people,'' he said. That creates an obligation, he went on. ''My big thing is this -- what kind of corporate culture does Facebook want to convey?'' "
"Google, Accused of Skirting Privacy Provision, Is to Pay $22.5 Million to Settle Charges","SAN FRANCISCO - The Federal Trade Commission fined Google $22.5 million on Thursday to settle charges that it had bypassed privacy settings in Apple's Safari browser to be able to track users of the browser and show them advertisements, and violated an earlier privacy settlement with the agency.The fine is the largest civil penalty ever levied by the commission, which has been cracking down on tech companies for privacy violations and is also investigating Google for antitrust violations. ""The social contract has to be that if you're going to hold on to people's most private data, you have to do a better job of honoring your privacy commitments,"" said David C. Vladeck, the director of the commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a call with reporters. ""And if there's a message the commission is trying to send today, it's that.""The commission said Google had broken the terms of a 2011 settlement over privacy missteps related to the Buzz, a social networking tool now defunct. In the settlement Thursday, Google did not admit to violating the law.A commissioner, J. Thomas Rosch, filed a dissenting statement because he said the commission should not have accepted Google's denial of liability, which he called ""inexplicable.""Google has said its actions had been unintentional and had resulted from a change in Safari of which Google was unaware. When the issue was brought to the company's attention, it said, it stopped tracking Safari users and showing them personalized ads.On the call with reporters, Mr. Vladeck said he had little patience with Google's explanation, and referred to other privacy violations about which Google has also said it was unaware, like collecting personal data with its Street View cars.""As a regulator, it is hard to know which answer is worse - I didn't know or I did it deliberately,"" Mr. Vladeck said. ""We hope that the civil penalty we're imposing here today and continued monitoring of Google's performance by the commission and by others frankly will force Google to have a better sense of what's going on.""Some analysts have questioned the commission's power to effectively police tech companies, which have repeatedly settled privacy violations with the commission. The fine, though large by commission standards, is small for Google.

Dow Jones Names Lex Fenwick Its New Chief Executive,"5:25 p.m. | Updated Lex Fenwick, the former head of Bloomberg L.P.,  will take over as the chief executive of Dow Jones & Company, publisher of The Wall Street Journal. The move, announced Thursday by News Corporation, Dow Jones's parent company, fills a six-month vacancy created when Les Hinton resigned in July amid a phone-hacking scandal at the company's British newspaper unit. Mr. Fenwick, 52, will assume the helm of the publisher as it aggressively pushes into new digital platforms as readers increasingly turn to the Web. In an e-mail, Robert Thomson, editor-in-chief of Dow Jones and managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, said Mr. Fenwick  ""has a genuine feel for the character of contemporary content and its value, and this instinct and insight and drive will be the stuff of our future prosperity.""   A greater investment in digital outlets and video has helped The Journal remain the largest United States newspaper, with a weekday circulation, including print and digital subscriptions, of 2.1 million as of Sept. 30, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. In the same period, WSJ.com had 537,469 paid digital subscribers.But several veteran journalists have recently left the paper, including the Pulitzer Prize winners Steve Stecklow, Douglas A. Blackmon and Alix Freedman. Both Ms. Freedman and Mr. Stecklow joined Reuters. On Wednesday, CNBC confirmed it had hired Kelly Evans, a co-anchor of WSJ.com's weekday morning newscast, ""The News Hub."" Meanwhile, The Journal re-hired Raju Narisetti, who had served as managing editor at The Washington Post since 2009. Mr. Thomson said other big-name hires were in the works.In a statement welcoming Mr. Fenwick, Rupert Murdoch, News Corporation's chairman and chief executive, emphasized the company's digital efforts at all Dow Jones brands, including the Dow Jones Newswires, Barron's and MarketWatch. ""We are thrilled that Lex will be driving our plans to grow all our Dow Jones franchises into true innovative market leaders for today's digital world,"" Mr. Murdoch wrote.Mr. Fenwick joined Bloomberg in 1987 and spent much of his early years abroad as manager of Bloomberg operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He served as chief operating officer of Bloomberg L.P. under Michael R. Bloomberg and, when his boss ran for Mayor of New York City in 2001, Mr. Fenwick became chief executive. He most recently founded and led a Bloomberg L.P. subsidiary, Bloomberg Ventures.""He was instrumental in helping build a company that continues to lead and grow,'' a Bloomberg spokesman, Ty Trippet, said in an e-mail. ""We wish Lex the best and thank him for his contribution."" Mr. Fenwick will take over as chief executive on Feb. 13, and will report to Chase Carey, News Corporation's president and chief operating officer. In a statement, Mr. Carey thanks Todd Larson, a long-time Dow Jones executive, who had been serving as acting chief executive while the company searched for a replacement for Mr. Hinton. "
The Dangers of Allowing an Adversary Access to a Network,"Schoolchildren learn the tale of the Trojan Horse, the giant gift in which Odysseus and a platoon of 30 Greek soldiers hid to gain access to the heavily defended city.Thousands of years later, it remains a thoroughly modern concept that is increasingly found at the heart of cyberwarfare strategies. Modern Trojan horses are computer code or vulnerabilities hidden in software or hardware that would allow a spy or an attacker to gain access to an adversary's computers and networks. Find a way to be invited into the computers of your enemy's weapons and military systems and you can render them useless in the face of an attack.For more than a decade, Pentagon officials have been anxious about the growing reliance by the United States electronics industry on Chinese manufacturers. As the Internet has become the nation's critical infrastructure weaving together commerce and power systems and even military command and control, it has become increasingly unthinkable to have a foreign presence in the network. Their fear is that those building and maintaining the network could build in a Trojan horse.Thus it was striking that the word ""Trojan"" was not mentioned in a 52-page report issued Monday by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence focusing on the activities of two giant Chinese telecommunications firms, Huawei and ZTE, which have long been suspected of having links to the Chinese government. Beijing has been suspected of trying to steal American corporate and government secrets through computer espionage.Stuxnet, a surreptitious program that was reportedly designed by United States and Israeli intelligence agencies to afflict the Iranian nuclear enrichment program, had many of the properties of a highly sophisticated Trojan horse. The program was at the heart of a concerted effort to delay or destroy the Iranian Natanz nuclear fuel facility. The attack damaged centrifuges and might have provided a surveillance window into Iranian activities by giving Western intelligence agencies unfettered access to the desktop computers of Iranian project managers.The program acted as a Trojan horse, perhaps delivered first on a USB memory stick, that then spread through computer networks inside the secret facility before reaching the outside world. A striking map of the paths followed by Stuxnet infection created by researchers at Symantec, the Silicon Valley computer security firm, indicates that Stuxnet actually broke out of Natanz, rather than breaking in, just as the Greek soldiers climbed out of the horse at night.Possibly because the United States is making Trojan horses, that term - if it exists in the House report on Huawei and ZTE - is said to be found only in a classified annex to the report that has not been made available.The published report consists of a series of allegations about the activities of the companies, including bribery and surveillance, but little hard evidence. Reports of ""suspicious"" incidents, including an ostensible case of ""beaconing"" from Cricket, a Texas wireless operator that uses Huawei equipment, have been heatedly denied by Huawei.If this issue is important enough, saidRichard A. Clarke, who served as the nation's counterterrorism overseer in both the Clinton andGeorge W. Bush administrations, there should be ways of declassifying the information. ""They're making important accusations,"" he said. ""Important accusations require important proof.""According to several former government officials, the real issue is not what has happened in the past but rather what might happen if Huawei gear were widely used in American telecommunications networks. Such use would mean that the company would have to serve and fix the network, requiring extensive access for its technical personnel to telecommunications networks in the United States.The danger in letting your potential adversary maintain your network has already been demonstrated, according to Mr. Clarke, who wrote in ""Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It."" In 2007, a remarkably sophisticated computer attack by Israel rendered Syrian antiaircraft radar useless. Israeli aircraft were able to destroy a Syrian nuclear reactor without any response from the country's military. He says it was vulnerable because the Syrians had relied on outsiders to maintain the network.Mr. Clarke disputes a recent New Yorker article that asserted that the bombing attack was supported by conventional electronic warfare, which involves jamming or deceiving an enemies' radar with high-powered radio waves. ""Regular electronic warfare fills the frequencies with static and overpowers the frequencies,"" he said. ""That wakes people up. That didn't happen. The Syrians didn't notice the jamming of their radars.""In 2009, The New York Times reported that an American semiconductor industry executive who claimed to have direct knowledge of the operation said that technology for disabling the radars had been supplied by Americans to the Israeli electronic intelligence agency, Unit 8200.If his account is true, it may be the real reason that the government has worked so hard to make sure that American computer networks are not made in China.

Cyberwar and Social Media in the Gaza Conflict,"LONDON - The grievances in the Gaza war may be as ancient as the history of a torn and tangled region that underpins one of the world's most intractable disputes. But the weapons are spanking new, reflecting the nature of war in the cyber-era.  As I mention in my latest column for the IHT, both sides are trying to harness social networks to promote their rival versions of the unfolding and uneven battle between the conventional might of the Israel Defense Forces and the rocket-firing units of Hamas's armed wing. But the cyberwar goes beyond that. Anonymous, the hacking collective, says it hasstruck at official Israel Web sites, and the Israeli authorities themselves say that a staggering 44 million hacking attempts have been made since the latest conflagration began last Wednesday. Only one succeeded for 10 minutes or so on an unspecified site, according to Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz. Most hacking attempts have been made on defense-related sites. On Monday, part of the war seemed to have tipped in Israel's favor with the I.D.F.'s Twitter posts far outnumbering those of the armed wing of Hamas, which seemed to have posted with far less frequency than earlier. ""The war is taking place on three fronts,"" Carmela Avner, Israel's chief information officer, told Reuters. ""The first is physical, the second is on the world of social networks and the third is cyber."" "
"Using His Software Skills With Freedom, Not a Big Payout, in Mind","E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com; Twitter: @jimdwyernytNadim Kobeissi, master hacker, summoned for interrogation multiple times as a teenager by cyber-intelligence authorities in Beirut, Lebanon, sat in the backyard of a restaurant in Brooklyn, astounded that he was being treated to lunch.''Please,'' he protested, ''you shouldn't pay for my omelet.''Mr. Kobeissi, 21, now a college student in Montreal, spent the weekend in New York City with elders of his tribe, software code writers who have ambitions that do not involve making suitcases of money off clever applications for sharing photographs online. This group was building a project called Cryptocat, which has a simple, countercultural goal: people should be able to talk on the Internet without being subjected to commercial or government surveillance.''The whole point of Cryptocat is that you click a link and you're chatting with someone over an encrypted chat room,'' said Mr. Kobeissi, who was born in Lebanon and said he had lived through four wars. ''That's it. You're done. It's just as easy to use as Facebook chat, Google chat, anything.''The Arab Spring showed that the power of the Internet and Web communications is a multi-edged blade, with activists able to organize through social media and to get their stories out, and authoritarian governments often able to target the activists by following the trail of digital crumbs.Among the conspicuous sources of information are the chat transcripts often kept on commercial servers, making it easy to see who was talking, what they talked about, and when the conversations took place. Cryptocat and a few other services disguise the content of chat messages so that they look like gibberish to anyone who does not have the encryption key. There is nothing new about encryption technology, but it is a brain-breaking subject, and the tools for using it are tricky.Mr. Kobeissi started building Cryptocat a year ago in his bedroom with the goal of making it simple to encrypt an online conversation. He had help last weekend from the Guardian Project, a group of developers who are trying to make mobile phones secure. They figured out a way to encrypt a chat on an Android phone by shaking it, taking advantage of the motion detectors in many smartphones. This will generate the digits that are part of the encryption process.''You can dance with your phone to encrypt it,'' Mr. Kobeissi said.Up to 10 people can speak privately to one another at a time in a Cryptocat chat room, a feature that distinguishes it from other encryption chat services. It is not ready for use by people in life-and-death situations, Mr. Kobeissi said, but it can give people a place to avoid everyday monitoring of routine conversation.''Cryptocat is an enabling, positive technology, and it's an alternative,'' said Jacob Appelbaum, a developer with the Tor project, which routes Web traffic in ways that help disguise sites that people have visited. ''A key thing here is that it is an experiment, with valid criticisms. It's not perfect. But it is important that we have people who are interested and knowledgeable about computer security who are working on these things, not just for money, and not just to break into people's computers.''The group met over the weekend at a code-a-thon organized by Julia Angwin of The Wall Street Journal, which has chronicled the spread of commercial surveillance in everyday technology in a vital series of articles and engaging online demonstrations called What They Know. A recent article in Wired magazine detailed big advances in United States government surveillance capabilities. Mr. Appelbaum and a documentary filmmaker, Laura Poitras, are holding a teach-in Friday evening at the Whitney Museum of American Art on the subject of surveillance.The invention of powerful tools to thwart the commercial and governmental collection of personal data has been criticized as creating hiding places for terrorists and online sexual predators. Mr. Kobeissi said he had been startled by those complaints. ''Evil people have been evil forever,'' he said. ''I don't think they're going to stop being evil or become more evil because of Cryptocat.''He appears to be wide open and unguarded about himself.''I love it when people criticize me,'' he said, pausing for a second and then amending his words. ''When they criticize me technically.''His ambitions with Cryptocat are not financial, though he is trying to raise $2,000 to cover his costs for the next year. ''Money is great, money is amazing,'' he said. ''It's not like money is something I don't understand. I understand what it is. I care more about making something nice that people can use, and it's free and it makes a difference.'' "
Q&A: Going Deeper Into FileVault," Q. Does Apple's FileVault security program for Mac OS X encrypt just the Home folder or the whole drive? A. FileVault's abilities depend on the version you are using. The FileVault encryption feature has been around since Mac OS X 10.3,M, also known as Panther, which was released in 2003, but FileVault has evolved over the years. More recent versions of the system - OS X 10.7, nicknamed Lion, and OS X 10.8, Mountain Lion - use an updated version of the software, FileVault 2. While the original version of FileVault just encrypted the contents of the user's Home folder, the newer FileVault 2 encrypts the entire disk, and can take advantage of the faster Intel processors in newer Macs to make the encryption/decryption time quicker. FileVault 2 also supports incremental backup and recovery with Apple's built-in Time Machine backup software and offers a user recovery key in case the FileVault 2 password is forgotten. You have the option of storing the recovery key with Apple, which encrypts the key and will unlock it only if three security questions you previously provided are answered successfully.While faster and more versatile than the original version, FileVault 2 has had some issues, including a password bug earlier this year that has since been fixed. Apple has instructions for setting up FileVault 2 that further explain how it works. The Macworld site has an extensive guide to using FileVault 2 as well if you want more information before you decide if you want to use this optional feature of OS X. "
Software Meant to Fight Crime Is Used to Spy on Dissidents,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Morgan Marquis-Boire works as a Google engineer and Bill Marczak is earning a Ph.D. in computer science. But this summer, the two men have been moonlighting as detectives, chasing an elusive surveillance tool from Bahrain across five continents.What they found was the widespread use of sophisticated, off-the-shelf computer espionage software by governments with questionable records on human rights. While the software is supposedly sold for use only in criminal investigations, the two came across evidence that it was being used to target political dissidents.The software proved to be the stuff of a spy film: it can grab images of computer screens, record Skype chats, turn on cameras and microphones and log keystrokes. The two men said they discovered mobile versions of the spyware customized for all major mobile phones.But what made the software especially sophisticated was how well it avoided detection. Its creators specifically engineered it to elude antivirus software made by Kaspersky Lab, Symantec, F-Secure and others. The software has been identified as FinSpy, one of the more elusive spyware tools sold in the growing market of off-the-shelf computer surveillance technologies that give governments a sophisticated plug-in monitoring operation. Research now links it to servers in more than a dozen countries, including Turkmenistan, Brunei and Bahrain, although no government acknowledges using the software for surveillance purposes.The market for such technologies has grown to $5 billion a year from ''nothing 10 years ago,'' said Jerry Lucas, president of TeleStrategies, the company behind ISS World, an annual surveillance show where law enforcement agents view the latest computer spyware.FinSpy is made by the Gamma Group, a British company that says it sells monitoring software to governments solely for criminal investigations.''This is dual-use equipment,'' said Eva Galperin, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet civil liberties group. ''If you sell it to a country that obeys the rule of law, they may use it for law enforcement. If you sell it to a country where the rule of law is not so strong, it will be used to monitor journalists and dissidents.''Until Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak stumbled upon FinSpy last May, security researchers had tried, unsuccessfully, for a year to track it down. FinSpy gained notoriety in March 2011 after protesters raided Egypt's state security headquarters and discovered a document that appeared to be a proposal by the Gamma Group to sell FinSpy to the government of President Hosni Mubarak for $353,000. It is unclear whether that transaction was ever completed.Martin J. Muench, a Gamma Group managing director, said his company did not disclose its customers. In an e-mail, he said the Gamma Group sold FinSpy to governments only to monitor criminals and that it was most frequently used ''against pedophiles, terrorists, organized crime, kidnapping and human trafficking.''In May, Mr. Marquis-Boire, 32, of San Francisco, and Mr. Marczak, 24, of Berkeley, Calif., volunteered to analyze some suspicious e-mails sent to three Bahraini activists. They discovered all the e-mails contained spyware that reported back to the same command-and-control server in Bahrain. The apparent use of the spyware to monitor Bahraini activists, none of whom had any criminal history, suggested that it had been used more broadly.Bahrain has been increasingly criticized for human rights abuses. This month, a 16-year-old Bahraini protester was killed in what activists said was a brutal attack by security forces, but which Bahrain's government framed as self-defense.The findings of the two men came as no surprise to those in the field. ''There has been a clear increase in the availability of penetrating cyberattack tools,'' said Sameer Bhalotra, President Obama's former senior director for cybersecurity who now serves as the chief operating officer of Impermium, a computer security firm. ''These were once the realm of the black market and intelligence agencies. Now they are emerging more and more. The problem is that it only requires small changes to apply a surveillance tool for attack, and in this case it looks like dissidents were targeted.''Since publishing their findings, Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak have started receiving malware samples from other security researchers and from activist groups that suspected they may have been targets. In several cases, the two found that the samples reported back to Web sites run by the Gamma Group. But other samples appeared to be actively snooping for foreign governments.A second set of researchers from Rapid7, of Boston, scoured the Internet for links to the software and discovered it running in 10 more countries. Indeed, the spyware was running off EC2, an Amazon.com cloud storage service. Amazon did not return requests for clarification, but Mr. Marczak and Mr. Marquis-Boire said the server appeared to be a proxy, a way to conceal traffic.Mr. Marquis-Boire said a Turkmenistan server running the software belonged to a range of I.P. addresses specifically assigned to the ministry of communications. It is the first clear-cut case of a government running the spyware off its own computer system. Human Rights Watch recently called Turkmenistan one of the ''world's most repressive countries'' and warned that dissidents faced ''constant threat of government reprisal.''Ms. Galperin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation said, ''Nobody in their right mind would claim it is O.K. to sell surveillance to Turkmenistan.''The Gamma Group would not confirm it sold software to Turkmenistan. A military attaché at the Turkmenistan Embassy in Washington refused to comment.Mr. Muench, who for the last month has repeatedly denied that the researchers had pinpointed the company's spyware, sharply reversed course Wednesday.In a statement released less than an hour after the researchers published their latest findings, Mr. Muench said that a Gamma Group server had been broken into and that several demonstration copies of FinSpy had been stolen.By Thursday afternoon, several of the FinSpy servers began to disappear, Mr. Marczak said. Servers in Singapore, Indonesia, Mongolia and Brunei went dark, while one in Bahrain briefly shut down before reincarnating elsewhere. Mr. Marquis-Boire said that as he traced spyware from Bahrain to 14 other countries -- many of them ''places with tight centralized control'' -- he grew increasingly worried about the people on the other end.Four months in, he sounds like a man who wants to take a break, but knows he cannot just yet: ''I can't wait for the day when I can sleep in and watch movies and go to the pub instead of analyzing malware and pondering the state of the global cybersurveillance industry.''PHOTOS: Morgan Marquis-Boire, left, and Bill Marczak.

Readers React to Surveillance Software for Parents,"The Pro-Surveillance CrowdThis is the way the world is now. One obscene text can land your kid with harassment charges or underage porn. Unwise posts on Facebook or videos posted that share overmuch will be on the internet forever. Whenever minors are in a situation where they can ruin their lives by using poor judgement, their parents have a right and obligation to supervise them. Electronic devices are so portable and so powerful these days that there's no way to supervise without some kind of surveillance software. You'll thank me for this when you're older, kid.The whole reason parents need to monitor children's activity is that it is NOT PRIVATE! Everything they send out in text form, is recorded, saved, and is anything but private. In fact anything sent or received can be used against them by authorities now, and in the future. God forbid anything ever happened, but good luck trying to explain in court how the written comment ""I wish you were dead"" was just venting in a situation where the recipient actually wound up dead (extreme example to make a point). It is entirely different from yelling it into a phone, where even if there were a recording, laws protect your conversation as ""private"" unless you have been informed that it is being recorded. No such laws protect your children with what they send and receive digitally, and even worse, there is permanent record of it.Couple this with the fact that there is not a single adult in this world (over the age of 20) that went through adolescence with these very public, powerful social media forms, leads me to feel parents are very wise to monitor and protect their children.I don't see a whole lot of difference between monitoring online activities now and the way kids' activities were monitored by a whole community decades ago. My parents and their friends were watched by their parents, their neighbors, the shopkeeper, teachers, the postman, milkman, etc. And any shenanigans or backtalk that was observed was reported to their parents. We don't have the luxury of the old-style neighborhood watch anymore, so it's up to parents to monitor their kids' behavior themselves. I have no problem with programs like this, especially when the things that are put on the internet are pretty much forever. Kids need guidance; only now, it's software that acts as the nosy neighbor.My 9-year-old made some comments that put me on the alert. I looked at her laptop ""history"" and saw YouTube items with titles like ""sexy teenage stripper."" I immediately put a block on YouTube. When she began complaining about her difficulty accessing YouTube, I explained how it had come about. I told her there was too much on the Internet that was disrespectful of a person's dignity, and I didn't want her exposed to that stuff, which I myself take pains to avoid. It gave us an opportunity to discuss some other important things. In the end I restored her YouTube access but told her a software program would alert me if she accessed sites with problematic key words -- at which time the boom would be lowered on Youtube again. We've had no problems since, and she's never complained. No doubt that will change, but with kids and the internet, it's always going to be one step at a time.The SkepticsWhat if a parent is very biased against gay people, and a son or daughter is wishing to just communicate with other like minded youths? Or parents who may be unbalanced themselves, seeking out any transgression as an excuse to beat or punish children?I've always had good, open communication with my children so typically they don't find a need to hide things. Of course, occasionally each one of them has. But is it not better to provide a good model, and to build trust, rather than to snoop and invade privacy on a constant basis?-- Tim B, SeattleEven children and teenagers deserve a measure of privacy. I'm pretty sure my own mother would consider this ""spying"". She didn't keep close tabs on me like this when I was growing up, because she trusted that she raised me to use common sense and good judgment. Kids need some space from their parents.-- SD, Rochester, NYI've written and spoken about kids and social media for some time now and I always come back to the same concept over and over: The Internet is like New York City. The first few times you take your kids into the city, you are going to watch them very carefully, make sure they understand how to get around, how to be safe, how to get help, etc. I was 13 or so the first time I was allowed to go into the city from my Westchester home for the first time with friends but by then I had been given enough knowledge and ""training"" to be able to handle it.The Internet and social media is the same thing. Kids need to be taught to use the tools and how to be decent citizens. Parents who just let their kids go and do whatever they want are doing them a disservice.But at the same time, overbearing surveillance is, in my opinion, a bridge too far. There are times when my 12 year old does inappropriate searches but he always comes to us and tells us. We reward him for being open with us (but he also knows that when he does this he loses his ability to surf/search for a few days to a week. No yelling. No guilt. Just a simple change to what he is allowed to do.) This way, we keep him talking to us. We don't need to spy on him if he feels comfortable coming to us. -- Andy Affleck, Rhode IslandFor all of you parents thinking of doing the surveillance thing, take this advice from someone who grew up with an overbearing mother -- kids have long memories. Particularly for teenagers, if your intrusions are affecting their social lives it can have long-lasting repercussions. Twenty years later my siblings and I still recall our 'stunted' teenage years, and one brother in particular still bears a massive grudge just bubbling under the surface at family get-togethers. I understand you might want to protect your children, just keep in mind there may be a heavy price if you push it too hard.-- Mario, BrooklynWow. If we keep going at this rate, kids are going to go back to talking on the telephone and passing notes in school, just to maintain their privacy.-- O'Brien, Airstrip One "

Conferences Via the Net Called Risky,"SAN FRANCISCO -- One afternoon this month, a hacker took a tour of a dozen conference rooms around the globe via equipment that most every company has in those rooms; videoconferencing equipment.With the move of a mouse, he steered a camera around each room, occasionally zooming in with such precision that he could discern grooves in the wood and paint flecks on the wall. In one room, he zoomed out through a window, across a parking lot and into shrubbery some 50 yards away where a small animal could be seen burrowing underneath a bush. With such equipment, the hacker could have easily eavesdropped on privileged attorney-client conversations or read trade secrets on a report lying on the conference room table.In this case, the hacker was HD Moore, a chief security officer at Rapid7, a Boston based company that looks for security holes in computer systems that are used in devices like toaster ovens and Mars landing equipment. His latest find: videoconferencing equipment is often left vulnerable to hackers. Businesses collectively spend billions of dollars each year beefing up security on their computer systems and employee laptops. They agonize over the confidential information that employees send to their Gmail and Dropbox accounts and store on their iPads and smartphones. But rarely do they give much thought to the ease with which anyone can penetrate a videoconference room where their most guarded trade secrets are openly discussed.Mr. Moore has found it easy to get into several top venture capital and law firms, pharmaceutical and oil companies and courtrooms across the country. He even found a path into the Goldman Sachs boardroom. ''The entry bar has fallen to the floor,'' said Mike Tuchen, chief executive of Rapid7. ''These are literally some of the world's most important boardrooms -- this is where their most critical meetings take place -- and there could be silent attendees in all of them.''Ten years ago, videoconferencing systems were complicated and erratic, and ran on expensive, closed high-speed phone lines. Over the last decade, videoconferencing -- like everything else -- migrated to the Internet. Now, most businesses use Internet protocol videoconferencing -- a souped-up version of Skype -- to connect with colleagues and customers. Most of these new systems were designed with visual and audio clarity -- not security -- in mind.Rapid7 discovered that hundreds of thousands of businesses were investing in top-quality videoconferencing units, but were setting them up on the cheap. At last count, companies spent an estimated $693 million on group videoconferencing from July to September of last year, according to Wainhouse Research.The most popular units, sold by Polycom and Cisco, can cost as much as $25,000 and feature encryption, high-definition video capture, and audio that can pick up the sound of a door opening 300 feet away. But administrators are setting them up outside the firewall and are configuring them with a false sense of security that hackers can use against them.Whether real hackers are exploiting this vulnerability is unknown; no company has announced that it has been hacked. (Nor would one, and most would never know in any case.) But with videoconference systems so ubiquitous, they make for an easy target.It certainly would not be the first time hackers had exploited holes in office hardware. After a security breach at the United States Chamber of Commerce last year, the Chamber discovered that its office printer, and even a thermostat in a Chamber-owned apartment, had been communicating with an Internet address in China.But with videoconferencing, companies have seemingly gone out of their way to make themselves vulnerable. In many cases, they are not only putting their systems on the Internet, but setting them up in a way that allows anyone to listen in unnoticed.New systems are outfitted with a feature that automatically accepts inbound calls so users do not have to press an ''accept'' button every time someone dials into their videoconference. The effect is that anyone can dial in and look around a room, and the only sign of their presence is a tiny light on a console unit, or the silent swing of a video camera.Two months ago, Mr. Moore wrote a computer program that scanned the Internet for videoconference systems that were outside the firewall and configured to automatically answer calls. In less than two hours, he had scanned 3 percent of the Internet.In that sliver, he discovered 5,000 wide-open conference rooms at law firms, pharmaceutical companies, oil refineries, universities and medical centers. He stumbled into a lawyer-inmate meeting room at a prison, an operating room at a university medical center, and a venture capital pitch meeting where a company's financials were being projected on a screen. Among the vendors that popped up in Mr. Moore's scan were Polycom, Cisco, LifeSize, Sony and others. Of those, Polycom -- which leads the videoconferencing market in units sold -- was the only manufacturer that ships its equipment -- from its low-end ViewStation models to its high-end HDX products -- with the auto-answer feature enabled by default.In an e-mail, Shawn Dainas, a Polycom spokesman, said the auto-answer feature had several safety elements built in that could be activated by a customer, including password protections, auto-mute and camera control lockup, adding that Polycom also offered a camera lens cover. He said the ''security levels have been designed to make it easy for our customers to enable security that is appropriate to their business.''Of the Polycom videoconference systems that popped up in Mr. Moore's scan, none blocked control of the camera, asked for a password or muted sound.''Many Polycom systems are sold, installed and maintained without any level of access security, with auto-answer enabled by default,'' Mr. Moore says. ''It boils down to whether organizations are aware of the risk, and our research indicates that many, even well-heeled venture capital firms, were not aware and do not implement even the most basic of security measures.''Mr. Tuchen of Rapid7 said that as a short cut, businesses put their videoconference systems outside the firewall, allowing them to receive calls from other companies without having to do any complex network configuration. The safer way to receive calls from other companies, Mr. Tuchen said, is to install a ''gatekeeper'' that securely connects calls from outside the firewall. But, this process ''is complex to configure properly,'' he said, and ''is often skipped.''Ira M. Weinstein, a senior analyst at Wainhouse Research, a market research firm that specializes in media conferencing, disputed the notion that most companies keep their systems outside the firewall. ''The companies that really have to worry about breaches -- the Department of Defense, banks -- put their systems behind the firewall,'' Mr. Weinstein said.''That doesn't mean there aren't exceptions. If you talk to outside companies, you need to decide if you want to be accessible or totally secure. I could never leave my house and be secure. But I want to be accessible. It's a choice people make.''But in some cases, Mr. Moore discovered he could leap from one open system into its address book and dial into the conference rooms of other companies, even those companies that put their system behind the firewall.That was the case with Goldman Sachs. The bank's boardroom did not show up in Mr. Moore's initial scan but an entry labeled ''Goldman Sachs Board Room'' popped up in the directory of a law firm that Goldman Sachs videoconferences with. Mr. Moore did not disclose the name of the law firm and said that because he was afraid of ''crossing a line,'' he did not dial into Goldman Sachs.Said Mr. Tuchen, ''Any reasonably computer literate 6-year-old can try this at home.'' "
Preventing Identity Theft Without Paying Monthly Fees,"MY first Shortcuts column, almost seven years ago, was on identity theft. At that point, in 2005, it seemed to be a scary and ever-growing trend, with tales everywhere of stolen credit cards and Social Security numbers leading to bad credit ratings that could haunt you for years, potentially costing you car loans, mortgages and even jobs.Spurred by a Consumers Union report this month that argues that identity theft is being hyped by marketers to scare consumers into buying costly and unnecessary services, I decided I wanted to revisit the issue.Is identity theft going up or down? What can we do to protect ourselves? And is it worth it to buy protection? First of all, the numbers. According to Justice Department figures released last November, in about 8.6 million households at least one person 12 or older experienced some kind of identity theft in 2010. That's up from 6.4 million households in 2005, when I first wrote about it.So it's still a problem, and an expensive one. The Justice Department wrote that identity theft cost households a total of $13.3 billion in 2010 in direct financial losses.That sounds pretty serious. So why is Consumers Union telling people not to worry?''We tell people they should take the problem seriously, but don't panic,'' said Jeff Blyskal, senior editor at Consumer Reports, who has been investigating issues surrounding identity theft for years and wrote the recent article.If you look more closely at the figures, the Justice Department states that the unauthorized use of existing credit cards ''accounted for much of the increase in household identity theft from 2005-2010.''And the percentage of households experiencing ''the misuse of personal information to open a new account or commit another crime'' declined to 14 percent from 23 percent in the period.Over all, 24 percent of households that experienced identity theft suffered no direct financial loss in 2010, compared with 19 percent in 2005.So we're doing well, right?Well, not so fast.It's true that the most common type of credit card fraud is pretty easy to deal with. Most people are liable for up to a maximum of $50 if someone fraudulently charges items using their number. This recently happened to us. We were notified of suspicious activity on the card, confirmed we hadn't recently charged anything in Nordstrom's in New Jersey (somewhat classy criminals) and were sent a new card fairly quickly. It was painless.A word of warning, though. A stolen debit card number is much less simple. If you don't notify the bank right away, ''you're liable to be responsible for a lot more than $50,'' said Phil Blank, managing director of security, risk and fraud at Javelin Strategy and Research.And there are other kinds of identity theft that can create many more problems than the credit card type. Although less prevalent, these include criminal identity theft, where someone who is arrested for a crime uses your information, and suddenly you have a warrant out for your arrest; medical identity theft, where someone accesses your medical insurance and misuses it; tax identity theft, where your tax records, and refund, are misappropriated; and child identity theft, in which someone uses a child's Social Security number to commit fraud.In cases like these, if the bad information gets on a credit report or impinges on another part of your life, it can take many hours -- and sometimes a fair amount of money -- to clean up.''It's not just the numbers taken out of your account,'' Mr. Blank said.So what's a consumer to do? Sign up for one of the myriad companies that promise to protect and defend you, often for around $10 a month and up?Let's consider that for a moment.First, there are plenty of free services that will help protect you, or at least sound an alert, if something's going wrong with your accounts.When I last wrote about this in 2005, only five states allowed consumers to freeze their credit reports. If you do that and someone tries to open a credit card in your name or take out a car loan, the credit will be denied because the vendor can't access your credit report. Now, almost every state allows you to freeze (and unfreeze) your credit report, some free and some for a minimal fee.Banks are also offering far more services that alert you to potentially criminal activity. For example, Mr. Blank said his bank alerted him every time a ''card not present'' purchase was made -- that is when his card number was used to buy something online or over the phone.''Most people don't know what alerts are,'' he said. ''All sorts of alerts can empower the consumer.''Here are some of the situations that some banks and credit card companies offer to alert to you, by e-mail or text message, usually without charge:When there is a withdrawal of cash from an A.T.M.When a charge is entered for more than an amount that you stipulate, like $100.When there is a change in the phone number or other information on your account.Currently, though, most alerts let you know after the fraud has occurred.''The new technology that we're seeing coming out will alert you when someone is trying to charge $1,000 on that credit card,'' Mr. Blank said. ''You can say right away, yes or no, if you approve.''Here are other things you can do to protect yourself: Check your credit reports free once a year. If you stagger it, you can receive a free report once every four months from one of the three major credit reporting companies -- TransUnion, Equifax and Experian.For medical fraud, check in with your medical insurer to see if there are any claims you don't recognize. LexisNexis Full File Disclosure (Go to personalreports.lexisnexis.com and click on ''access your personal information'') offers, among other things, a public records search, reports on claims for auto and homeowners' insurance and pre-employment background checks.And, still true after all these years: shred all documents that have any bank, Social Security, credit card or insurance identification numbers.But what if you want more? Surely there's no problem paying for some added protection?That's where opinions divide.For Mr. Blyskal of Consumers Union, it's better to be an informed and active consumer than to buy these services. It's necessary to really dig into the fine print to see what protection is truly being offered, he said. Over all, identity theft protection companies ''can give you a false sense of security,'' he said.On the other hand, Matthew Davis, a victim adviser at the nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center, said that ''you have to be a proactive consumer, but I would disagree that no products are helpful.''Mr. Davis wouldn't recommend any particular companies, but said word of any poor service would trickle out quickly on the Internet through customer reviews.Just as important as fraud alerts, Mr. Blank said, is that the companies ''have people extremely experienced who handle this information.'' That, he said, ''allows consumers to reduce the time around the fraud once it occurs.''Mr. Blank's company offers some tips if you decide to hire someone: know what protection is actually provided and what is hype. And use paid services in addition to the free security options your bank already has in place, not instead of them.The bad news is that even if we want to pay someone to defend us against identity theft, we still need to do most of the work ourselves. The good news is that seven years after I first wrote about this topic, there are a lot more free and easy ways to protect ourselves.E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com "
When a Palm Reader Knows More Than Your Life Line,"''PLEASE put your hand on the scanner,'' a receptionist at a doctor's office at New York University Langone Medical Center said to me recently, pointing to a small plastic device on the counter between us. ''I need to take a palm scan for your file.''I balked.As a reporter who has been covering the growing business of data collection, I know the potential drawbacks -- like customer profiling -- of giving out my personal details. But the idea of submitting to an infrared scan at a medical center that would take a copy of the unique vein patterns in my palm seemed fraught. The receptionist said it was for my own good. The medical center, she said, had recently instituted a biometric patient identification system to protect against identity theft.I reluctantly stuck my hand on the machine. If I demurred, I thought, perhaps I'd be denied medical care.Next, the receptionist said she needed to take my photo. After the palm scan, that seemed like data-collection overkill. Then an office manager appeared and explained that the scans and pictures were optional. Alas, my palm was already in the system.No longer the province of security services and science-fiction films, biometric technology is on the march. Facebook uses facial-recognition software so its members can automatically put name tags on friends when they upload their photos. Apple uses voice recognition to power Siri. Some theme parks take digital fingerprints to help recognize season pass holders. Now some hospitals and school districts are using palm vein pattern recognition to identify and efficiently manage their patients or students -- in effect, turning your palm into an E-ZPass.But consumer advocates say that enterprises are increasingly employing biometric data to improve convenience -- and that members of the public are paying for that convenience with their privacy.Fingerprints, facial dimensions and vein patterns are unique, consumer advocates say, and should be treated as carefully as genetic samples. So collecting such information for expediency, they say, could increase the risks of serious identity theft. Yet companies and institutions that compile such data often fail to adequately explain the risks to consumers, they say.''Let's say someone makes a fake ID and goes in and has their photo and their palm print taken as you. What are you going to do when you go in?'' said Pam Dixon, the executive director of the World Privacy Forum, an advocacy group in San Diego. ''Hospitals that are doing this are leaping over profound security issues that they are actually introducing into their systems.''THE N.Y.U. medical center started researching biometric systems a few years ago in an effort to address several problems, said Kathryn McClellan, its vice president who is in charge of implementing its new electronic health records system. More than a million people in the New York area have the same or similar names, she said, creating a risk that medical personnel might pull up the wrong health record for a patient. Another issue, she said, was that some patients had multiple records from being treated at different affiliates; N.Y.U. wanted an efficient way to consolidate them.Last year, the medical center adopted photography and palm-scan technology so that each patient would have two unique identifying features. Now, Ms. McClellan said, each arriving patient has his or her palm scanned, allowing the system to automatically pull up the correct file.''It's a patient safety initiative,'' Ms. McClellan said. ''We felt like the value to the patient was huge.''N.Y.U.'s system, called PatientSecure and marketed by HT Systems of Tampa, has already scanned more than 250,000 patients. In the United States, over five million patients have had the scans, said Charles Yanak, a spokesman for Fujitsu Frontech North America, a division of Fujitsu, the Japanese company that developed the vein palm identification technology.Yet, unless patients at N.Y.U. seem uncomfortable with the process, Ms. McClellan said, medical registration staff members don't inform them that they can opt out of photos and scans.''We don't have formal consent,'' Ms. McClellan said in a phone interview last Tuesday.That raises red flags for privacy advocates. ''If they are not informing patients it is optional,'' said Joel Reidenberg, a professor at Fordham University Law School with an expertise in data privacy, ''then effectively it is coerced consent.''He noted that N.Y.U. medical center has had recent incidents in which computers or USB drives containing unencrypted patient data have been lost or stolen, suggesting that the center's collection of biometric data might increase patients' risk of identity theft.Ms. McClellan responded that there was little chance of identity theft because the palm scan system turned the vein measurements into encrypted strings of binary numbers and stored them on an N.Y.U. server that is separate from the one with patients' health records. Even if there were a breach, she added, the data would be useless to hackers because a unique key is needed to decode the number strings. As for patients' photos, she said, they are attached to their medical records.Still, Arthur Caplan, the director of the division of medical ethics at the N.Y.U. center, recommended that hospitals do a better job of explaining biometric ID systems to patients. He himself recently had an appointment at the N.Y.U. center, he recounted, and didn't learn that the palm scan was optional until he hesitated and asked questions.''It gave me pause,'' Dr. Caplan said. ''It would be useful to put up a sign saying 'We are going to take biometric information which will help us track you through the system. If you don't want to do this, please see' '' an office manager.Other institutions that use PatientSecure, however, have instituted opt-in programs for patients.At the Duke University Health System, patients receive brochures explaining their options, said Eliana Owens, the health system's director of patient revenue. The center also trains staff members at registration desks to read patients a script about the opt-in process for the palm scans, she said. (Duke does not take patients' photos.)''They say: 'The enrollment is optional. If you choose not to participate, we will continue to ask you for your photo ID on subsequent visits,' '' Ms. Owens said.Consent or not, some leading identity experts see little value in palm scans for patients right now. If medical centers are going to use patients' biometric data for their own institutional convenience, they argue, the centers should also enhance patient privacy -- by, say, permitting lower-echelon medical personnel to look at a person's medical record only if that patient is present and approves access by having a palm scanned.Otherwise, ''you are enabling another level of danger,'' said Joseph Atick, a pioneer in biometric identity systems who consults for governments, ''instead of using the technology to enable another level of privacy.''At my request, N.Y.U. medical center has deleted my palm print.E-mail: slipstream@nytimes.com "
Identity Companies: Paid To Know About You," I was at the Montgomery & Co. investor conference in Los Angeles this week, where 186 promising start-ups present their businesses to over 1000 potential investors. The companies are private, so they don't give away too much financial information. Instead, you see what is doing well by watching where the money men spend their time. Three of the best-attended sessions were with companies that deal with online identity, which is actually about knowing about the person logging into a Web site, extracting information about them and then passing it on profitably. You can see why these sessions were packed.It matters now because corporations are struggling to keep straight all the fixed and mobile devices addressing their servers. In the cloud world, they increasingly have partner companies inside their computers too, and need to know who these people are. On the consumer side, companies want stronger online relations with clients, so they are offering them social features like games and status updates to Facebook. In every case what they really want is information.Identity management is all those things: how a corporate server can be sure only authorized people are accessing data, and how a Web site can recognize the right customers and remember their habits, to sell them more stuff.And sell us they will. Gigya is an identity management company aimed at consumers. It started out as a widget on MySpace, and got in early enough into social logins that it now works with over 500,000 Web sites, and enables over 1 billion logins a month. If you have logged on to a site through Facebook, Twitter, Google, China's RenRen social network or any of 21 other social services, you've probably been using Gigya. Gigya acts as an intermediary between social networks and the Web sites of Fox, Frito-Lay, Nike and Sony, among others. The companies could do it themselves, but it is simpler to outsource. When it verifies your identity via Facebook, say, Gigya also passes along to the commerce sites whatever social information you've recorded there and given permission to share, from your nickname and birthday to who your friends are. It doesn't share your activities on the commerce site back to Facebook unless you choose to publish something from there. ""You get an incredibly rich amount of information about a user and his friends,"" said Patrick Salyer, Gigya's chief executive. ""We believe that within two years 99 percent of commercial Web sites will have a social log in.""Consumers like social logins because it's easier than remembering all those passwords; on average, Mr. Salyer says, consumers have acquired 28 different login identities. By simplifying the process with a social login, however, they are also sharing their birthdays, e-mails, location, gender, favorite activities, and more. This affects the kind of content that is put in front of them, the types of games a Web site will have them play, or whether their on-site behavior is broadcast to Facebook or Twitter, or other sites.""Our clients are just starting to think about what they can do with that data,"" said Mr. Salyer, who last November started offering a database product to help manage this torrent of new information. ""We can show a product manager at Nike who is reviewing a shoe positively or negatively, who is writing things about it, where they go to school, or what their interests and hobbies are. You can see why that would be attractive."" In case companies are anxious abut all this personal information they are using, the identity management company can also make sure the Web site is compliant with different snooping laws in, say, Europe, where laws are stricter.In corporate identity, both Symplified and Ping Identity are pitching identity management in corporate cloud computing. Another company, called Okta, is also doing this kind of password-based permissions and authentication. As cloud-based networks explode, there is  a lot of money in keeping straight all those corporate passwords, figuring out whether a browser belongs to an authorized business partner, a trusted employee, or a new customer. Corporations can also amass a lot of information about people this way, including their work history, the projects they work on, who else they know in a company, and what kind of devices they use.Simplified claims it will increase revenues by 500 percent this year, and expects to have revenues near $100 million annually by 2015. Ping, which has been around since 2002, says it has grown at a 75 percent compounded annual growth rate over the past decade, and will also pass $100 million in annual sales within a couple of years. ""Given enough time, all technologies go through a networking phase,"" said Andre Durand, Ping's chief executive. ""We are taking identity through a networking phase."" And now that we are in this networked identity world, it's likely, companies probably will not leave. "
Europeans Set to Debate Permanent Bailout Fund,"COPENHAGEN -- How big is big enough for a permanent bailout fund for the euro zone?When finance ministers meet here Friday and Saturday, they will seek to agree on a figure large enough to deter speculators from further driving up the borrowing costs of countries like Spain, but not so large as to risk the creditworthiness of countries like Germany.The wrangling over the size of the fund, which would act as a firewall to protect the euro zone if another country faltered, is the latest challenge the currency union faces as it seeks to overcome a crisis of confidence that was set off two years ago by Greece's severe indebtedness. One of the plans the ministers could agree to would resemble a suggestion by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany early in the week: letting a temporary fund called the European Financial Stability Facility, or E.F.S.F., which has aided Greece, Ireland and Portugal, continue to operate beside a new, permanent fund, the European Stability Mechanism, or E.S.M. That would bring the total lending capacity of the firewall to nearly 700 billion euros, or $934 billion.And by allowing the facility to make new loans until mid-2013, the ministers would make an additional 240 billion euros available -- but temporarily.Such loans would be made only ''in exceptional circumstances following a unanimous decision of euro area heads of state or government notably in case the E.S.M. capacity would prove insufficient,'' according to a copy of a draft statement from euro zone finance ministers that was circulating Thursday.In the absence of any new lending, ''the combined lending ceiling of the E.S.M. and the E.F.S.F. will thus be set at 700 billion euros for the period after mid-2013,'' the statement said.Ministers also could agree to capitalize the permanent fund more quickly than previously planned by making the final installment of five payments of 16 billion euros each in the first half of 2014. Each 16 billion euro installment is leveraged to create lending capacity of about 100 billion euros, bringing total firepower to 500 billion euros.The draft could change during the gathering, which will include the governors of the central banks of all European Union member states.Views differ sharply across Europe, and the world, on how to build the most effective firewall.So-called maximalists like Angel Gurria, secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, based in Paris, have repeatedly called for a fund of about 1 trillion euros. Mr. Gurria said this week that the ''mother of all firewalls'' was necessary to prevent another crisis in Europe.A firewall amounting to 1 trillion euros would be an effective ''nuclear'' deterrent against speculative threats to the euro zone, Francois Baroin, the French finance minister, told BFM Business television Thursday.A commitment by Europe to put more of its own resources at stake could also nudge donors to the International Monetary Fund, including the United States and China, to pledge more to the fund. That would give the fund, which has taken part in the three euro zone bailouts, more resources to help bail out other European countries, if necessary.But the maximalist approach has inflamed some European leaders, who say putting up so much money could encourage some countries to reduce their commitments to austerity and could put at even greater risk the taxpayers in Germany and elsewhere who would bear the bailout funds' liabilities.In an apparent swipe at Mr. Gurria's suggestion of a 1 trillion euro fund, Steffen Siebert, the German government spokesman, said Wednesday that it was ''regrettable that in these discussions obviously no figure is high enough.'' Such suggestions are counterproductive, Mr. Siebert said, as ''they further unsettle the markets.''Speaking late on Thursday in Copenhagen, Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, suggested that any sum agreed to by ministers on Friday would not be more than 800 billion euros.The future leadership of the euro zone is another topic likely to be discussed at the meeting, but probably on the margins.The current leader of the so-called Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers is Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg. His term will end in June, and speculation is widespread that his successor could be Mr. Schauble.But such an appointment also could make it more difficult to keep another German, Klaus Regling, at the head of the stability facility.

Vulnerability in Google Wallet Leaves Funds Wide Open," 4:06 p.m. | Updated   A simple procedure demonstrated on some Android smartphones allows anyone to gain access to funds stored in Google Wallet, Google's mobile payment system that acts as a substitute for traditional credit cards. No hacking is required, and it can take a thief just minutes to start spending your cash.The Smartphone Champ, a cellphone blog, demonstrated the vulnerability in a video. If a person gets his hands on your Android device, all he has to do is go into the application settings and clear the data for Google Wallet. Then, when opening Google Wallet, the service will require a user to create a new personal identification number. After entering the new PIN, the user can gain access to the Google prepaid card and use it to make purchases.The root of the problem is that the Google prepaid card is attached to the device itself, not a specific account. So if you lose your Android phone or sell it, all someone would have to do is reset the Google Wallet settings and enter a new PIN to start spending your money.Not all Android users will be affected. Google Wallet is publicly available on only one Android smartphone on one network: the Samsung Nexus S 4G on Sprint. Google Wallet transactions work with terminals equipped with PayPass, a wireless payment technology that enables you to tap your smartphone against an electronic reader at checkout.Google acknowledged the security issue in a statement and advised that customers call a phone number to deactivate the prepaid card if they lose or want to sell their phone. The company said that a fix would be available soon.""We strongly encourage anyone who loses or wants to sell their phone to call Google Wallet support toll-free at 855-492-5538 to disable the prepaid card,"" the statement said. ""We are currently working on an automated fix as well that will be available soon. We also advise all Wallet users to set up a screen lock as an additional layer of protection for their phone.""Charlie Miller, a research consultant at Accuvant, the security firm, said that the vulnerability defeats the purpose of Google Wallet. He explained that requiring a PIN to make a transaction is supposed to increase security compared to swiping a traditional credit card, but this flaw removes that extra layer of protection.""This vulnerability undermines this principle and reduced the security of Google Wallet to that of a regular wallet, except worse,"" Mr. Miller said. ""I'm way more likely to lose my phone than my wallet.""The Google Wallet vulnerability surfaced just a day after Zvelo, a security firm, described a way to gain access to a user's PIN. That vulnerability, however, required ""rooting"" the device, a process that provides deeper access to the phone for people to perform hacks and modifications. Rooting a device inherently lowers its protection.Nate Tyler, a Google spokesman, said the company did not recommend that smartphone owners root their devices if they are using Google Wallet. The company added that if someone else got their hands on a device and then rooted it, the PIN would not be accessible.""The Zvelo study was conducted on their own phone on which they disabled the security mechanisms that protect Google Wallet by rooting the device,"" Google said in a statement. ""To date, there is no known vulnerability that enables someone to take a consumer phone and gain root access while preserving any Wallet information such as the PIN. We strongly encourage people to not install Google Wallet on rooted devices and to always set up a screen lock as an additional layer of security for their phone.""In the United States, mobile payment technology has yet to hit the mainstream. One of the challenges is proving to customers that tapping a smartphone to make a purchase is more convenient and secure than using a credit card. This vulnerability in Google Wallet is a testament to how this technology has yet to prove itself.Google has ""bug bounty"" programs that reward people for reporting security holes in Gmail, Google Docs, the Chrome browser and the company's open-source operating system, which it calls Chromium. To date, Google has paid out $700,000 in rewards to these people and even hired a handful of them. But the company still has no such program in place for Google Wallet, which is perhaps the ripest target for hackers.  The company is considering expanding the program to sites including Google.com and YouTube, but has made no mention of Google Wallet. "
Zuckerberg in China: Let the Rumors Begin,"HONG KONG - Mark Zuckerberg was spotted walking around Shanghai on Tuesday, which naturally led to a spike in online speculation about Facebook entering the Chinese market.  He said he was just on vacation with his girlfriend, Priscilla Chan.  Mr. Zuckerberg mentioned Ms. Chan, a Chinese-American woman he met at Harvard, in a ""60 Minutes"" piece, saying they have been together ""since before I started Facebook"" - contrary to the filmic account of Mr. Zuckerberg's romantic clumsiness in ""The Social Network."" (His comments are here, at 2:10 into the video.) Mr. Zuckerberg's previous trip to China - also with Ms. Chan - was in December 2010. That was billed as a vacation, too, although he also made public visits to the leading Internet companies Sina, Alibaba and Baidu. Photos and video from that trip are .Baidu had no comment Wednesday about Mr. Zuckerberg's current China trip.Facebook remains blocked in mainland China, which has 460 million Internet users, according to government figures. The site was firewalled in 2009 as the Chinese authorities said rioters used Facebook, Twitter and cellphones to organize anti-government demonstrations in Xinjiang, in western China. Google, Youtube and Twitter also are blocked. (Rendezvous explored Internet censorship in China in a previous post.) About 450,000 people in China access Facebook and other banned sites  using proxies, tunnels or VPN software. Even so, China ranks a measly 101st on the Facebook global list, well behind the likes of Congo (90), Albania (78) and Bangladesh (55), according to figures onsocialbalkers. In reviewing Facebook's recent filing for a public offering of stock, my colleague Brian Chen reported on the Bits blog that the company had a penetration rate of less than 15 percent in Japan and South Korea. In China, the filing documents said, Facebook has a near zero percent penetration. ""We continue to evaluate entering China,"" Facebook said. ""However, this market has substantial legal and regulatory complexities that have prevented our entry into China to date.""Another complexity: The social networking universe in China already has well-established players like Renren, Tencent and Weibo, Sina's hugely popular microblogging service.""Google, considered the most successful foreign Internet company to make a foray into China, managed to secure only 30 percent of the Chinese search market before pulling out in early 2010, after a serious hacking episode and a reluctance to censor further in China,"" according to a recent Reutersoverviewof Facebook's prospects in China. In an interview with Charlie Rose in November, Mr. Zuckerberg said cracking the China market was ""not the top thing we're worried about right now.'' Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, sitting next to Mr. Zuckerberg during the interview, said that ""China's obviously the big one,'' referring to countries where Facebook might expand.  But she said a China venture was ""not on the immediate horizon.""""It's not really our choice,"" Ms. Sandberg said. ""It's the government's choice.""In a Businessweek cover story on Ms. Sandberg and her role at Facebook, Brad Stone wrote:Facebook has explored creating a joint venture with Chinese Internet companies such as search engine Baidu (BIDU) to operate a division of the social network in China that complies with local censorship and filtering requirements. The company maintains that no decision has been made. Sandberg says the subject, like countless interpersonal relationships on Facebook, is complicated. ""There are compromises on not being in China, and there are compromises on being in China. It's not clear to me which one is bigger,"" she says.Three people familiar with these internal deliberations say that Sandberg and Zuckerberg fundamentally disagree on the issue. Zuckerberg believes that Facebook can be an agent of change in China, as it has been in countries such as Egypt and Tunisia. Sandberg, a veteran of Google's expensive misadventures in the world's most populous country, is wary about the compromises Facebook would have to make to do business there. "
"Stray-Cat Barbecue, Dirty Tap Water, Celebrity Hijinks, No Chen - the Usual","HONG KONG - It sounds quite preposterous, of course, this idea that 1.3 billion people could be kept wholly in the dark about a news event in their own country, an event that was simultaneously making headlines in the rest of the world.But the Chinese government - no shirker of large tasks -  tried its best to Ziploc any mention of the dramatic exploits of the blind human rights advocate Chen Guangcheng. State newspapers and TV said nothing. Blogs were censored. Even Internet searches of Mr. Chen's name and initials were blocked. Chinese ""netizens"" resorted to using code words to speak sotto voce about Mr. Chen, including calling him ""UA898,"" for United Airlines' daily Beijing-to-Washington flight. Eventually, the official omerta ended, and Mr. Chen's case has now been obliquely and fleetingly mentioned in the state media.  In mainland China there is no Twitter, no Google, no Facebook. So to reach news sites and social media services on the wider Web, some in the Chinese online community use proxies and virtual private-network services, or VPNs.But ""no more than 3 percent of Internet users in countries that engage in substantial filtering use circumvention tools,"" according to a report by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard. Assume there are close to half a billion Internet users in China. If 3 percent of them are circumventing the censors, that still leaves some 485 million behind the Great Firewall. So during the past week, ever since Mr. Chen emerged from the U.S. Embassy, what stories were Chinese news consumers reading on the Web? If they weren't getting news about Mr. Chen's escape from house arrest and his effect on U.S.-China relations, what were they searching, scanning and reading? Baidu, the country's largest search engine, shows no mention of Mr. Chen in its Top 10 rankings of the week's most popular stories online. The leader of the week, by far, was about a TV medical drama.On May 3, the day after Mr. Chen left the embassy, the most-searched story on Baidu was about a doctoral student complaining that a classmate, a government official, never showed up for classes at Tsinghua University in Beijing. The official is reportedly a department head from Shandong Province, where, coincidentally, Mr. Chen lives. Other top stories that day: The Hong Kong singer and actress Guan Ju Ying confirmed she is gay and intends to marry her girlfriend; an inappropriate gesture was made by the Real Madrid soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo; certain train tickets in China are now eligible for refunds if they're lost; and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived for previously scheduled talks in China. The week's list is here, with summaries in English.On Friday, May 4, as Mr. Chen remained at a Beijing hospital and diplomats wrangled over his fate, a traffic incident in Shanxi Province was drawing the attention of most Chinese. As Baidu Beat summed it up: ""An angry driver pulled a bus driver out of his bus seat to give him a beating, all the while boasting out loud about being the son of the head of Ministry of Public Security in the region."" The story was the second most popular for the whole week. The incident seemed to echo the infamous ""My father is Li Gang!"" case from 2010.Other items of note on Friday: Farmers in Shandong were discovered spraying formaldehyde on cabbages to keep them fresh, a 19-year-old female pimp received a five-year prison sentence, and an army soldier arrived home on leave to discover the family house in Yunnan being demolished. ""Members of the local ministries in charge of the demolition handcuffed both him and his mother to prevent them from protesting,"" Baidu Beat said. ""The man uploaded pictures of the ordeal online and is attracting a lot of concerned netizens who are expressing their discontent and anger towards the apparent injustice.""So it went for the week, the sublime mixed in with the ridiculous, just like anywhere else in the world  - 50 people in a wedding party got food poisoning; the police busted a gang of traffickers in human kidneys; the basketball star nicknamed ""Little Yao Ming"" died of a heart attack; half the samples of tap water taken on the mainland failed inspections; plus there was an array of the usual celebrity hijinks and the customary health warnings about ice cream bars, contaminated chives and street vendors using rat and stray-cat meat in their barbecue skewers.A young Californian, Jason Loose, also became an instant celebrity online in China when he bought a bag of McDonald's French fries for an elderly beggar on the street in Nanjing. Photos of Mr. Loose eating with the woman on the sidewalk circulated quickly online. ""Many users are expressing admiration for Jason Loose's random act of kindness,"" Baidu Beat said. A story about the episode is here, in charmingly fractured English, and part of the account says: ""McDonald's door, a foreigner to buy two bag of chips, and give begging grandmother a packet of two men sat on the floor, happily eating, talking different languages, the world still love.""

Bring On the Hacks (Meat Lovers Preferred),"Glazed pork chops, sizzling bacon, a gargantuan slab of spare ribs -- increasingly, people are choosing to buy these succulent staples from sustainable meat farms instead of choosing industrially processed meat. The New York City Meat Hackathon is saluting this trend a three-day event, beginning today, where farmers, butchers, tech mavens, policymakers and entrepreneurs - all ""steakholders"" -- will confer on potential improvements in the ways that livestock is farmed and meat is processed and consumed.It's ""hacking"" in the creative sense, said Chris Hunt of the Grace Communications Foundation, one of the event's sponsors. The goal, he said, is to deconstruct the challenge and come up with do-it-yourself solutions based on existing technology.  (Hacking of the traditional variety will also be involved: a pig-butchering demo is part of the lineup at the event, to be held in the experimental workspace known as Grind at 419 Park Avenue South, near 29th Street.) The annual food-themed hackathon, the third to be held in New York to date, invites participants including the general public to match their skill sets to specific challenges in the hope of inventing prototype tools or technologies. This is the first one devoted to meat; in previous years the focus was on food in general and then on using data visualization to explore the subject. The winning hack will receive both  $2,500 to help make his or her solution a reality and expert guidance on promoting the idea.""There are big challenges that are faced by sustainable meat producers and sustainable meat consumers,"" Mr. Hunt said. Sustainable meat is loosely characterized as meat from pasture-dwelling animals that were not fed hormones or antibiotics.Rather than campaigning for reforms in  the industrial meat industry, the organizers want to find strategies for bolstering the sustainable sector. Challenges include educating consumers on finding sustainably farmed goods, reading labels in supermarkets, and understanding the environmental impact of factory farms. The industrial meat sector, which relies on antibiotics to counter often-unhygienic conditions, promotes the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can make human illnesses harder to treat. And then there's pollution, from methane emissions to industrial runoff. By the same token, sustainable producers have much to learn about labeling a chunk of meat to make its origins clearer. For consumers, ""things like labels are very confusing,"" Mr. Hunt said.Other themes include food safety, animal welfare and improving efficiency in the processing and production of sustainably farmed meat.""The industrial meat system has a very well established and sophisticated distribution network,"" Mr. Hunt noted, which makes its products more accessible and cheaper than the sustainable variety. That's a challenge that one participant, the digital developer Will Turnage, is eager to pursue at the hackathon. He said that inventory management on sustainable farms is still an antiquated process. ""A lot of slaughterhouses are still run by a guy with a pad and paper,"" he said. ""To me it's really about improving the speed and the workflow."" Technology could help accomplish that. Mr. Turnage mentioned the potential for cellphone apps that could change the way inventories are updated.Organizers suggest that such efforts could ultimately influence the industrial meat sector to adopt more sustainable practices as well. ""I think something like this hackathon helps to promote that sort of transition,"" Mr. Hunt said.In addition to Grace, the event is sponsored by the media research group Food+Tech Connect and  Applegate, the organic meat purveyor.

Judge Finds Ex-Motorola Employee Stole Secrets,"Hanjuan Jin, a former Motorola software engineer, was found guilty on Wednesday of stealing trade secrets from the company but was acquitted of economic espionage to benefit a foreign government. In a separate case, a California businessman was charged with attempted economic espionage, accused of trying to obtain trade secrets from DuPont for Chinese companies.In the Motorola case, Ms. Jin was tried in November before Judge Ruben Castillo of Federal District Court in Chicago after being indicted on three counts of stealing trade secrets and three more counts of economic espionage. She waived her right to a jury.Judge Castillo found her guilty of stealing trade secrets and acquitted her on the three counts of economic espionage.He allowed Ms. Jin to remain in home confinement and scheduled sentencing for April 18.Ms. Jin, 41, faces as much as 10 years in prison on the trade secrets conviction. She faced as much as 15 years in prison on each of the economic espionage counts.She was indicted in 2008, a year after she returned to Motorola after a yearlong medical leave of absence and immediately stepped down.She was accused of simultaneously working for Motorola and for a Beijing-based company, the Kai Sun News (Beijing) Technology Company, also known as SunKaisens, which was affiliated with China's military.In California, Walter Liew and the Pangang Group of China were charged with conspiring to steal trade secrets about titanium dioxide technology from DuPont, according to the Justice Department and a revised indictment.Mr. Liew also was charged with attempted economic espionage, according to the indictment filed in federal court in San Francisco. Pangang's titanium and steel units were named in the indictment as well. Mr. Liew's wife, a Chinese citizen, and two others were also charged.The defendants were involved in a ''long-running effort'' to obtain United States trade secrets for Chinese companies, Melinda Haag, the United States attorney for the Northern District of California, said in a statement.China had sought to develop the ability to produce titanium dioxide, and state-owned companies including Pangang conspired to steal the technology developed over many years by DuPont, she said.DuPont, based in Wilmington, Del., is the world's largest manufacturer of titanium dioxide, a white pigment commonly used in coatings, plastics and paper.

Credit Card Data Breach at Barnes & Noble Stores,"WASHINGTON -- Hackers have stolen credit card information for customers who shopped as recently as last month at 63 Barnes & Noble stores across the country, including stores in New York City, San Diego, Miami and Chicago, according to people briefed on the investigation.The company discovered around Sept. 14 that the information had been stolen but kept the matter quiet at the Justice Department's request so the F.B.I. could determine who was behind the attacks, according to these people. The information was stolen by hackers who broke into the keypads in front of registers where customers swipe their credit cards and enter their personal identification numbers, or PINs.In response to questions about the attack, the company acknowledged the security breach, saying that as a precaution customers who used their cards at any of the 63 Barnes & Noble where information was stolen should change their PINs and scan their accounts for unauthorized transactions.A high-ranking official for the company said that hackers had used information from some customers' credit cards to make unauthorized purchases, but that activity had mainly occurred in September and had declined in recent weeks.The official defended the company's decision not to tell its customers about the attack, saying that the company had informed credit card companies that certain accounts might have been compromised.''We have acted at the direction of the U.S. government and they have specifically told us not to disclose it, and there we have complied,'' said the official, who asked not to be identified because the investigation was continuing.The company has received two letters from the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York that said it did not have to report the attacks to its customers during the investigation, according to the official. At least one of the letters said that the company could wait until Dec. 24 to tell the customers.As the company tried to determine how the attack occurred, it turned off all 7,000 keypads in its several hundred stores and had them shipped to a site where the company could examine them.The company determined that only one keypad in each of the 63 stores had been hacked. Nevertheless, the company has not reinstalled the devices.''Right now, we have no PIN pads in any stores and we are O.K. with that,'' the company official said.Customers who want to use credit and debit cards now have to ask cashiers to swipe their cards on the readers connected to the registers.The company said that purchases at its college bookstores and on BarnesandNoble.com, Nook, Nook mobile apps and its member database were not affected by the hacking. It did not say, however, whether it would now be telling individual customers that their information had been stolen.While specifics differ, most states, including California, require that companies notify customers of a breach if their names are compromised in combination with other information such as a credit card, a Social Security number or a driver's license number.But states make an exception for encrypted information. As long as companies wrap consumer information in basic encryption, laws do not require them to tell customers about a breach.''If you had a breach that included name plus credit card information, but the credit card information was encrypted, you would not have to provide notice,'' said Miriam H. Wugmeister, a lawyer with Morrison & Foerster.Computer security experts say such an attack entails a multilayered assault.''This is no small undertaking,'' said Edward Schwartz, the chief security officer at RSA, a security company. ''An attack of this type involves many different phases of reconnaissance and multiple levels of exploitation.''Barnes & Noble did not offer more information on how its network was penetrated. Security experts said a company insider could have inserted malicious code, or criminals could have persuaded an unsuspecting employee to click on a malicious link that installed malware, giving the perpetrators a foothold into Barnes & Noble's point-of-sale systems.''Attacks on point-of-sale systems are growing exponentially,'' said Tom Kellermann, a vice president at the security company Trend Micro. Mr. Kellermann said this was, in large part, because encryption no longer provided a deterrent for skilled hackers. "
Computer Expert Convicted in Vatican Leaks Case,"VATICAN CITY -- A Vatican court on Saturday convicted a Holy See computer expert of obstruction of justice as part of a broader investigation into the theft of confidential papal documents that were leaked to a journalist. He was given a two-month suspended sentence. The defendant, Claudio Sciarpelletti, 48, a computer analyst with the Vatican's Secretariat of State, is the second Vatican employee to be sentenced in an uncommon breach of security at an institution known for its secrecy. Pope Benedict XVI's former butler, Paolo Gabriele, is serving an 18-month sentence after being convicted of leaking papal documents to a journalist, Gianluigi Nuzzi, who published many of them in the book ''His Holiness: The Secret Papers of Pope Benedict XVI.''Mr. Sciarpelletti was found guilty of misleading investigators by giving contradictory testimony after he was interrogated about an envelope found in his desk that was addressed to the pope's butler and contained what investigators identified as confidential material. Mr. Sciarpelletti was initially sentenced to four months in prison, which the court reduced to two, then suspended, because he had no previous criminal record and because of his long years of service. The conviction will not appear on his record, the court ruled.Mr. Sciarpelletti's lawyer indicated on Saturday that he would appeal. Mr. Sciarpelletti said that he had never looked at the contents of the envelope and had been confused about who had closed it, put the stamp on it and why he had it because of the ''moral shock'' of being arrested.''I challenge anyone to remember what he did three years ago, even on the day of your birthday,'' Mr. Sciarpelletti told the court on Saturday.Mr. Sciarpelletti spent one night in prison after his arrest in May.Witnesses called to the stand on Saturday said that Mr. Sciarpelletti had cooperated with investigators. The court also heard testimony from two Vatican security officials, a Vatican prelate and Mr. Gabriele, the pope's former butler.Mr. Gabriele said that he had given documents to Mr. Sciarpelletti, but said they were not of a confidential nature. Mr. Gabriele testified that he had wanted to share his impression with Mr. Sciarpelletti on the ''peculiar atmosphere'' at the Vatican at the time, a feeling that Mr. Gabriele would now describe as ''ridiculous and with some inaccuracies,'' he said.Mr. Gabriele was tried separately last month and was found guilty of aggravated theft for passing confidential documents to Mr. Nuzzi, whose book was published in May and became a best seller. Mr. Gabriele is incarcerated in Vatican City.Mr. Gabriele and Mr. Sciarpelletti are the only Vatican employees who have been formally investigated so far, but the Vatican's prosecutor said that the investigation was continuing.''The punishment is not implemented, but there is a sentence,'' the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, told reporters on Saturday. ''I think the story is not over yet.'' "
"He Took the Code, but Was It a Federal Crime?","In white-collar crime, the line between questionable business practices and criminal conduct can be quite thin, often dependent on technical distinctions in statutes.  The reversal of the conviction of Sergey Aleynikov, a computer programmer accused of stealing trade secrets from Goldman Sachs, highlights how difficult it can be to figure out what is - and is not - a federal offense.Mr. Aleynikov was charged with taking source code used in Goldman's high-frequency trading system, a valuable tool that allowed the firm to execute within nanoseconds high-volume computer-driven trades of securities and commodities.  He took the code after agreeing to work for a rival firm that planned to set up its own trading system and admitted that he violated Goldman's confidentiality policy.  The indictment alleged violations of two federal laws: the Economic Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property provision.  In a rare step, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the conviction immediately after the oral argument of his appeal and ordered the Federal District Court to process Mr. Aleynikov's release from prison. The case involved figuring out what comes within the statutory prohibition of theft of trade secrets and interstate transportation of stolen property.  Mr. Aleynikov argued that all he took was source code that was used in parts of Goldman's trading system but not the entire program, which was highly confidential and never disclosed by the firm.  Prosecutors claimed that the code was an important component for building the system, and its use in developing competing programs would diminish the value of Goldman's trading operation.The Second Circuit did not announce the reason for overturning Mr. Aleynikov's convictions, issuing only a terse order stating that an opinion would be issued ""in due course.""  In Mr. Aleynikov's brief and at the oral argument, the focus was on whether the computer code came within the two statutes.  By reversing both convictions, the appeals court appears to have adopted a narrow approach to whether computer source code has been stolen when it was only downloaded for use by a competitor.Congress enacted the Economic Espionage Act in 1996, and while one part of the law prohibits stealing trade secrets for foreign governments, the more commonly used provision is 18 U.S.C. § 1832, which covers any theft of business trade secrets for personal gain.  The statute is complex, even compared to other federal provisions, reaching any person who knowingly acts ""with intent to convert a trade secret, that is related to or included in a product that is produced for or placed in interstate or foreign commerce, to the economic benefit of anyone other than the owner thereof, and intending or knowing that the offense will, injure any owner of that trade secret"" through theft.The key to Mr. Aleynikov's case is whether the code is a ""product that is produced"" under the Economic Espionage Act.  As an open source code it was not for sale, but it was used by Goldman as part of its trading system that dealt in securities and commodities.  The issue was whether part of a computer program was itself a ""product"" connected to interstate commerce, the basis for federal jurisdiction.Mr. Aleynikov argued in essence that the code was only one part of a larger system, so downloading it for future use when he started working a the new firm on its own system did not come within the Economic Espionage Act , even if it could have been prosecuted as a theft under state law.The Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property provision of the law, 18 U.S.C. § 2314, has much deeper roots than the Economic Espionage Act, passed by Congress in 1934 at the urging of J. Edgar Hoover and the Justice Department to help federal agents combat organized crime rings that specialized in stealing securities and other valuables that were fenced in other states.The statute covers any person who ""transports, transmits, or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce any goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud.""The Supreme Court has not reviewed any prosecutions under the Economic Espionage Act, but in Dowling v. United States it took a narrower view of what constitutes ""good, wares, [or] merchandise.""  The decision reversed a conviction for interstate transportation of bootleg records secretly made from Elvis Presley concert tapes because the recordings themselves were not transported, only the records made from them.  According to the high court, ""the provision seems clearly to contemplate a physical identity between the items unlawfully obtained and those eventually transported, and hence some prior physical taking of the subject goods.""Similarly, Mr. Aleynikov claimed that the source code was not ""goods, wares, [or] merchandise"" to constitute a violation of the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property  provision because he took only intangible property that was not worth anything until it was later incorporated into a high-speed trading system.  While Goldman might have been harmed by a competitor's system, it did not suffer the loss of its own trading platform fromMr. Aleynikov's downloading of the source code.Both the Economic Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property provision use terms like ""product"" and ""goods"" that fit best with thefts of tangible items.  The statutes can be applied to intangibles like a computer program because it is something that can be put into immediate operation, like a car, and its value is intrinsic.Source code falls into a gray area, however, because it may not have any independent value until it is incorporated in a much larger system that must be designed and implemented.  While the code is a starting point, it may be more like a recording of Mr. Presley that was misused but not stolen.Prosecutors often find themselves in a difficult position when new technologies and business processes have to be fit into older statutes that might contain gaps in their coverage.  The classic type of trade secret theft is taking the plans for a new product or blueprints for a machine, while downloading source code that can make designing a competing computer program does not fit that simpler form of the offense.  Laws sometimes have to be contorted to cover areas that are on the edge of legality, but courts are often reticent about contorting the meaning of the statutory language to reach new areas.Congress could fix the problem by rewriting the Economic Espionage Act to cover a wider range of trade secrets, but that creates the danger that knowledge about customers or internal sales strategies could become the basis for prosecuting a former employee who uses that information in a new job.  It is not clear that the federal government should criminalize private disputes between employers and employees, or turn everything confidential in a business into a trade secret.Mr. Aleynikov's case may well end up in the Supreme Court because the issue of trade secret protection is one of growing importance as the Justice Department focuses more on white-collar crimes involving businesses.  The court could takea narrow approach to the Economic Espionage Act like it did with the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property  provision in Dowling, which means Congress would have to consider whether there is a gap in the law it needs to address.

"Buying a Gift Card, and Checking It Twice","Although they may lack the drama of a brightly wrapped package, gift cards remain popular holiday presents for finicky or otherwise hard-to-buy-for recipients. The National Retail Federationdeems them the ""season's hottest gift."" But the cards are also popular targets of swindlers and thieves, who buy them with stolen credit card numbers and use them to buy merchandise, or resell them - sometimes in online auction forums. (The Federal Trade Commissionsuggests avoiding online card auction sites.)""They're one of the biggest targets of fraudsters,"" because they can act as a conduit for turning stolen credit-card numbers into cash, said Avivah Litan, a security and fraud analyst with the technology research firm Gartner. ""They're harder to trace,"" she said, because they're not associated with a specific individual, as a credit card is.Because this poses a loss risk to retailers, most knowledgeable, high-volume online gift-card sellers - Apple and Amazon, for instance - have highly sophisticated fraud detection systems to root out card fraud without having to bother customers unless absolutely necessary, she said.But that is apparently not the case with all retailers. Just last week, a colleague reported the following experience after purchasing an online gift card from Bloomingdale's.He paid for the card online, via Bloomingdale's Web site, expecting the gift to land in the recipient's e-mail in-box on the designated day. But then he received phone messages from Bloomies asking him to call a special number, citing a potential problem with the purchase. When he called, he was asked for information to verify the purchase.The customer-service representative, he said, told him that Bloomingdale's verifies all online gift card purchases by phone, because they are among the first things a thief purchases with a stolen credit card.I contacted Bloomingdale's, first by e-mail and then by phone, to follow up. Could it possibly be true that the store verifies all online gift card purchases by phone? If so, why not just drop online sales of the cards and have customers order them by phone, since the sale is going to involve a call anyway?A Bloomingdale's public relations representative, Marissa Vitagliano, replied with an e-mail that did not really address the issue. ""As with other types of cards, gift cards are not immune to exposure to fraud and theft,"" she wrote. ""The gift card owner should monitor the balance of the card regularly to ensure its value. If an owner would suspect a problem, he or she should immediately call the phone number on the card to report any concerns.""She didn't respond to further inquiries seeking details. So it's unclear just what Bloomingdale's formal policy is regarding verification of online sales of gift cards.Have you ever been contacted by Bloomingdale's or any other retailer after buying a gift card online?

Former Murdoch Aide Is 'Baffled' at Charges She Obstructed Hacking Investigation,"As my colleagues Alan Cowell and John F. Burns report, Rebekah Brooks, the former head of Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper empire and a close friend of Prime Minister David Cameron, faced charges on Tuesday that she, her husband and four others conspired ""to pervert the course of justice"" during a police investigation of illegal phone-hacking by tabloid journalists.After they were formally charged, Ms. Brooks and her husband, Charlie Brooks, appeared together to denounce the decision in furious statements. Speaking to reporters first, Mr. Brooks claimed that his wife was the ""subject of a witch hunt.""Ms. Brooks, who once wielded immense political power as the chief editor of the popular tabloids The News of the World and The Sun, then said: ""I am baffled by the decision to charge me today. However, more importantly, I cannot express my anger enough that those closest to me have been dragged into this, unfairly. One day, the details of this case will emerge, and people will see today as nothing more than an expensive sideshow, a waste of public money, as a result of an unjust and weak decision.""  Earlier on Tuesday, Alison Levitt, a legal adviser for Britain's Crown Prosecution Service, stepped before the cameras to read a description of the three charges.According to Ms. Levitt, her review of the evidence suggested that Ms. Brooks and her associates had conspired in July of last year ""to conceal documents, computers and other electronic equipment from officers of the Metropolitan Police Service,"" and ""to remove seven boxes of material from the archive of News International.""In the kind of coincidence the former tabloid editor might have been delighted by in other circumstances, video shot outside the police station where Ms. Brooks was charged showed that she departed by first walking and then driving past a large van emblazoned with the words ""Police Horses."" It was revealed in February that the same London police force that had failed to adequately investigate the use of phone hacking at tabloids under Ms. Brooks's control had lent her a retired police horse in 2008. The horse was later ridden by Mr. Cameron ahead of the 2010 election, when he was courting the support of the Murdoch-owned tabloids.Last week, Ms. Brooks told a public inquiry into press ethics that she and Mr. Cameron had exchanged frequent text messages. ""Occasionally he would sign them LOL - 'lots of love,'"" Ms. Brooks said, ""until I told him it meant 'laugh out loud.' "" The news that Mr. Cameron had a poor grasp on the abbreviations used in text messages, after his delayed admission that he had indeed been for a ride on the retired police horse, led one observer to suggest on Twitter that the prime minister might also be confused about the meaning of IMHO -- text speak for ""in my humble opinion.""In my honest opinion, this is the best spoof #camerontext so far: RT@ruhawksley: IMHO - Is My Horse Outside?- Paul Waugh (@paulwaugh)11 May 12 "
E-Mail Alert To a Murdoch On Hacking Was Deleted,"LONDON -- An e-mail to Rupert Murdoch's son James that referred to ''a nightmare scenario'' of legal repercussions from widespread phone hacking at the News of the World tabloid was deleted from his computer less than two weeks before the police opened their current investigation into phone hacking, lawyers said Wednesday.The deletion was part of an ''e-mail stabilization and modernization program'' in which accounts were ''being prepared for the migration to a new e-mail system,'' said Linklaters, a law firm representing News International, the British newspaper arm of the Murdoch media empire. The e-mail was a chain of messages sent June 7, 2008, to James Murdoch, head of News Corporation's European and Asian operations, warning that the potential legal fallout from hacking at The News of the World was ''as bad as we feared.''Linklaters disclosed the existence of the e-mail to a House of Commons committee investigating phone hacking in December. Mr. Murdoch said that while he received and answered the e-mail, he did not scroll all the way down through the chain and so did not read everything in it.The disclosure of the deletion came in a letter from Linklaters to the Commons committee. The letter says that the deletion occurred on Jan. 15, 2011. Operation Weeting, the police inquiry into phone hacking at The News of the World, began 11 days later.The letter also disclosed that the e-mail's existence became known only because investigators unearthed a hard copy from a storage crate filled with material left behind last summer when The News of the World was closed.A News International spokeswoman said the company had no comment and would not discuss what other e-mails might have been deleted at the same time.The e-mail has become significant in the hacking case as possible evidence of what Mr. Murdoch knew and when he learned it. Two company officials -- Tom Crone, then a News International lawyer, and Colin Myler, then the News of the World editor -- have said they informed him at the time that phone hacking was endemic at the newspaper.Mr. Murdoch has always maintained that they never told him and that he knew nothing about it until much later.Three days after the June 7 e-mail, Mr. Murdoch met with Mr. Crone and Mr. Myler and decided to pay more than $1.4 million to settle a hacking lawsuit. The details of the suit were kept secret, and until December 2010, News International maintained that hacking at the newspaper was limited to a ''rogue reporter.''The Linklaters' letter said the crate in which the hard copy of the e-mail was found ''had a sticker on it which suggested the contents were originally held in Mr. Myler's office.''Electronic copies were then found in two of Mr. Murdoch's laptops, and one from an assistant's desktop computer, Linklaters said. Mr. Myler's copy, though, was ''lost from the e-mail archive system in a hardware failure which occurred on 18 March 2010,'' the law firm added.News International has given varying accounts about what e-mails it has, where they are and why it did not immediately make them available to investigators. At one point, it said that its e-mail archive had been lost on the way for storage in Mumbai, India; at another, it said it could only retrieve e-mails that were less than six months old.But new intimations that the company may have purposely destroyed evidence are raising questions about whether the company might be investigated for obstruction of justice.A judge accused News International last month of destroying possibly relevant e-mails. And The Guardian reported Tuesday that the police were examining ''an enormous reservoir of material from News International's central computer services'' that was ''deliberately deleted from News International's servers.''

"News Corp. Profited in Quarter, Despite Hacking Scandal","Cable television dramas and movies helped raise News Corporation's revenues by 2 percent in the second quarter, offsetting the growing costs related to a phone hacking scandal at the company's British newspaper unit.The company on Wednesday beat Wall Street's expectations, reporting $1.06 billion in net income, or 42 cents a share, in the three months that ended Dec. 31, compared with $642 million, or 24 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue grew slightly, to $8.98 billion, up from $8.76 billion in 2010.News Corporation said an ongoing investigation into phone hacking and the closing of the News of the World tabloid had cost the company $87 million in the quarter, or 3 cents a share. Chase Carey, the company's president and chief operating officer, declined to forecast how much the hacking scandal, including legal settlements with victims, could cost News Corporation. ''We're not going to predict or target it. We're going to do what it takes to make things right,'' he said Wednesday on a conference call with analysts and reporters.Mr. Carey said entertainment ''continues to drive overall company results.'' Leading the growth was cable network FX. Hit dramas like ''American Horror Story'' led to a 20 percent increase in prime-time viewers ages 18 to 49. Operating income at FX and News Corporation's other cable networks, including perennial performer Fox News, jumped 20 percent to $882 million.Movies like ''Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked'' and ''The Descendants'' contributed to $393 million in operating income at the company's filmed entertainment unit, more than twice what it was in 2010.That growth ''clearly validates our strategy to develop and distribute superior wide-ranging content,'' Rupert Murdoch, chief executive at News Corporation, said in a statement. He added: ''I am particularly pleased with the success of our business strategies in spite of the uncertain economic conditions that we continue to face.''But profits at the business closest to Mr. Murdoch's heart continued to ebb. The company's publishing unit, which includes newspapers in Australia, Britain and the United States, saw a 43 percent decline in profit, due to a weak advertising market in Australia and the cost of closing the News of the World.The declines in print publications were ''exacerbated by a very tough economy,'' Mr. Carey said. The exception was The Wall Street Journal, which performed well in the quarter, he said (the company does not break out revenue figures for individual newspapers).Mr. Carey said Dow Jones & Company, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and the Dow Jones newswires, will expand its reach into financial services and other digital initiatives under the leadership of a new chief executive, Lex Fenwick, formerly of Bloomberg L.P., who was named last week.Operating income at the Fox broadcast network jumped 25 percent to $189 million, largely because of a strong fall season anchored by Major League Baseball and shows like ''The X Factor'' and ''The New Girl.'' Mr. Carey's efforts at renegotiating steeper carriage fees with cable and satellite operators paid off with retransmission consent revenues up more than 100 percent from the previous quarter.News Corporation released its quarterly results after the markets closed, with shares ending the day up 0.62 percent at $19.62.

Hacking Cases Focus on Memo To a Murdoch,"LONDON -- As dozens of investigators and high-powered lawyers converge on Rupert Murdoch's News International in the phone hacking scandal, attention has focused on the printout of an e-mail excavated three months ago from a sealed carton left behind in an empty company office.Addressed to Mr. Murdoch's son James, it contained explosive information about the scale of phone hacking at The News of the World tabloid -- information James Murdoch says he failed to take in because he did not read the whole e-mail chain.The e-mail returned to cause trouble for News International, the British newspaper subsidiary of News Corporation, several weeks ago when the company said that it had been deleted from Mr. Murdoch's computer. Even as people familiar with the investigations said the e-mail and its convoluted history will form a crucial part of the inquiry into allegations of a cover-up, the scandal appeared to be widening on Saturday, as senior journalists at News Corporation's Sun tabloid were arrested. Tracing the story of the e-mail, which was found in November and first became publicly known in December, also sheds light on the intrigue surrounding Mr. Murdoch, the company's heir apparent, and on efforts to protect him from the scandal.Embroiled in three separate police operations, a parliamentary investigation, a judicial inquiry and a flurry of civil suits with potentially hundreds more waiting in the wings, News Corporation has begun to provide information that suggests a broader sweep of hacking activity at News International than was suspected even recently and more widespread knowledge within the company of past efforts to cover it up.This new level of cooperation includes the release of damaging material from an internal investigation that is being overseen by executives who, observers say, are using it to consolidate their power within the company, a move that could come at James Murdoch's expense.''There's no good way out of it,'' a former News International executive said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigations. ''If you put up your hand and say, 'I'm going to investigate myself and here's what I found' and you're not very open and full about it, then it looks like just another cover-up.''A Stunning FindWhen The News of the World was closed in disgrace last summer, its newsroom was locked down by security guards. In mid-November, News International says, investigators searching the seized materials found a storage crate that, judging from a sticker on top, had come from the office of Colin Myler, the paper's last editor. It contained a hard copy of an e-mail sent from Mr. Myler to James Murdoch on June 7, 2008 -- in reality a chain of e-mails that included correspondence with Tom Crone, then an in-house lawyer.''Unfortunately, it is as bad as we feared,'' Mr. Myler wrote, speaking of an impending lawsuit that threatened to reveal that voice-mail hacking at the paper was endemic.Last summer, senior News International officials said that in that crucial period in 2008, Mr. Murdoch had neither been told about nor shown documentation of the extent of the illegality at The News of the World. The discovery of the e-mail, said one former official with knowledge of the situation, was completely unexpected.Why did it take so long to come to light? Linklaters, a law firm working for News International, said that a junior employee found it in November, but that senior officials at the firm did not know about it until December.In addition, Linklaters told the Commons Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, Mr. Myler's electronic copy had been lost ''in a hardware failure'' on March 18, 2010,'' while Mr. Murdoch's electronic copy had been deleted on Jan. 15, 2011 during an ''e-mail stabilization and modernization program.''Big corporations routinely delete old e-mails. Between April 2010 and July 2011, News International discussed e-mail deletion with HCL Technologies, which manages its e-mail system, on nine occasions, according to a letter HCL wrote to Parliament last summer.Most of the reasons were mundane. But in January 2011, HCL said, News International asked whether HCL was capable of helping ''truncate'' -- meaning delete -- ''a particular database'' in the e-mail system. The question came shortly after disclosures in a civil suit brought by the actress Sienna Miller raised fears that material about widespread phone hacking at The News of the World might become public.News International did not explain why it wanted the deletion. HCL said it could not help and told the company to look elsewhere.It is not clear whether the ''stabilization and modernization program'' that deleted the Murdoch e-mail was linked to News International's request to ''truncate'' data. But it is clear that on Jan. 15, when the deletion took place, the company knew it was facing civil and potentially criminal inquiries. A month earlier, reacting to new information from the Miller and other cases, it had suspended the News of the World's news editor, Ian Edmondson, on suspicion of phone hacking, and handed some material to the police.Questions of Timing''They were aware that it was highly likely the police were going to reopen the investigation,'' said a person with knowledge of the police operation. Indeed, the police formally began Operation Weeting, their new phone hacking investigation, 11 days later.At every step of the inquiry, the company has said it is cooperating fully and producing relevant documents. A News International spokeswoman declined to comment for this article.A lawmaker involved in the investigations of News International said the company's primary objective from the beginning was to protect James Murdoch, and everything else was secondary to that.News International has given a variety of explanations for where its e-mails are and whether the ones it says it cannot find were deleted, lost in computer malfunctions or simply mislaid. In December 2010, a News of the World editor told a court in Scotland that ''many e-mails had been lost when they were being moved to an archive in India.'' That same month, a company lawyer said that News International could not retrieve e-mails written more than six months earlier. Neither of those statements was true, the company admitted later.Last month, the High Court judge presiding over the civil lawsuits brought by hacking victims castigated News International for what he called its ''startling approach'' to e-mail. Even after the company received a formal request for documents, said the judge, Geoffrey Vos, ''a previously conceived plan to delete e-mails was put in place by senior management.''Speaking of News Group Newspapers, a division of News International, Justice Vos said that ''they are to be treated as deliberate destroyers of evidence.''At every step of the way, News International has declared that it is doing its utmost to investigate wrongdoing. In 2007, for example, the company told Parliament that it had conducted an investigation by asking an outside law firm, Harbottle & Lewis, to examine 2,500 e-mails, and that the investigation had cleared senior editors of wrongdoing.Many of those supposedly cleared were later arrested on suspicion of phone hacking and other charges. And Harbottle & Lewis said later that the investigation had, in fact, been requested by News International to answer allegations in an unfair dismissal claim brought by a former employee involved in phone hacking -- not to look for more phone hacking at the paper.News International has pledged to police itself better. Under the aegis of its four-person Management and Standards Committee, it says it will comb through and make available every piece of potentially pertinent material.Dozens of people -- lawyers, forensic accountants, forensic computer technicians and, sometimes, police officers -- gather daily at a site in Thomas More Square here, where News International is based, searching through 300 million e-mails and other documents stretching back a decade.''Pooling data together is a complex matter,'' said a person with knowledge of the standards committee. ''What is recoverable is a very technical operation.''Mr. Murdoch, who is News Corporation's deputy chief operating officer and chairman and chief executive of its international division, relocated to New York recently as part of a long-planned move meant to help ease him into place to eventually take over News Corporation from his father. But the younger Mr. Murdoch's position seems much more precarious than it did a year ago. Last month, he resigned from the board of GlaxoSmithKline, Britain's biggest drug company, and last summer his dream of helping News Corporation take over all of British Sky Broadcasting shattered to pieces in the wake of the hacking scandal.People in New York say that Mr. Murdoch is confident he will survive the storm back in London. But questions still abound about what he knew, and when.When he got the 2008 e-mail, News International was facing a major potential disaster: a lawsuit brought by Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, who said that his phone had been hacked and that he had proof.That is what the e-mail told Mr. Murdoch. Farther down in a short message chain, there was mention of a ''nightmare scenario'' of legal repercussions, and an acknowledgment that The News of the World ''knew of and made use of the voice mail information'' it illegally acquired from Mr. Taylor's cellphone.Mr. Myler's e-mail was sent on a Saturday afternoon. Mr. Murdoch replied minutes later, agreeing to a meeting that Tuesday and telling Mr. Myler he would be home ''if you want to talk before.''Soon afterward, Mr. Murdoch approved a settlement of more than $1.4 million to Mr. Taylor, an unprecedented amount for such a case.In December, he said he had not read the whole e-mail. ''I am confident that I did not review the full e-mail chain at this time or afterwards,'' he said in a letter to the Commons culture committee. ''I would also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm my past testimony that I was not aware of evidence that either pointed to widespread wrongdoing or indicated that further investigation was necessary.''Contradicting Mr. Murdoch's testimony, Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone told Parliament they had informed him about the damaging aspects of the Taylor lawsuit. Mr. Murdoch has consistently denied this, declaring that he approved the settlement because of his lawyers' advice, not because he knew the underlying details. "
Former Murdoch Executive Is Said to Be Arrested in Tabloid Hacking Inquiry,"LONDON -- Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, the British newspaper division of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, was arrested early Tuesday on suspicion of obstruction of justice, according to a person with knowledge of the arrest. Her husband, Charlie, a friend of Prime Minister David Cameron from their days at Eton three decades ago, was also arrested, the person said.The police said in a statement that six people in and outside of London had been arrested on Tuesday as part of Operation Weeting, the criminal investigation into phone hacking and other illegal activities at The News of the World and other newspapers. None have yet been formally charged with crimes; in the British system, charges can be filed months after an arrest, and sometimes not at all. Following standard procedure, the police statement did not identify those arrested. But a person with knowledge of the arrests said that besides Ms. Brooks and her husband, they included Mark Hanna, the head of security for News International.The police statement said the six had been arrested between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. and were being interrogated at different police stations on suspicion of ''conspiracy to pervert the course of justice,'' the British equivalent of obstruction of justice. This could relate to activities like destroying e-mails, computers and other evidence, people with knowledge of the investigation said.Two former editorial staff members at News International said they had heard from inside the company that the questioning was related to e-mails that were deleted before the police widened their phone hacking investigation last year.A second Scotland Yard statement, issued more than 13 hours after the arrests, said five of the six suspects had been released on bail but were required to return for further questioning in April. The statement said the sixth suspect, a man, remained ''in custody at a central London police station'' but did not explain why.From the sparse details in the statement, which identified those released by their ages and where they had been questioned, it was clear that the Brookses were among them. The pattern -- predawn arrests, hours of questioning, release on bail after dusk -- followed procedures that Scotland Yard had used in all previous arrests in the case.Ms. Brooks, 43, is a confidante of Mr. Murdoch and an erstwhile friend of Mr. Cameron, who attended her wedding to Mr. Brooks in 2009. She was the editor of the now-defunct News of the World and the editor of The Sun, another Murdoch-owned tabloid, before being named chief executive of News International. Before the arrest on Tuesday, she had already been arrested in the police operation -- last summer, on suspicion of phone hacking and illegally paying the police.The police have arrested but not yet charged more than 40 people in Operation Weeting and two ancillary investigations: Operation Tuleta, which is looking into accusations of computer hacking, and Operation Elveden, which is looking into accusations that journalists paid police officers and government officials for information.Ms. Brooks is the highest-ranking News International official to be arrested. Andy Coulson, a former News of the World editor who went on to become the chief spokesman for the prime minister, was also arrested last summer as part of Operation Weeting. Other suspects include some of the most prominent reporters and editors at The News of the World and The Sun, Britain's most popular daily newspaper.Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson have maintained that they knew nothing about phone hacking or other illegal activities. David Wilson, a spokesman for the Brookses, did not return a call seeking comment.According to a statement from the Metropolitan Police, the ages of the suspects arrested Tuesday ranged from 38 to 49, and all but one were men. Five were arrested at home: two in Oxfordshire (these are believed to be the Brookses), one in Hampshire, one in West London, one in Hertfordshire and one in East London. The sixth suspect, the police said, was arrested at a business address in East London.It is unclear what Mr. Brooks, a horse trainer with strong Conservative ties who appears to have been drawn into the investigation by virtue of his marriage, is suspected of having done. But The Guardian reported in July that he was involved in a peculiar episode featuring a laptop left in a bag in a garbage can in an underground parking garage near the London apartment he shares with his wife.According to The Guardian, the bag, which also held some papers, was unearthed by security guards, who called the police. Mr. Brooks then tried to reclaim the items but could not prove they were his.A spokesman for Mr. Brooks told the newspaper that he had ''left the bag with a friend who was returning it, but dropped it in the wrong part of the garage.'' When asked how the bag had ended up in a garbage can, the spokesman replied, ''The suggestion is that a cleaner thought it was rubbish and put it in the bin,'' and added that it had been ''nothing to do with Rebekah,'' the newspaper said. "
Witness Intimidation Alleged in Arrest in Hacking Scandal,"LONDON -- In what could prove to be one of the most damaging chapters yet in the scandal enveloping Rupert Murdoch's tabloid newspapers in Britain, Scotland Yard arrested a former chief reporter for The News of the World on Wednesday on suspicion of intimidating a witness, the first time the police have raised the specter of witness tampering in the course of their investigations.A police statement said a 51-year-old man had been ''arrested by appointment'' at a central London police station ''on suspicion of intimidation of a witness'' and of ''encouraging or assisting'' a related offense. The statement did not name the man, but former employees of News International, the British newspaper subsidiary of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, identified him as Neville Thurlbeck, who was fired by News International last summer after 21 years with The News of the World. Mr. Murdoch shut down The News of the World, a Sunday paper, in July amid a wave of revelations about its use of cellphone hacking. Police inquiries have widened to include The Sun, the daily newspaper that is the most profitable and most widely circulated of the Murdoch newspaper titles in Britain, and a broad range of suspected criminal wrongdoing.As Mr. Thurlbeck was undergoing questioning, a parliamentary committee released a new letter from Mr. Murdoch's 39-year-old son, James, who until his recent resignation as chairman of News International was the overall head of the newspaper operations in Britain.In the seven-page letter, James Murdoch expressed his ''great and real regret'' over the cellphone hacking. But he insisted that he had not misled Parliament in his two extended appearances before the committee last year, and that he had not engaged in a cover-up.''I did not know about, nor did I try to hide, wrongdoing,'' he said. ''I do not believe the evidence before you supports any other conclusion.''Mr. Thurlbeck's arrest on Wednesday was his second in Scotland Yard's investigations. His arrest in April, the police said, was on suspicion of phone hacking.More than 40 people with links to the Murdoch papers have been arrested and released on bail in the scandal, including six who were taken for lengthy questioning on Tuesday on suspicion of obstruction of justice. The six included Rebekah Brooks, a former editor of The News of the World and former chief executive of News International; her husband, Charlie Brooks, a well-known racehorse trainer; and Mark Hanna, the head of security at News International.Legal experts said the arrests in recent weeks pointed to an ascending hierarchy of suspected wrongdoing that made for a worsening situation for News International and its parent, News Corporation. After concentrating for months on phone hacking, Scotland Yard has progressed to allegations that carry potentially far heavier criminal penalties -- bribery of public officials, obstruction of justice and now witness intimidation.One of the problems facing the company is the bitter disaffection of some who lost their jobs as a result of the News of the World shutdown or who, like Mr. Thurlbeck, were dismissed. In that regard, Mr. Thurlbeck has become a focal figure, suing the company for his legal costs and using a blog on his own Web site to excoriate News International executives for passing information to Scotland Yard that led to some of the recent arrests.He has made a target of News International's Management and Standards Committee, appointed by Rupert Murdoch to track down evidence of wrongdoing from the company's files and turn it over to the police, and to draw up new ethical rules for the company's journalism.In one post last week, Mr. Thurlbeck described the committee as ''obsequious,'' and said that it was ''busily heaping the corpses of its most loyal servants onto a funeral pyre'' in the hope of deterring any prosecution of News Corporation in the United States under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.One News International executive who has been singled out by Mr. Thurlbeck for harsh comments has been Will Lewis, the 42-year-old former executive editor of the group that publishes The Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph, who was recruited by News International in 2010 and appointed to the Management and Standards Committee.In another post last week, Mr. Thurlbeck reported that Mr. Lewis had hired a private security company to tighten surveillance of his home outside London after The Evening Standard, a non-Murdoch tabloid in London, ran a story saying that two Sun journalists had attempted suicide after the Murdoch committee turned their names over to the police. Mr. Thurlbeck said Mr. Lewis had acted on his home security in the face of ''mounting fury on the Sun's newsroom floor.''In its original form, the Thurlbeck post gave the street address of Mr. Lewis's home, a detail he subsequently struck from the blog, with an apology. "
James Murdoch Resigns From Board of Newspaper Group,"In a continuing effort to distance himself from News Corporation's embattled British newspaper unit, James Murdoch has stepped down from the board of Times Newspapers Holdings.The group, established by Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of News Corporation and James's father, was created to safeguard the editorial independence of The Times of London and The Sunday Times after the media conglomerate bought the British newspapers in 1981, according to public filings with the British government. James, the youngest son of Rupert Murdoch and once the heir apparent at the $50 billion media company, has over the last several months resigned from a string of corporate boards, both with ties to the British papers and unrelated.Last week, the auction house Sotheby's said in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission that James Murdoch would not return to his board position. Earlier this year he gave up his position on the board of the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.It remains to be seen whether Mr. Murdoch will hold onto his role as chairman of the British broadcaster BSkyB, of which News Corporation holds a minority stake. The company dropped its $12 billion bid to take over BSkyB last summer when a phone hacking scandal thrust News Corporation under increased government scrutiny.News Corporation's British tabloids continue to face government inquiries over the phone hacking episode and over allegations of bribery of government officials. In February, the company said Mr. Murdoch would step down from his role as chief executive of News International, the company's British newspaper subsidiary.Mr. Murdoch already spent most of his time at the company's New York headquarters, where he holds the title of deputy chief operating officer, reporting to Chase Carey, News Corporation's president and chief operating officer. He had already stepped down from the holding companies News Corporation Investments and News International Publishers.The scandal in Britain has led to the resignation of several News International executives. Lawmakers are still investigating Mr. Murdoch's involvement in the phone hacking case as News Corporation's internal Management and Standards Committee hands over additional documents and evidence.In the coming weeks, the Parliament's culture, media and sport committee, which has been leading the investigation into phone hacking at the now shuttered News of the World tabloid and The Sun, is expected to release a report on whether executives previously misled investigators.Last week, Mr. Murdoch released a letter to British lawmakers acknowledging that in 2009 when allegations of phone hacking came to light, he could have been more diligent in uncovering wrongdoing. But he maintained that he did not mislead lawmakers.''I could have asked more questions, requested more documents and taken a more challenging and skeptical view of what I was told,'' he wrote. ''I will do so in the future.''This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
News Corp.'s Pursuer Had Modest Start,"Rupert Murdoch has made a career of painting his critics as elitist, privileged and out of touch. But the English lawyer who stands at the center of the legal battles that have engulfed his News Corporation did not attend a select law school or work at a top London law firm.In fact, until 2009, when a parliamentary committee heard evidence into accusations of widespread phone hacking at News Corporation's News of the World tabloid, Mark Lewis, a 47-year-old solicitor from Manchester, had never been inside the House of Commons.Mr. Lewis is one of a small handful of lawyers who have led the civil litigation against News Corporation over suspected phone hacking at its now-closed News of the World. He has represented nearly 100 clients, including the family of Milly Dowler, the kidnapped 13-year-old whose voice mail is said to have been hacked by the tabloid. The phone-hacking scandal has not jumped the ocean to the United States, but Mr. Lewis will. On Monday, he will hold meetings in New York to look into filing at least three civil suits related to phone hacking at The News of the World.Mr. Lewis said his clients believed their voice-mail messages were intercepted while they were visiting the United States or as they left messages on British cellphones that had been hacked by The News of the World.''If the person leaving a message is American, why should they travel across the Atlantic to issue a claim?'' Mr. Lewis said.Mr. Lewis would not discuss the details of the suits but said they related to two professional sports figures and at least one United States citizen. A spokesman for News Corporation declined to comment on Mr. Lewis's visit to New York and any potential suits in the United States.The path that led Mr. Lewis to one of the most prominent legal battles against a major corporation sounds ''like a John Grisham novel,'' Mr. Lewis said.The son of a part-time secretary and a failed businessman, Mr. Lewis grew up in Radcliffe, a working-class town on the outskirts of Manchester. He studied law at the University of Chester and for years loyally read The News of the World. He has multiple sclerosis, which has left him with a debilitated arm and a limp that has not slowed him down.In 2006, Mr. Lewis specialized in defamation cases (''It almost sounds like ambulance chasing,'' he said) at George Davies Solicitors L.L.P. One of his clients, Gordon Taylor, a former soccer player and the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, sought to stop The News of the World from publishing an article that claimed he was having an affair.Mr. Lewis stopped the article's publication. He then wrote to The News of the World, requesting the tabloid pay his legal fees ''on the basis that if you don't ask, you don't get it,'' he said.In response, he received a letter from News International, the News Corporation subsidiary that published The News of the World.''They said no to my request, but they put in this throwaway line in the letter that said, 'This was a proper journalistic inquiry,' '' he recalled. ''That caught my eye.''A few months later he had his living room television on and noticed that the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and the royal family reporter Clive Goodman had pleaded guilty to phone hacking. Photos appeared of celebrities who had been named in court as having had their voice mails hacked. Mr. Taylor's picture appeared.''That was my light-bulb moment,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''If I'd had a different channel on or looked at the TV two minutes later, none of this would've happened.''He wrote to The News of the World and accused the tabloid of hacking into Mr. Taylor's cellphone. In his research, he sued London's Metropolitan Police Service in order to gain access to documents pertaining to his client's case. In this trove, he uncovered a document now known as the ''for Neville'' e-mail, frequently mentioned in subsequent parliamentary hearings.The e-mail, to the longtime News of the World reporter Neville Thurlbeck, contained transcripts of cellphone conversations, proof that the hacking was more widespread than the work of a single rogue reporter, as the company initially claimed.In response to his claim on behalf of Mr. Taylor, a News International in-house lawyer, Tom Crone, visited Mr. Lewis in Manchester. ''I'd been doing that job for 17 years, and he'd never left his office to come see me,'' Mr. Lewis said.News International paid more than $:700,000, or $1.1 million, in 2008 to settle the case with Mr. Taylor, several hundred times more than typical damages in British invasion-of-privacy cases.Mr. Lewis soon began to hear from others who claimed their phones had been hacked by The News of the World.Mr. Lewis said he believed that News International had put him and his family under surveillance and assembled a dossier with details about his personal life. Mr. Crone later told British lawmakers that News International had collected information on two lawyers who had worked on suits related to phone hacking. He did not specifically name Mr. Lewis. (News Corporation declined to comment.)In 2009, when The Guardian newspaper of Britain published an article about phone hacking at The News of the World, Mr. Lewis lost his job at the firm. ''They made a business decision that pursuing this was too much trouble,'' Mr. Lewis said.He and his wife of 19 years, with whom he has four daughters, divorced. He lost his house and sold a couple of his coveted vintage cars on eBay to help pay the bills. Then, Milly Dowler's mother reached out to him to pursue the family's case against News International.''I was running out of money, living on credit cards, and pretty close to giving up, and just on that afternoon I got a call from Sally Dowler,'' Mr. Lewis said.In October 2011, the Dowler family received a $4.8 million compensation package, including a $1.6 million charitable donation from Mr. Murdoch, News Corporation's chairman and chief executive, who personally apologized.''That was the turning point,'' Mr. Lewis said.The phone-hacking scandal has cost News Corporation $379 million, which includes legal and consulting fees and costs related to closing The News of the World, according to the company. Several media analysts say the cost could total nearly $1 billion as News International settles suits.No suits have been brought against News Corporation in the United States. Mr. Lewis said he planned to meet with Norman Siegel, a prominent civil liberties lawyer in New York, to discuss how to proceed with filing suits. Hacking phones on United States soil could potentially violate privacy and telecommunications laws.A person knowledgeable about News Corporation who could not discuss private conversations publicly said the company had not seen any evidence that supported Mr. Lewis's claims.A year and a half ago Mr. Lewis relocated to London to take a job at Taylor Hampton Solicitors. In a twist that Mr. Lewis calls coincidental, a founder of the firm, Daniel Taylor, previously worked as an in-house counsel at News International.''If you wrote it in a novel, people wouldn't believe it,'' he said. "
British Government Seeks Special Status at Hacking Inquiry,"LONDON -- Days before two former executives at Rupert Murdoch's tabloid newspapers here are to testify at a judicial inquiry into Britain's phone hacking scandal, the government of Prime Minister David Cameron was granted special status that yields advance access to witness statements and the ability to question testimony.At a previously unscheduled hearing on Friday, the judge leading the inquiry, Lord Justice Brian Leveson, said that he would grant the prime minister and six other senior cabinet ministers what is called core participant status, given to those who have a special interest in the outcome of the hearings. The status will be granted to the prime minister and members of his cabinet including the culture minister Jeremy Hunt, and the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who have both been targets of accusations of improper coziness with Mr. Murdoch and his executives. The government's request reflected some of the apprehension that the hacking scandal has injected into Britain's political establishment, which once courted Mr. Murdoch's newspapers for approval and endorsement but now fears any fresh suggestion that contacts with the media tycoon were too intimate.Only last week, the judicial inquiry uncovered evidence of what seemed close ties between Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation and the office of Mr. Hunt, which was in charge of evaluating the company's $12 billion bid, since withdrawn, to assume full control of Britain's biggest satellite broadcaster, BSkyB.Adam Smith, an aide to the minister resigned over the accusation, but Mr. Hunt himself has resisted opposition calls in Parliament for his ouster.The inquiry lists 10 individuals and groups -- including victims of phone hacking -- who have already been given the special status. They include News International, the British newspaper subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.John Toker, a spokesman for the inquiry, said core participant status would give the government the right to see documents and witness statements in advance and enable it to question other witnesses through its lawyers. Core participants may also discuss the wording of redactions in material to be published on the inquiry's Web site.But, he said, the inquiry imposes strict conditions and, for instance, requires core participants to sign confidentiality agreements to prevent premature disclosure of material provided to them.According to its Web site, the status is available to those who ''played a direct and significant role'' in the scandal, had a ''significant interest'' in the hearings or ''may be subject to explicit or significant criticism during the inquiry proceedings or in its report.''The inquiry scheduled its session on the government's request days before Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, pivotal figures in the phone hacking scandal with strong links to Prime Minister David Cameron, are set to give evidence next week.Mr. Coulson, who resigned as the editor of the tabloid The News of the World, which was at the center of the scandal in 2007 and was closed last year by Mr. Murdoch, became a senior adviser to Mr. Cameron before being forced to step down last year.He was arrested and later released on suspicion of conspiracy in the hacking case and of corruption in approving payments from journalists to public officials.Ms. Brooks, who was chief executive of Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper company News International, also has close ties to Mr. Cameron and is already listed as a core participant in the inquiry.She was also arrested on the same grounds as Mr. Coulson and on suspicion of obstructing justice.The Leveson inquiry is one of three overlapping inquiries into British press ethics and practices since the disclosure last year that The News of the World, a Sunday tabloid which Mr. Murdoch ordered closed because of the scandal, had hacked into the voice mail of a murdered British teenager, Milly Dowler, after she was abducted and before her body was found.Both Rupert Murdoch and his son James testified at the inquiry last week that they were unaware of the extent of the hacking when it first came to light and was investigated in 2007.But, separately from the judicial inquiry, a parliamentary investigation concluded in a finding split along partisan lines that Mr. Murdoch was ''not a fit person'' to run a huge international corporation and censured three former executives of News International.It also alleged that his company sought to cover up widespread phone hacking used to gather information about politicians, celebrities and other people in the news.At the same time the police are conducting their own interwoven criminal inquiries into phone hacking, e-mail hacking and corruption.The appearances are likely to deepen scrutiny of the links -- described by critics as improperly close -- between Mr. Murdoch's media empire and Mr. Cameron's government. Separately, a former Scotland Yard special operations officer was arrested ''on suspicion of misconduct in a public office'' as part of Operation Elveden, the investigation into payments to public officials, police officials said.The arrest was made, police officials said, as a result of information provided by Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation.

Ex-Aide to Cameron Charged in Scottish Perjury Case,"LONDON -- Andy Coulson, a former tabloid editor in Rupert Murdoch's media empire and later director of communications for Prime Minister David Cameron, was arrested by the Scottish police on Wednesday and charged with lying under oath about whether he knew phone hacking was going on at the newspaper he edited, The News of the World.Mr. Coulson, 44, is the second high-profile former Murdoch employee to be criminally charged in the hacking scandal, joining Rebekah Brooks, a top Murdoch lieutenant who was arrested in England this month on charges of obstructing justice. According to British news reports, Mr. Coulson was detained at his house in Dulwich, South London, at 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday, and then driven -- escorted by seven Scottish police officers -- to a police station in Glasgow. He was questioned through the day and formally charged shortly before 10 p.m.Mr. Murdoch closed The News of the World last summer amid a scandal over unsavory and illicit reporting practices that has reverberated through Britain's political, law enforcement and media establishments.After years of denying that phone hacking went on at The News of the World, News International, the British newspaper arm of Mr. Murdoch's media empire, finally acknowledged that the practice was widespread and has paid millions of dollars to settle dozens of civil cases brought by hacking victims.The charge against Mr. Coulson stems from a case heard at Scottish High Court in Glasgow in 2010 that involved a Scottish politician charged with having committed perjury in testimony at an earlier libel trial. Defending himself against the perjury charge, the politician, Tommy Sheridan, claimed that The News of the World had illegally intercepted voice mail messages from his cellphone account.Mr. Coulson was called as a witness in that case. He was presented with records showing that Mr. Sheridan's name, phone number and telephone PIN code were written in a notebook belonging to Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator who worked extensively for The News of the World and who pleaded guilty in 2007 to hacking voice mail messages on the paper's behalf.Mr. Coulson expressed surprise. ''I'm saying that I had absolutely no knowledge of it,'' he declared on the stand, speaking of Mr. Sheridan's assertion that Mr. Mulcaire had hacked his phone. ''I certainly didn't instruct anyone to do anything at the time, or anything else that was untoward.''Mr. Coulson also flatly denied that he had condoned or even known about phone hacking or other illegal reporting techniques while he was editor of The News of the World.''I don't accept there was a culture of phone hacking at The News of the World,'' he testified. Nor, he added, had he ever instructed his reporters to use ''the dark arts'' to obtain stories. In any case, he told the court, he defined ''the dark arts'' as ''investigative work.''After Mr. Mulcaire pleaded guilty to phone hacking -- along with the paper's royal correspondent, Clive Goodman -- Mr. Coulson resigned as editor, saying he had to take ultimate responsibility for what happened. But he maintained that Mr. Goodman was a ''rogue reporter'' and that phone hacking at the paper had not extended beyond him.He repeated that claim while testifying at the 2010 trial.''There was a very unfortunate, to put it mildly, case involving Clive Goodman,'' Mr. Coulson told the court. ''No one was more sorry about it than me. That's why I resigned.''Mr. Coulson's testimony was consistent with other comments he has made, including in the House of Commons, about phone hacking, always denying he knew about it.But lying to Parliament and committing perjury in court are two different things. Mr. Sheridan, who was ultimately convicted in his own perjury case, was sentenced to three years in prison, and served one year before being released.After he left The News of the World, Mr. Coulson was hired to be the Conservative Party's chief of communications by Mr. Cameron, who said he believed that Mr. Coulson was telling the truth about phone hacking and who stood by him even as it became increasingly clear that the practice had been endemic at The News of the World.Mr. Coulson followed the victorious Conservative Party to Downing Street after the 2010 election, but resigned from his government post in January 2011, saying that the growing hacking scandal was distracting him.Last July, he was arrested and questioned by the police in England on suspicion of phone hacking and of illegally paying officials for information. He has not yet heard whether he will be charged with those crimes; England and Scotland have different criminal justice systems, and arrests in England do not necessarily lead to formal charges. "
Britain: Hacking Panel's Big Week,"LONDON -- The judicial inquiry investigating the ethics and behavior of the British press following the phone hacking scandal unveiled an A-list of politicians on Friday -- including prime ministers past and present -- to testify over four days next week about their ties with the media, particularly the Murdoch empire.It had been widely known that members of the political elite would be summoned. But the concentration of political heavyweights in such a short space of time seemed certain to send a frisson of anticipation through those who track the twists and turns of the months-old inquiry and who are likely to see the forthcoming testimony as potentially among the most significant so far. In a statement on its Web site, the inquiry, led by Lord Justice Sir Brian Leveson, said the four days of hearings would culminate next Thursday with an all-day appearance by Prime Minister David Cameron. He will be preceded earlier in the week by two former prime ministers, Gordon Brown of Labour and the Sir John Major of the Conservative Party.Other political luminaries to appear include the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, the leader of the Labour opposition, Ed Miliband, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond.If past hearings are anything to go by, the questioning is likely to focus on the intensity and texture of their relationships with executives of News International, the British newspaper subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, based in New York, and with Mr. Murdoch himself.Mr. Cameron in particular has had close ties, according to previous testimony, with the former chief executive of News International, Rebekah Brooks, and with a former Murdoch newspaper editor, Andy Coulson, who became Mr. Cameron's director of communications both in opposition and at 10 Downing Street.Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson were forced by the phone hacking scandal to resign last year and both of them have been charged in recent weeks with criminal offenses. In late May, Mr. Coulson, 44, was charged with lying under oath in a case in Scotland and, in a separate development, Ms. Brooks has been charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.In testimony to the inquiry, Ms. Brooks said Mr. Cameron routinely signed off text messages to her with the letters ''LOL,'' which he took to mean ''lots of love,'' until she told him it meant ''laugh out loud.''In one of the more bizarre revelations of Britain's interlocked inquiries into phone hacking, political cronyism and police corruption, Mr. Cameron was forced by persistent questioning in the media in March to admit that he had once ridden a former police horse, Raisa, lent to Ms. Brooks by Scotland Yard after the horse was retired from duty in 2008.The equestrian episode seemed to reinforce a perception of cozy cross ties between politicians and News International, since Mr. Cameron and Ms. Brooks belong to what is known in Britain as the Chipping Norton set, a well-heeled social network in the countryside west of London.Mr. Cameron initially denied riding Raisa at the country mansion Ms. Brooks shares with her horse-trainer husband, Charlie Brooks, close to Mr. Cameron's private home and his official country residence, Chequers.Finally, though, he acknowledged that he had ridden the horse once while still in opposition.More portentously, the Labour opposition has assailed Mr. Cameron for displaying what it calls a lack of judgment by hiring Mr. Coulson even after it first emerged that reporters at the now defunct Murdoch Sunday tabloid, The News of the World, had intercepted voice mail messages.For his part, Mr. Brown, the former prime minister, spoke last summer of his anguish when Ms. Brooks informed him in 2006 that The Sun, a daily tabloid owned by News International, planned to print an article revealing that his 4-month-old son had cystic fibrosis. Ms. Brooks has told the Leveson inquiry that Mr. Brown and his wife, Sarah, had no objection to publication of the story.The inquiry has also focused on what seems a chummy relationship between Conservative politicians and News Corporation in another area -- the $12 billion bid by News Corporation to assume full control of Britain's leading satellite broadcaster, BSkyB. The bid was abandoned last year as a result of the phone hacking inquiry.In late May, Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt, a close associate of Mr. Cameron, told the inquiry that he had been personally sympathetic to the bid, but did not act with improper bias when he was assigned to oversee it.The relationship between Mr. Murdoch and successive British governments is an object some fascination here since his tabloid newspapers are generally seen by politicians as influencing millions of undecided voters. Mr. Murdoch's tabloids supported the Conservatives for many years, but switched to Labour before the 1997 election that brought Tony Blair of the Labour Party to power. Mr. Blair testified before the inquiry in late May.Shortly before the 2010 election, which produced a coalition led by Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg, a Liberal Democrat, as junior partner, the Murdoch tabloids switched back to the Conservatives. Both Mr. Murdoch and his son James have appeared before the inquiry to explain their side of the arrangements.In his testimony, Rupert Murdoch quoted former Prime Minister Gordon Brown as saying he would ''make war'' on Murdoch companies after the tabloids switched to the Conservatives in late 2009. But Mr. Brown responded by saying the allegation was ''wholly wrong.''This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
"Britain: Detective in Hacking Case Can't Remain Silent, Court Rules","LONDON -- A private investigator who has been a central player in Britain's phone hacking scandal lost a bid at the Supreme Court on Wednesday to remain silent about who commissioned him to intercept voice mail messages on behalf of The News of the World, Rupert Murdoch's now-defunct tabloid. The ruling, by five Supreme Court judges, could open the way to further disclosures about the names and stature of the people who supervised the investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, and possibly show the extent to which the scandal reached into the News of the World management.Mr. Mulcaire had argued that he had a right to remain silent about who commissioned him to avoid self-incrimination.The judges issued their ruling in the case of Nicola Phillips, the personal assistant to a well-known publicist, Max Clifford, who has said her voice mail was intercepted. The judges ruled that Mr. Mulcaire was not protected by the right to remain silent and had three weeks to tell Ms. Phillips who had asked him to hack her voice mail.The scandal has seared a broad path through the British press, police and political elite and forced Mr. Murdoch into key business decisions, including the closure of the 168-year-old News of the World last summer and the abandonment of a $12 billion bid to assume full control of Britain's biggest satellite broadcaster.Around 60 people have been arrested, and on Wednesday police officials said three more people had been detained in a related investigation into the corruption of public officials. Most of those arrested have not been charged and all were granted bail.In a statement, Mr. Mulcaire said he would comply with the ruling and consider ''what the wider implications of this judgment are, if and when I am asked to answer questions in other cases.''Ms. Phillips's lawyer, Mark Lewis, called the ruling a ''significant milestone'' with ''wide-ranging consequences in relation to all the phone hacking claimants and beyond.''In the initial phase of the scandal, Mr. Mulcaire and a News of the World reporter, Clive Goodman, were jailed for several months in early 2007 for illegally accessing voice mail messages in the royal household. At that time, News International, Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper subsidiary, said the hacking was the work of a single rogue reporter.But last July, the scandal mushroomed with the disclosure that the voice mail of a murdered schoolgirl had been hacked in 2002 before the police found her body. That revelation produced a wave of public revulsion and the affair came under scrutiny in three inquiries by Parliament, the police and a judicial panel led by Lord Justice Sir Brian Leveson.The inquiries have dominated British public debate, showing close ties between Murdoch executives and British politicians, including Prime Minister David Cameron. Mr. Cameron had appointed a former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, as his director of communications, and was friendly with Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International. Both have been charged with criminal offenses.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Phone-Hacking Charges Seen As a Blow to the British Scoop,"LONDON -- To many in Britain, the prosecutors' decision on Tuesday to lay criminal charges against eight of the most prominent figures in British tabloid journalism over the past decade was a dramatic step toward exacting accountability for the tangled web of wrongdoing in Rupert Murdoch's London newsrooms.But with trials pending for those now charged with conspiracy in the phone-hacking scandal -- Andy Coulson, Prime Minister David Cameron's former communications director; Rebekah Brooks, the handpicked boss of Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper empire until she resigned a year ago; five senior editors and reporters at the now-defunct, Murdoch-owned News of the World; and a private investigator -- the wider implications are increasingly pressing in.What is becoming clear, media analysts say, is that the push-the-legal-limits newsroom culture that has gone untrammeled for years at the British tabloids and has even found its way into some of the country's upmarket broadsheets, including Mr. Murdoch's Times and Sunday Times, could be a casualty of a new culture of caution. The indictments did not surprise executives at News Corporation, the New York media conglomerate that owns the British papers, who are readying the split of the company's newspapers from its more lucrative entertainment assets. The charges, in part, played into the timing of Mr. Murdoch's finally agreeing to the split, which his top lieutenants had proposed for years, a person familiar with the thinking at the company said.''You don't get an indictment like this without a lot of preliminary discussions,'' said this person, who could not comment on the record about private discussions. ''They knew exactly, exactly what was coming and how bad it would look.''Already, some who work at British newspapers say, the scandal has had a chilling effect on newsrooms, with editors, reporters and their proprietors less eager to trumpet splashy exposes that might involve, or be perceived to involve, less than ethical standards of news gathering.One tabloid journalist, who insisted on anonymity because of concern for his job, lamented what he called the end of the ''anything goes'' era. ''Before, it was a case of 'Don't tell me how you get it, just get it,' '' he said. ''Now things are looked at differently.''With the announcement of charges on Tuesday, prosecutors have shown a new willingness to pursue criminal cases against editors and reporters accused of seeking to gather information through means that were for years winked at as unsavory but tolerable, at least for Britain: paying the police and public figures for scoops, and hacking into cellphone voice messages of politicians, celebrities and other people in the news for the salacious gossip that is the currency of mass-circulation dailies.Mr. Coulson and Ms. Brooks, both former editors of The News of the World, and the six others charged on Tuesday face possible prison terms of up to two years if convicted. All eight have vigorously denied the charges, with some suggesting that they are the victims of public and political hysteria, and have vowed to fight the indictments in court.Few in Britain have not been shocked by the revelations that have tumbled out of the scandal in the past year: not just the industrial-scale phone hacking, but also checkbook journalism that is alleged to have included payments rising into the tens of thousands of dollars to public officials, including police and prison officers, and a cover-up that prosecutors say persisted long after the heat of public anger was focused on the miscreants. Together, prosecutors say, it is a tally of wrongdoing that is likely to yield many more criminal cases in the months ahead.Media critics say the legacy of the ''yellow journalism'' of turn-of-the-20th-century America has migrated in recent decades to Fleet Street, the traditional home in London of many of Britain's most powerful papers. Many editors and reporters nurtured in that culture have migrated abroad, some of them to Murdoch-owned papers in America, Australia and elsewhere, taking their no-holds-barred attitudes with them.Some critics say Mr. Murdoch's London tabloids, The Sun and The News of the World, and rivals here that compete for the same scoop-hungry readership of millions, have set a grim and degrading standard of journalism that will not be missed.But that style of journalism has its defenders, including influential voices who have warned that the opprobrium now focused on the tabloids, and on Mr. Murdoch personally, carries its own risk of excess. In newspaper columns, and in testimony at the public inquiry presided over by Lord Justice Sir Brian Leveson, they have argued against imposing statutory restraints to quiet the tabloids and protect secrets -- personal, political and corporate -- that only an irreverent press is likely to ferret out.One who has taken this view is Ken Clarke, a Conservative who is justice minister in Mr. Cameron's cabinet. At the Leveson inquiry last month, he provoked condemnation by warning of the ''chilling effect'' of some of the testimony before the panel, and said new statutory controls on the press were not necessary.Chris Blackhurst, editor of The Independent, a left-of-center paper that escaped taint during the scandal, took a similar view. In an interview, he called the criminal charges ''a shaming day for British journalism,'' but defended some of the tabloids' practices, saying that in some cases lawbreaking by journalists was defensible. ''The Independent hasn't hacked anyone's phone, but there might be a case where we felt that we had to,'' he said.Besides shaking Mr. Murdoch's global empire to its core, the British scandal has forced News Corporation to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs, out-of-court settlements and payoffs to employees who have been laid off, Mr. Murdoch testified this year before the Leveson panel.And that price, analysts say, is likely to exceed a billion dollars as lawsuits and settlements proliferate. Alison Levitt, chief legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service, traced the scope of what lies ahead with a broad account on Tuesday of the number of confirmed victims of the phone hacking -- more than 600, by the prosecutors' count.Sue Akers, the senior Scotland Yard officer overseeing the police investigations, told the Leveson inquiry on Monday that the police had notified 2,615 people that they may have been targets of the voice-mail interceptions. So far, only about 40 of those known to have been victims of the practice have settled their lawsuits against the Murdoch papers, with at least one of the settlements exceeding $1 million.Among the well-known figures given by Ms. Levitt as having been targeted in the phone hacking were Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie; Paul McCartney and his former wife, Heather Mills; the actresses Sienna Miller and Sadie Frost; and Wayne Rooney, perhaps Britain's best-known professional soccer player.The sensitivity among prosecutors to the political context of the phone hacking was suggested by the emphasis that Ms. Levitt, outlining the criminal charges, gave to the case of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old schoolgirl who disappeared in 2002 and was found murdered. Police have said her cellphone was hacked when she was the subject of a police hunt.The episode prompted Ms. Brooks's resignation and led Mr. Murdoch to apologize personally to Milly's parents -- and to offer a settlement that was reported at the time to run into several million dollars. It also precipitated a parliamentary inquiry, and the decision by Mr. Cameron to impanel the Leveson hearings.Six of the eight people charged are accused of involvement in the hacking of the schoolgirl's phone. In addition to Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson, they included three others who worked in senior newsroom positions at The News of the World: Stuart Kuttner, a former managing editor; Greg Miskiw, another senior editor; and Neville Thurlbeck, the paper's longtime chief reporter. Also on the ''Dowler list'' is Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator. Two other News of the World editors who were charged in the phone hacking, but not in the Dowler case, were Ian Edmondson and James Weatherup. "
Church of England Sells News Corp. Stake Over Hacking,"PARIS -- The Church of England has decided thou shalt not listen to the mobile phone messages of others.The church said Tuesday that it had sold its £1.9 million, or nearly $3 million, stake in News Corp., citing ethical qualms stemming from the phone hacking scandal that continues to roil the company.The church, which began buying shares in News Corp. in 2005, said it had raised its concerns with the company last year after the scandal intensified, with reports that journalists at The News of the World had hacked the mobile phone of a murdered 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler. ''The Church of England was not satisfied that News Corp. had shown, or is likely in the immediate future to show, a commitment to implement necessary corporate governance reform,'' the church said in a statement.Steve Jenkins, a spokesman, said the church wanted the company to separate the jobs of chairman and chief executive, which are both held by Rupert Murdoch, believing that an independent, outside chairman could serve as a moral compass.The church echoed concerns raised by Christian Brothers Investment Services, a fund based in New York that manages $4 billion on behalf of Catholic dioceses and other groups. Christian Brothers in April filed a shareholder resolution calling for News Corp. to appoint an independent chairman, citing ''lax ethical culture and a lack of effective board oversight.''Julie Tanner, the assistant director of socially responsible investing at Christian Brothers, said: ''Shareholders are waiting for some action from the board on how they are going to deal with these corporate governance lapses. I think the Church of England's move is a significant one.''For now, Christian Brothers has held on to its stake. Analysts said the move by the Church of England, which has more than £8 billion under management, was unusual because ethical investors often use stakes in companies as leverage to get their issues on annual meeting agendas.''Our feeling on this kind of thing in general is that it's not necessarily the best thing to pull your money out,'' said Matthew Butcher, a spokesman for FairPensions, a group that campaigns for socially responsible investing. ''It's usually better to engage with them. But it does sound like the Church of England has been engaging with them for quite a while without any results.''The sale of the stake, equal to less than one one-hundredth of 1 percent of News Corp.'s market value of about $58 billion, is unlikely to have a direct financial impact on the company. On Tuesday, its shares were up slightly in afternoon trading.Still, the public scolding puts News Corp. in unusual company for a media organization.The last time that the church made a similar move was in 2010, when it sold its stake in Vedanta Resources, a mining company, citing concerns about allegations of human rights violations in India.The church said that its investment guidelines ban it from taking stakes in companies that provide military products or services, pornography, alcohol, gambling, tobacco, human embryonic cloning or high-interest-rate lending.News Corp. declined to comment.The church's move raises pressure on the company as a potentially raucous annual meeting, scheduled for October, draws near. In addition to the religious organizations, a powerful group of other institutional investors have complained about News Corp.'s governance. Among their concerns are Mr. Murdoch's dual role and the company's two-tier shareholding structure, which gives the Murdoch family voting control disproportionate to the size of its financial stake.News Corp. has already announced plans to split itself into separate entertainment and publishing companies, with Mr. Murdoch remaining chairman of both and chief executive of the entertainment business, though not of the publishing entity. The company's stock price has risen sharply since news emerged in June that the company was considering a split.The British authorities are charging Andy Coulson, a former aide to Prime Minister David Cameron; Rebekah Brooks, the former chief of News Corp.'s British newspaper arm; and six others over their roles in the hacking scandal. "
New Arrest Amid Inquiry On Hacking,"LONDON -- Police officials investigating phone hacking by journalists at Rupert Murdoch's British newspapers arrested a man on Thursday who was identified in news reports as Tom Crone, a former senior lawyer for the newspapers. Scotland Yard said in a statement that officers in London were questioning a 60-year-old man ''on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications.'' The police did not release the man's name, but he was widely identified by British news outlets.The arrest brings the scandal over allegations of illegal interceptions of voice mail messages and other improprieties at the newspapers -- especially The News of the World, the tabloid that Mr. Murdoch shut down last year -- closer to Mr. Murdoch's son James. He headed the British newspaper business until recently, and has been locked in a public dispute with Mr. Crone and with Colin Myler, the former editor of The News of the World.In testimony before public inquiries and in statements to reporters, the two men have insisted that in the summer of 2008, when they were facing a lawsuit claiming that phone hacking was widespread at the paper, they informed James Murdoch at a meeting and in an e-mail that criminality in the newsroom was not limited to one or two rogue employees.Mr. Murdoch has said that he did not read the e-mail, and he disputes the men's account of their meeting. He has said that he agreed to settle the lawsuit by authorizing a large payment to the plaintiffs only because it made financial sense to do so, not as part of a cover-up. When a wave of additional phone hacking allegations emerged last year and stoked public outrage, Rupert Murdoch shut down The News of the World.A spokeswoman for News International, the British newspaper arm of the Murdoch empire, said Thursday that it had no comment on the arrest.Scotland Yard said in a statement that the man it arrested Thursday -- the one that British news outlets said was Mr. Crone -- was not accused of obstructing justice, a charge leveled at some other former Murdoch executives. But a former colleague, who did not want to be named discussing a continuing police investigation, said that the arrest would probably cause concern within Mr. Murdoch's companies.''He was at the middle of every meeting and discussion,'' the former colleague said of Mr. Crone. ''He's the last person you'd want to start talking if you wanted this all to go away.''Mr. Crone did not immediately respond to a voice mail message seeking comment. "
Ruling Lets Murdoch Keep British Broadcasting License,"More than a year after a phone hacking crisis in Britain engulfed Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the embattled media company received a clean bill of corporate health on Thursday from a critical British regulator.Britain's Office of Communications, known as Ofcom, said Thursday that British Sky Broadcasting, 39.1 percent owned by News Corporation, was ''fit and proper'' to hold a broadcast license. The ruling, which was a result of an investigation by the regulators that lasted months, relieves the company from an expensive legal fight to maintain its broadcast license.More important, it helps allay concerns that had spread within the company that an unfavorable Ofcom ruling could have prompted further scrutiny in the United States by the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission that could have affected News Corporation's domestic television assets.There are still many hurdles for News Corporation in Britain: the hacking scandals set off several inquiries into the company's use of phone hacking and its connections to the police, criminal trials for several senior company executives will begin next year, and 174 new civil claims were filed ahead of a court deadline last Friday. But the relief over the ruling was palpable at corporate headquarters in New York and London. One company official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal conversations said executives should not declare victory just yet.''Only an idiot would say it was over,'' the official said of the scandal. ''But it's not as panicked as it was.''In a sign that the company feels less restrained by British scrutiny, James Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch's son and News Corporation's deputy chief operating officer, is expected to take an expanded role within the company.James was in charge of the company's British holdings when the hacking was revealed, and the Ofcom report was critical of his performance, saying that he ''repeatedly fell short'' in his response to the illegal activities at the company's News of the World tabloid. In April, James resigned as head of BSkyB, and his future at News Corporation seemed uncertain.However, a person close to News Corporation confirmed a Financial Times report that James Murdoch's job could be expanded to oversee the Fox Networks Group, a Los Angeles-based unit that includes Fox Broadcasting and Fox's regional sports channels.In July, News Corporation named Peter Rice, a longtime entertainment executive and friend of James Murdoch's, chairman and chief executive of the group. Mr. Rice would report to James Murdoch.Although News Corporation plays down the impact of phone hacking on its broader corporate strategy, it is evident that the media conglomerate has emerged a transformed company with a different raison d'être, one less driven by Rupert Murdoch's whims and no longer the acquisition-heavy dealmaker it once was.It has already announced plans to split its publishing business -- including newspapers like The Wall Street Journal, The Times of London and The New York Post -- into a publicly traded company separate from more lucrative entertainment assets like FX and Fox News. There has since been a steady reshuffling of executives within the company as it prepares for the split.''It feels a little like Big Brother is watching, and that's keeping everybody in check,'' said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Before the phone hacking scandal distracted his ambitions, Mr. Murdoch had pushed a $12 billion bid to acquire the remaining shares of BSkyB. The findings open up the possibility of News Corporation's revisiting its bid for the remainder, though that is unlikely to happen in the next year or two, said a person close to the company who could not discuss its strategy for attribution.Chase Carey, News Corporation's chief operating officer, said on a recent conference call with analysts: ''We're not going to put a time frame on it. We like that investment. We like that business. We tried to buy that business. It's an indication of our commitment.''Mr. Murdoch has signaled that he would personally prefer to take his business elsewhere. In an interview with the Fox Business channel in June, Mr. Murdoch said he would move on from the once-coveted BSkyB.''That was billions and billions of dollars, and if Britain doesn't want them, we'll find a place to put them here,'' he said. He added, ''I'm much more bullish in America than I am in Britain.'' When asked whether that was because of the financial crisis sweeping Europe, he responded, ''No, it's just the English.''Even with aggressive stock buybacks, News Corporation had $9.6 billion in cash on hand in the fiscal year that ended June 30. That stockpile has led analysts and investors to wonder whether the company is contemplating another BSkyB bid.''What could they possibly be saving the cash for?'' asked Todd Juenger, an analyst at Bernstein Research. ''The preponderance of evidence suggests to us that they really do believe they can take another run at BSY in the not-too-distant future.''News Corporation praised Ofcom's decision and denounced parts of its report that criticized James Murdoch and questioned his ''competence'' in his handling of the hacking scandal, which exploded last July at News of the World.''We are also pleased that Ofcom determined that the evidence related to phone hacking, concealment and corruption does not provide any basis to conclude that News Corporation and Rupert Murdoch acted in a way that was inappropriate,'' the company said in a statement.The company added: ''We disagree, however, with certain of the report's statements about James Murdoch's prior actions as an executive and director, which are not at all substantiated by evidence.''James Murdoch feels his reputation has been battered by events in London, friends have said, and is seeking to rebuild it in the United States. Eager to move beyond the hacking scandal and out of his father's shadow, he has had meetings with at least one American new media company in recent months to discuss a board or advisory position, said one person present at a meeting.The findings come at a critical time for News Corporation as it readies for its annual shareholder meeting. Next month, investors will gather at the company's Fox Studio lot in Los Angeles under heavy security to confront Mr. Murdoch about ''inadequate oversight and maintenance of corporate culture'' and a board that ''despite the enormity of this scandal'' had ''failed to take action against any senior executives,'' according to company documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.''Look at how Ofcom criticized James Murdoch, and it's evident that this isn't necessarily a closed book and that can of worms might be reopened,'' said Laura Campos, director of shareholder activities at the Nathan Cummings Foundation, which owns 3,686 shares of News Corporation's Class B voting shares.In Britain, the hacking scandal has moved beyond the chaos of its initial revelations, but the company still has much to be wary about. The judge overseeing the civil claims, Geoffrey Vos, is eager to see at least some cases reach open court, with the attendant possibility of damaging revelations, said one person with knowledge of the court process.Three police investigations, into allegations of payments to public officials and phone and computer hacking, also continue.

Britain: Hearing in Phone Hacking Case,"LONDON -- Two of the most senior former executives at newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch, both once close to Prime Minister David Cameron, appeared at the Old Bailey courthouse in central London on Wednesday facing charges relating to the phone hacking scandal convulsing parts of the British press. At a brief hearing, a judge set Sept. 9, 2013, as the starting date for a full trial after other preliminary procedures. Five other journalists and a private investigator are accused along with them on various charges.The best-known figures in the case are Rebekah Brooks, who was once the chief executive of Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper outpost, and Andy Coulson, a former editor of Mr. Murdoch's News of the World Sunday tabloid who went on to become Mr. Cameron's director of communications.The accused spoke only to confirm their identities at the hearing on Wednesday and remained free on bail.For months, the police have been pursuing a variety of investigations of scores of journalists and managers into accusations, including phone hacking, conspiring conspiracy to hide evidence and corrupting public officials.Additionally, scores of entertainment and sporting personalities have started civil proceedings seeking compensation for the unlawful interception of personal voice mail messages.The scandal has thrown an unaccustomed spotlight onto the way the British press operates, showing a cozy relationship between journalists, police officers and the political elite while raising questions about Mr. Cameron's judgment in hiring Mr. Coulson.Mr. Coulson faces charges that he conspired to intercept voice mail. Mr. Cameron hired Mr. Coulson before he became prime minister but kept him on as communications chief after the Conservative victory in the 2010 election.As the hacking scandal widened, Mr. Cameron initially stood by Mr. Coulson, but disclosures about illicit phone intercepts continued. Mr. Coulson resigned from his government post in January 2011, saying the scandal was distracting him from his work at 10 Downing Street.In July 2011, Mr. Coulson was arrested and questioned by the police in England on suspicion of phone hacking and of illegally paying officials for information. In May this year, he was arrested by the Scottish police in a separate case and charged with lying under oath about whether he knew phone hacking was going on at The News of the World.In a parallel case, Ms. Brooks, 44, faces three charges of conspiring to pervert the course of justice.Prosecutors accuse her and her husband, Charlie Brooks, a racehorse trainer, of concealing material from police officers. Several former members of her staff also face charges. She has denied phone hacking charges.Ms. Brooks was once among the most influential people in British journalism, at different times editing two of Mr. Murdoch's mass circulation tabloids, running his operations here and in close touch with Mr. Cameron.The five other journalists from The News of the World Sunday tabloid, which Mr. Murdoch ordered closed as a result of the scandal, face accusations relating to the hacking scandal, along with Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator.For many years, executives at News International insisted that phone hacking was the work of a single rogue reporter. In early 2007, Clive Goodman, a journalist who covered the royal family for The News of the World, was sentenced to four months in prison for hacking into royal officials' voice mail in 2005 and 2006. At that time, Mr. Mulcaire was also sentenced to six months in jail.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Police Official Accused of Leak to Tabloid Newspaper in British Phone Hacking Scandal,"LONDON -- A senior Scotland Yard detective was accused in court on Monday of illegally leaking information to a tabloid newspaper about a 2010 police inquiry into phone hacking. The officer, Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn, was charged with misconduct in public office and with violating the Official Secrets Act. She is the first person so far to be charged in an investigation of corrupt payments to the police and other public officials by journalists. More than 50 other people have been arrested on suspicion of making or receiving payments, but none have been charged.Ms. Casburn, 53, is accused of contacting The News of the World, the weekly paper at the center of the scandal over illegal eavesdropping on private phone messages and other practices, in September 2010, and offering information about Operation Varec, a police inquiry into whether a closed investigation into the practices should be reopened. The police did reopen the investigation several months later.She is also accused of keeping secret documents at home without permission. It was unclear what kind of documents the accusations referred to, or whether they are connected to the misconduct allegations.The charges are significant because, if proved true, they would illustrate the longtime symbiotic coziness between the police and journalists at The News of the World, which was owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Mr. Murdoch closed the paper in July 2011 after it became clear that its reporters and editors had routinely broken into the voice mail messages of public officials and people in the news, including Milly Dowler, a teenager who was abducted and killed.Several investigations related to the scandal are under way, including one of phone hacking at The News of the World and The Sun, another Murdoch tabloid. More than 20 people have been arrested in that investigation, and several have been charged, including Andy Coulson, a former News of the World editor who was the chief spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron, and Rebekah Brooks, a former editor and chief executive of News International, the British newspaper arm of News Corporation. Mr. Coulson and Ms. Brooks are scheduled for trial next fall.At Monday's hearing in Westminster Magistrates' Court, Ms. Casburn did not offer a plea.She has been suspended from her duties at Scotland Yard, where she worked alongside officers investigating phone hacking, according to the BBC.

"As It Emerges From Scandal, News Corp. Looks to Buy Again","News Corporation is starting to look like its old self again.The media conglomerate, which had been on its heels for more than a year because of the phone hacking scandal in Britain, is looking to make acquisitions again. First on the list could be a 49 percent stake in the Yes Network in New York, a purchase that could aid in the formation of a new nationwide sports network to compete with ESPN.News Corporation's stock has reached highs as the company prepares to transfer its underperforming publishing assets, including newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, into a separate publicly traded entity.One of the crucial factors in the decision was that the split would allow Rupert Murdoch, the company's chairman and chief executive, to buy into the businesses he loves without upsetting investors who are more interested in cable and broadcast. Potential targets include The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune and more education companies. ''Rupert has his mojo back,'' said Todd Juenger, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''The stock is up, investors are happy with the company's recent decisions.''''He is definitely rubbing his hands together,'' a person with knowledge of News Corporation's deal-making discussions said of Mr. Murdoch.In the last several weeks, Mr. Murdoch has exuded a satisfaction and sure-footedness that people close to the company said they had not seen since before Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper unit became embroiled in a phone hacking scandal. That is in part because hacking has been overtaken in the press by an unfolding scandal at the British Broadcasting Corporation.The BBC, which Mr. Murdoch and his son James have frequently criticized, is accused of canceling a news program's segment about serial child molesting committed by longtime host Jimmy Savile, and broadcasting false reports of pedophilia about a member of Margaret Thatcher's administration.People close to Mr. Murdoch said he considered the BBC scandal karmic justice for months of negative coverage of News Corporation, and he has provided almost daily commentary via Twitter. ''BBC getting into deeper mess,'' he wrote on Nov. 10. ''After Savile scandal, now prominent news program falsely names senior pol as pedophile.''And the BBC scandal touches another Murdoch rival -- The New York Times, whose parent company's new chief executive, Mark Thompson, served as director general at the BBC. Mr. Thompson's replacement at the BBC, George Entwistle, resigned on Nov. 11 after just 54 days on the job. ''Look to new CEO to shape up NYT unless recalled to BBC to explain latest scandal,'' Mr. Murdoch wrote on Twitter last month.As News Corporation sank into its hacking scandal last year, it delayed new acquisitions. In September, Britain's Office of Communications, known as Ofcom, said that British Sky Broadcasting, 39.1 percent owned by News Corporation, was ''fit and proper'' to hold a broadcast license. The decision removed a cloud of uncertainty at News Corporation's Manhattan headquarters and cleared the company to revisit deals, analysts said.''The internal narrative at the company is that the boss is in shopping mode,'' said one person close to News Corporation who could not discuss Mr. Murdoch's thinking publicly.Dropping its $12 billion bid for the portion of BSkyB that it did not already own gave News Corporation ample cash to complete share buybacks and consider other acquisitions. The company had $9.6 billion in cash at the end of its 2012 fiscal year and in September borrowed another $1 billion.On a recent earnings call, Chase Carey, News Corporation's president and chief operating officer, said: ''We always seem to be the topic of the day when it comes to a rumor of some transaction.'' Still, he added: ''There are places where we think we should kick the tires on things.''Last week News Corporation neared a deal with Yankees Global Enterprises to buy a 49 percent stake in the Yes Network, a regional New York sports network with a valuation of about $3 billion. A stake in Yes would add to News Corporation's lineup of regional sports channels and contribute to its reported plans to introduce a national cable sports channel that could take on the Walt Disney Company's ESPN.''It's one of the only businesses where there's no No. 2,'' said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at Nomura Securities. ''In our view, sports is the safest asset in media.''This month the company paid an estimated $250 million for the portion of ESPN Star Sports that it did not already own. ESPN Star Sports, based in Singapore, operates 17 sports networks in five languages around Asia.Then there are publishing assets that the 81-year-old Mr. Murdoch has long coveted, like The Los Angeles Times. Its owner, the bankrupt Tribune Company, is looking for a buyer for its struggling newspapers, including The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune.Julie Henderson, a spokeswoman for News Corporation, called recent reports that News Corporation was in talks with Tribune Company and The Los Angeles Times ''wholly inaccurate.'' News Corporation's last major acquisition, of Dow Jones & Company, publisher of The Journal and Barron's, for $5.6 billion in 2007, was unpopular among investors.But the structure of the coming split of News Corporation could give Mr. Murdoch considerable resources to indulge his love of newspapers. While the final details of the split won't be announced until next month, News Corporation has arranged for its sluggish publishing division to be bolstered by Australian pay television assets, which will make up the bulk of the earnings in the newly formed company. In Australia, the company recently paid $2.01 billion to increase its stake in Australia's dominant pay TV provider, Foxtel.''All of the Australian assets go into the split-off company,'' Mr. Murdoch said in June. ''It is just a lot simpler.''That structure also gives the company's hard-hit newspapers a financial safety net and Mr. Murdoch capital. Mr. Carey, News Corporation's president, has said the company will invest in its fledgling education division. Run by a former New York City schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, the education group, called Amplify, will be part of the new company.Last month, News Corporation explored a $1.6 billion cash offer for Pearson's Penguin publishing house. Penguin ultimately merged with Bertelsmann's Random House. But News Corporation's interest raised questions about other acquisitions that would bring scale to its HarperCollins book division, also part of the publishing company.''He'll have the currency'' to do whatever he wants, said a person who discussed the split plan with Mr. Murdoch. "
Two Former Top Murdoch Aides Will Be Charged With Bribery of Public Officials,"LONDON -- In a new turn in the scandals swirling around Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper outpost, prosecutors said on Tuesday that two former top executives would be charged with paying bribes of up to $160,000 to public officials, in addition to several earlier charges against them.The Crown Prosecution Service identified the onetime aides as Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, both of whom have had close personal or professional ties to Prime Minister David Cameron. Mr. Cameron hired Mr. Coulson as his director of communications while in opposition and kept him on after coming to power in the 2010 elections. On Tuesday, Mr. Coulson, 44, a former editor of a Murdoch tabloid, The News of the World, denied two charges relating to periods before he joined Mr. Cameron's staff in 2007 and said he would fight them in court.Ms. Brooks, 44, who is accused of conspiring with another journalist to pay $160,000 over seven years to a Defense Ministry official, was a neighbor and personal friend of Mr. Cameron.In one of several inquiries into the hacking scandal, she testified in May that she and Mr. Cameron kept in touch by telephone, text message and e-mail, meeting at lunches and dinners and socializing at parties, summer outings and Christmas celebrations.The charge of bribing a Defense Ministry official is potentially the most serious of all those drawn up by prosecutors so far in the scandal that has enveloped the Murdoch media empire in Britain.Under a new bribery act passed by Parliament in 2010, described by British legal experts as one of the toughest statutes of its kind anywhere, the maximum penalty for bribing a public official or receiving a bribe is 10 years in prison and an unlimited fine, but the statute also provides for much lesser penalties.The accusations seem certain to precipitate a new debate about the practice known in Britain as ''checkbook journalism,'' common for many years, under which editors, reporters and investigators have paid sources clandestinely for information or provided them with other benefits. A defense often made of the practice has been that the information obtained in this way serves the public interest, particularly when a resulting article exposes waste or dishonesty in public office.The Crown Prosecution Service said on Tuesday that Mr. Coulson and Ms. Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, the British newspaper subsidiary of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, were among five people to be charged as part of a police inquiry called Operation Elveden. The investigation ran in parallel with other investigations related to a phone hacking scandal that led to the closing of The News of the World.Among the five were Clive Goodman, a former royalty correspondent at The News of the World, who served a brief jail term in 2007 for hacking into voice mail accounts in the royal household. A sixth potential suspect, apparently a public official, is still being investigated.Mr. Coulson was deputy editor of The News of the World from 2000 to 2003 and editor from 2003 to 2007, when he became Mr. Cameron's spokesman. He resigned from that post in 2011 as the hacking scandal intensified. The charges against him relate to two periods between August 2002 and January 2003 and January and June of 2005, before he joined Mr. Cameron's office, the prosecutors said.When he hired Mr. Coulson, Mr. Cameron said he accepted his aide's assurances that he was not involved in any criminal wrongdoing while editing The News of the World. But the Labour opposition has frequently accused Mr. Cameron of poor judgment for taking him on and defending him before he quit.Ms. Brooks, who was editor of The Sun tabloid from 2003 to 2009, will face charges along with John Kay, the newspaper's chief reporter from 1990 to 2011, and an employee of the Defense Ministry, Bettina Jordan-Barber.Ms. Brooks is among a group of former Murdoch employees who are to face trial next year on charges related to the scandals.Altogether, more than 50 former newspaper executives, lawyers, editors, reporters and investigators have been arrested and questioned in extensive police inquiries.Before her fall, Ms. Brooks was a close confidante of Mr. Murdoch and one of the most powerful figures in the British news media. Over nearly 20 years with the company, she rose rapidly to become editor of The News of the World, a weekly, and later of The Sun, Britain's most widely circulated daily paper, before being promoted to chief executive of News International in 2009. "
British Lawmakers Warn Against Press Restrictions,"LONDON -- On the eve of a major report on Britain's phone hacking scandal that editors and journalists fear could lead to statutory regulation of the press, a group of more than 80 British lawmakers on Wednesday opened a defense of press freedom, which, they said, would be undermined by new laws enforcing controls on newspapers.''As parliamentarians, we believe in free speech and are opposed to the imposition of any form of statutory control even if it is dressed up as underpinning,'' the group of 86 legislators, who were from the three main parties and both houses of Parliament, said in a letter published in The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph. The letter appeared the same day a van pulled up at 10 Downing Street with Prime Minister David Cameron's personal copy of the lengthy report, which has emerged from nine months of hearings conducted by Lord Justice Sir Brian Leveson after the hacking scandal that focused primarily on Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper subsidiary.The document, to be made public on Thursday, is likely to stoke furious debate within the divided political elite about the future of press controls. These are currently based on a loose, voluntary system of self-regulation administered by the newspaper industry through a body known as the Press Complaints Commission, which many lawmakers and a cross section of newspaper editors believe has for years been woefully ineffective.But the furor that swept the country in the wake of the hacking scandal, and revelations of other criminal wrongdoing in newspaper newsrooms, particularly by mass-circulation tabloids, has fostered what some of the harshest critics of the industry have described as a ''once in a lifetime'' opportunity to rein in the newspapers and end a culture of rambunctious, no-holds-barred journalism that has had few equals in the world.These critics have argued for statutory regulation, hoping that public disgust with tabloid excesses has created political momentum that Mr. Cameron and other political leaders will be reluctant to withstand. Advocates of such a statutory remedy have widespread political support, including from dozens of lawmakers in Mr. Cameron's Conservative Party.One sign of pressure came this month when Mr. Cameron received a delegation from Hacked Off, a group that includes some of the most highly publicized victims of the tabloid hacking, among them Hugh Grant, the actor, and the parents of Milly Dowler, a teenage murder victim whose phone messages were intercepted by the Murdoch-owned News of the World before her body was discovered.In response, the newspaper industry has come up with its own recommendations for a tighter system of self-regulation that would not require new laws. One proposal, which has won broad support, has come from two peers who have been pillars of the existing complaints commission: Lord David Hunt and Lord Guy Black.They have proposed a new complaints body, financed by the newspaper industry, with much broader powers, including an expanded staff capable of conducting thorough investigations, and the power to levy mandatory fines of up to $1.6 million against offending newspapers.''At the moment, it is like the Wild West out there. We need to appoint a sheriff,'' Lord Hunt said when outlining the proposals.Opposition to statutory controls has come from some of the country's most prominent politicians, including Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, who is widely viewed as a potential successor to Mr. Cameron as leader of the Conservative Party.''M.P.s, don't you for a minute think about regulating the press in this country, which has been free for 300 years,'' Mr. Johnson told an audience in London last week. He added, in defense of the tabloids, ''To rinse the gutters of public life you need a gutter press.' ''In their letter, lawmakers opposing statutory controls said that no form of ''statutory regulation of the press would be possible without the imposition of state licensing -- abolished in Britain in 1695.''''State licensing is inimical to any idea of press freedom,'' the letter said, ''and would radically alter the balance of our unwritten constitution.''Mr. Cameron, whose cabinet is divided over the issue, trod warily in the House of Commons on Wednesday, avoiding anything that committed him to one side or the other of the issue, or hinting at what the Leveson report will recommend. But he emphasized that change was essential.''Whatever the changes we make, we want a robust and free press in our country,'' he said. ''One of the key things that the Leveson inquiry is trying to get to the bottom of is how you can have a strong, independent regulatory system so you don't have to wait for the wheels of the criminal justice system or the libel system to work.''He added, ''People should be able to rely on a good regulatory system as well to get the sort of redress they want, whether that is prominent apologies or fines for newspapers or the other things that are clearly so necessary.'' "
News Corp. Gives Details On Its Corporate Split,"8:15 p.m. | Updated A phone hacking scandal and restless shareholders may have forced Rupert Murdoch to split News Corporation into two companies, but on Monday he celebrated the decision by pouring Veuve Clicquot Champagne over the head of his newest editor.Standing in The Wall Street Journal's newsroom on the sixth floor of News Corporation's New York headquarters, Mr. Murdoch, chairman and chief executive, toasted Gerard Baker. Mr. Baker will take over as managing editor of The Wall Street Journal and editor in chief of Dow Jones & Company, positions held by Robert Thomson, who was named chief executive of the separate publishing company. The publishing company will retain the name News Corporation and will consist of newspapers, including The Journal and The New York Post, and HarperCollins. Mr. Murdoch will serve as chairman.The bigger company will be called Fox Group and will include Fox Broadcasting, 20th Century Fox and cable channels like Fox News and FX. Chase Carey, News Corporation's president and chief operating officer, will maintain that title at Fox Group. Mr. Murdoch will serve as chief executive and chairman and his youngest son, James R. Murdoch, who left his post in Britain in the midst of the phone hacking scandal, will serve as Fox Group's deputy chief operating officer.The companies' names serve as a reminder of how News Corporation has evolved over the years. The fast-growing cable television businesses led by Fox News have largely driven profits, while the mature newspapers faced industrywide headwinds and, more recently, the phone hacking scandal.But Mr. Murdoch, who built his company from a single paper in Adelaide, Australia, has for years defended print. That the company will retain the News Corporation name underscored that newspapers, not cable television, represent the company's emotional, if not financial, roots.In a memo to the staff on Monday, Mr. Murdoch reaffirmed his connection to newspapers. ""Many of you know that a belief in the power of the written word has been in my bones for my entire life,"" he said. ""My personal mission is to serve and satisfy the human need for insight as well as I possibly can.""At the same time, the company announced it would shutter one of its publications. The Daily, a tablet-only news outlet introduced with much fanfare less than two years ago, will cease publication on Dec. 15. At The Daily's introduction in February 2011 in New York, Mr. Murdoch stood on stage with an Apple executive, Eddy Cue, who said the publication would ""redefine the news."" But The Daily never matched its high expectations.""From its launch, The Daily was a bold experiment in digital publishing,"" Mr. Murdoch said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, our experience was that we could not find a large enough audience quickly enough to convince us the business model was sustainable long-term.""Jesse Angelo, editor in chief of The Daily, will become publisher of The New York Post, where he served as executive editor. Greg Clayman, The Daily's publisher, will oversee the larger publishing company's global digital strategy. The company said some additional Daily employees would be absorbed by The Post.Mr. Thomson will soon oversee a publishing company that could buy more papers, while investing in video and new forms of digital distribution. Lucrative pay-television assets in Australia are expected to drive revenues in the new News Corporation. ""Rupert has been the driving force behind the renaissance of The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones,"" Mr. Thomson said in a statement. ""Our goal is to make the new News Corp. far more than the sum of its distinguished parts.""Doug Mitchelson, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: ""I think certainly a benefit of the spinoff is that mergers and acquisition risk related to newspapers or education would be isolated at the smaller publishing entity.""Mr. Baker, who will replace Mr. Thomson, is deputy editor in chief at The Journal and was a columnist at the Times of London. He also served as Washington bureau chief at The Financial Times, where Mr. Thomson oversaw the United States edition.Tom Mockridge, chief executive of News Corporation's British publishing unit, News International, had also been considered a candidate to run the new publishing company. On Sunday, when reports emerged that Mr. Thomson would be named chief executive, Mr. Mockridge resigned.Mr. Mockridge stepped in at News International in July 2011 to replace Rebekah Brooks. Ms. Brooks and several other top Murdoch lieutenants had been arrested on charges of illegal phone hacking and conspiracy at the company's British tabloids. In a letter to the staff on Monday, Mr. Mockridge said that after 22 years at News Corporation, the new structure ""does not offer me a role I am comfortable with.""News Corporation is expected to announce more details about both companies, including their capital structures, by the end of the year. The separation is expected to be complete by mid-2013.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
British Editors Urged to Set Up Regulator,"LONDON -- Under heavy pressure from the victims of Britain's phone hacking scandal, Prime Minister David Cameron met with the country's top newspaper editors on Tuesday and told them ''the clock is ticking'' on their pledge to adopt a tough new system of press regulation of their own devising if they are to avoid demands by the hacking victims and many lawmakers for a new regulatory system backed by parliamentary statute.After the meeting at 10 Downing Street, a Twitter post in Mr. Cameron's name said he had told the editors, representing most of Britain's main national newspapers, that ''they need to set up an independent regulator urgently,'' with the implication that the government might otherwise have to bow to demands for a law to put teeth into a new system of accountability. The meeting between the prime minister and the editors came five days after a long-running inquiry into phone hacking and other potentially criminal activities by British newspapers published a 2,000-page report that gave as its principal recommendation the creation of an independent, self-regulatory body backed by law to replace the largely discredited Press Complaints Commission.The report, by Lord Justice Sir Brian Leveson, set off an acrimonious dispute between those who are deeply wary of the implications for press freedom in Britain if Parliament passes a new law, and others who argue that the newspapers -- particularly the country's rambunctious mass-circulation tabloids -- have demonstrated that parliamentary action is the only way to ensure compliance with the new, independent regulatory measure that both sides in the dispute say is needed.The dispute poses a potentially serious political challenge for Mr. Cameron, on top of a host of others confronting his coalition government at the midway point in its five-year term. Although most of the country's newspapers and many influential commentators have applauded him for resisting the Leveson report's call for a new system backed by statute, a powerful groundswell in public opinion has been stirred by a lobby group led by some of the best-known victims of tabloid intrusion, who have said that the tabloids have been ''drinking in the 'last chance saloon' '' for too long and need the threat of a new law to curb their excesses.Mr. Cameron indicated after the Downing Street meeting that he had admonished the newspaper editors not to delay in embracing a tough new system of accountability along the lines of Lord Justice Leveson's proposals. ''They've got to do it in a way that absolutely meets the requirements of Lord Justice Leveson's report,'' he told BBC television. ''That means million-pound fines, proper investigation of complaints, prominent apologies and a tough independent regulatory system.''''And they know, because I told them, the clock is ticking for this to be sorted out,'' he said.His warning reinforced one that Maria Miller, the culture secretary in the Cameron government, gave on Monday in the House of Commons, when she said that if the newspaper industry failed to agree on a stricter system or sought to introduce a ''puppet show with the same people pulling the same strings,'' changes in the system ''would include legislation.''Mr. Cameron, whose parliamentary majority depends on the fragile support of his Liberal Democrat coalition partners, faces something of a political tightrope walk if efforts to find a compromise in the dispute fall short. Both the opposition Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats are in favor of legislation to underpin a new system, and they have found a deep resonance in a British public that has been outraged by 18 months of revelations about the widespread phone hacking and other forms of alleged newsroom wrongdoing, including computer hacking, perjury and the bribery of police officers and other public officials.Without a deal with Labour and the Liberal Democrats, Mr. Cameron could find his Conservatives -- who are split over the need for a new law -- facing defeat in the House of Commons if the issue comes to a vote. Cross-party talks aimed at resolving the dispute have produced an agreement that both sides will draft a parliamentary bill that would give the force of law to a new regulatory system. But Labour and the Liberal Democrats say they are confident they can come up with a formula that does not threaten press freedom, while the Conservatives have said they are ready to draft a new bill solely to demonstrate that it would be unworkable.Moves for a new regulatory system are running parallel to a police investigation into the tabloid scandal. More than 90 people have been arrested and questioned, and a small but growing group of them have been charged with criminal offenses. One of them, Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's newspaper empire in Britain, resigned last year after investigators revealed that the Murdoch-owned News of the World tabloid had hacked the cellphone of a murdered 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler, while she was missing but not yet confirmed as dead. Another, Andy Coulson, also a former News of the World editor, went on to serve as Mr. Cameron's communications director until he, too, was forced to resign by the scandal. "
Another Editor Steps Down In News Corp. Shake-Up,"News Corporation's British newspaper unit, embroiled in the aftermath of a phone hacking scandal, lost another high-ranking executive on Wednesday when the editor of The Times of London announced he would step down. The executive, James Harding, considered by many a golden boy of British journalism, said he would depart his post at The Times amid pressure from News Corporation's senior leadership.He called the corporation's chief executive, Rupert Murdoch, early Wednesday to offer his resignation, the second in two weeks at News International, the British newspaper subsidiary of News Corporation. On Dec. 2, Tom Mockridge, chief executive of News International, announced his resignation.''It has been made clear to me that News Corporation would like to appoint a new editor of The Times,'' Mr. Harding told his staff. ''I have therefore agreed to stand down.''The same day that Mr. Harding said he would depart, regulatory filings showed that Rebekah Brooks, a former chief executive of News International, had received a $17.6 million severance package that included ''compensation for loss of office'' and ''various ongoing benefits.''Ms. Brooks, who had served as editor of the News of the World and Sun tabloids, both accused of widespread phone hacking, is expected to stand trial in September over accusations of illegal payments to public officials. She has also been charged with conspiracy to intercept voice mail messages and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. She has denied the accusations.The settlement agreement, reached during Ms. Brooks's departure in July 2011 at the height of the phone hacking scandal at The News of the World, stipulates that she would be required to return much of her compensation if she were found guilty.Mr. Harding took over as editor of The Times in 2007 at 38, making him one of the youngest to hold the job in the broadsheet's 227-year history. His counterpart at The Sunday Times, John Witherow, was widely expected to replace him. News International declined to comment.Mr. Murdoch bought The Times in 1981, adding prestige and influence to his stable of British tabloids. In October, the paper's weekday circulation was down 7.82 percent from the same month last year, to 403,770 readers, according to Britain's Audit Bureau of Circulations.Under Mr. Harding's leadership, The Times took a relatively critical stance against its parent company's handling of the hacking scandal, and speculation arose that the spirited coverage had led to his ouster.''In uniquely difficult circumstances I hope we have covered the story that has swirled around us with the integrity and independence that readers of The Times expect of us,'' Mr. Harding told his staff.In a statement, Mr. Murdoch said, ''James has been a distinguished editor for The Times'' and helped lead the paper ''through difficult times.''News Corporation is readying itself to split off its publishing assets into a separate publicly traded entity. The new company will be led by Robert Thomson, currently the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal and editor in chief of Dow Jones. "

Comcast Is Said to Be Mulling Bid for BSkyB,"5:05 p.m. | Updated Comcast is exploring whether the British Sky Broadcasting Group, Britain's largest satellite broadcaster and a lucrative pay TV asset 39 percent owned by News Corporation, could become available for purchase, according to several people briefed on the company's strategic thinking.Comcast's thinking about a possible deal is in the preliminary stages, and the company has not made a formal offer or even approached BSkyB or News Corporation about negotiations, said these people, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the company's strategy.Michael J. Angelakis, Comcast's vice chairman and chief financial officer, denied that the company had any interest in acquiring BSkyB.""This is complete rubbish,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""It is total speculation and inaccurate.""As News Corporation faces the fallout of the continuing phone-hacking scandal in Britain, its stake in BSkyB has come under question. A British regulatory panel is investigating whether Rupert Murdoch's media company is ""fit and proper"" to hold a broadcast license.Last summer, News Corporation withdrew its $12 billion bid for the remaining stake in BSkyB, amid scrutiny related to the phone hacking carried out at by its News of the World tabloid. Since then, the chances of News Corporation reviving that bid have diminished.These circumstances have prompted News Corporation to consider divesting its BSkyB stake at a premium and retreat from what once looked like a key part of the conglomerate's $50 billion portfolio, according to these people. News Corporation does not want to be forced to sell its BSkyB stake in a fire sale, if Ofcom, the British regulatory body reviewing the matter, were to deem the company unfit to hold the broadcast license, analysts have said.""There's a big difference between exiting a position like that on your own terms versus being forced to exit a big position in a forced-exit situation,"" Todd Juenger, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said in an interview last month.Others on Wall Street said it would be uncharacteristic of News Corporation to sell its BSkyB stake during the current scrutiny in Britain. ""On an emotional level, I find it hard to believe,"" said David Bank, a media analyst at RBC Capital Markets, adding, ""It would be a tacit admission that the British government is right.""Acquiring BSkyB would make strategic sense for several United States media companies - including Comcast, DirecTV and Liberty Media - that want to expand their footprints in the international pay-TV business.Another person close to Comcast, but not authorized to discuss potential deals publicly, cautioned that media bankers regularly pitch proposals.""With the current News Corporation situation everyone in the media business has been approached about BSkyB,"" this person said, adding that Comcast is ""focused on its current businesses"" and has not initiated any BSkyB discussions.Comcast, however, has been the company that is most actively approached by outside advisers about whether a BSkyB purchase would make sense, one of the people with knowledge of the BSkyB discussions said.News Corporation and BSkyB declined to comment.Comcast, a Philadelphia-based company, does not typically own minority stakes in foreign companies and if interested, would buy BSkyB outright, though these people cautioned that any exploration is extremely preliminary.With a market capitalization of over $80 billion, Comcast has not shied away from big-ticket, complicated mergers in the past. In early 2011, Comcast won approval in Washington to acquire a 51 percent stake in NBCUniversal for $13.8 billion in cash and assets. Having reached near saturation in cable subscriptions in the United States, Comcast, the country's largest cable operator and Internet service provider, has looked overseas for growth opportunities.In the quarter that ended March 31, Comcast had $2.21 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet and operating cash flow of $4.69 billion.For News Corporation, the sale of BSkyB would effectively end its reign as a major television force in Britain. At the same time, the multibillion-dollar sale would boost News Corporation's stock and cash flow and please investors who have called for it to divest its minority stakes in several overseas companies.Last Friday, fresh revelations about a favorable relationship between the British culture minister, Jeremy Hunt, and News Corporation lobbyists became public. Mr. Hunt said he had been ""sympathetic"" to News Corporation's bid to take over BSkyB. He was later tasked with overseeing the regulatory aspects of the deal.In April, one of Mr. Murdoch's sons, James Murdoch, resigned as chairman of BSkyB amid pressure related to his involvement in the phone hacking scandal at the company's British tabloids.News Corporation's equity earnings from its BSkyB stake were $262 million in the quarter that ended March 31. Last summer, BSkyB said it had a pretax profit for 2010 to 2011 of $1.7 billion, up 16 percent from the previous year.Mr. Juenger wrote in a May 18 report, using BSkyB's ticker symbol, BSY, ""We believe BSY stake is a poor use of capital and News Corp. should seek to exit - on their own terms and timing."" He added, ""While they won't admit it, we believe News Corp. was always likely to eventually decide to sell its stake in BSkyB if it cannot acquire full control.""BSkyB, meanwhile, has done its part to distance itself from News Corporation. ""I would emphasize that it's important to remember that Sky and News Corporation are separate companies,"" Jeremy Darroch, BSkyB's chief executive, told reporters last month.He added, ""We believe that Sky's track record as a broadcaster is the most important factor in determining our fitness to hold a license."" "
9/11 Relatives Who Suspect Hacking Await Answers,"Shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, relatives of some of the victims began suspecting that someone was eavesdropping on their telephones.Some heard mysterious clicking sounds on their home and mobile phones. The fiancee of one man who died at the World Trade Center remembers listening to snippets of someone else's conversation on her line. A husband of another victim recalls hearing somebody remotely accessing his home answering machine, which still held the final, reassuring message left by his wife shortly before the crash of Flight 93. Others say they are baffled as to how details about their loved ones appeared in British tabloids within days of the attacks.Ten years later, their long-held suspicions aroused by The News of the World phone-hacking scandal in London, dozens of relatives of victims contacted the Justice Department. On Aug. 24, eight of them met with Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and asked him to determine whether their privacy had been violated. As a first step, they asked him to see whether Scotland Yard had a record of their names or phone numbers among the material seized from a private investigator who hacked cellphone messages for the tabloid.Four months later, they are still waiting to hear back and are frustrated by the Justice Department's silence. ''It's not that hard to find out -- it's quite a simple thing, really, isn't it?'' said Patricia Bingley, a British citizen whose son, Kevin Dennis, a 43-year-old trader at Cantor Fitzgerald, worked on the 101st floor of the World Trade Center's north tower.Ms. Bingley said she was stunned to see, in the Sept. 18, 2001, issue of The Sun, a photograph of her son reading a bedtime story to his two sons, which she did not give to the paper. The story also contained details about her son that she said no one from her family had provided to The Sun. ''It never made sense to me,'' she said, adding that she suspects hacking or worse by the paper. ''I'd like very much for the government to tell us whether this happened or not. Celebrities seem to have no trouble finding out.''In July, as revelations about widespread phone hacking by the tabloid were spilling out, another British newspaper, The Daily Mirror, reported that a private investigator said that News of the World reporters had offered to pay him to retrieve phone records of Sept. 11 victims. After the report, which was not confirmed by other news organizations, the Justice Department opened an investigation. To date, no evidence has emerged publicly that Sept. 11 victims were hacking targets.Jodi Westbrook Flowers, a lawyer at a South Carolina firm that represents more than 6,700 relatives of Sept. 11 victims, said she and her colleagues had scoured the British tabloids and found scores of details about the victims. Relatives were not certain how the tabloids found out so much so quickly after the attacks.One of the relatives, whom she declined to identify, said that five days after Sept. 11, The Sun published the words from a voice mail message left on his cellphone by his son, who was aboard one of the planes that hit the World Trade Center. (British authorities are also investigating whether hacking occurred at The Sun, which, like The News of the World, is owned by News Corporation.)In late September, Ms. Flowers, of the Motley Rice law firm, sent Mr. Holder phone numbers of two dozen relatives of victims and asked that Scotland Yard run them through the 12,000 pages of documents seized from the home of Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator responsible for most of the hacking by the now-shuttered News of the World. She said at least 100 of her clients, in both the United States and Britain, now want similar information.On Nov. 3, Vida G. Bottom, chief of the Justice Department's public corruption unit, wrote to the lawyers, saying, ''The F.B.I. has undertaken a preliminary review to assess the veracity of those allegations.''Ms. Flowers said she was disappointed by the vagueness of the response. ''We asked a simple threshold question, and we basically received a nonanswer,'' she said.Ms. Flowers added, ''If there was no hacking, it is wildly coincidental that so many people describe similar experiences.''Even so, two Justice Department officials with knowledge of the inquiry said they did not expect much to come of the investigation. The officials, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss a continuing criminal inquiry, said the investigation remained open in case Scotland Yard discovered evidence confirming the suspicions of the Sept. 11 relatives. They both said they were doubtful such evidence would emerge.Tracy Schmaler, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said only, ''It's an ongoing investigation.''Norman Siegel, a lawyer for nearly two dozen victims' families who also attended the meeting with Mr. Holder, said, ''As far as I know, there is still serious interest in this investigation not only by the Department of Justice and the F.B.I. but by Attorney General Holder himself.'' He said he understands his clients' frustration, but remains optimistic they will ultimately believe their suspicions have been investigated ''in good faith.''A determination that the relatives of Sept. 11 victims were hacked would add a new, explosive twist to the scandal, particularly if they are in the United States. The confirmed cases of hacking -- which extend to celebrities, government officials and crime victims -- have all been confined to Britain.Many of the instances recounted by relatives of victims do not fit the pattern of the confirmed hacking cases, in which cellphone messages were illegally accessed in pursuit of tabloid stories. But even if they cannot point to subsequent tabloid stories, the relatives with memories of the odd occurrences after the attacks are eager for an answer from the Justice Department.Lorie Van Auken, whose husband, Kenneth Van Auken, died in the World Trade Center, said she noticed clicks on her home phone line for months after the attacks and overheard cross-talking voices. ''It is mystifying,'' she said of the Justice Department's silence. ''This is a peace of mind issue. We just want to know the truth.''In interviews, more than a half-dozen relatives of Sept. 11 victims reported having suspicions that someone had gained illegal access to their phones.Jack Grandcolas, whose wife, Lauren Grandcolas, was aboard Flight 93, which crashed in Shanksville, Pa., said that one night several months after her death, his home telephone rang and he listened as the answering machine played previously recorded messages, apparently through a password-enabled command. ''It was as if the phone had been accessed by someone,'' he said.Among the messages was the one his wife left from the plane saying: ''I'm totally fine. I just love you more than anything, just know that. And you know, I'm, you know, I'm comfortable and I'm O.K. -- for now. Just a little problem.''Years later, that message appeared on YouTube accompanied by a laugh track. Although Mr. Grandcolas said he allowed two documentary producers to use the message, his memory of the answering machine episode and clicking sounds he heard on his phone after the attacks made him wonder if he was a victim of hacking.Lucy Aita, whose fiance, Paul Innella, 33, of East Brunswick, N.J., died in the World Trade Center, said she also recalls clicking sounds on her telephone for months after the attacks.''Every time we picked up the phone, we heard a little clicking noise that was intermittent,'' she said. ''Then we started hearing voices of people, as if they were on a speaker phone. A few times we'd say, 'Can you stop listening to us, please?' Then all of the sudden, we'd hear a click and they would be gone.'' "
Latest Hacking Scandal Arrest Suggests Focus on Cover-Up,"LONDON -- Scotland Yard's arrest of a former personal assistant to Rebekah Brooks, a former chief executive of the British newspaper arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, appears to reflect the investigators' intensifying focus on the possibility of a cover-up by executives, editors and others of the extent of illegal phone hacking and other criminal wrongdoing at the The News of the World, which is now defunct.After 10 hours of questioning on Friday, detectives assigned to a special unit investigating the affair released the assistant, Cheryl Carter, 47, on police bail pending further questioning. She was arrested at dawn at her home in Billericay, 25 miles east of London. Efforts to reach her for comment on Saturday were not successful. Scotland Yard said she was the 17th person, most of them former employees of the The News of the World, to be arrested by officers assigned to Operation Weeting, established last year under special provisions intended to ensure the independence of the investigators.The creation of that task force followed several years of faltering inquiries by Scotland Yard that upheld, until a torrent of disclosures last year, denials by News International that more than two people on the News of the World's newsroom staff had been involved in the illegal interception of the cellphone voicemails of crime victims, politicians and celebrities.As the scandal grew last year, dominating headlines in Britain for months, the police inquiry, and hearings by a parliamentary committee, began to focus on allegations that executives, editors and others involved had conspired to cover up the extent of the wrongdoing, which Scotland Yard said last month had involved the hacking of the cellphones of at least 800 people.One of the executives who has been under pressure is James Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's son, who leads News Corporation's European and Asian operations, and has long been considered a candidate to succeed his father as head of the company. The police investigation and testimony before a parliamentary committee identified a 2009 meeting in London attended by James Murdoch as crucial to unraveling the issue of whether senior executives conspired in the cover-up.Under questioning at two sessions before the committee last year, James Murdoch denied having approved an out-of-court settlement of more than $1.4 million to buy the silence of a British soccer union executive who was suing News International and threatening to go public with documents pointing to a wider use of phone hacking than the company had then admitted. Two other senior Murdoch employees contested Mr. Murdoch's denial, saying that they had informed Mr. Murdoch of the extent of the phone hacking, and cited that as a reason for approving the settlement. One of the two, Colin Myler, the former editor of the The News of the World, was appointed editor last week of The Daily News in New York, a rival of the Murdoch-owned New York Post.Ms. Carter's arrest drew attention for several reasons, including a Scotland Yard statement that said that she had been questioned on suspicion of trying to pervert the course of justice, a line of inquiry that has not been specified in police statements on most of the other arrests in Operation Weeting.In addition, Ms. Carter appeared to have had a close personal and professional relationship with Ms. Brooks, the most senior executive in the Murdoch hierarchy to have been arrested in the affair. Former News of the World employees who spoke on condition of anonymity said Ms. Carter had worked as a personal assistant to Ms. Brooks for 19 years, starting when Ms. Brooks was deputy editor of The Sun, another Murdoch-owned tabloid in London, and continuing as Ms. Brooks became editor of the The News of the World, editor of The Sun, and later chief executive of News International, overseeing all of the Murdoch titles in Britain.Ms. Brooks's resignation in July followed closely the News Corporation's abrupt decision to close News of the World, Britain's highest-circulation Sunday newspaper, after 168 years of continuous publication.Ms. Carter, who was described by those who worked with her as Ms. Brooks's ''gatekeeper,'' with close knowledge of Ms. Brooks's schedule, e-mails and meetings, lost her job as personal assistant amid the storm of recriminations after the disclosure that one of those whose cellphones had been hacked was Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old girl who was abducted and murdered in an outer London suburb in 2002.News International's acknowledgment that the The News of the World had hacked into the teenager's phone at a time when there was still hope that she remained alive was a watershed in the scandal. Ms. Carter's departure from News International closely followed that of Ms. Brooks, but Ms. Carter continued to write a weekly beauty column for The Sun until that, too, was discontinued in December.One of the issues under investigation by Scotland Yard is whether any documents or e-mails pertinent to the inquiry were deleted or destroyed as part of a cover-up. Although News International has provided investigators with an archive of 300 million e-mails, the company has been accused of having deleted e-mails and of providing former employees with lavish payouts on the condition of their silence. It has also been accused of making selective leaks to other sections of the news media that Scotland Yard suggested constituted a ''deliberate campaign to undermine the investigation.''According to two former staff members who did not want to be named because they were discussing a topic that was the subject of an active police investigation, Ms. Carter was fiercely loyal to Ms. Brooks. A person who claimed to have been present on the day that Ms. Brooks cleared out her office at News International's headquarters, and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the two women were seen carrying items to a parked car. "
Murdoch's Trusted Outsider,"Last August, as News Corporation scrambled to contain a phone-hacking scandal at its British newspaper unit, Chase Carey, the company's president and chief operating officer, proposed an idea to his boss, Rupert Murdoch: buy back $5 billion worth of stock.Mr. Murdoch was skeptical, saying he would rather focus on getting through the crisis than on the stock price, according to people familiar with Mr. Murdoch's thinking who would not publicly discuss private conversations.Mr. Carey persisted. As of this month, News Corporation had repurchased $2.5 billion of Class A shares and had largely kept investors happy, despite the continuing scandal in Britain. In the first week of trading in 2012, News Corporation shares rose to a 52-week record, or 30 percent above the lows it hit in the weeks after public outcry over the hacking scandal began in July and higher than it had been before.The crisis in London has left Mr. Murdoch stretched thin and increasingly reliant on his No. 2, Mr. Carey, 58, who was once considered to be serving as a placeholder until one of the Murdoch children took over. Never in the $60 billion media company's history has an executive other than Mr. Murdoch taken such a major role in running the daily operations. ''Chase is one of those people with no fear,'' said Michael Ovitz, co-founder of the Creative Artists Agency. ''He'll say, 'This is what's good for you. And this is what's bad for you.' That's hard to do when you're dealing with a founder and patriarch.''Mr. Carey, who wears blazers with elbow patches and a Wyatt Earp-style handlebar mustache, leads earnings calls, speaks at investor conferences and strategizes on everything, including retransmission fees with cable and satellite companies. Unlike Mr. Murdoch and his son James, who continue to face scrutiny related to phone hacking and the accusation that nepotism sometimes overrides shareholder interests, Mr. Carey's outsider status makes him a steady and less polarizing figure, analysts said.''He's increasingly becoming the face of the company,'' said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG.In August, Mr. Murdoch, 80, told analysts that Mr. Carey would take over as chief executive in an emergency. ''Chase is my partner, and if anything happened to me, I'm sure he'll get it immediately,'' he said.The question of succession at News Corporation is a delicate one. Most senior executives declined to comment on the record about Mr. Carey, expressing concern that any positive observations might appear as a slight to James Murdoch. Mr. Carey declined to comment.Interviews with more than a dozen current and former associates reveal that Mr. Carey is in many ways Mr. Murdoch's alter ego. He is aloof while Mr. Murdoch is engaged with the public (most recently on Twitter, where Mr. Murdoch has criticized opponents of antipiracy legislation); he is all-American while Mr. Murdoch is worldly (Mr. Carey once dragged a colleague to a sports bar while on business in Hong Kong); and he is apolitical while Mr. Murdoch is conservative.''Every visionary has 40 bad ideas and three good ones, and you need those checks and balances,'' said Greg Nathanson, the former president of the Fox Television Stations. ''Murdoch's visions were amazing, but he couldn't execute them without a person like Chase.''Mr. Carey, a New York native, college rugby player and die-hard Yankees and Giants fan, first joined News Corporation in 1988 after working in the home entertainment and finance divisions of Columbia Pictures. His mustache hides a scar from an injury from a car accident on the way to a football game at Colgate University, where he was active in the Delta Upsilon fraternity. The driver died, and Mr. Carey went through the windshield.As the fledgling Fox network's chief operating officer, Mr. Carey quickly became Mr. Murdoch's preferred negotiator.In 1993, Mr. Murdoch bet Mr. Carey $20 that the network known for ''The Simpsons'' and ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' could not capture the National Football League's primary television rights from venerable CBS. The league had twice rejected Fox's offers, and CBS had been known for football for 38 years.Mr. Carey put together a $1.56 billion deal that beat out CBS and put Fox on the map. Mr. Murdoch paid up on his $20 bet.''That was a game changer for the next two decades,'' said Paul Tagliabue, who served as the N.F.L. commissioner during the negotiation. Of Mr. Carey's negotiating tactics, Mr. Tagliabue said: ''He didn't shout. There were no histrionics. He was almost deceptively calm.''From 1996 to 2002, he served as co-chief operating officer with Peter Chernin, a showman heavily involved in the company's creative units. Mr. Carey has little interest in the glamorous Hollywood business. In 2002, Mr. Carey unexpectedly resigned, saying he did not see a role for himself in the company after its failed bid to take over DirecTV. The following year, Mr. Murdoch succeeded in a $6.6 billion deal for DirecTV, and Mr. Carey returned to lead the satellite-television broadcaster, which now is no longer part of News Corporation.In the years he was based in Los Angeles, Mr. Carey lived in Manhattan Beach and frequented the San Francisco Saloon, a bar known for its buffalo wings and sawdust-covered floors. Under his leadership, DirecTV expanded its United States subscriber base to more than 18 million, from 12 million.''It was pretty cut and dry with Chase,'' said Derek Chang, executive vice president for content strategy and development at DirecTV, where Mr. Carey served as president and chief executive from 2003 to 2009. Mr. Chang added: ''He didn't micromanage. You got in, you did your job, or you didn't have a job.''Mr. Murdoch lured Mr. Carey back to News Corporation in 2009. Last fiscal year, Mr. Carey earned $30.2 million, a 16 percent increase from the previous year, making him the company's second-highest-paid executive after Mr. Murdoch, whose compensation totaled $33.3 million.In a company known for its outsize personalities, Mr. Carey has no interest in the spotlight. (He seldom interferes with the Fox News chairman, Roger Ailes, according to people familiar with the company.) He regularly orders a hamburger and fries during power lunches in News Corporation's third-floor executive dining room and rides a packed commuter train home to the Connecticut suburbs, often popping a can of Budweiser on the way, despite having ''the highest car allowance available to a senior executive,'' according to a 2009 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Colleagues describe him as all-business with little interest in making small talk, unless it is sports related. Several longtime associates said they knew about Mr. Carey's wife and his son and daughter only because of an annual Christmas card.''We talked about the Murdoch kids more than we talked about our own kids,'' said one former News Corporation executive who worked closely with Mr. Carey.Mr. Carey, like the Murdoch children, does not share his boss's affection for the newspaper business, according to colleagues. He would rather the company, which owns The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and other papers, home in on more lucrative and less distracting pursuits. ''He hates politics. He thinks News Corp. should be a sports and entertainment business,'' said one executive from Britain not authorized to discuss Mr. Carey on the record.Mr. Carey is now using his negotiating tactics to again alter the economics of television. He has pressured satellite and cable providers to pay higher retransmission fees, which have become among the largest drivers of growth at News Corporation and some other media companies.''This whole retransmission battle is a big, big, big deal, and he's the most pivotal figure in it,'' said Staley Cates, president and chief investment officer of the Memphis-based Southeastern Asset Management, which holds roughly 52.5 million nonvoting shares in News Corporation.But some media bankers said Mr. Carey was picking the low-hanging fruit. They would like him to put more effort into developing new businesses in addition to exploiting existing ones. A little talked-about result of the phone-hacking scandal, they said, is that the younger visionary figures in the company, namely James and his sister Elisabeth Murdoch, have been at least temporarily marginalized.''He doesn't have a huge ego that has to dominate every minute of every day,'' said Mitchell Stern, former chairman and chief executive of Fox Television Stations and Twentieth Television. ''Where he was lacking, which I think he'd admit, would be in the creative content.''In March, the company said James Murdoch would move to New York from London and become deputy chief operating officer, reporting to Mr. Carey. In recent weeks, British lawmakers have uncovered new documents that further threaten the reputation of James Murdoch, who oversaw British operations when the hacking took place. That leaves Mr. Carey as the company's most stable senior executive untainted by the British tumult.''He's completely disconnected from the whole saga. He's running the business,'' the media tycoon and investor Haim Saban said of Mr. Carey. At a tumultuous time, ''he's the Rock of Gibraltar,'' Mr. Saban added.Despite Mr. Carey's more public role, News Corporation is still very much a family business. ''He's influencing the day-to-day decisions in the company more than anyone ever has other than Rupert,'' said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Nomura Securities.

5 Are Arrested in British Tabloid Scandal,"LONDON -- A Scotland Yard team investigating the bribery of police officers by journalists searched the offices of Rupert Murdoch's flagship British tabloid, The Sun, on Saturday after arresting a police officer and four men identified as current or former journalists at the paper. A police statement said searches were also being conducted at the homes of the arrested men. The arrests appeared to be an intensification of the police investigation into the role of The Sun, Britain's highest circulation daily newspaper, in the illegal news-gathering techniques that prompted Mr. Murdoch, 80, last summer to close The Sun's sister newspaper, the weekend News of the World.Police investigations of wrongdoing at The News of the World, involving the illegal hacking of cellphone voice mail messages and the bribery of police officers for leaking confidential information, have led to the arrest of more than a dozen reporters, editors, executives and others who worked for that paper.A statement issued by Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation in New York said the arrests on Saturday resulted from information provided to the police by the company's Management and Standards Committee, which was charged by Mr. Murdoch last year with rooting out what the company called ''unacceptable news gathering practices by individuals'' at the newspapers of the company's British subsidiary, News International.The company's cooperation with the police investigation was part of its commitment, the statement said, ''to undertake a review of all News International titles, regardless of cost, and to proactively cooperate with law enforcement and other authorities if potentially relevant information arose at those titles.''That review has run parallel to the company's efforts to reach out-of-court settlements with politicians, celebrities and others who have been identified by the police as among at least 800 victims of illegal voice mail hacking. This month, Murdoch executives reached court-approved settlements amounting to nearly $1 million with 37 phone hacking victims, including Jude Law, the actor; Ashley Cole, the soccer star; and John Prescott, a former deputy prime minister.The police said that three of the men arrested Saturday were taken from their homes in London and neighboring areas of Essex County for questioning on suspicion of conspiracy in actions involving ''aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office,'' the criminal offense commonly applied to cases of bribery of public officials. The fourth man was arrested when he appeared at an East London police station, the police statement said.The police officer involved, a 29-year-old man serving in the territorial policing command of the Metropolitan Police, the formal name for Scotland Yard, was arrested while at work at a central London police station. He was the second serving officer to be arrested as part of the investigation, known as Operation Elveden, following the arrest last month of a 52-year-old female officer. In all of the arrests, the suspects were released on bail.Scotland Yard and News Corporation did not identify the Sun journalists who were arrested on Saturday. But the BBC's Web site said they were Graham Dudman, a former managing editor; Fergus Shanahan, a former deputy editor; Mike Sullivan, the paper's crime editor; and Chris Pharo, the paper's head of news. The arrests of the men brought to 13 the number of those arrested in the investigation into the bribery of police officers. "
Israel Says Iran Is Behind Bombs,"JERUSALEM -- Tensions between Israel and Iran rose sharply on Monday when bombers struck at Israeli Embassy personnel in the capitals of India and Georgia. Israel accused the Tehran government of being behind the attacks, which Iran denied.The wife of an Israeli defense envoy to New Delhi was hurt along with several other people when her car was destroyed by an explosive device placed on it by a motorcyclist at a red light. In Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, a similar device was discovered on the car of a local staff member of the Israeli Embassy, but was defused by the police.Both resembled attacks that have killed five of Iran's nuclear scientists in recent years, most recently last month. Iran has attributed the assassinations to Israeli agents and has vowed to take revenge. The scientists' assassinations -- along with sabotage of Iran's nuclear program through cyberwarfare and faulty parts -- are aimed at delaying what the West believes is Iran's drive to build a nuclear weapon. If actually carried out by Iran, the attacks would be another indication that the leadership in Tehran was willing to reach beyond its borders against its enemies and expand its attacks to civilians. The United States has charged that Iran was behind a plot to assassinate a Saudi ambassador on American soil, and Israel has said that Iran has planned to attack its citizens in various countries, but that those plots were stopped.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu contended that Monday's attacks fit that pattern.''In recent months, we have witnessed several attempts to attack Israeli citizens and Jews in several countries, including Azerbaijan, Thailand and others,'' he said. ''In each instance, we succeeded in foiling the attacks in cooperation with local authorities. Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah, were behind all of these attempted attacks.''Iran's Foreign Ministry rejected Israel's accusations on Monday. A spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said, ''Israel has bombed its embassies in New Delhi and Tbilisi to tarnish Iran's friendly ties with the host countries,'' adding, ''Israel perpetrated the terrorist actions to launch psychological warfare against Iran.''Iran has defended its nuclear program as peaceful and has defiantly pursued uranium enrichment through years of international pressure and sanctions. Israel's increasingly urgent warnings on the need to halt Iran's nuclear progress, before it gets much closer to being able to build a bomb, have prompted concerns that Israel might unilaterally mount a military strike -- and have added to the implacable enmity between the two.Iran's oil and banking industries are suffering from sanctions implemented by the United States and Europe to pressure the country to back off its nuclear program. Iranian leaders have vowed to fight back through shutting the vital Strait of Hormuz and through military strikes on countries that are used as launching pads for attacks on it.Gen. Masoud Jazayeri, a spokesman for Iran's Joint Armed Forces Staff, said recently that ''the enemies of the Iranian nation, especially the United States, Britain and the Zionist regime, have to be held responsible for their activities.''Iranian leaders have called Israel a tumor that must be removed, and Iran arms and finances Hezbollah and Hamas, which are founded on the principle that Israel has no right to exist.On Monday, Israeli officials said there was enough evidence from the scenes in Georgia and India to say that the bombs were the work of Iranian agents.''Iran's fingerprints are all over this,'' one official said after emerging from high-level meetings in Jerusalem, speaking on the condition of anonymity.Some American Jewish leaders have expressed concern that synagogues and American Jewish centers could be targets in the increased tensions. In 1994, a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires was bombed, killing 85 people. The authorities there have accused Iranian diplomats of being behind that attack.Hezbollah, the Lebanese Islamist group with close ties to Iran, has promised to take revenge for the killing of its top commander, Imad Mugniyah, four years ago this week. Mr. Mugniyah had been sought by the United States in terrorist attacks that killed hundreds of Americans in the 1980s.Israel held him responsible for Hezbollah military operations in southern Lebanon from the mid-1990s. Israel is widely thought to have killed him with a powerful bomb in Damascus, the Syrian capital.Israeli analysts said the attacks on Monday were insignificant enough that the Israeli government would not feel driven to counterattack.''Clearly Israel is not going to attack Iran over this,'' Yoram Schweitzer, director of a terrorism project at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, said by telephone. ''The effect of this specific attack does not necessitate a harsh Israeli response other than condemnation.''Michael Herzog, a retired brigadier general who is an international fellow in Israel with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, agreed. ''There is no need to respond,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''What is at stake in Israel's calculations about Iran is much bigger than this.''The attack in New Delhi took place less than a mile from the residence of the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh.In a news conference Monday night, Delhi's police commissioner, B. K. Gupta, said a witness ''saw a person on a motorcycle sticking some kind of device on the back of the car.'' As the motorcycle moved away, ''a mild blast took place in the back of the car,'' he said.The injured woman was Tal Yehoshua Koren, who is married to an Israeli defense official at the embassy and also works there. She was on her way to pick up her children at the American Embassy school. The car's driver, Manoj Sharma, was also wounded. Two occupants of a nearby car were also hurt.Ms. Yehoshua Koren underwent spinal surgery, according to Dr. Deep Makkar of Primus Super Specialty Hospital, in New Delhi's diplomatic enclave.Shrapnel ''penetrated her spine and her liver,'' Dr. Makkar said, adding that she could face neurological injuries. The other three victims were admitted to a nearby hospital with minor injuries.''India very strongly condemns such an unfortunate incident,'' said S. M. Krishna, India's minister of external affairs, who also called Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli foreign minister. ''It will be fully investigated and the culprit will be brought to justice.''India has resisted American and European pressure to curtail trade with Iran because it relies heavily on Iranian oil.Israeli diplomats have been on high alert since Pakistan-based militants attacked in the city of Mumbai in 2008, killing more than 160 people, including 6 people in a Chabad Jewish community center.

"Information for Us, or for the Enemy?","Re ''National Secrets and National Security'' (June 17):As a teacher, I strongly support The New York Times's articles on the United States' drone-strike assassinations and cyberwarfare program. Questions about the prudence of publishing these two articles on policies related to our national security have been blown out of proportion.Americans who follow the news know that the United States is deeply involved in cyberwarfare in Iran and in the use of drones in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. What was important about these articles was that they provided information about our president's oversight and involvement in these matters. The articles moved these relatively new and hidden defensive strategies from the realm of hint and innuendo into the actual world of continuing, structured and intentional activity to confront those who threaten violent action against us. How else are we to have an informed electorate if our news sources are kept from providing truthful information about what our elected and appointed officials are doing to protect our national security? Such information, rather than revealing secrets, shows that inherently difficult and complex decisions are made under conditions subject to high-level scrutiny, debate and responsibility.KATHLEEN SLOBIN San FranciscoWhile the Times articles initially sparked a discussion about strategic policy, I am greatly disappointed that that conversation has not taken greater hold. The announcement of an investigation into the ''leaks'' (I hardly see how they can be called leaks since just about everyone already knew about them) seems to have quieted this more important discussion.We seem to accept the fallacy that because of the understandable need for some secret tactics in a conflict, the strategic policy and decisions that lead to and maintain that conflict should remain secret as well. I would welcome an effort by any responsible news outlet to pursue an examination of our strategic policies in regard to these (are there others?) nominally secret wars and to put our leaders -- executive and Congressional -- on the record as to their understanding and support, or lack thereof, of these policies.ROBERT J. TROY Charlottesville, Va.The comments from personnel at The Times about recent national security leaks and publication thereof were predictable and tiresome. It is nice that Times editors have two internal memos to guide them, but it would be naive to think those are objective standards.Moreover, Jill Abramson's comment that ''No story about details of government secrets has come near to demonstrably hurting the national security in decades and decades'' is both arrogant and nonauthoritative. Does Ms. Abramson know for certain that the recent story about our cyberwarfare efforts has not compromised national security? When Democrats like Dianne Feinstein and John Kerry are upset, there is cause to think otherwise.As a member of the great unwashed public that The Times is always educating with these disclosures, I for one do not think it has helped me one bit to know the ''dimensions and some of the details'' of ''a kind of warfare being waged'' in our name against the potential nuclear weaponizing of Iran. I have to make the assumption that these disclosures have most likely helped the mullahs in Iran more than they have helped our public.The Times's well-known position is that attacking Iran militarily is not an option and will create even more danger. When the paper enables our enemies to gain insight into our country's methods of contesting their quest for nuclear weapons, it makes it more likely that some form of military confrontation will become inevitable.DAVID P. LEVIN Hartsdale, N.Y.I suspect a very large majority of our population sees nothing wrong with cyberattacks. No civilians die, and the cost of running such a program is probably going to be less than building one drone.Reporting any details of our secret military operations is giving our enemies a heads-up warning. I'm quite sure that the next billion dollars they spend will be related to stopping cyberattacks (instead of putting another layer of concrete on top of a nuclear facility). Obviously they thought they were safe, and just as obviously they weren't. But why point that out -- and with details no less?PHILIP BARNETT Scottsdale, Ariz.Sizing Up FacebookRe ''Wall Street and the Average Reader (June 3):It strikes me, as someone on the sidelines of the Facebook I.P.O. mess, that The Times should focus more on the individual investor rather than the Wall Streeter. The professional has many sources of information as well as Street rumors, while the individual's only source is what his media may tell him or her in Flyover Country.Yes, the pros read The Times, but I'd bet a lot that they don't rely on it for their investment decisions.CHARLIE BROWN Hendersonville, N.C.I disagree entirely with the opinion expressed in this column. I like to think that I am a general reader of The New York Times. I certainly am not a specialist in investing. And all of the articles that The New York Times wrote before the Facebook I.P.O. convinced me that an investment in Facebook would be throwing money down the rabbit hole.So please don't castigate the business writers. Please don't dumb down the information.PRISCILLA KAWAKAMI Salt Lake CityMr. Brisbane's hindsight is 20-20. This analysis is easy to write after the fact. I doubt that many would have been dissuaded from rushing to buy Facebook stock had they been more aware of the red flags.The scandal is the Wall Street firms that had cold feet and shared their misgivings with their best clients, allowing them to avoid a haircut. Maybe Mr. Brisbane will write about that.DENNIS LaRUE Poland, OhioE-mail: public@nytimes.com "
Obama's Counterterrorism Actions Complicate Republican Strategy,"The revelation that President Obama has been personally and secretly directing a covert cyberwar against Iran could have political implications as the president enters the final stretch of his re-election campaign against Mitt Romney this year.The report in The New York Times is the latest evidence that Mr. Obama has embraced the use of his predecessor's national security and anti-terrorism machinery, decisions that some of his liberal supporters have viewed as a misguided and hawkish approach to foreign policy.But the news also complicates the political strategy for Republicans, including Mr. Romney, who are trying to build a case against Mr. Obama as a feckless, indecisive foreign policy leader, citing in particular the humanitarian crises in Libya and Syria.That case may be more difficult to make against a president who has once again pushed the envelope for waging covert operations abroad. In in this instance, the target was Iran, a country against which Republicans have been urging the administration to take stronger and more decisive action. Last year, Mr. Romney accused Mr. Obama of being ""weak and timid"" with Iran for not reacting more strongly when a United States drone crashed in that country.Ironically, the news of Mr. Obama's cyber war against Iran comes a day after the president stood shoulder to shoulder with George W. Bush in the White House as the official portrait of Mr. Bush, the 43rd president, was unveiled. Mr. Obama praised Mr. Bush and joked that he ""left me a really good TV sports package"" in the White House. It turns out, Mr. Bush also left behind a secret computer virus that Mr. Obama used to try and cripple Iran's nuclear program.The Times report portrays Mr. Obama as personally engaged in the decision to use the virus, which was eventually called Stuxnet, to slow Iran's progress and destroy its nuclear enrichment equipment. The virus was developed during Mr. Bush's time in office, but its use continued and expanded under Mr. Obama.""From his first months in office, President Obama secretly ordered increasingly sophisticated attacks on the computer systems that run Iran's main nuclear enrichment facilities, significantly expanding America's first sustained use of cyberweapons, according to participants in the program,"" the article, by David Sanger, says.It was the second Times story in a week to provide a behind-the-scenes look at the president's direct involvement in covert decisions abroad. A story on Tuesday by Jo Becker and Scott Shane described Mr. Obama's role in deciding what terrorists to put on a ""kill list.""The ""kill list"" story prompted predictable outrage from some of Mr. Obama's staunchest supporters, who have long complained that anti-war rhetoric he expressed during the 2008 campaign has given way to a hawkish policy in the White House.""He has put a prettier and more palatable face on extremely ugly policies,"" Glenn Greenwald, of Salon Magazine, wrote this week. ""Many Obama fans claimed during the 2008 election that his background as a constitutional lawyer would ensure reversal of the most extremist Bush/Cheney policies, but he has instead used that background for the opposite goal.""Liberals have not always been unhappy with the president. In his first days in office, Mr. Obama banned interrogation techniques that his supporters deemed tantamount to torture and he ordered the closure of the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, within a year, although he failed to follow through in the face of Congressional opposition. Later in his presidency, he followed through on a promise to end the war in Iraq by the conclusion of 2011. Both moves earned him praise from his base.But his decision to increase the number of troops in Afghanistan by 30,000 was viewed by some liberals as a betrayal, even though Mr. Obama had said during the 2008 campaign that the war in that country was the right one to be fighting.And his willingness to dramatically increase the use of drones for targeted assassinations of terrorist figures has strained his credibility among those who view such tactics as the work of the neoconservative hawks who surrounded Mr. Bush in the White House.Even the killing of Osama bin Laden, which was widely supported by members of both political parties, made some progressives queasy because of its implications for defining the executive powers of the presidency to order an assassination.But the same actions by Mr. Obama that anger liberals could also help insulate him from the ""weak on defense"" political attacks that Republicans have historically leveled against Democrats.Mr. Romney and his fellow Republicans have accused the president of not being aggressive enough with Iran, Syria and other adversaries. They have said he should have done more to support an uprising in Iran two years ago. And they accuse Mr. Obama of not doing enough in Syria.""President Obama's lack of leadership has resulted in a policy of paralysis that has watched Assad slaughter 10,000 individuals,"" Mr. Romney said this week, calling for the United States and its allies to provide weapons to the Syrian opposition forces.Mr. Obama's campaign has already begun to use the killing of Osama bin Laden as a political tool, questioning in an ad about the president's leadership whether Mr. Romney would have made the decision to authorize the raid in Pakistan during which Bin Laden was killed.Similarly, the president's allies could use the stories from this week - Mr. Obama's role in assembling a terrorist ""kill list"" and his involvement in authorizing cyber warfare - to challenge the idea that his foreign policy is characterized by paralysis.The campaign between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney is likely to remain primarily about the economy and how to fix it. But foreign policy and national security issues will help shape how both men are perceived as leaders.And events in the world  - including in Iran and Syria - could heighten voter interest in how both men will use the country's national security apparatus.

Fear and Loathing at Murdoch's Sun,"LONDON - The news coming out of a British outpost of Rupert Murdoch's international media empire seems to go from bad to worse. This week, two senior journalists at his top-selling Sun newspaper apparently attempted suicide amid the mounting pressures of a police investigation.Mr. Murdoch's News International, the British newspaper unit of Mr. Murdoch's News Corp., has made no statement but colleagues who spoke to Rendezvous linked the suicide attempts to the situation at The Sun. British media reports have not named the two people, a man and a woman whose identities are known to Rendezvous. Both are now in medical care at their employer's expense.The Sun is the focus of a widening investigation into phone-hacking and other corrupt practices that has spurred demands for tighter supervision of media practices and ownership.Eleven current and former members of the newspaper's staff have been arrested in recent months on suspicion of bribing police and other officials, although none has been charged.This year's arrests came after News Corp, the British unit's U.S.-based parent company, handed police information, including millions of e-mails, to identify wrongdoing. News Corp set up a Management and Standards Committee to help police inquiries and to liaise with courts.Sun employees, many hired after the phone-hacking offenses, said they feel that they have been thrown to the wolves by their employer.They also claim that the police, themselves under pressure after revelations of their cozy relationships journalists from the popular press, have been excessively zealous in their pursuit of suspects.Last month, five people were arrested in what the Sun itself described as part of the biggest police operation in British criminal history. Colleagues quoted one suspect as saying he was held incommunicado for six hours after an early morning raid while police ripped up floorboards in search of incriminating material.After last month's arrests, Trevor Kavanagh, the Sun's associate editor, wrote that the newspaper's staff were being treated like ""members of an organized crime gang.""Mr. Murdoch flew to London in February to quell a near-mutiny at News International's headquarters in east London. He announced the launch of a Sunday edition of the Sun to replace the News of the World, which he closed in the wake of phone-hacking revelations. Its first edition sold more than three million copies.He lifted the suspension of 10 journalists who had been arrested, saying. ""Everyone is innocent unless proven otherwise."" But he said the Management and Standards Committee would continue to hand over evidence to police.Mr. Murdoch's morale-boosting visit was supposed to have done the trick. However, staff say the apparent suicide attempts prove fear and loathing still stalk the media mogul's British HQ. "
